    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Section 523 (a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code creates an exception to discharge for individual bankruptcies applicable to, quote, debts for money, property, services, or extensions of credit to the extent obtained by fraud. 
    The required fraud under that section includes not only representations that are consciously false, but also reckless false statements, and the issue in this case is whether this exception reaches beyond the amounts actually obtained by the debtor to except from discharge a treble damage award ordered for reckless fraud. 
    Where the fraud involves intentional falsehoods and results in wilful and malicious injury, the damages, punitive and otherwise, are nondischargeable under a different section, 523 (a)(6).

    We do.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    We would Your Honor and, in fact, we think that's quite clear from the language, that the structure of the 523 sections as they work, given the literal reading of 523 (a)(2), works quite well. 
    523 (a)(2) is a provision which, by its terms, is directed to the actual fruits of the fraud. 
    It's a simple, clear directive that tells people, if they commit fraud, what they get by the fraud will not be discharged.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Well, it... I think the most reasonable interpretation is to focus upon the amounts obtained by the act of the fraud, which I would think most immediately would be the amounts obtained in the fraud. 
    What is very--

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --I think it would not, Your Honor. 
    I think that the other provisions, the (a)(6) provision in particular, which this Court will address tomorrow in the Geiger case, is a provision which is generally applicable, essentially, among other things, to all torts, and it sets a standard which says wilful and... a debt for wilful and malicious injury. 
    That has been interpreted reasonably, we think, to include punitive damages, to include other penalty sums, to include consequential damages, to include contractually arranged for attorney's fees, and is a reasonable and uniform way of dealing with what I'll call damages and consequential payments that are owed. 
    Our--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="176.183" stopTime="204.022">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Correct. 
    Now, one interesting result of our interpretation, and it actually is played out in some detail in a decision cited in the Solicitor General's brief, a Tenth Circuit case, In re Gerlach, is that actually the amount awarded under (a)(2), when you focus on the act of fraud and what is obtained, may actually exceed, in some cases, the damages that are otherwise owing, and in that sense it seems it is a very rational and sensible message to people who may commit fraud.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="204.022" stopTime="204.159">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Say that again.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="204.159" stopTime="267.602">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, in the context... specifically, the context in Gerlach was a context where the operator of a business selling heavy equipment, selling John Deere tractors, initially got an extension of credit from John Deere, legitimately, but later on they got an extension of that credit by submitting false invoices to show they were doing business that they weren't doing. 
    The Court in Gerlach said that the later extensions of credit involved the obtaining of money by fraud, and as a result the entire amount of the debt that was owed was, in fact, covered by (a)(2), even though there might in that case be no damages at all, so I... the only point I want to make is that our point is that in (a)(2) you're dealing with what was obtained. 
    The other sections under the code, (a)(6) but also others, also (a)(4), also (a)(11), other... others deal with money that is gained by fraud, and they set up a different logic. 
    The logic is, what did you... what the debt is for, the injury, and the injury is interpreted broadly, and--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="267.602" stopTime="276.768">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    How does Gerlach work? 
    In other words, the Bankruptcy Code supersedes State tort law on the measure of recovery for fraud, in the John Deere case that you're describing.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="276.768" stopTime="287.064">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --I think the net result is that... is that it... to whatever extent there is a debt it would be nondischargeable under (a)(2) if it is--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="287.064" stopTime="288.356">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Ah, to the extent there is a debt.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="288.356" stopTime="392.084">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Well, there has to be a debt, obviously, but it may, in fact, be a debt that is larger than the amount that is damages as a result of the fraud. 
    I guess that's the point that I want to make. 
    Back briefly to the facts of this case, which I think are important. 
    The respondents here are some of the tenants of an 18-unit apartment building that was owned by the petitioner and his father between 1985 and 1989. 
    When their apartment rental business failed in the late eighties as a result of falling real estate values, petitioner filed bankruptcy under Chapter 7. 
    Thereafter, the rent control administrator entered an order to the effect that there had been an overcharge of these tenants which amounted to $31,000 and the bankruptcy court held that the overcharge was nondischargeable under the (a)(2) provision. 
    The court found further that actual fraud existed in that case on the ground that the act of charging rents was itself an implicit representation of their legality and, second, that petitioner's recklessness in failing to determine what the correct rents were was sufficient to establish an intent to deceive and, finally, the bankruptcy court held that because the overcharges amounted to fraud, treble damages were appropriate under the New Jersey consumer fraud statute and then found that that amount, indeed, also was nondischargeable. 
    Our view is, as is apparent already, I guess, that that result is wrong. 
    It's wrong essentially for three reasons: 1) the plain language of the statute, which talks about debts for money, property, services, extensions of credit to the extent obtained by fraud clearly doesn't include the amounts that are punitive in nature--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="392.084" stopTime="401.919">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I don't know that it's all that clear from the language. 
    What does debt for mean? 
    Does it mean liability on a claim for?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="401.919" stopTime="408.183">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --It does, Your Honor. 
    That's... it is defined as liability on a claim for money, property, services, et cetera.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="408.183" stopTime="411.907">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you rely on the phrase, to the extent?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="411.907" stopTime="446.648">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    We do. 
    We think that... there's been a discussion back and forth in this case about whether to the extent modifies money, property, services, or whether it modifies debt. 
    I think everyone agrees... in this case, at least, agrees that it modifies money, property, services. 
    Our difference, I think, is that... how we understand the word for. 
    In the petitioner's view, a debt for a house, or a debt for any particular thing, is a debt for what you have to pay for that thing. 
    It's not a debt for the act of obtaining that thing. 
    It's a debt for the thing.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --That they were nondischarge... I think--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="474.587" stopTime="474.788">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Right.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="474.788" stopTime="617.379">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --I think not, Your Honor. 
    I think that the interpret... the language prior to 1984 was language that said, debt for obtaining money, property, et cetera, by fraud. 
    Now, we think that's ambiguous language. 
    There are a couple of cases, literally only a couple, that held necessarily that that language does, in fact, reach punitive amounts, and we don't think that it is illogical to reach that result, but what is important is that prior to 1984 and prior to 1978 even more so, there was... there were not occasions that came up that made courts decide this issue. 
    The main reason is that with the presence of the (a)(6) language that talks about debts for wilful and malicious injury, with that language being there, any time conduct results in wilful and malicious injury, it doesn't matter what (a)(2) means, or what is now (a)(2) means. 
    It doesn't matter what it means to have a debt for obtaining, and so courts in deciding these cases, as we talk in some detail about in footnotes 13 and 14 of our reply brief, of the yellow brief, the courts typically didn't focus specifically on the meaning of that prior language. 
    They didn't have a reason to, and so it isn't possible to say here, as the Court has said in a number of cases, there was an important pre-1978, or pre-1984 bankruptcy practice that had been established. 
    Indeed, there was no clear practice that had been established. 
    It is not our mission here to tell you that the meaning of those words, if it mattered what the pre-'78 words meant and you didn't have (a)(6) and you had to decide, might a court decide that they in fact meant to include punitive damages. 
    Maybe they did. 
    It isn't clear. 
    I would only say that, when reviewing... what you review Justice Breyer for the Court's opinion in the O'Gilvie case, which talks about, under the different statute, under the IRS statute, whether damages on account of personal injury, whether those include punitive damages, and the Court ruled that they did not, if that is an admissible result, it seems to me it's certainly admissible to conclude... one could conclude that... that a debt for obtaining money by fraud doesn't include it. 
    Our only point is that it was ambiguous. 
    It never got clearly resolved by the courts but in a single case that we're aware of, a Ninth Circuit case called Houtman.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    It is still applicable, Your Honor, and I think that it is true that this case and this Court's decision in this case is only going to be determinative in the group of cases... and I debated whether to characterize it as the sliver of cases or a larger group of cases, but the group of cases that involves conduct that is fraudulent, meaning it's at least reckless, but it falls short of being wilful and malicious.

speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="742.364" stopTime="784.110">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Correct, and secondly... I mean, our best reading of the cases is that wilful and malicious requires a measure of intentionality and knowing conduct vis a vis the harm that results. 
    Now, we could be wrong about that. 
    It's not an issue that has been raised in this case because thus far no one has suggested that the conduct here was wilful and malicious, and I guess I would submit that that's highly unlikely, given the fact that we're dealing with implicit representations based simply on the fact that he charged a certain rent, and recklessness in failing to ascertain what they thought the legal rent was. 
    I would think that would be hard to find wilful and malicious, but I will not attempt to define, you know, the case, the outcome of the case tomorrow.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I think you may have the better view in a close question on the reading of (a)(2), but I'm concerned about the lack of parallelism with (4) and (6), which is what we've been addressing... addressing here. 
    If you prevail, there are going to be cases that might be classified under this section or section... the section on malicious conduct, and then we'd have to decide whether it falls under this... the--
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="814.551" stopTime="938.793">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, I mean, our understanding of the statute as it now reads is that there are several provisions that make nondischargeable various damages. 
    We would submit that the (a)(2) provision is essentially not a damages... it doesn't deal with damages. 
    It deals with the specific act of obtaining something by fraud and it says, no, you're going to be stuck with that if you got it by fraud. 
    The other provisions, the (a)(4) provision relates to fraud by a fiduciary, among other things. 
    The (a)(11) provision is a special provision enacted with regard to fraud in the context of federally insured institutions and (a)(6), dealing with wilful and malicious, as the Court suggested in footnote 2 of the Grogan decision, that might be, the Court said there... didn't try to decide the issue, but suggested that that might be a sensible place to focus the discussion of whether or not fraudulent conduct is wilful. 
    So the lack of parallelism I would submit is the product of the fact that (a)(2) is looking at something else. 
    (a)(2) is looking at the act, the obtaining, and saying no, you can't keep that, and the rest of it creates, you know, frankly I would say a uniform and sensible system. 
    If the line that's to be drawn as a matter of policy is that nondischargeability comes when conduct gets bad enough that you can say it's wilful and malicious, then why should fraudulent conduct be any different than other kinds of tortious conduct? 
    Why would you single that out? 
    They've already singled out the act of obtaining by fraud. 
    That's important. 
    That's a significant thing. 
    But why should we reach in and say... why should the court reach in and say, well, we know it only really matters when you have reckless fraud, and we know that it's going to make nondischargeable statutory treble damage awards such as in this case where somebody acts by an implicit representation based on reckless failure to determine facts. 
    That's really... the situation of reckless fraud is the only one where this case... I think it's the only one where this case makes any difference, because when you get beyond reckless fraud and you say wilful and malicious, then you're dealing with it under (a)(6), and I--

I mean, in all honesty, Your Honor, that is a possible extension of the... of our reading of it that I will say in all honesty had not occurred to me, but it's a possibility, that in other words it is possible, perhaps, to say that you got this money by fraud and then you got profits by fraud, but... you got profits from that money and therefore all of that was obtained by fraud and I must say, I think that's... that is an interpretation which I do think could be reasonable in the context--

    If there is no reason, then... and if the language permits, as Justice O'Connor pointed out before, why shouldn't we read this exactly the same as it's always been read in the history, i.e., liability on the claim. 
    They're talking about a claim. 
    In other words, they're talking about a judgment, i.e. they're talking about what is normally in a bankruptcy proceeding a piece of paper. 
    The bankruptcy judge sits there, he says, I've a piece of paper it has a number on it. 
    You go read the number. 
    You ask the question, is this piece of paper in an action for fraud. 
    It is or it isn't. 
    If the answer's yes, you write in the number. 
    If the answer's no, you don't. 
    Now, I take it, if there's no intent whatsoever to make a change... and we haven't found any. 
    They said it was stylistic... then that's the simple way that bankruptcy proceedings used to work, and what's the reason for making it more complicated now?

    --I guess I would make two points, one which I made before and that is, the prior language never needed to be and in fact I would submit, looking at our footnotes 13 and 14, never was definitively interpreted the way Your Honor has indicated, but the most important reason is that... well, I won't say the most im... I think the most important reason is the words of the statute. 
    Beyond the words of the statute and the structure and the lack of a prior clear precedent, all of which we submit is dispositive, there is the very important fact that this whole set of provisions, 523(a), is a set of exceptions to discharge that applies only in the context of individual bankruptcies. 
    More than 90 percent of individual bankruptcies are now consumer bankruptcies relating to consumer debts, and what we know is that Congress in 1978 was substantially concerned about the problems of the ineffectiveness of the bankruptcy process vis a vis consumer debtors, was concerned about overreaching creditors, was concerned about creditors who were aggressively asserting positions using the nondischarge provision specifically referred to by this Court in Field v. Mans, talking in terms of the financial statement provisions and the abuses by such creditors. 
    A broad construction of these words... the case before the Court involves certain facts. 
    It represents a relatively tiny proportion of the bankruptcy... individual bankruptcy cases in this country to which it will apply.

   Argument of Gregory G. Diebold
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="1569.205" stopTime="1640.521">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    When considered in light of the history and structure of the code, the clear purpose of the phrase, to the extent obtained by fraud, is to distinguish between legally obtained property or money and fraudulently obtained money or property. 
    In fact, the precise language that was used in the amendment was taken from a case, In re Danns, a Second Circuit case, which discussed that very issue, noted that there was a conflict in authority, and held that in a situation where a debtor obtains money through a legal credit transaction and then subsequently commits an act of fraud and then obtains additional money through a refinancing, the amount of money that gives rise to the debt is the amount obtained through fraud, but it's the debt which is nondischargeable, and the debt has been defined and is still defined by the code as the liability on a claim. 
    The liability on a claim is the amount that you become liable for as a result of the money that you obtained by fraud.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1640.521" stopTime="1694.037">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It depends on how you use the word claim. 
    I mean, you can say you have a claim for money that someone owes you, using the word, the object of the claim is what you're entitled to. 
    But you can also say you have a claim for fraud, or a claim for personal injury, and in that case you're using it to refer to the cause of action rather than what you're entitled to, and the point made by your colleague here is that this statute uses the word in different sections in different ways. 
    In (4) and in (6) and in (9) it's a claim for death, for personal injury, a claim for wilful injury, and so forth, whereas in this it says a claim for money. 
    That's quite different. 
    And then it says, for money to the extent that.

    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    --My response, Justice Scalia, is that it's a... what's nondischargeable is the debt. 
    The debt is based on a claim for money to the extent that the money was obtained by fraud.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1706.815" stopTime="1712.788">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Yes, but it's very difficult to say that the punitive damages were obtained by fraud.

    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    It's difficult to say that if you concede, which we don't, that obtained is used to limit the amount of debt that you occur... incur, but what you're... what we say obtained is limiting is to explain that the fraud, that there must be fraud in connection with the money you obtained and that gives rise to the nondischargeable debt, which in this case, under New Jersey law, is three times the amount of the overcharged rents.

    Why did they put that in if they meant claim? 
    You know, liability on a claim, a claim for fraud, you just say the thing that's nondischargeable is liability on a claim for a fraud.

    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    Let me use an example in the credit transaction. 
    It very often happens that in a credit card situation you charge things, you incur bills, and then you decide you're going to file for bankruptcy, and a month before you go to the attorney and you file for bankruptcy you run up $10,000 worth of debt. 
    Courts have held that that money is obtained by fraud, so to the extent that your credit card bill was obtained by fraud, that debt is nondischargeable, but if the State of New Jersey, as it has in this case, chooses to impose a penalty for that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1852.901" stopTime="1864.128">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But you don't usually think of one obtaining a bill. 
    I mean, you obtain property for which you get a bill. 
    Obtain sounds like it's... you've succeeded in doing something.
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="1864.128" stopTime="1869.191">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes.
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="1870.042" stopTime="1880.978">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    But you obtain a debt for obtaining that money which is nondischargeable. 
    The debt here happened to be more than the money you actually obtained, three times more.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1880.978" stopTime="1926.258">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, let me ask you another question. 
    Referring to this general section of (a), subsection (a). 
    Subsection (a)(7) says that it's not dischargeable to the extent such debt is for a penalty payable to a governmental unit and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss, other than a tax penalty. 
    There the Congress has specified certain penalties that will be nondischargeable, those payable to the Government. 
    Does that mean that they thought about penalties such as punitive damages that aren't payable to the Government and didn't include them anywhere?
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="1926.258" stopTime="1927.660">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    No, Justice, I don't think it--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1927.660" stopTime="1928.148">
    Unknown Speaker 
    No?
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="1928.148" stopTime="1945.272">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    --it does. 
    I think that first of all with (a)(7), the difference between (a)(7) and (a)(2) is that it has to be a debt owed to, or penalty owed to the Government, but there's nothing in the code itself which restricts or makes each of those sections exclusive. 
    a non Government--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1945.272" stopTime="1949.854">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, at least we know from (a)(7) that Congress thought about penalties--
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="1949.854" stopTime="1950.956">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    --Exactly, and we also know--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1950.956" stopTime="1959.590">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --to the extent they're payable to the Government. 
    Sometimes punitive damages are payable to a governmental unit. 
    Maybe in that case it would go under (7).
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="1959.590" stopTime="1980.285">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    --That's correct. 
    There's no requirement of fraud in (a)(7), so that the Government can recover those penalties regardless of what the reason for their imposition was. 
    In (a)(2), of course, there's a requirement that the private party show fraud. 
    But (a)(7) also demonstrates that Congress knew clearly how to distinguish between compensatory damages and punitive damages if they wanted to.

    The credit card company says Smith went bankrupt, and Smith owes me $50,000, so my claim as the credit card company is, I have a claim... I say Smith is liable on my claim for $50,000. 
    Now, $20,000 of that he obtained by fraud, so I have a claim for 50, and that claim for 50 is fraud... is for fraud to the extent of 20,000.

    I respectfully think that Your Honor is. 
    We both agree that the statute... I believe we both agree that the statute permits a severing of that obtained legally and that obtained by fraud. 
    The question is, does the statute in addition prohibit the imposition of treble damages or other penalties or punitive damages based on the amount obtained by fraud, which in Your Honor's hypothetical would be the $20,000.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Am I correct that in your answer to Justice Breyer's question you were assuming that debt or claim and money are synonymous, but it seems to me that under the statute they're not synonymous. 
    There are certain debts or claims, and those debts or claims may to some extent represent money obtained, so that if you recognize the distinction between claim on the one hand and the money that may or may not be represented by that claim on the other hand, you would have to answer differently, wouldn't you?
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="2166.208" stopTime="2168.048">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    Well, I'm not sure I'm following--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2168.048" stopTime="2190.242">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    You would have to... you would have to say that if you recognize the distinction you simply cannot amalgamate money obtained by fraud and damages assessed with respect to that money obtained by fraud and that, it seems to me, is what you consistently do in your argument. 
    You do identify or amalgamate those two things and yet the statute seems not to do that.
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="2190.242" stopTime="2194.956">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    --Well, except that the statute defines debt as a liability on a claim.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mm hmm.
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="2195.847" stopTime="2205.815">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    And in this case the liability on the respondent's claim was, under New Jersey law, three times the amount of the money obtained by fraud.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2205.815" stopTime="2211.619">
    Justice David H. Souter

    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    Well, if I can use an example to I think answer what I believe to be Your Honor's question, let's assume that in this case the legal rent is $500 and the landlord had a good faith reasonable belief that the rent was $600, but he decided to tack on another $100 because he thought he could get away with it. 
    What we're saying is that the amount between $500 and $600 would be fully dischargeable. 
    The amount between $600 and $700 is the amount that he obtained by fraud but that... but the debt that that obtaining would create would be $300 under New Jersey law.

    Yes, but when you start talking about statutes as a whole, that means this particular language is against me, but I'm going to try to find a broader purpose. 
    Do you concede that as long as you make the distinction between the debt or claim and the money on the other hand, recognizing that the latter may be less than the former, the language of the statute is against you?

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Then I-- 
    --Let me try it another way. 
    I think I'm asking the same question. 
    It seems to me perfectly reasonable to add on the trebling in those sections that speak of any debt for fraud, for wilful and malicious injury, when they talk about a debt for the wrongful act. 
    Anything that you get by reason of the wrongful act, including the trebling, belongs to you. 
    But when they're using claim in the other way, or debt in the other way... that is, a liability for a claim... and they're saying debt for money, money isn't a wrongful act. 
    When it says debt for money to the extent that, there it seems to me not proper to add on any trebling that you get. 
    Now, what's the response for that? 
    You have to understand that (2) and maybe (7) are different from the other sections in that they refer to debt for what you're asking for, not for the wrongful act.
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="2347.348" stopTime="2353.362">

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm not defining debt in different ways. 
    I'm just noting that the object of the debt is phrased differently in these different subsections. 
    In some cases the object is the wrongful act. 
    In other cases, it is what you are asking for by reason of the wrongful act.
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="2372.455" stopTime="2395.830">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    I think as a matter of grammar that's a possible interpretation, but to reach that conclusion, Your Honor would have to assume that in 1984 Congress intended to change what was I believe concededly the... at least the majority position that punitive damages under (a)(2) were not dischargeable.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2395.830" stopTime="2410.350">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But wasn't the prior law in exactly the form that Justice Scalia used as his contrast? 
    Wasn't the operative phrase in the prior law debt for obtaining, as opposed to debt for money obtained by? 
    Isn't that correct?
speaker="gregory_g_diebold" startTime="2410.350" stopTime="2440.871">
    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    That's correct, but I think that the danger of looking at just the phrase that we're concerned about in this case is that it disregards the complete absence of any legislative history to support the position that the petitioner wishes you to adopt. 
    I don't think that it's reasonable to assume that Congress would have decided to reduce the liability of a debtor for fraudulent conduct without at least some discussion or reference to it in the legislative history.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, but doesn't his argument use debt in exactly the same way? 
    Debt is used synonymously with claim, but his argument simply depends upon the fact that the statute recognizes that some debt is for money obtained and other debt is for judgments rendered. 
    That is to say, and this is the same question, that debt means claim as further defined subsection by subsection by subsection?

    Mr. Gregory G. Diebold 
    --I don't think that the language, the operative language in section (2) is attempting to further define debt, though. 
    I think that even the petitioner concedes that the holding in the Levy case, which held that the phrase modified debt, is correct. 
    I think that what Congress was intending to do, as was shown by the 1978 legislative report that's quoted at page 19 of the Solicitor General's brief, is to distinguish between how that debt was obtained. 
    The entire structure of the... of 523 is to define or list certain types of conduct for which debts will not be dischargeable. 
    The conduct that is non... that gives rise to a nondischargeable debt under (a)(2) is that conduct which is fraudulent. 
    If you obtain money legally and fraudulently, then the statute allows you to separate those two situations and only the debt based on the fraudulently obtained money would be nondischargeable.

    Well, that's correct, and perhaps Congress could have written this a little better but the fact is, I believe, that Congress would not have changed this statute and how it operates significantly in the way that the petitioner wishes you to read it without some discussion of it. 
    The discussion, what little there was, about consumer debt and bankruptcy show that Congress was concerned about curtailing debtor abuse. 
    You would have to conclude, in order to rule in favor of the petitioner, that what Congress did in 1984 was stop and say, okay, but let's give a break to fraudulent debtors and reduce their liability and I don't think that under the legislative history of this statute that that's what Congress intended to do.

   Argument of Jeffrey A. Lamken
speaker="jeffrey_a_lamken" startTime="2739.175" stopTime="2778.500">
    Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    For nearly a century, bankruptcy law has excluded from discharge all liabilities arising from the debtor's fraud, including consequential and, where imposed, punitive damages. 
    Nothing in section 523(a)(2) alters that settled practice. 
    The code defines the term, debt, as liability on a claim. 
    Section 523 (a)(2) thus exempts from discharge liability on a claim for money or services to the extent the money or services were obtained by fraud.

    Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken 
    No, Your Honor, I don't think Mr. Ayer would concede that consequential damages to the creditor are within his interpretation. 
    His interpretation limits what is nondischargeable to the amount actually obtained by the debtor. 
    Now, if the debtor also makes an additional profit, he was considering the possibility of including that, but the consequential damages are clearly excluded--

    Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken 
    Your Honor, I think the question assumes that the phrase, a claim for money obtained by fraud, means a claim to acquire or to obtain the money which was obtained by fraud. 
    I think it's clear that Congress did not use the phrase, debt for, or claim for, in that sense. 
    From section (a)(2)(A) itself, that refers to a claim for services obtained by fraud. 
    It's clear that the creditor is not trying to acquire the services that were obtained by fraud. 
    What the creditor wants is the liability that was imposed as a result and that liability can include punitive and consequential damages.

    Well, the language of (a)(2) really does favor the petitioner. 
    A discharge doesn't include a debt for, in this case, money to the extent obtained by fraud. 
    It favors the position taken by the petitioner, and you ask us to look back at the older provisions for guidance, I guess.
speaker="jeffrey_a_lamken" startTime="3032.277" stopTime="3074.394">
    Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken 
    That's correct, Your Honor, but I would disagree that the language favors petitioner, because that is only true if you don't look at the definition of the word debt. 
    The word debt is liability on a claim. 
    I don't think you could be any clearer that a claim for money or property or services obtained by fraud under New Jersey law is three times the damages so imposed and therefore the claim, the liability on the claim is the full amount of the judgment that would be entered by a New Jersey court in this context. 
    The structure of 523 (a) I believe confirms this. 
    Section 523 (a)(6) and (a)(9) make nondischargeable liability on a claim for death or injury, or liability on a claim for wilful or malicious injury.

    Before 1970 there was a split in the courts on whether or not the full amount of credit was nondischargeable simply because a small portion thereof had been obtained by fraud, and that's the In re Danns decision. 
    The legislative history in 1978 shows that Congress was aware of this issue. 
    I believe that the language added in 1984 is most reasonably read as making it unmistakably clear that there must be a parsing process to determine how much was obtained by fraud, how much was not obtained by fraud, and all of the liability on a claim for the portion that was obtained by fraud is nondischargeable, and that liability may include consequential and punitive damages.

    Is that... in one sentence, is that your argument?
speaker="jeffrey_a_lamken" startTime="3173.229" stopTime="3217.939">
    Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken 
    That is absolutely correct. 
    Lawyers often refer to a claim by what caused the claim to arise, and sometimes by the result. 
    We might speak of a claim for personal injury, the result, or we might speak of a claim for battery, what caused the injury. 
    In the context of this statute, Congress has used those two interchangeably, as lawyers often do. 
    Sometimes they spoke of a debt for fraud, the action that produced the injury, or a debt for wilful and malicious injury, the result. 
    In our portion, in (a)(2), it says a debt for money, property, or services to the extent obtained by fraud, the result, but that does not alter the amount of liability, necessarily. 
    The amount of liability is that amount which would be imposed by a State court and that amount, in this case, is three times the injury so imposed. 
    If there are no further questions, I'll cede the remainder of my time.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Lamken. 
    Mr. Ayer, you have 2 minutes remaining. 
    I'm sure Mr. Lamken didn't mean to cede it to you.

   Rebuttal of Donald B. Ayer
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="3225.963" stopTime="3287.135">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I just want to make one point, and it relates to Justice Breyer's hypothetical about the credit card situation. 
    I would submit that a broad reading of this provision here so as to essentially use the prior language, read broadly, as it's read in (a)(6), reading debt for obtaining money by fraud creates... that broad reading to include all essentially consequential, punitive, and other damages would create a situation where a credit card company who could come in and argue reckless fraud with regard to the $20,000 that was spent, and then can argue $30,000 more in interest at 18 percent under their contract and then can argue another $10,000 in attorney's fees, that in that circumstance they can come in and make a credible, if not a winning argument that in fact all of that is something that's entitled to nondischarge. 
    Now, that is something that's a real life issue. 
    I would direct the Court, if it's interested, to the 1997 National Bankruptcy Review Commission report.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You don't want them to get the interest. 
    You mean, all they can get is the $20,000 that the person got, and he gets it interest free, right?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="3296.121" stopTime="3303.165">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    We would submit, Your Honor, that's correct, that they get the... well, they may get a market interest. 
    Whether they get a contractual interest rate I would submit is--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3303.165" stopTime="3304.997">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why even the market interest rate?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="3304.997" stopTime="3318.775">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Well, I'm sorry. 
    The measure under Justice Scalia's hypothetical earlier would be the benefit that... and I think it may be correct... the benefit that was obtained by the debtor, not the amount that's contractually owed to the credit card company.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3318.775" stopTime="3328.461">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Could I get you to comment on one question that came up in your opponent's argument? 
    The prior law is uncertain, you say, but what about the 1898 statute? 
    That was perfectly clear, wasn't it?
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="3328.461" stopTime="3330.803">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    The 1898 statute talked about judgments.

    Right.
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="3331.183" stopTime="3333.475">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    It talked about judgments, and--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3333.475" stopTime="3334.944">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Which would necessarily include the punitive--
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="3334.944" stopTime="3348.855">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Well, if that language were transported to today, when punitive damages is an issue, which really only started in a big way in the 1970's, that may well be where the Court would come out. 
    The fact is, no one has come up with a case construing that language.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3348.855" stopTime="3351.857">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Of course, that language may be clear enough that you didn't need a case.

    Thank you, Mr. Ayer.
