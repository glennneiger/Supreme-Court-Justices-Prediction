Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-568, Joseph Oncale v. Sundowner's Offshore Services, Inc.-- 
    Mr. Canaday.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="10.689" stopTime="102.632">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Rejecting Joseph Oncale's title VII claims, the Fifth Circuit stated, same-sex harassment claims are not cognizable under title VII. 
    The question presented through this appeal is whether the Fifth Circuit's categorical rejection of same-sex claims under title VII is correct. 
    We argue that it is not. 
    The court below should be reversed. 
    Same-sex sexual harassment claims are actionable under title VII. 
    This case is not about the outer limits or parameters of same-sex sexual harassment as an actionable form of discrimination because of sex, nor is this case about the methods of proof of such a claim. 
    This case is about whether a same-sex sexual harassment claim exists as a matter of law. 
    The Fifth Circuit rule that same-sex claims do not exist under title VII is not sex-specific. 
    It is an absolute rule. 
    Both sides to this litigation agree that women are entitled to the protections of title VII, but to accept the Fifth Circuit rule is to accept the proposition that a woman's right to work in an environment free of unwelcome sexual conduct, or sexual solicitation, turns on the sex of her harasser. 
    If the harasser is a female, the woman has no rights or remedies under title VII as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="102.632" stopTime="104.494">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I thought this case involved a man.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="104.494" stopTime="154.419">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    It does, Your Honor. 
    This case does involve a man, but I emphasize that the Fifth Circuit's ruling is not a male-on-male decision, it is a same-sex decision, and I emphasize that to point out the breadth of the Fifth Circuit's categorical and absolute rule that same-gender sexual harassment claims, regardless of the genders, as long as they're identical, and regardless of the underlying facts, would, under the Fifth Circuit's rule, be dismissed as a matter of law, but Your Honor, you're exactly correct, this is a male-on-male situation, but the court did not decide the case on that fact except to recognize that the genders of the two parties, the harasser and the victim, were the same. 
    So to accept the Fifth Circuit's rule, then, is to agree that the sex of the harasser defines the scope of title VII.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="154.419" stopTime="186.101">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Not necessarily. 
    I mean, you could say if the harasser, whoever he or she is, treats members of one sex, whether the same sex as the harasser or the opposite sex, differently, you could... so you... if you have a difference of... in treatment by the perpetrator of males and females, that's one thing. 
    So I don't think that the Fifth Circuit has ruled quite as broadly as you suggest. 
    You could have a male perpetrator and a male victim.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="186.101" stopTime="208.117">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit has ruled categorically that if there is a male victim and a male perpetrator they do not look at the underlying facts or circumstances of the harassment. 
    They decided as a matter of law that same-gender causes of actions do not exist. 
    The Fifth Circuit's rule would be equally applicable were this a woman-on-woman case. 
    The fact that it is male-on-male--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="208.117" stopTime="235.148">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But my point is, this was an all-male environment, too, and wasn't that... don't we have to take the decision in that context? 
    In other words, they didn't say that if you have an employer who treats members of one sex one way and members of another sex another way there would still be no claim under title VII if the victim is a male and the perpetrator is a male. 
    They didn't say that. 
    There was no other sex involved in this case.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="235.148" stopTime="256.095">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    --That is correct, there was no other sex involved, but that factual determination is not the foundation of the Fifth Circuit's rule. 
    The Fifth Circuit's rule is a categorical rule. 
    The Fifth Circuit in fact did not discern or consider the underlying circumstances or the maleness of the workplace. 
    The Fifth Circuit's rule is the broadest of possible brushes. 
    It's an absolute rule.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="256.095" stopTime="269.225">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, as I understand, Mr. Canaday, you're not asking us to decide whether or not there was discrimination in this case. 
    You're simply asking us to say that the fact that it was male on male does not prevent there from having been discrimination.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="269.225" stopTime="286.621">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    Your Honor, that's exactly correct, because my case was thrown out as a matter of law. 
    The court below found that no facts were material. 
    The court below did not review the facts and determine which facts of the alleged harassing situation were material. 
    They didn't decide this case as a matter of fact. 
    They decided this case as a matter of law.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, what are you going to have to show if you prevail?

speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="295.528" stopTime="334.358">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    We would prevail if the jury was instructed that sexual harassment is a cognizable form of discrimination based on sex. 
    The jury could then be instructed on the law as established in the circuits and as articulated by this Court, and then the court, the trier of fact could draw the reasonable inference... well, first of all, under the facts alleged the trier of fact could determine that Joseph Oncale was quid pro... the victim of quid pro quo sexual harassment, or the trier of fact, under the facts as they currently stand, could find that Joseph Oncale was victimized of a hostile sexual environment.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="334.358" stopTime="349.287">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But title VII doesn't speak of sexual harassment or a hostile sexual environment. 
    That is a part of a... the basic is discrimination. 
    You would have to show that he was treated differently because he was a man, would you not?
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="349.287" stopTime="357.953">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    Your Honor, we would have to show that discrimination because of sex, as defined by this Court in the Meritor case, did in fact occur, yes, sir.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, suppose you had a case in which an uncouth supervisor tells very offensive and suggestive jokes to both sexes.

    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    Well, on the facts--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    --If it is the off-color, or the poor joke case, Your Honor, I believe the argument then would be, or the issue then would be whether or not the severity or pervasiveness of the conduct raised the level--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="392.214" stopTime="392.945">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, you know what I'm trying to say.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="392.945" stopTime="407.765">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    --Yes, sir. 
    If the facts were that the... all employees of both genders are treated equally, the equal opportunity harasser... first of all, let me emphasize that's not this case.

    So--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So you're saying that the other sexual harasser, or the homosexual harasser is liable, but the bisexual harasser is not.

    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    --No.

    No, sir.

    No, sir.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --Well, if not, why is there discrimination? 
    I think that's what we're both asking.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="443.808" stopTime="463.412">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    In the pure... in the true bisexual harasser scenario, which again this case is not, the court could then look at the sexual nature of the conduct and could, under existing precedent, argue that each victim was a victim of sexual harassment.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="463.412" stopTime="477.213">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No. 
    Each victim would have been a victim of... would have been discriminated against on the basis of that person's sexuality, but not on the basis of that person's sex, because it was indifferent to the harasser whether the person was male or female.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="477.213" stopTime="491.574">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    But the individual claimant, Your Honor, who brought the cause of action alleging that he or she was the victim of sexual discrimination could demonstrate that their work environment was a discriminatorily hostile work environment and then, perhaps as a matter of defense--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="491.574" stopTime="493.284">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No more so than people of the other sex.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="493.284" stopTime="493.855">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    --Then that would be--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="493.855" stopTime="494.956">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That's what the person has to show.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="494.956" stopTime="504.714">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    --But that would be a matter of affirmative defense, would it not, not as matter of an element of cause of action. 
    If that person shows that they are singled out for mistreatment based upon sex--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="504.714" stopTime="506.604">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, if they show they're singled out.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="506.604" stopTime="506.985">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    --Yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="506.985" stopTime="512.048">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But the point is, they haven't been singled out. 
    This person treats males and females alike.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="512.048" stopTime="513.230">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    Right, and again, if that was--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="513.230" stopTime="522.957">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I just wonder... you know, if you acknowledge that the bisexual harasser does not violate this law, I just wonder how that transfers over to the case that you have.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="522.957" stopTime="538.496">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    --Well, I do not believe it transfers over to the case that I have because the case before you now is the first-step case as to whether the cause of action exists and secondly, in my case, only men were harassed under the situation on the Sundowner rig. 
    Only Joseph Oncale was harassed.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="538.496" stopTime="547.312">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but you don't concede as a matter of law, do you, that the bisexual harasser cannot harass on the basis of sex?
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="547.312" stopTime="548.642">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    That is exactly correct.

    Oh, let's assume that it's very gross, but... so... and it meets all the standards of our case law about it has to be pervasive and grave.

    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, why is that discrimination, then? 
    You would agree that you also have to show that the harasser is discriminating-- 
    --Yes--

speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="641.358" stopTime="657.629">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    I believe that's an essential element of the cause of action, but the Fifth Circuit in this case said that those circumstances could never be proved in a same-gender sexual harassment claim. 
    These questions that the court have posed are questions of proof, or questions of motive, but not of questions of definition.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="657.629" stopTime="668.386">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    No, but it's also a question of how we're going to write the opinion. 
    I mean, maybe you would prevail under these facts, but we have to understand the nature of the cause of action, and we're asking you why there is discrimination in some of these hypotheticals that we have posed.
speaker="nicholas_canaday_iii" startTime="668.386" stopTime="688.240">
    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    Your Honor, there is discrimination because Joseph Oncale in this case, alone among men in a workplace, was selected by his supervisor, a male, to be the victim of that male supervisor's unsolicited, unwanted, and obnoxious sexual advances. 
    That is sexual harassment.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="688.240" stopTime="724.378">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I wouldn't really call them sexual advances. 
    It was certainly not... a lot cruder than that, but suppose... suppose that Mr. Oncale had been hazed, which is what the other side says. 
    This is just, you know, good frolics, and male hazing. 
    Suppose he had been hazed in some other fashion. 
    I mean, just as obnoxious, but just not... you know, nothing to do with genitals or anything else. 
    They just said, you know, you're a fat slob. 
    Your eyes are crooked.

    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    --Well, I believe that what we've argued in brief is that it is... the singling out for sex-specific or sex-driven conduct is one category, this category, but your hypothetical--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why is that? 
    Is this a law... I mean, is this a dirty-word law, or something?

    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    --Right. 
    To answer your question, though, you asked earlier, Your Honor, is if the conduct was devoid of sexual connotations, or didn't involve grabbing Mr. Oncale's genitalia, or didn't involve use of a bar of soap in a shower, as this case did, then perhaps there would have to be showing of modus, or motive, or intent, or animus, independent of the facts. 
    But given that this man was singled out for sexual abuse by his supervisors, the component of sexuality as a component of... because of his sex is inherent in the fact pattern.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Well, take Justice Scalia's hypothesis that the hazing here did not involve genitals, but just very nasty treatment. 
    Now, if you could show the supervisor, or whoever was the hazer, did not treat women the same way given the same circumstances, then I suppose you could make out a claim of discrimination.

    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    I believe if the harassing conduct is nonsexual then the plaintiff would have a burden of establishing a disparity of treatment and show that perhaps that supervisor didn't treat women the same way so as to show the motive to--

    That is true.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Isn't your point here that when the hazing is of the sexual nature here, simply by proving what went on, you make a stronger prima facie case that in fact there was sex discrimination going on than you would be if you were merely to prove hazing of a totally nonsexual nature? 
    Isn't that the real difference?

    Mr. Nicholas Canaday, III 
    We might be able to show how women were treated in other circumstances, in other work offices of Sundowner, or how they responded to sexual harassments by other individuals. 
    We may be able to demonstrate that Mr. Lyons may confess that had Joseph Oncale not been a man he never would have done that. 
    In the current posture of this case we haven't had an opportunity to take Mr. Lyons' deposition, but those are the types of questions we would certainly explore with him. 
    I'd like to save some time for rebuttal, if I may.

    --The--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And how can that be shown?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1023.237" stopTime="1063.174">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --The test under title VII is whether a person was treated in the way he or she was because of that employee's sex. 
    As this Court said in Vinson, to quote, without question, when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex, that supervisor discriminates on the basis of sex, or, put another way, as in Manhart, when the person is treated in a manner different from what he would have been treated if gender had not been taken into account. 
    The question of how someone of the opposite sex is treated is one way of proving that ultimate question, but the Court in Vinson regarded it as treating someone because of their sex as discrimination.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1063.174" stopTime="1070.610">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    How can that possibly be involved in this case? 
    I mean, there were other men in the workplace who weren't treated this way. 
    They just didn't like this guy.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1070.610" stopTime="1114.304">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, that... there's a difference between motive and treatment. 
    I mean, if we look at Harris, for example, in Harris the harassment was explicitly sexual, sex-based. 
    The employer was saying, you dumb woman, comments like that. 
    It was facially sex-based, just like in Johnson Controls the policy with respect to employment was explicitly sex-based, and the Court said when you have something that's explicitly sex-based the motive behind that does not detract from the fact that it is a violation of title VII. 
    And when you... in the opposite gender harassment cases the courts, lower courts have been prepared to assume, as I think this Court's descriptions in Vinson and Harris have, that it is because of sex. 
    Now, that may--

    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, I think that the courts have assumed that it's because of sex, that there's something relational about sex.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1130.094" stopTime="1133.427">

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1148.317" stopTime="1171.693">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Okay. 
    So suppose you have an employer who has the unfortunate habit of patting every single employee, male or female, on the fanny every day, indiscriminately, both sexes. 
    Now, how do you show sexual harassment under that discrimination requirement of title VII?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1171.693" stopTime="1184.222">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    It may well be that in that situation the conduct is not because of the recipient's... of the victim's sex. 
    That is the requirement, and as the Court said in Harris, this is a question of the facts and circumstances and the severity--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1184.222" stopTime="1191.746">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    You're concentrating on because of sex, which is in the statute, I agree, but discriminate... discriminate is also a word in the statute, and you're leaving that out of your analysis, it seems to me.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1191.746" stopTime="1251.004">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Well, it textually... this is a constructive discharge case, among other things, and the statute says it's an unlawful employment practice to fail or refuse to hire... excuse me, or to discharge an individual or otherwise discriminate because of the individual's sex. 
    The suggestion textually, discharge because of sex, is taken to be discrimination in that situation, and this is consistent with the purpose of title VII, which is to render irrelevant a person's sex, just as the person's race or national origin is to be irrelevant in the workplace. 
    So if you have... in the hypothetical equal opportunity harasser, if someone uses explicitly sex-based harassing terms, rising to the level of offensiveness at issue in Harris, against women using sex-specific words and men using derogatory, sex-specific terms, each of those employees experiences the terms and conditions of his or her employment--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    It says discriminate.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1275.564" stopTime="1282.801">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Well then, Justice O'Connor's hypothetical, then, would not meet the statute because no words were chosen.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --And it is not... it is not... perhaps looked at in other ways, it's not facially sex-based. 
    In the opposite sex sexual harassment cases the courts have been prepared to assume, I think, that it is because of sex. 
    Maybe that's an assumption about human behavior, and probably an accurate one. 
    It is seldom the case that the victim, or the other person's sex is irrelevant in sexual conduct. 
    Sex is relational. 
    It's done with regard to the sex of the other person, whether it's the same sex or opposite sex.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I find it difficult to see that there ought to be a distinction, with regard to the application of this law, whether the particular individual who was harassed in this case is made to feel small and insignificant and embarrassed by using dirty sex words or in some other fashion. 
    I can't see how that would have anything to do with whether he's being discriminated against on the basis of his sex. 
    You're telling me if you call him a jerk every day, that's okay, but if you use some sex-related word it's not okay.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --It wouldn't be okay... if you have very abusive conduct that is not sex-based on its face, it would still be open to the employee to show that it is because of the employee's sex by showing that women were not treated in the same way. 
    But where it is explicitly sex-based, where it is by use of the sex organs, it would at least be a permissible inference for a finder of fact to conclude that this conduct would not have been engaged in with a woman, that this was done--

   Argument of Harry M. Reasoner
speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="1591.100" stopTime="1646.971">
    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I would like to rest our argument on three points, to the extent that the Court would permit. 
    First, I think the question by Mr. Chief Justice about the relationship of sexual harassment to this discrimination statute is at the heart of the case. 
    This is a discrimination statute. 
    It was passed in 1964, clearly, we submit by its plain language to deal with discrimination between men and women. 
    In our language, words take their meaning from the context, and in the context of this statute it did refer to discrimination between men and women. 
    Sexual harassment, although both the Government and petitioner treat it as if it were an independent, statutory concept not tied to the fundamental finding of discrimination, is not an independent--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1646.971" stopTime="1650.832">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Reasoner, can I ask you sort of a basic question? 
    Your opponent relied on the Manhart case.

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    --Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1651.383" stopTime="1660.178">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Which I guess the basic test is, if this person would have been treated differently if he had been of the opposite sex, then that's a prima facie proof of discrimination.
speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="1660.178" stopTime="1660.839">
    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1660.839" stopTime="1671.605">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Would you agree that if the jury could reasonably infer from the set of circumstances that the same thing would not have happened if this person had been a woman, that then that would be the necessary showing of discrimination?

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    I would not, Your Honor.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You would not.
speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="1672.907" stopTime="1727.307">
    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    And if I might attempt to explain, I think that when you... that the Court extended the statute to say that sexual harassment can so affect the conditions of employment that it violates the statute, creates discrimination. 
    That is clearly powerfully true with regard to women. 
    Congress was well-informed on that. 
    They had passed in 1963 the Equal Pay Act, and so to extend the statute to say if you are harassing women in the workplace you are creating a discrimination which deprives them of a level playing field. 
    We do not... and I think that this extension is reasonable. 
    The question that is now being asked, the Court is now being asked to do is say, you have extended sexual harassment into the area of men and women, discrimination between men and women. 
    Now we want you to extend it to regulate the conduct of men. 
    Sexual--

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    --I think I did, too. 
    What I'm trying to say, at least, is this. 
    If we move into Federal regulation the whole spectrum of male relationships which are sexually, which have sexual content and are abusive and in the workplace... and I submit to you, that is what both the petitioner and the Government are asking for. 
    If you look at page 21 of the Government's paper, in response to Justice O'Connor and Justice Ginsburg's question, they would include it all, all male conduct that has a sexual content that is in the workplace and is abusive.

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    --Let me suggest to you why I think that the statute should not be applied in that way, and three circuits have followed that notion. 
    The Fourth Circuit, Sixth Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit have adopted the concept of a homosexual... if the homosexual... there's a homosexual harassment, then they can meet the because-of-sex requirement. 
    You would argue that if you can find homosexuality, or raise an issue of homosexuality, then it was because of Mr. Oncale's sex that this occurred. 
    I--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1851.577" stopTime="1879.707">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But employers can discriminate because of sex without the discriminator having any particular sexual desires for the victim of the discrimination. 
    I mean, under the Fifth Circuit's ruling a man who discriminates against a man or a woman who discriminates against a woman in the workplace is immune, and it seems to me that's very difficult to justify.
speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="1879.707" stopTime="1905.733">
    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    --I... with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that is an overstatement of the Fifth Circuit's position, as I would understand it. 
    I think you must bear in mind that the Fifth Circuit was speaking only to sexual harassment, and only to the question that when the Court has extended this discrimination statute into the area of sexual harassment to meet its purposes, should it then extend it further to regulate same-sex conduct?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1905.733" stopTime="1925.118">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I don't know that we regard it as an extension of the statute to say that it covered sexual harassment. 
    I think what we said was that sexual harassment without actual resulting in a discharge or a demotion was nonetheless actionable. 
    I don't think we changed the actors involved.

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    I think, Your Honor, what... Mr. Chief Justice, what I understood you to say in Meritor is that sexual harassment can be equivalent to discrimination if it is so severe and pervasive that it changes the conditions of employment, thereby discriminating against the sex being harassed.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1943.691" stopTime="1956.450">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, sexual harassment directed in a discriminatory way against a victim, but certainly we didn't say that sexual harassment that was meted out equally to everybody is discrimination.
speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="1956.450" stopTime="1972.190">
    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    Well, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I agree with that, and both in Meritor and Harris you were dealing with sexual harassment of women, very clear based on congressional findings... I mean, that there was a disparity. 
    There's a disparity in power. 
    There was a need to level--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1972.190" stopTime="1977.904">

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    --I would submit, Your Honor, that the Court can look to the Equal Pay Act of 1963, that there were extensive findings by Congress that there was a disparate treatment of women in the workplace. 
    My point on federalism is that there are no findings, anywhere, that suggest that Congress needs to pass a statute to regulate discrimination among males, or to regulate male conduct.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Mr.-- 
    --Well--

    You would have us hold that if a homosexual supervisor trades favors with people of his own sex for advancement, that this is not a violation of the statute.

    Now, the guideline says that harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of title VII if it's physical conduct of a sexual nature when such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    If I could say this one word, or sentence, the Fifth Circuit is saying that discrimination because of sex was not intended to comprehend relationships between the same sex. 
    It was not intended to comprehend all the whole spectrum of males' treatment of males. 
    Because of sex meant discrimination between men and women. 
    That's why they would exclude sexual harassment.

speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="2232.627" stopTime="2251.363">
    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    Justice Ginsburg, I think there is a clear distinction between policies regarding to pay, promotion, et cetera. 
    That's clear. 
    You can't discriminate. 
    The sex of the superior deciding that is immaterial. 
    It is only the area of sexual harassment, this interpersonal abuse--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2251.363" stopTime="2277.059">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, why would it be different? 
    Let's say you had two rooms in the same, and in one there were women working, in the other, men, and when the women complain about sexual harassment, the boss attends to it, takes it seriously, and when the men complain about the grossest treatment, the kind we have here, the boss says, boys will be boys. 
    That would be okay? 
    That would not be within title VII?

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner

speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2285.043" stopTime="2298.544">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But I'm talking only about title VII, so... but I've given you a situation where the employer responds to women's complaints of sexual harassment, says to the guys, you've got to be made of sterner stuff, so I'm not going to pay any attention. 
    That would not come within title VII?
speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="2298.544" stopTime="2311.510">
    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    No, Your Honor, I think not, in the sense if what is being complained about is male harassment of a male.

    They then attempted to retreat from that in Johnson v. Hondo shortly thereafter saying, well, we won't look at sexual content alone, but once you get into regulating male behavior with sexual content--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why isn't the Manhart test the answer to all this? 
    You say there are all sorts of problems, but why don't you just have a very simple rule? 
    If the plaintiff sustains the burden of proving that the victim would have been treated differently if he or she had been of the opposite sex, that proves discrimination.

    Now, when we're talking about interpersonal relationships and we're going to attach them to discrimination in some way, what's the content we give to them? 
    What does because of sex mean? 
    The only thing the Fourth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuit could figure out that because of sex meant was that we inquire into the sexual orientation of the predator.

    But that must be wrong, isn't it? 
    I mean, isn't it the... that they're trying to get at the problem of whether the employer has imposed a term or condition, a significant term or condition because of the person's gender, and in those instances where, for example, people create a workplace where there is either quid pro quo or some frightful situation where the women have to suffer because of their gender, they have a term or condition that the others don't, and the same could happen to a man, couldn't it? 
    I grant you it's hard to work out in the... in some individual cases. 
    In many it's not hard to work out.

    --Well, Your Honor, I think that when one looks at the struggles of the Seventh Circuit, the Fourth, the Sixth, and the Eleventh, to work out a rationale to make this statute... and I submit one reason it is so difficult to work out is because this statute was never designed to regulate conduct among the same sex, then I think that the... that it's fair to say that the courts desperately need guidance.

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    If she discriminates in an employment decision, a promotion decision, certainly not. 
    You know, discrimination at the level of company policy or supervision is certainly not immune. 
    If she discriminates... if she propositions her, or makes sexual overtures to her, then yes, we would say that that is not implicated by the statute.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, and is the reason... is the reason it is not implicated simply because it was not the intent of Congress to implicate it?

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    --Well, I would submit that you're having to change the meaning. 
    If you say discrimination because of sex, speaking of gender, you're talking about discrimination because somebody's a male or because somebody's a female. 
    That's exactly what you had in Meritor and Harris. 
    You went no further than that.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2875.755" stopTime="2898.211">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Sure, but at the time the statute was passed, exactly the same argument could have been made about discrimination because of race. 
    You're talking about somebody of race A who treats race B in a disadvantageous way, and exactly that same argument, if it were sound, would have led to the conclusion that you can't have discrimination by one white against another white.
speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="2898.211" stopTime="2910.720">
    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    No, Your Honor, I would suggest that if you look at because of sex, when you apply it to... a female to a female, or a male to a male, you have changed the meaning.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Why couldn't it be because you're not the right kind of man, just as with respect to women, and wasn't there, at least in one case, a statement to the effect of what title VII is aimed at is getting rid of stereotypical notions about the way men are or the way women are, so that if you... we know that an employer can't say, as in Martin Marietta, how could I discriminate against women, most of the people I hire are women, but I won't take the ones who have children. 
    So if that's what title VII is about, you're not the right kind of male, or you're not the right kind of female, why wouldn't it fit?

    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner

    Of course that's discrimination. 
    But are we now going to say that, on male-on-male relationships, that abuse, because we don't like their appearance... I mean, does it all go back to sex and harassment, and I submit to you that's what the Government would have you do. 
    They say to you flatly it's immaterial what the motives were, and the test is tautological. 
    You say, because of sex. 
    Man harasses a man, of course it's because of sex.

    You're not saying that male-on-male is bad. 
    There can be discrimination male-on-male. 
    You're just saying that sexual harassment male-on-male does not automatically constitute discrimination under the act, as male-on-female or female-on-male would. 
    Is that right? 
    Does not automatically.
speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="3045.357" stopTime="3048.148">

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But just because it does not automatically, I don't know why that leads to the conclusion that it does not ever, and why was a summary judgment proper here? 
    Why shouldn't it have been left to the jury to say, well, regardless of whether there were sexual overtones or not, that doesn't decide the case, but nonetheless, if you think that this individual male was being discriminated against because he was a man and not for some other reason, you can find for the plaintiff?
speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="3077.918" stopTime="3094.731">
    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    It leads to that conclusion, Your Honor, if you conclude that, looking at the language of title VII in context, that Congress intended to limit it to discrimination between men and women, that it did not intend to reach into same-sex harassment, and--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Wait, you've acknowledged that it didn't intend to limit it between men and women.

    --the Fifth Circuit said that.

    I think it implicates serious concerns of federalism to now say that this statute will be expanded to uncover this entire spectrum of relationships, and to do it with no... you have no standard. 
    Once you've cut loose from the moorings of the two sexes, because of sex, are we then going to get into homosexuality--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, there's another way of looking at it. 
    Instead of saying it's expanding the statute, say the statute's always covered discrimination, and you're asking to cut out of the general field of discrimination this one area. 
    One can look at it that way, too.
speaker="harry_m_reasoner" startTime="3157.887" stopTime="3182.972">
    Mr. Harry M. Reasoner 
    --One could, Your Honor, but I submit, and even the Government admits this at page 10 of their brief, that sexual harassment was an expansion of the statute based on the intent of the statute, and I think necessary to achieve the statutory purposes, and the question before the Court now is, does sexual harassment need to be applied in the context of single-sex relationships in order to achieve the statutory purposes, and--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3182.972" stopTime="3223.360">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But it's not necessary to look at it as an expansion of the statute. 
    It seems to me that it's sufficient to look at the sexual harassment law as being in effect a kind of evidentiary gloss on the statute, that when this kind of conduct occurs, as Thoreau put it, you know, there's a trout in the milk. 
    We know what that means, and I don't see why we don't also draw an inference when the harassment is between the same sexes. 
    It may in some instances be more difficult to draw it, but as Justice Scalia says, what is the theoretical basis for saying you can never draw that kind of an inference?

    It does not create such an offense.
