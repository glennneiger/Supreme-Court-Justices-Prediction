    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-827, Leonard Rollon Crawford-El v. Patricia Britton. 
    Mr. Schember.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="10.538" stopTime="69.138">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, a First Amendment retaliation case, the Court held that district courts should protect defendants' qualified immunity through firm application of the civil rules protecting defendants against the burden of broad-ranging discovery and enabling them promptly to seek and in substantial cases promptly to obtain summary judgment. 
    The Federal rules are fully sufficient to accomplish these purposes. 
    At the outset of litigation district courts can hold the plaintiff's discovery in abeyance and allow defendants to inquire of the plaintiffs, obtaining from the plaintiffs all evidence that they have to support their contentions that they exercised First Amendment rights, that the defendants knew about it, that the defendants injured the plaintiffs, and that the motive for the injury was retaliation for exercise--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="69.138" stopTime="86.920">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, I suppose you're right that the rules and the procedures are fully sufficient if we wish to devote a huge amount of resources to complaints of this type and to subject officials who have a claim of immunity to prolonged discovery.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="86.920" stopTime="88.650">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --That's what I'm saying, Your Honor.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="88.650" stopTime="93.314">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    If those two factors are eliminated, then I suppose you're quite right, the rules are quite adequate.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="93.314" stopTime="94.426">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Yes.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="94.426" stopTime="105.963">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But the question is whether or not the cost of these proceedings to the Government official who wishes to assert the immunity are so high that the purpose of the immunity is substantially lost.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="105.963" stopTime="106.481">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Yes.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="106.481" stopTime="108.103">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Or am I wrong that that's the question?
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="108.103" stopTime="143.527">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    No, that's the question, but the two burdens identified in Harlow are, first, the burdens of trial and the burdens of broad-ranging discovery, and what I'm suggesting is that at the outset of the case the district court through firm application of the rules, as the Court said should be done in Harlow, can protect defendants against broad-ranging discovery and, indeed, impose the burden on the plaintiff to come forward immediately with all evidence to support the claim, all elements of the claim, and if the plaintiff is unable to do so immediately, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment unless, of course, the plaintiff can show specific facts giving rise to a reasonable likelihood that discovery will uncover necessary evidence.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="143.527" stopTime="164.862">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Schember, speaking more generally there's talk of discovery abuses not just in this case but throughout the country, and the answer often is, well, the district judges have it within their power to prevent that, and I think a lot of people agree that's true, but you have 700 district judges in the country and they just react differently to this sort of problem.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="164.862" stopTime="248.758">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Yes, and I think guidance from this Court could tell them how to firmly apply the civil rules, and the purpose of my argument is to suggest precisely what should be said in that regard, and that by holding the plaintiff's discovery in abeyance at the outset of the case until the defendant has been entitled to discover all the plaintiff's evidence, thereby placing the defendant in the position of promptly seeking summary judgment unless the plaintiff has sufficient evidence or has a basis for seeking discovery, that is firm control that prohibits excessive burden on the defendant at the outset. 
    And even if the plaintiffs make a showing that there's a reasonable likelihood that discovery will uncover evidence supporting their claims the district court still could hold their discovery in abeyance if the defendant wished to assert a defense under Mount Healthy Board of Education v. Doyle, saying even if I... we were substantially motivated by hostility to the plaintiff's exercise of constitutional rights, nonetheless we would have taken the same action in any event, and if defendants come forward with sufficient evidence to establish that defense, they are entitled immediately to summary judgment on that ground unless, of course, plaintiff immediately can present admissible evidence rebutting that, or, again, make a showing that there are facts giving rise to a reasonable likelihood that discovery--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="248.758" stopTime="263.838">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    When you're talking about intent, though, that's a very difficult issue to get summary judgment on, because it's the subjective state of someone's mind, and it's just something that ordinarily it goes to a trier of fact, I think.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="263.838" stopTime="291.767">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --Well, certainly the Harlow court commented on that with respect to the subject of general bad faith and malice. 
    However, inquiry as to the specific intent of unconstitutional animus I would suggest is narrower. 
    For example, the plaintiff certainly has to show I exercised First Amendment rights and the defendant knew about it, and discovery as to that inquiry certainly is narrower than whether the defendant's a bad person, a malicious person, someone who customarily is mean to people, that type of thing.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="291.767" stopTime="298.853">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It still gets you into subjective investigations, which is really what we tried to put behind us in Harlow.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="298.853" stopTime="300.333">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Well--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="300.333" stopTime="303.325">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, we really tried to make this an objective inquiry.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="303.325" stopTime="322.667">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --Well, the Court certainly said that qualified immunity is to be based upon a showing... on the fact that a... no violation of clearly established law exists, but, of course, retaliation for exercise of First Amendment rights, or discrimination on the basis of race or sex was clearly... is clearly established constitutional law.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="322.667" stopTime="354.238">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That clearly established law principle was simply the device which would enable an objective determination to be made in Harlow. 
    What this case requires, if we're to follow the philosophy of Harlow, is some other device that would likewise produce an objective test rather than a subjective one. 
    Now, I'm not sure that what the D.C. Circuit majority did here does that. 
    It's still a subjective test by clear and convincing evidence, but Judge Silberman's test would certainly do that.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="354.238" stopTime="355.728">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Well, but Justice--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="355.728" stopTime="360.602">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Given these facts, could a reasonable person have taken this action. 
    If so, end of the matter.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="360.602" stopTime="375.372">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --Yes, that certainly would do that, but that would be effectively the end of claims that are based upon the subjective intent and, if we are to eliminate entirely claims that are based upon proving the unconstitutional animus--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="375.372" stopTime="378.396">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Just as in Harlow we eliminated claims that were based upon subjective intent.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="378.396" stopTime="407.903">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --General malice, but Harlow cannot be read for the proposition that First Amendment retaliation cases cannot go forward, period. 
    Harlow was a First Amendment retaliation case, and what the Court said in that case is, firmly apply the civil rules in order to make sure that there's no broad-ranging discovery and to make sure that there's early determination by summary judgment, rather than a long-delayed trial in an insubstantial case. 
    It cannot... I do not believe Harlow can be read to foreclose First Amendment retaliation cases, and it has not been understood, I don't believe, since then, to stand for that proposition.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="407.903" stopTime="419.444">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It can surely be read as an attempt by this Court to make the section 1983 inquiry an objective inquiry rather than a subjective one. 
    Surely that was the whole driving force behind Harlow.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="419.444" stopTime="435.273">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Well, that was a Bivens inquiry. 
    That was a Bivens case rather than a section 1983 case, but yes, the... it is true that what the Court did was strip away the particular subjective aspect of the Woodby-Strickland test. 
    That part of the test didn't make any sense.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="435.273" stopTime="445.320">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why... you can always make this claim that what was done was done with a... with an intent to deprive me of a constitutional right.

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Well, it can't always be--

    It can't always be proven.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="447.451" stopTime="454.447">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --Well, I suppose it can always be asserted, but the firm application of the rules will ferret out baseless assertions if the assertion is baseless.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask, in this case, what would happen if the trial judge let the plaintiff take the deposition of the defendant and she testified that she merely gave the materials to the brother-in-law, or whatever he was, as a matter of convenience, she knew all about his First Amendment activities, but she didn't hold a grudge against him, and that's all she said. 
    What should the district judge do with the case, and then there's a motion for summary judgment. 
    There's nothing substantiating it except his belief that she acted improperly.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="482.724" stopTime="512.124">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Well, but there would be... the motion should be denied for the following reason. 
    Implicit in... certainly we wouldn't ignore what she said already on the subject, and that is that she doesn't think prisoners have any rights, and that prisoners bound for a Federal penitentiary don't have any right to any property at all, and that is not a reasonable assertion, the idea that there are no circumstances in which any Federal prisoner has any right to possess any legal papers, no matter what their need might be for pending litigation--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="512.124" stopTime="513.174">

    Yes, but--

    --is not a reasonable--

    --That may be her belief, but she may say with respect to the transactions at issue in this case, I did it as... purely as a matter of convenience, and even though that's my belief, I wasn't trying to discipline him. 
    I just was going about my work.

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --If that were a reasonable belief, then in theory it would be a defense. 
    However, it is not a reasonable basis for her to have so acted. 
    In Waters v. Churchill the Court talked about the problem of inadvertent or mistaken violation of First Amendment rights and said that there should be inquiry as to whether the so-called mistake in the case... or the genuine mistake... was a reasonable mistake.

    This was no mistake.

    Yes, and implicit in her reason, certainly the facts indicate that she intended to deprive him totally of these papers and all of his property. 
    There's no doubt about that. 
    Her belief was that, supposedly that he wasn't entitled to have them at all, but that was not a reasonable belief. 
    That is not a proper basis for a Mount Healthy defense.

    I think there is none. 
    For the Harlow, when you're talking about the legal standard, then we have clearly established law. 
    Here, on the surface everything looks lawful. 
    What makes it unlawful is a clearly unconstitutional design, either race discrimination, First Amendment violation, but on the surface everything looks okay.

    This is an instance where there was injury inflicted. 
    Out-of-pocket loss was imposed, and it happens to have been in violation of the District of Columbia common law and also there is sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that unconstitutional animus motivated it, and it is in the public interest, even if there could be a recovery under a common law conversion claim that the First Amendment claim go forward and that the plaintiff be allowed to prove that if hostility to exercise First Amendment rights was--

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    There should not be, I am arguing to the Court, for the reasons that a clear and convincing evidence rule would not properly balance defendant's needs for immunity against the countervailing interests, which are the need to deter officials from violating constitutional rights, and the need to redress the victims. 
    If we had a situation where Government employees could have their careers ruined by supervisors who retaliate against them for their exercise of speech offduty on matters of public concern, the... and if those employees were not able to obtain any redress unless they could prove their claims by clear and convincing evidence, the chilling effect on Government employees' speech would be contrary to the public interest.

    Never mind that it wasn't clearly established, he knew he was violating the Constitution, and that was his intent.

    Well, yes, but the plaintiff cannot get past summary judgment merely by arguing to the judge, judge, the jury may disbelieve the defendant. 
    Oh, no. 
    Under the summary judgment rules the plaintiff has to come forward with tangible, admissible evidence creating a genuine issue for trial on that, and mere assertion by the plaintiff of, I don't think the defendant would have taken the action but for hostility to me.

    Well, what about the case in which the prisoner has in fact taken some action, as in this case in going to the press, which has resulted in embarrassment to the prison. 
    Take Justice Stevens' hypothetical otherwise. 
    The warden says, I know all of that. 
    Yes, he spoke to the press, it was embarrassing, but that's not the reason I did this. 
    I did this because this seemed to be the most expeditious way of getting the property back to the person. 
    Would the fact that in... on your theory, would the fact that the prison had been embarrassed be a sufficient basis for raising a claim of improper motivation that would survive the summary judgment--

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    I think not. 
    No, I think the official would win summary judgment under that hypothetical, because it's very... if the motive was to get the property back to the prisoner by the most expeditious means, and that was a means to do that, and that's what the official was trying to do, then I would think she would be entitled to summary judgment on it.

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    And... well, the undisputed facts are that she did not divert the property outside the prison system for the purpose of getting it back to Mr. Crawford-El. 
    It was to divert it outside the prison system because she thought he didn't have any entitlement at all to it, and that she could have thrown it in the trash, and as an alternative to throwing it in the trash, she allowed a relative to pick it up.

    If the defendant provides, in a Mount Healthy motion, evidence from which the jury can conclude that she would have acted in the same way in any event, if the plaintiff doesn't come forward with evidence rebutting that... and it's got to be evidence, not surmise and guess.

    No, but it's more than surmise and guess in this hypothetical. 
    Most people, in fact, get mad when they are embarrassed in the public print, and they get mad at the people who are causing them embarrassment. 
    That's more than mere speculation. 
    Why, therefore, isn't it enough to survive?

    Justice David H. Souter 
    In my hypothetical the opposing evidence is this. 
    The prison official says, I did this only because I thought this was the most expeditious way to get things back. 
    I know I was embarrassed, but that had nothing to do with it. 
    On the other side, the evidence is that the prisoner went to the press, made statements that were published, and which were embarrassing to the prison administration. 
    Now, that's more than mere speculation. 
    They... one may reasonably infer that people who get embarrassed that way get mad at the people who cause the embarrassment. 
    You say, nonetheless... I thought you said nonetheless that, in fact, the prisoner's claim would not survive summary judgment.

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    What I said was, if the defendant files a Mount Healthy motion and assumes the burden of saying, I would have acted in the same way, even though I was, or maybe assumed to be... to have acted with unconstitutional animus, if, in that context, the defendant raises the defense and presents evidence that would... that from... on which a jury could reach a conclusion that the defense is established, then the plaintiff must come forward.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1322.082" stopTime="1323.103">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, the evidence is just what I said.
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="1323.103" stopTime="1345.297">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    In your hypothetical, Your Honor, the claim would go forward, because all that's been shown is that there were two substantial motivations for the action, and the defendant has not gone the extra step of saying, even though there was this motive, or irrespective of the motive, I definitely would have, in any event, taken the same action.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1345.297" stopTime="1371.714">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So the distinction seems to be a mere pleading distinction. 
    In my hypothetical, the prison official said, I wasn't influenced by this embarrassment, and it comes out one way. 
    If, on the other hand, the prison official says, well, of course I felt some motivation, but my principal concern, and the predominant purpose, was simply to get the property to the prisoner in the most expeditious way, then the result would be different?
speaker="daniel_m_schember" startTime="1371.714" stopTime="1397.632">
    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    Well, the Mount Healthy standard is, would the official have taken the same action anyway? 
    That's the... under Mount Healthy, that's what the official has to show. 
    If we have two substantial motivations, it's... and one is unconstitutional animus, and there's no proof by the defendant that the same action would, in fact, have been taken absent the unconstitutional animus, then the plaintiff is entitled to prevail.

    I did not act on an improper motive. 
    But there are some things which would permit an inference. 
    A finder of fact could infer that there was an improper motive.

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --Yes. 
    There's a captain in Seattle I think we need to depose. 
    There is... if he will not simply cooperate with an investigation. 
    There are some prisoners who we would like to depose, if they're not available simply through investigation, but in terms of the other side, in terms of this specific claim, no. 
    I think the deposition of the defendant should be sufficient. 
    However, one of the issues we'd want to get into with her is the extent of her role in deciding which prisoners get transferred to Federal penitentiaries, because it... that relates to her belief that, well, if I send them to a Federal penitentiary they won't be entitled to any property, and I think that's an underlying factor that we may want to look into. 
    And if that deposition develops specific lines of inquiry as to Government policy on that subject, then I think maybe a couple of other depositions would be warranted, but no, I do not believe extensive discovery would be required in this case for this claim. 
    Now, we do have a claim against D.C. which requires a custom, policy, and practice proof as well, and that's not before the Court now.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right, then how exactly, in your view, do you deal with the problem? 
    You may say there is no problem, but I take it, the problem, to be that many prisoners will file pieces of paper in Federal court that they call a complaint. 
    They won't be sent to the judge, actually. 
    They'll be sent to a magistrate, and the magistrate's normal inclination under notice pleading is, discovery is fine. 
    But here, they say that in these cases where motives are alleged, it's a great burden upon the prison official to have to sit at a deposition, and there's no real reason for it, so the first thing you'd want to do is require the prisoner to say what he's talking about in detail, but I guess we can't do that under the Federal rules.

    Mr. Daniel M. Schember 
    --Hold the plaintiff's discovery in abeyance and allow the defendant to do discovery.

    26. 
    Rule 26 enables the court to limit discovery to the needs of the case and to prevent undue burden, and that includes controlling the timing, the methods, and the means of discovery, and allowing the defendant to go first and holding the plaintiff's discovery in abeyance goes a long way to solving this problem.

   Argument of Walter A. Smith, Jr.
speaker="walter_a_smith_jr" startTime="1770.231" stopTime="1833.772">
    Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Petitioner's counsel has just said that in his view the gravament of his position is that there needn't be any special rules at all. 
    I think the Court has already decided in Harlow that there have to be, so I'd like to argue two points to you. 
    First, that in wrongful intent cases such as this there needs to be some kind of heightened standard applied to protect public officials with regard to determining whether they had a wrongful intent or not, because if you don't have some kind of special heightened standard the result is going to be, in nearly all of these cases, we're going to put public officials through discovery, past summary judgment, and into trial, and that will cause all of the harm to effective government and all of the harm to the public interest that this Court in Harlow designed a rule to prohibit, and I think he's quite wrong to say that we can simply rely on the normal rules to take care of the case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1833.772" stopTime="1844.019">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But isn't it true that Harlow dealt with the special problem of qualified immunity, and your position in this case, even if there's no qualified immunity defense interposed, you'd still make the same arguments.
speaker="walter_a_smith_jr" startTime="1844.019" stopTime="1851.703">
    Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr. 
    Well, on the merits we would, but since we did interpose qualified immunity, Your Honor, there are two parts to the qualified immunity.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1851.703" stopTime="1863.791">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But it seems to me the case really is about the merits, because if the defendant here did what was alleged, there really isn't a basis for qualified immunity. 
    On the other hand, if the defendant is correct, there's no cause of action.

    Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr. 
    I guess I disagree with that, Your Honor. 
    I would say this case is about whether or not Ms. Britton's assertion of good faith in the actions that she took is going to be upheld under the qualified immunity doctrine. 
    The Court said there are two--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1877.981" stopTime="1879.553">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But if she's in good faith there's no cause of action.
speaker="walter_a_smith_jr" startTime="1879.553" stopTime="1888.198">
    Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr. 
    --Well, but the Court said there are two parts to the good faith immunity. 
    One is what the Court called objective. 
    The other is what the Court called subjective, and in Harlow--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1888.198" stopTime="1898.223">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I understand that, but do you not agree that if she acted in good faith and did not have the motive that the plaintiff describes, there's no cause of action at all. 
    She doesn't need an affirmative defense.
speaker="walter_a_smith_jr" startTime="1898.223" stopTime="1914.636">
    Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr. 
    --That is true. 
    That is true, but good faith immunity is called, I think, Your Honor, good faith immunity precisely because it's designed to assure public officials that if they act in good faith, as Harlow said, cases against them will be promptly dismissed, according to--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1914.636" stopTime="1928.374">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, I don't think that's right. 
    In Harlow it's even if they acted in bad faith and for malice and all these other bad motives, if the right wasn't clearly established at the time, the plaintiff still loses. 
    It's not a question of subjective good faith. 
    It's a question of the state of the law at the time of the conduct.

    Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr.

    I'd like to respond to something Justice Scalia said, though. 
    He said that in Harlow we had found a mechanism for making sure we didn't have to have an inquiry into the knowledge part. 
    What we now need to find is a mechanism to make sure that we don't have subjective inquiries into the intent part, because that can do just as much damage to the purposes of the Harlow decision as inquiries into the knowledge of the law.

    But it isn't an intent part and a knowledge part. 
    There are two discrete kinds of wrongful acts. 
    In the Harlow thing it was a question of whether the law had been violated and the Court's answer was, there's qualified immunity unless that law was clearly established. 
    Now, here, there isn't any question that if the motive that's alleged exists, what was done was terribly unlawful, so the two... you can't just mix them together and say they're all part of the same kind of tortious conduct. 
    One is, did I act in violation of the law, and the other is, what was in my head, because if one thing was in my head, then I acted in violation of the law, if another thing was, I didn't, so they're two different kinds of torts.

    They are two different things, Your Honor, but I would try to argue to you they're both part of the good faith immunity, and before Harlow the Court said there were two parts to the inquiry, one that the Court called subjective, and one that the Court called objective, but they both had to do with the state of the mind of the official. 
    One is the knowledge of the law in the mind of the official, the other is whether or not there's improper intent.

    I'm trying to make it part of the qualified immunity inquiry and find a way to assure that the qualified immunity will be given to the official without having to go through discovery and trial, and my point is that if you don't have some kind of what Justice Scalia was calling a special mechanism, nearly every one of these cases where improper intent is alleged is going to have to go through discovery and trial, bringing about all of the harm that Harlow was designed to prohibit. 
    That's the point that I'm trying to make, and we need to find, again to use Justice Scalia's words, I think a mechanism for assuring that what the Court said in Harlow should not occur... a subjective inquiry... will not occur here either. 
    We must find a way to assure public officials that when they act in good faith in their positions, insubstantial claims against them will be promptly dismissed.

    Do you have any factual evidence in the record to that effect?

    We have an explosion of cases in this area. 
    Almost half of them are prisoner cases, and nearly all of them are ultimately determined to be nonmeritorious, but you can always allege improper intent in such cases and, under the rules that we now have, you can almost always get through in discovery and trial in such cases.

    Suppose you said that, first, when the prisoner files a claim which you can't really understand, which very often happens, that the official who's being sued can ask for a reply, and that reply at the judge's or magistrate's discretion can describe in detail what he knows and what he's talking about. 
    Then the second thing is, having obtained that, the official can move for summary judgment under 56, at which point discovery will not take place unless the judge decides under 56(f) that justice so requires, et cetera, using the standard of 56(f), and we could say, you have to be very careful where motive is alleged. 
    Anyone can allege it. 
    There are, you know, all these considerations that you're concerned about.

    That's--
speaker="walter_a_smith_jr" startTime="2606.635" stopTime="2756.134">
    Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr. 
    My view... my view, Your Honor, would be two things. 
    First of all, thousands of cases puts quite a burden on the district courts, but the more important point, I think, is that the policy consideration that drove Harlow was that if you permit cases like this to proceed, you will dampen the ardor of public officials. 
    Unless public officials are certain that these insubstantial suits are going to be promptly dismissed before discovery and trial, the risk is great, the Harlow court said, that these public officials are not going to be unflinching in their duties, and at a given prison, it would only take one such claim to do that kind of harm. 
    Just let one of these cases linger and occupy the time of a public official, challenging what I still want to call their good faith, just one of them can dampen their ardor with regard to other situations. 
    They will be afraid to take action that might engender another lawsuit, and we would submit that is the core of Harlow, and it is why some kind of special rule needs to be applied. 
    I haven't talked yet about clear and convincing. 
    Obviously, you have to first be persuaded that some kind of heightened standard is needed in order to address the problem. 
    I would like just to take the last few moments, with the Court's permission, to tick off what I think are four reasons why clear and convincing is the right kind of heightened standard to use in these cases. 
    First of all, and this will be abbreviated, as Judge Williams said in his opinion, this is a situation where we had asymmetry in the risk of error. 
    That is to say, the Court has already determined in Harlow itself that some meritorious cases must be turned away in order to serve the greater good of ensuring that insubstantial cases will be promptly dismissed, and it's in an asymmetry of error situation the Court has often adopted clear and convincing. 
    His second reason was that this is a case where, just to use his words, motive is easy to allege and hard to disprove. 
    That, too, suggests that we need a benefit of the doubt for public officials, and that's a point the Court made in Harlow itself, where it said at page 814, note 23, dishonest or vindictive motives are readily attributed and as readily believed, actually raising the specter that we may have public officials who are completely innocent of the charge but would be found guilty because of the tenuousness of the kind of evidence we're dealing with.

    Could I mention the other two reasons, though? 
    One is that I think you've done this in analogous situations, not only in the civil fraud context, but I think New York Times may be the best analogy. 
    There, in order to protect the public's great interest in uninhibited public debate, you adopt a clear and convincing standard. 
    So, too, I would suggest, to serve the public interest in having uninhibited public official decisionmaking, it's important to adopt the clear and convincing--

    Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr. 
    --No, the Court in Woodby, Your Honor, referred to various different situations where courts have, in a civil fraud context, adopted a clear and convincing test. 
    And the fourth one I'd like to mention is the presumption of regularity, which the Court noted as long ago as the United States v. Chemical case and reaffirmed in Armstrong, which is, there should be a presumption of regularity to validate decisions of public officials in the absence... and this was the key phrase, I think... in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary. 
    It seems to me that, too, supports the view that clear and convincing is the right kind of heightened standard to use here, although I'll say in response to something Justice Breyer said our primary point is that something has to be done to assure public officials that these insubstantial claims will not put them through discovery and trial. 
    We think clear and convincing is the best choice.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, we know he's subject to suit, but I mean, how do we... do you have an empirical basis for telling us how much deserves to be weeded out but is not being weeded out under the law as it now stands?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="2990.917" stopTime="3003.515">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --I think the statistics provide a partial answer here, and the statistics I'll cite from are the Bureau of Justice statistics that are prepared in a monograph that they have made publicly available called Prisoner Petitions in the Federal Courts. 
    That--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Are those in your brief or an appendix--
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3006.426" stopTime="3017.324">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --No, it's not. 
    Unfortunately it is not, but generally the statistics are also available from the administrative office of the courts, and they indicate that for prisoner petitions approximately 40,000 prisoner petitions are filed each year.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3017.324" stopTime="3018.345">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --State and Federal?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3018.345" stopTime="3020.095">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Federal and State cases--

    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes.
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3020.726" stopTime="3031.873">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --involving civil rights claims. 
    Of those cases, about 60 percent are weeded out at the pleadings stage, but that still leaves 16,000 cases which require some additional treatment of one kind or another.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3031.873" stopTime="3035.757">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But do you know how many of those are based on unconstitutional motive?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3035.757" stopTime="3056.089">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    No. 
    That is one bit of evidence that we do not know. 
    What we do know from the evidence that's provided by the Bureau of Justice statistics is that about 40 percent of these cases arise from either disciplinary actions or claims of inadequate medical treatment, or claims of protection of personal security, all types of cases that could, in fact, involve a claim of impermissible motive.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3056.089" stopTime="3069.857">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But even among them I take it your statistics don't give us a way to estimate the number of cases that should not be weeded out at the summary judgment stage even though they are not unsuccessful.
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3069.857" stopTime="3070.598">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    That is--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3070.598" stopTime="3074.041">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    As distinct from those that should be and are also ultimately unsuccessful.

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --We simply do not have information on that, but we do have, as an example, this case here, and this is a case that I think that many people would say is... presents an insubstantial claim.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3083.828" stopTime="3111.665">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    This rule might-- 
    --this case... I have no idea about this case, but why shouldn't we say, look, the Department of Justice has whole groups of people whose job it is to collect statistics. 
    You're asking us to create a special rule that would undoubtedly inevitably cut off some good claims, and therefore if you want us to create a special rule to deal with a special situation of harassment to public officials for claims that are not good, why doesn't the Department have the burden of coming in with the statistics that show it's a real problem?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3111.665" stopTime="3115.348">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Well, I think the statistics that we have presented do suggest that there's a--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3115.348" stopTime="3115.799">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, all I know--
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3115.799" stopTime="3116.199">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --problem here.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3116.199" stopTime="3146.119">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --from the statistics is that there are a lot of cases and 60 percent get weeded out, and it doesn't seem like that much compared to the number of prisoners, then somebody else might say the same, and we don't know how many deal with the motive, and we don't know whether the best way is to have a higher proof on the substance, or whether it's better to get simply more elaborate pleadings, or whether it's better to have special ways of enforcing discovery requirements... I mean, there are many, many ways of dealing with it, if it's a problem. 
    Mr. Minear, did the Court require some special research and statistics before it decided Harlow?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3146.119" stopTime="3148.630">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    No, the Court did not, and in fact--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3148.630" stopTime="3150.791">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Or in Miranda? 
    [Laughter]
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3150.791" stopTime="3160.829">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --No, it did not, and again, I think the statistics we have here are helpful, but ultimately the decision rests with you, and I think the decision has to be drawn from the principles that you developed in Harlow.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3160.829" stopTime="3167.821">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But Mr. Minear, like respondent's counsel you are not proposing a rule that is limited to prison petitions, are you?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3167.821" stopTime="3168.843">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    No, we are not.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3168.843" stopTime="3176.287">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So even if we had all those statistics, they wouldn't show us the bottom line that we have to know, would they?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3176.287" stopTime="3179.188">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    No, they don't, and I think ultimately this requires the exercise of judgment.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3179.188" stopTime="3187.466">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You're also not proposing a rule that's limited to the qualified immunity defense. 
    You're proposing a rule that covers all unconstitutional motive affirmative claims.
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3187.466" stopTime="3196.740">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    No, I do disagree with you there, Justice Stevens. 
    What we're proposing here is a limitation on, or an application of qualified immunity to the motivation--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3196.740" stopTime="3210.730">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What if the trial judge in this case said, the law was perfectly clear at the time of action, so no matter what happens there's no qualified immunity, but nevertheless I'm concerned about the very problem you're all discussing here? 
    Would they have just said, well, since the qualified immunity defense isn't available, well, just too bad?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3210.730" stopTime="3258.530">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --Well, we do think that this rule ought to be applied as part of the qualified immunity defense, and let me explain how that would work, and I think the easiest way to focus on this is to imagine a case that's... in which the jury is being instructed... let's suppose we've gotten past summary judgment. 
    The jury will be instructed that the plaintiff has to come forward and prove his constitutional claim and then the jury will be instructed, if you find that that claim is proved by a preponderance of the evidence, then you must consider the defendant's qualified immunity defense and, accepting your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, that the... there's a clearly established rule, what we're asking, that there be an additional instruction that the jury be told that you must find that there was a firm basis for believing that the officer had an improper intent. 
    Now, we're suggesting, of course, that this same standard should apply at the summary judgment stage as well, and we think the reason why it's justified--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3258.530" stopTime="3263.825">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Wouldn't there have had to have been a firm basis for believing they had the intent if the... in order for the plaintiff to make out the affirmative case?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3263.825" stopTime="3273.072">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --No. 
    That is the difference with the clear and convincing standard. 
    Clear and convincing evidence is evidence sufficient to give the jury a firm belief of an improper motive.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3273.072" stopTime="3287.894">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That's very good as well as a charge to the jury, Mr. Minear, but how does a judge on a summary judgment stage... is there some way he can distinguish between a claim that is supported by a preponderance of the evidence but not by clear and convincing evidence?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3287.894" stopTime="3347.981">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Yes, we think that he can, and he has to ask the same question. 
    He applies that standard of proof that... the clear and convincing standard in determining the summary judgment motion, much as took place in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, where he looks at the factual question through the prism of the appropriate standard, and that is what we're suggesting is appropriate here. 
    And that standard is necessary, we submit, because otherwise there will always be these types of claims in which improper motive can be alleged based merely on inference and, because the judge must credit the inferences in favor of a nonmoving party, these cases will go on and be subjected to a jury trial even though it's very unlikely that they will proceed, or that they will produce a verdict, and that is something that we do have statistics on. 
    We do know that only 1 percent of the criminal... of the prisoner petition cases ultimately result in court-ordered relief for the prisoner out of the 40,000 cases that the district courts are charged with handling, and that seems to me that is significant. 
    It does indicate to us that there is a need for additional winnowing--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3347.981" stopTime="3351.244">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But do those statistics tell us how many of those cases actually went to trial?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3351.244" stopTime="3354.056">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --Yes, they do tell us how many of those cases went to trial.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3354.056" stopTime="3354.627">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And how many?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3354.627" stopTime="3357.047">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Roughly about 3 percent of the cases--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3357.047" stopTime="3360.771">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    About 3 percent, so that's really the universe we're most concerned about, the 3 percent.
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3360.771" stopTime="3378.442">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --Yes, and what we're concerned about also... not just the 3 percent. 
    I take that back. 
    We're also concerned about those cases in which there's extensive discovery where a motion for summary judgment is ultimately granted after the plaintiff has conducted deposition after deposition and the court concludes that in fact there is not sufficient factual evidence to support the claim.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3378.442" stopTime="3391.269">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why just... just don't allow those depositions, as opposing counsel suggests? 
    Only allow the Government to... Government defendant to depose. 
    Don't allow the plaintiff.
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3391.269" stopTime="3421.299">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Well, we think that in fact Justice Ginsburg in the court of appeals has suggested an appropriate approach with regard to discovery, and as a separate matter he has suggested that discovery should not go forward unless it's likely to produce sufficient evidence to achieve the desired result at trial. 
    In other words, the plaintiff has to produce some evidence of an improper motive and, in addition, must show that there's a reasonable likelihood that he can produce evidence through discovery that will--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3421.299" stopTime="3424.083">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How does he know what he can produce through discovery until he has it?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3424.083" stopTime="3468.700">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --Well, this is the same type of balancing determination that a court always has to make under Rule 26(b)(2)(3). 
    There's always a question of the burdens and benefits of discovery, and the benefits of discovery is the likelihood of the evidence being produced. 
    The plaintiff is obligated when he submits his Rule 56(f) affidavit to indicate what his basis for believing is that this discovery will be fruitful, so in fact the district judge will have a basis to make that determination. 
    He will be able to look at what the plaintiff is suggesting he will obtain on discovery, and he can make a reasoned judgment of whether or not he's likely to obtain the evidence he thinks he will receive. 
    In a case such as this, I think it's quite clear that the intended deposition of Ms. Britton is unlikely to produce anything more than what her deposition states, namely that she did this for a proper purpose.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3468.700" stopTime="3469.822">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You mean her affidavit?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="3469.822" stopTime="3529.762">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Her affidavit that she had prepared in an earlier stage of this proceeding. 
    And with regard to that, I'd also like to note that in this case the... it's very easy to make factual allegations along the way. 
    If you look to what the fourth amended complaint actually states in this case on page 185 of the petition, it indicates that the plaintiff himself indicates that Ms. Britton was acting in order to protect the prisoner's property. 
    He made that allegation in his complaint. 
    What we find is that the facts, the factual allegations change as the case moves forward. 
    Ultimately, that takes me back to my point with regard to restrictions on discovery. 
    We do think that it's appropriate not only to have a clear and convincing standard here, but also to require that there be limitations on discovery to ensure that that discovery is limited and narrowed to that... to those areas that are in fact of vital importance in proving the plaintiff's case. 
    Now, there's also been some suggestion in the questions from the Court about your authority... I see my time has expired.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3529.762" stopTime="3531.972">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Minear. 
    The case is submitted.
