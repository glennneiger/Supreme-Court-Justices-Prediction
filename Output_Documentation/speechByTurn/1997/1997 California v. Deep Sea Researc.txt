    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1400, California and State Lands Commission v. the Deep Sea Research, Inc.-- 
    Mr. Rusconi.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="64.414" stopTime="133.828">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The action below was one in rem by a private party to try title as against all the world and for exclusive salvage rights to a vessel lying upon the sovereign submerged lands of the State of California. 
    In this situation, California claims title and rights to salvage over that same vessel, and the Eleventh Amendment prevents the adjudication of California's interests in this case without its consent. 
    Under this Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, the guiding principle in these cases is the effect of the relief requested on the State. 
    This conclusion is not dependent upon formalisms or upon the manipulation of captions or pleadings. 
    Had this suit been in personam against the State under the same circumstances there is no doubt that the suit would have been barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and this result cannot be changed by the substitution of the vessel as defendant for the State of California.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="133.828" stopTime="136.500">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, there's really no such thing as an in rem action, then.

    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    No, that's--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="137.822" stopTime="146.246">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I mean, you cannot possibly adjudicate the rights to a particular piece of property. 
    You always have at least 50 claimants--

    --Justice Scalia--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="147.899" stopTime="152.872">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --who can come in and say, no, it's really mine, and this adjudication was for naught.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="152.872" stopTime="161.988">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --Justice Scalia, all we're asking in this case is that the State be dismissed. 
    Now, they can move forward in this with an in rem judgment against the rest of the world.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="161.988" stopTime="187.342">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Then it's not an in rem judgment. 
    The whole point, historically, of an in rem judgment in these admiralty actions is that it binds the world, and it seems to me that the implication of what you're saying here is, a State is always part of the world and, therefore, in any admiralty in rem action a State could come forward and say, got to dismiss it, Eleventh Amendment, can't bind me.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="187.342" stopTime="197.310">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    Justice Souter, I believe that is what we are saying. 
    However, the practical effect of that, States are not going to run around willy nilly and make these type of claims.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="197.310" stopTime="215.641">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    And isn't the reason that they're not... isn't the reason that you're not going to file this kind of an objection on, let's say, an East Coast salvage case is that there is no colorable basis, in your mind or anybody else's, for your doing so, for your having a claim that might be cut off and therefore in fact adjudicated by the in rem action?
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="215.641" stopTime="217.945">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    That will be the practical effect, yes.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="217.945" stopTime="296.925">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    All right. 
    Then what would be wrong with a rule, and maybe it would be a softer rule than the circuit applied here, which says you have at least got to come forward and make a sufficient showing that you are within the class of those whose interests might, in fact, be adjudicated here? 
    You've done that, in fact, in part by what you've done so far. 
    After all, in this case the original in rem process describes the location, so you said, look, we're within the class of those geographically that might be affected, and what would be wrong with carrying that one step further and simply saying, all right, make an equally colorable showing that you're also within the class as defined by other criteria, abandonment, embeddedness, historic register? 
    It doesn't mean... this rule would not mean that you have ultimately to prove your entitlement, but it would mean that you've got to make a showing that there is a practical reason for stopping this in rem proceeding, and the reason, the justification for that is to avoid the absurd situation in which, simply by claiming that you're part of the world, you could defeat any in rem proceeding. 
    What would be wrong with that rule?
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="296.925" stopTime="307.951">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    Justice Souter, the problem with that rule is that by inquiring into the location, inquiring into the issues that you mentioned, you're adjudicating the merits of the claim.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="307.951" stopTime="356.604">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, I'm simply... my suggestion was that you've at least got to come forward with a basis for saying, yes, there is a reasonable basis for saying that State interests are involved here, as distinct from the case that would occur if the wreck were beyond the 3-mile limit, or the wreck were in the Gulf of Mexico, or in Europe. 
    And I'm not suggesting that there needs to be a final adjudication, but I'm suggesting that in order to preserve the value of in rem actions there at least ought to be a sufficient showing for the court... from which the court could conclude that you or your State has a serious interest implicated here that justifies recognizing your Eleventh Amendment claim and, in effect, defeating the Federal in rem action, that's all.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="356.604" stopTime="369.024">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    I understand, Justice Souter, but I do not see as a practical matter how this inquiry that you're talking about about preliminary matters cannot but implicate a question on the merits, and this is what--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="369.024" stopTime="381.132">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Oh, it implicates it, but it doesn't determine it. 
    In other words, you've got to come forward with some evidence. 
    That's a very different thing from saying that you've got to, in effect, present a full case and prevail.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="381.132" stopTime="394.057">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --We think that the... the State of California thinks that the broad concept of sovereign immunity in the Eleventh Amendment means that even the type of preliminary inquiry that you're asking for is forbidden. 
    Now, when a State--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="394.057" stopTime="425.909">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I think I might agree with that, and then suggest that perhaps the Eleventh Amendment doesn't apply at all to an in rem action where the res is not in the custody, the actual custody of the State. 
    If you don't accept Justice Souter's lifeline it seems to me that this shows that perhaps the in... the utility of in rem actions is substantially destroyed by your position.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="425.909" stopTime="441.659">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --Well, Your Honor, we don't think we're destroying the utility of in rem actions. 
    There has... this... there has not been a history of States making unsubstantiated claims based on the Eleventh Amendment, and it's certainly not the case in this case.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="441.659" stopTime="459.602">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but there is some indication, isn't there, that when the Framers were drafting the Constitution and when the Eleventh Amendment was adopted that it was thought that certain types of suits in admiralty weren't covered by the Eleventh Amendment at all.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="459.602" stopTime="461.322">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    I--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="461.322" stopTime="474.581">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The prize cases, for example... and very possibly in rem cases of this type, where the State isn't in possession, as such, of the property.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="474.581" stopTime="505.822">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --Your Honor, since the early cases, which we do not believe stand for the citation by the other parties in this case, those cases did not involve in rem actions at all, or possession was not central to the holding. 
    In this case, title is being... is going to be adjudicated against the State in this in rem action. 
    In this case, its regulatory authority has been infringed by the orders of the district court, as--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="505.822" stopTime="523.312">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Rusconi, your opponents cite the old Peters case from this Court as standing for the proposition that a Federal court can adjudicate an action so long as the property is not in the possession of the State. 
    Now, do you disagree with that reading of Peters?
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="523.312" stopTime="554.484">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --Yes, we do. 
    That case was not an in rem action. 
    That case was an in personam action by rival claimants against the executrices of the estate of the ex State Treasurer. 
    Now, in that case, when you look at Justice Marshall's quote about the State not being able to sit back and then destroy this ongoing action, that makes sense. 
    Normal principles of estoppel would not bind the State on a judgment in an in personam case when they're not named, and so there's no problem.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="554.484" stopTime="575.318">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    What's your answer to The Davis? 
    As I recall, you said in your brief, well, Davis isn't on point, or... here because the title was not involved, but the question is the Eleventh Amendment applicability, and I would suppose that there's an Eleventh Amendment violation or not an Eleventh Amendment violation regardless.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="575.318" stopTime="578.800">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    Well, yes, title was not involved in The Davis, and that involved--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="578.800" stopTime="579.960">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, why should that make a difference here?
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="579.960" stopTime="580.721">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --Because--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="580.721" stopTime="589.647">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Regardless of what's being adjudicated you're saying we have the right to an Eleventh Amendment immunity even though we weren't in possession and even though it is in rem.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="589.647" stopTime="602.533">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --That's correct. 
    In The Davis the title to the cargo was not at issue, and it also involved the sovereign immunity of the United States, so it's not an Eleventh Amendment immunity. 
    In this case we have--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="602.533" stopTime="620.105">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but if sovereign immunity of the United States would not have prevailed in that case, there's at least a pretty fair argument that it's unlikely that the concept of sovereign immunity recognized in the Eleventh Amendment for State purposes would, in fact, be somehow more powerful or broader. 
    I mean, I don't see that as a distinction.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="620.105" stopTime="629.552">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --Well, I believe that the cases have diverged on the Eleventh Amendment immunity that is given to the States versus the sovereign immunity of the United States.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="629.552" stopTime="633.795">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but do you take the position that State sovereign immunity in fact is broader than Federal sovereign immunity?

    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi

    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    I... but I also want to add that we're talking here about a vessel that is on the sovereign lands of the State of California, and whose title is being tried, and whose... the State is not making a bound... a baseless claim in this case, and the recent jurisprudence of this Court--

    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --Perhaps I misunderstand your question. 
    Not all property within our jurisdiction is the sovereign lands of the State of California.

    You have greater sovereignty over the sea bed than you have over the dry land in California?
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="713.708" stopTime="730.507">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    It is held subject to a public trust, a unique trust that all sovereign lands in the State of California are held that are not held, say, on proprietary lands, which may be sold, whereas sovereign lands, it takes a unique statutory scheme to get rid of them.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't understand. 
    Well-- 
    --I don't know where the sovereign lands argument takes you, because if... to the extent that you're going to rely on sovereign lands rather than Eleventh Amendment immunity, period, it seems to mean you're open to the argument that the reason you've got those lands is that the Congress of the United States gave them to you, and if you're going to take the benefit of those lands, presumably it would be fair to say you ought to take them subject to the burden of taking them without destroying the utility of in rem actions.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="762.719" stopTime="768.842">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    This is a difficult case, Justice Souter. 
    However, just last term in the Coeur D'Alene case the Court was very--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="768.842" stopTime="781.312">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, is my... I... Coeur D'Alene is fine, but I mean, is there something wrong with the, kind of the equity argument that I just made that if you're going to depend on sovereign lands I think you've got to take the burden as well as the benefit?
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="781.312" stopTime="784.834">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --I don't see what the burden is here.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="784.834" stopTime="821.727">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    The burden is that you are going to be subject to some incidents of in rem jurisdiction. 
    Maybe that incident is that you're going to lose your title, and you don't have an Eleventh Amendment claim if you're not in possession. 
    Maybe that incident is that you're going to have to make at least a colorable showing that you are in a position at least to claim an interest subject to Eleventh Amendment protection. 
    But whatever the burden is, the argument is that you got the sovereign lands from the United States, they weren't your historical entitlement, and you ought to take them subject to this burden.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="821.727" stopTime="837.728">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    A couple of things. 
    Yes, but we did not get them under the equal footing doctrine, but why should we be treated any differently by the fact that the lands were conveyed by the Submerged Lands Act when they're adjacent to lands given under the equal footing doctrine?
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="837.728" stopTime="851.457">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, the reason is that you got this boon out of Congress in 1953, and presumably Congress did not intend to destroy the utility of in rem admiralty actions in the course of doing it. 
    That's the answer.
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="851.457" stopTime="860.553">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    I understand your argument, Justice Souter, but California believes that its title and its regulatory authority transcend questions such as possession.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="860.553" stopTime="878.514">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I interrupt you with just one question there? 
    I understand the Ninth Circuit... because they wrote the opinion, but is it not correct that the issues of title and regulatory authority really are quite different, that it might well be true that the in rem action would bind you as to title, but not necessarily as to regulatory control?
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="878.514" stopTime="896.707">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    They are different actions. 
    However, both of those impact the sovereignty of the State of California in that this... the title question goes right to... it's as if our Treasury was being invaded. 
    It is that invasive. 
    To decide that a piece of property does not belong to the State--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="896.707" stopTime="902.761">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but all I'm saying is, is it not... would you not agree that you might lose on the title argument and still win on the regulatory argument?

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Okay. 
    Just want to be-- 
    --I am just curious about the practical effects of this. 
    What is supposed to happen in respect to all of the ships or other pieces of property that for the last 200 years admiralty courts have adjudicated the title of in rem? 
    Are all of those adjudications, past, present, and future, now not final because any one of 50 sovereigns can say, we weren't bound? 
    And my related question is, what's supposed to happen in bankruptcy proceedings, another instance, I take it, where every day courts decide who owns property as of against the world? 
    Are now all those property decisions up for grabs? 
    What do title insurance companies do or say?
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="943.688" stopTime="949.422">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    First question, theoretically yes, but again, I don't see the practical implication of--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="949.422" stopTime="960.587">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Title companies... I'm interested in that because, of course, the title insurance companies often raise rates a lot when there's just a theoretical objection, so I'm quite interested. 
    I don't want to stop you. 
    I want to encourage you to--

    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --The... I'm not an expert in marine title insurance law. 
    However, the practical effects of the application of the rule that we're asking I think, or the State thinks it will be very minimal. 
    Now, as to bankruptcy, the type of claim which is made in bankruptcy under 106 is something that is almost reduced to money. 
    It's a money debt that is owed, and California acknowledges that in bankruptcy if we do not file a proof of claim under operation of law that debt will be discharged as to the State of California, but a suit to quiet title is an entirely different matter. 
    It is--

    What... why?
speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="1006.539" stopTime="1028.742">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --Because an... a suit to quiet title is an adjudication of a State's right. 
    Under bankruptcy, there is no adjudication. 
    It is by operation of law that the claim is discharged. 
    It's not an adjudication that it's a bad... it's... that there was no debt, or that the debt exists. 
    It is just a simple congressional enactment that unless you file a claim it's discharged, and that is--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We're talking here about an in rem action in admiralty which I think has long had special characteristics that might not carry over to bankruptcy or to a quiet title action.

    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi

speaker="joseph_c_rusconi" startTime="1074.213" stopTime="1084.889">
    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    What I'm saying is... yes, that the... the functional equivalent of the admiralty action is a direct quiet title action against the State.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1084.889" stopTime="1102.991">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, but the difference, traditionally, is that the in rem action adjudicates title against the world. 
    In a quiet title action, you have to join all the possible defendants, and then you get a quiet title action only as to them, unless you're dealing with some... the Massachusetts title system, which doesn't prevail in most places.

    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi

    The effect is that it forecloses the State of California.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, you can intervene in the case if you want to. 
    I mean, it's not as if you're prevented from making California's claim. 
    All that you're prevented from doing is saying... is sitting back and saying you've adjudicated title against all the rest of the world but not against us, and you say the Eleventh Amendment entitles you to do that.

    Mr. Joseph C. Rusconi 
    --Correct, we do, and as a practical matter States are not going to sit back. 
    They're going to bring actions in their own courts, where these actions belong. 
    I... we don't see it as a crippling interference to require that one action against the rest of the world be in Federal court and the other action against the State be in the State court.

speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="1482.692" stopTime="1529.244">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Although we agree with petitioners that the courts below misconstrued the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, we disagree with them that the Eleventh Amendment applies because this is not a suit against the State. 
    The State was not a named party, and the coercive process of the Federal court is not necessary to dispossess State agents of property. 
    The filing of a claim by a State in an admiralty in rem action does not transform that into a suit commenced or prosecuted against the State within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment. 
    Just like in a bankruptcy proceeding, if a State is a creditor the filing of a claim by the State does not transform a bankruptcy action into a suit proscribed by the Eleventh Amendment.

    The ASA--

    So cases under the ASA are within the admiralty jurisdiction of the--
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="1543.283" stopTime="1595.756">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --No. 
    What happens is in this case the process, the admiralty process brought this case, this vessel within the admiralty jurisdiction of the court. 
    At that point, when the court exercises in rem jurisdiction it has to decide among the competing claimants who owns what. 
    The Abandoned Shipwreck Act says that if the statutory requisites are met, the United States assumes title and transfers it to the State, and at that point the ASA divests the Federal court of admiralty jurisdiction with respect to that property that falls within the requisites of the Abandoned Shipwreck Act. 
    So at the initiation of the proceeding the court has admiralty jurisdiction, but if it is found that the ASA applies to a part of the wreck, or maybe the whole wreck, at that point the court no longer has admiralty jurisdiction.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1595.756" stopTime="1621.195">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --Does that mean the Eleventh Amendment objection of the State then becomes active, whereas... and a problem, whereas before we could have displaced it by saying that historically in rem admiralty jurisdiction is sufficient to bind the State, but once we're in... within the Federal question jurisdiction the State then makes the argument that the Eleventh Amendment sort of springs back into play?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="1621.195" stopTime="1648.000">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    That becomes a much more difficult proposition, Justice Kennedy, because what happens in practical effect is that once the State owns it by operation of the Abandoned Shipwreck Act there are other consequences that might flow from admiralty courts' orders, and it might be appropriate at that point for the State to say that the perpetuation and continuation of the suit is in effect an action against the State.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1648.000" stopTime="1657.177">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Frederick, do you agree that if the... if this property were in the possession of the State that the Eleventh Amendment would prevent an in rem adjudication of title?
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="1657.177" stopTime="1706.000">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Yes. 
    This Court's precedents historically with respect to foreign sovereigns, States, and the United States make clear that the immunity of the sovereign turns on whether its agents are in actual possession or custody of the property that's being adjudicated, and there were several practical reasons for that. 
    The first was that courts recognized that they could not issue coercive process against a sovereign's agents to dispossess those agents and create a conflict between the court and the sovereign's agents. 
    There was also the practical reality that if the property wasn't in the possession of the sovereign's agents it likely was not doing the sovereign's work, and so there was a recognition that, as Chief Justice Waite stated while riding on circuit, that the mere fact that a sovereign claims title to property doesn't make the property part of the sovereignty.

    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    No.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    --Respondent's counsel is better positioned to know what its officials and representatives are doing than I am, but what the district court did here, Justice O'Connor, was to draw a circle basically and to say that the shipwreck is somewhere within that circle, and allow the salvage to proceed. 
    Before turning to abandonment I do want to address just one point, and that's the sovereignty interests of the State here in terms of regulatory authority. 
    The State did not appeal the district court's order with respect to an infringement upon its regulatory authority over salvage, so that question is not properly presented in the questions upon which this Court granted certiorari. 
    Moreover, it's clear here that Federal interests might supplant State sovereignty interests if shipwrecks are in certain places. 
    There was... is an express preservation of rights in the Abandoned Shipwreck Act so that if the Brother Jonathan had sunk below the current site of the Golden Gate Bridge, for instance, and the Army Corps of Engineers needed to clear it out for navigation and national defense purposes, there would be no question that the United States could do that.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Frederick, I'm just curious about where the Government saw the light, because you made a rather strong argument in the Ninth Circuit that the Eleventh Amendment does apply, and that... and now you've switched positions on that.
speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="1829.309" stopTime="1864.553">
    Mr. David C. Frederick 
    Justice Ginsburg, when the Court granted certiorari in this case we carefully examined the requisites of immunity and when immunity is appropriate in in rem actions, and the courts since the Treasure Salvors case have been in confusion over whether or not a colorable claim needs to be asserted. 
    We concluded that that is not a helpful way of analyzing an immunity question when the sovereign is not in actual possession of the property, because this Court's cases uniformly say that when the sovereign is not in possession the colorable claim analysis is really out of the equation.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1864.553" stopTime="1867.795">

    No. 
    What we're saying is that Treasure Salvors is what Treasure Salvors is. 
    The State agents had possession of property there. 
    They do not here, and it is a much simpler case when State agents do not have possession of property that is subject to the in rem jurisdiction of the court.

   Argument of Fletcher C. Alford
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2056.150" stopTime="2114.488">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I think it's quite clear that this case is properly before the admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal court. 
    Indeed, the Federal admiralty court is the only court where such an action could have been brought. 
    This Court has consistently held that admiralty in rem actions against shipwrecked vessels are uniquely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, and this Court has never held that a sovereign, simply by asserting the claim of ownership to the res in the possession of the court divests the court of its constitutionally mandated exclusive jurisdiction. 
    Rather, this... a long line of this Court's jurisprudence stands for the proposition that only where the property is within the actual physical possession of the sovereign is the action at that point deemed to be an action against the sovereign itself. 
    Where the property is not in the actual possession of the sovereign, the rule is that the case may go forward and the sovereign, if it wishes to do so, may enter into the suit and assert a claim and prove that claim just like any other claimant in the world.

    You don't want to go the whole hog and say that in fact there simply is no Eleventh Amendment applicability to an admiralty in rem action?

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Your Honor, I do not think that is consistent with this Court's cases, and I certainly don't think it's necessary to decide this case. 
    I think it would be appropriate to decide this case on a narrower rule that--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2132.410" stopTime="2132.910">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    A possession rule.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2132.910" stopTime="2144.478">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --A possession rule, that's right, Your Honor, and the possession rule has been applied not only to States but also to foreign sovereigns and to the Federal Government and, you know, the question is, why should any different rule apply to the States?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2144.478" stopTime="2169.763">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What does the possession rule mean, strictly speaking? 
    Supposing there's a State marina with State water police boats in it, and there's an admiralty action brought against... to adjudicate title in one of those boats, but actually it isn't owned by the State, but it's in this State-owned marina. 
    Now, would that be in the possession of the State, or does it have to be actually owned by the State?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2169.763" stopTime="2180.341">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, I don't think possession and ownership necessarily have to be equated, Your Honor. 
    I think, if I understand Your Honor's hypothetical correctly, this is a situation where a slip in a State-owned marina is leased to a private party.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2180.341" stopTime="2180.762">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Right.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2180.762" stopTime="2189.896">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Then certainly in that case the private party would be deemed to be the one in possession of the boat that is in the slip that it has leased from the Government, but--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2189.896" stopTime="2214.002">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, can I just vary the Chief Justice's question a little? 
    It seems to me that under your rule it would be wise, if States want to get control of these abandoned vessels, or sunken vessels, as soon as they hear about it, send the local police out in the appropriate vessels and just take possession, and then let the litigation go forward. 
    Doesn't this... doesn't your rule encourage States to use self help in these situations?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2214.002" stopTime="2243.130">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --Well, Your Honor, no, I don't think so. 
    I think our rule encourages States to locate these wrecks if they want to exercise control over them, and I think that's certainly the purpose of the Abandoned Shipwreck also, which was to encourage States to locate these wrecks and, indeed, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act requires States to give public notice of the location of wrecks to which it claims title under the ASA, so I think this encourages States, if they really want to exercise dominion over these wrecks, to at least locate them. 
    That's a fundamental threshold issue, and--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2243.130" stopTime="2253.168">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But if they had located them, and had sent a diver down affixing a sign saying, claimed by the State, that would be enough for the possession rule, would it?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2253.168" stopTime="2277.114">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --Well, Your Honor, I think so. 
    In the Navemar, for instance, in a foreign sovereign immunities context, this Court defined actual possession as some act of physical dominion or control, so at a threshold, certainly the State would need to know where the wreck is located. 
    I mean, it's absurd to say that the State has possession of something and it doesn't even know where it's at, it can't find it, so that has to be a threshold issue.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2277.114" stopTime="2283.860">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, maybe it doesn't have to send a diver down. 
    It could just go and drop a big rock. 
    I mean, get right above it and drop a big rock that says the State owns this. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2283.860" stopTime="2288.511">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, Your Honor, there has to be some act of physical dominion and control.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2288.511" stopTime="2299.248">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I mean, the rock hits the... it lands right on the deck. 
    [Laughter] 
    That's physical. 
    What about putting a buoy, as divers often do. 
    Yes. 
    Putting a buoy on the surface, above where the wreck is.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2299.248" stopTime="2311.107">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Your Honor, I do think that would be sufficient. 
    If the State knew where the wreck was located and marked it as State property, I think that would be sufficient, but that is... it's undisputed that that has not happened here.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2311.107" stopTime="2316.919">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, you're not talking about possession, then. 
    You're just simply... an assertion of ownership. 
    Is that the same thing as possession?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2316.919" stopTime="2318.211">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I think--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2318.211" stopTime="2320.462">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I thought possession and an assertion of ownership are two different things.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2320.462" stopTime="2329.408">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --They absolutely are, Your Honor, but taking physical... some act that shows physical dominion over the property I think is possession.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2329.408" stopTime="2333.871">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, why would posting a buoy above it be an act of possession?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2333.871" stopTime="2365.171">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, Your Honor, traditionally that's the way that it's indicated in the admiralty law with the case of sunken property. 
    For instance, a salvor, when it locates a shipwreck, often posts a buoy on the site and, in the traditional Federal admiralty law, when the court arrests sunken property it often puts a buoy on the site with the arrest papers on the buoy, so I think by analogy, if the State were to locate the wreck and mark the wreck with its sign in some way, then I think that would be possession.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2365.171" stopTime="2366.974">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Are you going to talk about the abandonment issue?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2366.974" stopTime="2397.002">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The State and the Federal Government suggest that there's some dispute or uncertainty about the definition of abandonment. 
    I disagree. 
    I think abandonment is a fundamental, well-known concept in the common law. 
    As Justice Scalia noted, it has to be some type of voluntary relinquishment of ownership to property. 
    If it's not a voluntary relinquishment, then it's a taking, so there has to be some indication of a voluntary relinquishment of title.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2397.002" stopTime="2421.040">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, can we infer a voluntary relinquishment simply on the basis of insufficient activity to pursue the claim? 
    In other words, I don't... I assume I don't have... one way to abandon would be to stand there and say, I wash my hands of it. 
    I want nothing more to do with it. 
    But another way, I suppose, would be simply to do nothing for too long a period of time in which the relinquishment would be inferred. 
    Do you agree there?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2421.040" stopTime="2436.299">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    I agree certainly, Your Honor, that abandonment can be inferred from the circumstances. 
    I do not agree that simply the passage of time without any kind of notice would be sufficient. 
    I think that would be a due process problem. 
    I think it would also be a takings problem. 
    For instance, in this case--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2436.299" stopTime="2444.695">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But you have it in your adverse possession all the time in real estate. 
    If somebody else gets on your land and stays there whatever the period of time is, you've lost it.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2444.695" stopTime="2459.285">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --That's true, Your Honor, but it's my understanding in those cases that the possession has to be open and notorious, such that it would give any claimant notice that another person is occupying the property, and that's certainly not the case here. 
    I think there's a fundamental distinction--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2459.285" stopTime="2461.115">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, except you know you've lost something.

    --You certainly know you've lost something, Your Honor, that's correct.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2463.936" stopTime="2473.532">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Under your rule, I... if there has to be some voluntary act relinquishing all claim of title, I suppose that no one would ever do that.

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, Your Honor--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2475.132" stopTime="2482.138">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    You'd teach a child when you're 3 years old, don't ever abandon that dollar in the steam grate, because some day it might be yours. 
    I'm not sure the law requires that.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2482.138" stopTime="2501.800">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --I agree with Your Honor. 
    I do not think the law requires any kind of explicit act, and I think the lower courts did not interpret the law in that manner, but in any event, it requires some evidence of a voluntary relinquishment of ownership. 
    It doesn't require an explicit statement, but some evidence of intent on the part of the original owner to relinquish ownership.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2501.800" stopTime="2547.144">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What about the Park Service that they quote in the amicus brief? 
    The Park Service in the House report say that you could indicate that intent in one of two ways at least. 
    There may be others. 
    But one way is that you never assert any control and, of course, there they couldn't do it. 
    The technology wasn't there. 
    And the other way was not otherwise indicating a claim, i.e., you didn't mark it. 
    And I guess, suppose 100 years passes and nobody says anything. 
    They don't have to get a submarine, but they could at least announce, you know, put a buoy up or do something, and if they don't have to do anything like that, how would we ever decide these cases? 
    There could be a million heirs. 
    You know, there could be 10 million heirs from the year 1520, each of which owns a nickel's worth of gold. 
    I mean, why don't you have to at least say that you want to keep it?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2547.144" stopTime="2554.517">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, Your Honor, there has to be some evidence that there is a relinquishment of ownership or, on the converse, there has to be some evidence.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2554.517" stopTime="2570.987">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The evidence is, they never marked it. 
    The evidence is, 130 years passed, and not only didn't they go there, which is understandable, but they never even said to anybody, even in their annual report, or even passing it down by family tradition, or even putting up a buoy or a flag, they did none of that.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2570.987" stopTime="2575.912">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, Your Honor, the problem is we don't know whether that's this case. 
    We simply don't know, and--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2575.912" stopTime="2587.510">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, so far as the standard is concerned, are you... are we trying to find a subjective state of mind, or are we trying to determine what objectively is reasonable so far as ownership of ancient property?

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --Well, Your Honor, I think it's part of both. 
    I think there has to be some subjective intent to relinquish ownership, but it certainly can be proven by objective factors.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2597.704" stopTime="2601.758">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, subjective, I'm never sure... I'm not sure you're ever going to be able to show it.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2601.758" stopTime="2613.556">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    I think you can, Your Honor. 
    I think it would be appropriate in certain circumstances to infer from all the facts that the original owner had an intent to abandon the property.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2613.556" stopTime="2623.553">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You don't mean subjective. 
    You wouldn't really insist that if I had a secret subjective intent not to abandon ownership, but I... all my actions suggest the contrary, that I have an abandonment.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2623.553" stopTime="2629.658">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, Your Honor, I think the fundamental issue is, is the owner's intent, but certainly the court can look to objective factors and--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2629.658" stopTime="2643.385">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So your answer to my question is yes. 
    If I have a secret intent, and I even... I put a sign on it that says, I don't own this any more. 
    I don't care about it. 
    I have a sign on it. 
    But deep in my heart, I really do care. 
    [Laughter] 
    My real intent is that I... you wouldn't say that, would you?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2643.385" stopTime="2643.896">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --No, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2643.896" stopTime="2648.118">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Of course not. 
    So it isn't the subjective intent that matters. 
    It's the objective manifestations.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2648.118" stopTime="2652.662">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    That's right. 
    I think it's the objective manifestations of a subjective intent.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but that's exactly contrary to the-- 
    [Laughter] 
    If you say that the objective manifestations are useful only as a basis from which one can infer subjective intent, you're saying that the basic criterion remains subjective intent. 
    Now, in the light of Justice Scalia's withering example do you still-- 
    Do you still adhere to that?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2675.326" stopTime="2684.853">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    If I understand Your Honor's question correctly, yes, I think it is... ultimately that subjective intent is the key issue, but it can be proven by objective factors.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2684.853" stopTime="2695.208">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, so here, whose intent do we look for? 
    Is it the chief executive officer of the various insurance companies in the year 1868, or whenever it was that the Brother Jonathan went down?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2695.208" stopTime="2705.767">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    I think it's that, Your Honor, but it's also more. 
    It's the present claimants, and I think that's one of the problems here. 
    At this early stage in the litigation I submit that the district court had no choice but to--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2705.767" stopTime="2711.189">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, the present claimants claim only by virtue of an assignment from the insurance company, don't they?

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --No. 
    There are other claims as well, Your Honor. 
    For instance, the United States claims that it had original title to the property.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, but don't your clients, or at least some of them, claim by virtue of assignment from the insurance company?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2722.747" stopTime="2726.392">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    They also have a salvage claim which is not an ownership claim--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, but--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --Factors that the court can consider... well, I think it would be inappropriate for the Court to constrain the district court's discretion in this regard, but, for example, factors the district court might consider are whether the insurance company's ever made any effort to locate the vessel--

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    That's correct, Your Honor, but as evidenced by objective factors, and I think the objective factors in this case, for instance, could include whether the company ever made any effort to locate the vessel, whether they... whether it was technologically feasible for them to locate the vessel, whether they wrote it off as a loss on their books--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2781.568" stopTime="2790.443">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    It seems to me we can almost take judicial notice that no one, especially an insurance company, ever wants to give up claim of ownership to anything it might have.

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --Well, Your Honor, I assume that's true, but again I think there's a fundamental distinction here between property that's lost and property that is abandoned, and property that's lost is not necessarily abandoned. 
    There's no doubt this wreck was lost to the original owners, but the question is, has it been abandoned by them, and I think Justice--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well now, let's talk specifically about the property here.

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Your Honor, I think it has to be treated as a whole, particularly under the ASA.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Why? 
    I mean, I would think if you have cargo, discrete cargo and it was different types of things... you were carrying gold bullion that belonged to the United States, and you were carrying something else of value that belonged to other people... conceivably you might have some of it abandoned and others not.

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Your Honor, under the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, section 2102(e), I believe, of the act, it defines a shipwreck as 
    "a vessel or wreck, its cargo and other contents. " 
    A single, unified entity. 
    It doesn't parse the wreck up into separate pieces. 
    It says that a shipwreck is a single thing.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, which way do you treat it?

    That's why it was essential for the district court to find at this stage that the wreck was not abandoned, because there was no notice to potential claimants.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Was that a preliminary finding of some kind? 
    I thought the district court didn't really resolve that issue.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2926.468" stopTime="2946.860">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    The district court found that it was convinced the wreck was not abandoned, but it was not prepared to say that specific items of property either were or were not abandoned, because again the court stressed that notice had not been given to potential claimants, and that once notice had been given to the world by publication, claimants might continue to come forward.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2946.860" stopTime="2952.553">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    How do you read the Ninth Circuit opinion on the abandonment issue? 
    Did it go further than the district court?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="2952.553" stopTime="2981.213">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    I don't think the Ninth Circuit did, Your Honor. 
    I think the Ninth Circuit simply affirmed the district court's finding that at that stage of the litigation the district court could not say that the wreck was abandoned because no notice had been given to any potential claimants. 
    And in fact the district court's judgment in this regard has been validated, because potential claimants have continued to come forward since publication of the notice, and it would have been entirely premature at that stage of the litigation for the district court to say that the property was abandoned and therefore cut off all potential claimants.

    May I ask you, under your view of abandonment, was the gold in the hull of the ship that was involved in the Treasure Salvors case abandoned by the Spanish?

    Your Honor, I--

    There's no evidence of affirmative, you know, voluntary relinquishment of interest in all that money.

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --Right. 
    I don't completely know the facts of that case, but as I--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3001.705" stopTime="3012.164">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, let me give them to you, then. 
    A ship is found that went down in 14 or 1500, somewhere back... loaded with gold that everybody knew belonged to Spain at the time the ship went down. 
    Was it abandoned, or not? 
    That's all you know.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3012.164" stopTime="3017.727">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --I believe so, Your Honor, because it's my understanding the Government did not come forward after notice in that case. 
    In other words--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3017.727" stopTime="3020.950">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The abandonment took place after the finding of the vessel, then.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3020.950" stopTime="3027.401">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --Well, the finding of abandonment was appropriate once the court issued notice to the public and no claimants came forward.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3027.401" stopTime="3034.136">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but I don't... the word finding was bad. 
    The time the abandonment occurred was after the discovery of the vessel. 
    Is that your view?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3034.136" stopTime="3037.508">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    I don't know the answer to that question, Your Honor. 
    I'm sorry.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3037.508" stopTime="3042.662">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It seems to me it's precisely the same situation we have here, except instead of Spanish gold it's American dollars.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3042.662" stopTime="3049.637">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, the critical difference, Your Honor, is that in Treasure Salvors notice was given to the public and no one came forward claiming ownership. 
    That is perhaps--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3049.637" stopTime="3053.298">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that's almost a default type of thing rather than abandonment, isn't it?

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --Well, Your Honor--

    Default of judicial proceedings.

    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --That's true, Your Honor. 
    I think that abandonment could be found by default in that circumstance.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3061.105" stopTime="3072.261">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, no. 
    I'm suggesting that you can have a concept of default in a judicial proceeding, failure to appear and assert a claim, that may have nothing to do with historical abandonment.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3072.261" stopTime="3091.713">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    That's correct, Your Honor, but I think the issues are related in at least one respect and that is, in a sense, if notice was given to the public and no one comes forward claiming the property, that is, I think, powerful evidence that the property is abandoned. 
    It's not only a legal default, but I think it also goes to evidence of intent to relinquish ownership of the property. 
    No one's come forward to claim it.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3091.713" stopTime="3139.105">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But if we have a rule like the Ninth Circuit rule, which is bothering me, what we do about the Ninth Circuit's statement? 
    Their statement seems to be that if a long time passes, hundreds of years, and nobody does anything, it's not abandoned. 
    Now, if that's the rule, then I guess once we announce it you won't have problems with people coming forward. 
    Maybe I have a claim. 
    Who knows? 
    There may be thousands of people who have little bits of claims, and they'll all come forward. 
    Why do we think any bit of this was abandoned? 
    And so why do we think there's parts that wasn't abandoned? 
    They just don't know they have a right to it yet, but they'll know. 
    Now, my question is, am I right in that worry, and if so, what do you think we should do about it?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3139.105" stopTime="3151.893">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    No, Your Honor, I do not think you're right in that worry. 
    Again, claimants have to come forward and prove their claims. 
    It's not enough for them to come forward and say, I understand that property is never abandoned, therefore I own a piece of it. 
    They would be required to prove that they--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3151.893" stopTime="3178.241">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    No, no, somebody's great-great-grandmother had some cargo and she left a will, and those things can be traced. 
    I overstated hundreds. 
    It's only 130, 135 years ago, whatever, and those things can be traced through wills and so forth. 
    It's those thousands of people now, perhaps divided as property passed intestate. 
    It's those, not millions of people but hundreds or thousands that might come forward. 
    That's my worry.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3178.241" stopTime="3201.047">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --Well, Your Honor, I think the passage of time in itself, without anything more, is not sufficient to infer abandonment where claimants actually come forward. 
    The loss should not start with a presumption that the property is abandoned. 
    California speaks in its brief about a presumption of abandonment. 
    There's absolutely no authority for that position. 
    I think that if claimants come forward they ought to be allowed to prove their claim, and--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3201.047" stopTime="3212.484">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    That's consistent with what I take it to be your answer to Justice Stevens. 
    I just infer this, that if the Spanish Government had come forward that would have been sufficient, even though they had done nothing for 500 years.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3212.484" stopTime="3213.834">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --No, Your Honor.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3213.834" stopTime="3216.656">

    And that seems to me a very extraordinary position.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3216.656" stopTime="3228.486">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The fact that they simply come forward is not enough in itself to prove not abandoned... nonabandonment. 
    My point, however, inartfully made, perhaps, was that before we even give notice--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3228.486" stopTime="3239.515">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Would it be fair to say that it's your point that the Spanish are not foreclosed unless it has been shown that they affirmatively took some act to abandon?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3239.515" stopTime="3247.379">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    I don't think abandonment needs to be proven by some affirmative act. 
    It can be proven by inference from the circumstances, and that was certainly recognized by the lower courts here.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3247.379" stopTime="3279.831">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, if, in fact, this shipwreck was abandoned, if at the bottom line that's the finding, then your clients are just out, I take it. 
    They get no salvage rights because the Federal act eliminates that. 
    They get no finder's law, because it eliminates that. 
    They're just out. 
    They will have done all of this work, made all of this effort, and they will get nothing. 
    Is that the bottom line if the wreck is determined to be abandoned?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3279.831" stopTime="3282.512">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    That's exactly correct, Your Honor, because of the operation of the Abandoned Shipwreck Act.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3282.512" stopTime="3304.016">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask just one other question? 
    Or, I guess, two parts to this. 
    One, is it perfectly clear that the term abandoned in this statute has the same meaning it had at admiralty law before the statute was enacted? 
    That's my first question. 
    My second question is, is it not likely that Congress assumed that this statute would apply to a lot of sunken vessels, and if we adopt your view of abandonment, it won't apply to any?
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3304.016" stopTime="3332.073">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, Your Honor, on the first question, I think we have to start from the presumption that Congress did not intend to change the fundamental concept of abandonment that has been applied for years both in the common law and in the general maritime law, and indeed that Congress is not free to define abandonment in some way other than as a voluntary process, and there's no evidence, certainly, in the legislative record that Congress intended to depart from the traditional standard of abandonment. 
    Certainly--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3332.073" stopTime="3335.266">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But there is evidence that they thought the statute would apply to a large number of vessels.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3335.266" stopTime="3336.287">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    --That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3336.287" stopTime="3338.869">

    And I don't think, under your view, it would apply to any.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3338.869" stopTime="3350.816">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, I respectfully disagree, Your Honor. 
    Again, if no claimants come forward, then certainly the court would be justified in finding, both as a matter of default and as a matter of evidence, that the property is abandoned.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3350.816" stopTime="3358.892">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But that's the line that you draw... for example, the United States. 
    The United States didn't do anything to get the gold. 
    All it did was, when it found out it was there, it filed a claim.
speaker="fletcher_c_alford" startTime="3358.892" stopTime="3363.206">
    Mr. Fletcher C. Alford 
    Well, we don't know yet, Your Honor, and that's the problem. 
    That's the essential feature here.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3363.206" stopTime="3385.679">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But suppose that's the case. 
    Suppose the United States was just sitting there doing nothing about this, thinking that ship would never be found, but the moment it was found, put in a claim, would you say that the United States, because it had done absolutely nothing, is not claiming that it's done anything... it abandoned it because it didn't step forward until someone else found the vessel, and then it said, we have stuff on it.
