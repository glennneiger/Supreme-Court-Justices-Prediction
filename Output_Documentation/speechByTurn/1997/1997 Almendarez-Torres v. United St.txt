    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 96-6839, Hugo Roman Almendarez Torres v. The United States. 
    Mr. Fleury.
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="55.137" stopTime="163.287">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    Title 8, section 1326(a), provides for a 2-year maximum penalty if these facts are proved: 1) a deportation, and 2) a reentry without a deport... without permission. 
    Title 8, 1326(b)(2), on the other hand, sets a punishment of up to 20 years if these facts are proven: 1) a deportation, 2) a reentry without permission, and 3) an aggravated felony conviction which occurred prior to the deportation. 
    The issue presented is, did Congress intend for 1326(b) to be a sentence provision or a separate offense? 
    The starting point, of course, is the plain language of the statute. 
    There are three very important factors which plainly indicate that subsection (b) incorporates by reference the conduct described in subsection (a) rather than setting forth the sentence for a conviction in subsection (a). 
    The first phrase that helps us is 1326(b). 
    It says... is in 1326(b) which says, in the case of any alien described in such subsection, and then it says, in that case if the person has a prior aggravated felony, he'll be facing a 20-year maximum. 
    It specifically does not say, in the case of any alien convicted in such subsection and, as this Court said in the Sedima case, when Congress intended that the defendant had been previously convicted, it said so by using explicitly words like convicted or conviction. 
    Here we have no such word, so what subsection (b) does is incorporate by reference the conduct set forth in subsection (a), that you have to have a deportation and a reentry without permission.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="163.287" stopTime="172.995">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But you could also say that the person described in subsection (a) shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 2 years or both. 
    It's describing that.
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="172.995" stopTime="178.177">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    That's describing the result of the process, not the person in subsection (a).
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="178.177" stopTime="180.078">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But it's in subsection (a), is it not?
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="180.078" stopTime="197.799">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    That is in subsection (a), but if you take that clause that I just read, the person described in subsection (a), and you add to it the clause that precedes it, where it says, notwithstanding subsection (a), which the Government itself concedes as a must, that that means despite subsection (a), which--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="197.799" stopTime="206.457">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, doesn't that very clause naturally refer to the... to your maximum penalty in (a)--
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="206.457" stopTime="207.196">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    --No. 
    What--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="207.196" stopTime="211.329">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Notwithstanding that penalty, here's another penalty if these facts are--
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="211.329" stopTime="215.501">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    --You have to re add words to the statute to get to that result, which is the opposite--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="215.501" stopTime="241.770">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, I don't think so. 
    I mean, I think it's a pretty normal reading, and I think we're... another factor is that the titles to subsection (b) make reference to penalties, and all the amendments to it refer to penalties. 
    They don't refer to a new separate crime. 
    I don't know why those aren't indicators for us that this really is a sentence enhancement.
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="241.770" stopTime="446.833">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    --First, as to the notwithstanding question, if subsection (b) was to be a penalty or a sentence for subsection (a), it's the opposite word that you would use. 
    You would say, the penalties in subsection (a) are a result of the conviction... I mean, the penalties in subsection (b) are a result of the conviction in subsection (a), not, notwithstanding or despite the conviction in subsection (a). 
    It's the opposite signal one would give to say that (b) flows from or is a result of (a). 
    Secondly, as to the word penalty, the word penalty by itself is a very little evidence that what Congress intended was a sentence provision. 
    Penalty is the word signifying the result that will occur, not whether or not how you get there is through a trial of an offense, or at a sentence proceeding. 
    Penalty and sentence proceeding are not synonymous phrases. 
    Congress, when they enacted in 1952 this very statute, 1326, before the (b) part was even thought of, enacted it in Chapter 8 of the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act entitled, penalties. 
    The House report to that statutory provision referred to the 1326(a) as creating a sanction for certain deported aliens. 
    The word penalties is the way anybody would describe the creation of a new criminal law. 
    If you wanted to pass a law against jay walking you would say, I want to make a penalty against jay walking, and you would describe it as such, just as Congress did when they described the car jacking statute. 
    It was under a subtitle called, enhanced penalties for auto theft, or Federal penalties for armed robberies. 
    Numerous statutes are found under a heading with penalties. 
    It would be a different thing all together if there was subsection (a), offense, subsection (b), penalty. 
    In 1988, when Congress passed 1326(b), as the Government points out in their brief, the phrase penalty was not added to the statute. 
    That's just in the codification that you see when you pick up a book. 
    That was not a congress... the codifiers added that, not Congress, so the word penalty did not become part of the statute at all, much less... even if it had meaning as a signal as to whether or not it's a sentence provision or an offense. 
    And third, in the plain language of the statute it would make no sense for the phrase in (b)(1) that you can get up to a 10-year sentence for a felony, and then in parentheses, other than an aggravated felony. 
    How would that make any sense if that's a sentence... if that's just a sentence proceeding, because it would just be a gradation. 
    All of the courts below are uniform in looking at a statute and seeing... if Congress had passed 1326(b) and simply added that language to an already existing 1326(a) right at the end, and just said, shall be guilty of a felony and shall suffer a penalty of up to 10 years, or a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years, and if they have an aggravated felony it will be up to 20 years, or if it's just a felony it will be up to 10 years, that would be a signal that there's a sentence provision for the offense in (a). 
    But making it a separate subsection is deemed by all of the courts that review this as an indicator that it's an offense, especially when it's not section (a) entitled penalties, which it's not. 
    Then when we--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="446.833" stopTime="456.750">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I'm not following your argument all... about all of the courts of appeals, because I thought that the Ninth Circuit is the only one interpreting this statute as established in a separate offense.
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="456.750" stopTime="530.468">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    --My point was that in looking at whether or not something is titled penalties, if it's in a separate subdivision, like in section... 18 U.S.C. section 1091, which says (a), basic offense, (b), penalty for basic offense, then that's a signal that (b) is to be a sentence provision. 
    But where it's all in one section, courts of appeals have said as to that factor, not the end result but as to that factor, that is an indication, if the penalty provision is in the same paragraph as the offense, then it's a sentence for the offense, but if it's separated out into a separate section without a separate title of penalty, then that's an indicator... it may not be dispositive... an indicator that it's meant to create a separate offense. 
    Such as in 2113(d), which is the bank robbery statute, and 2113 sets forth (a) that it's a crime to commit a bank robbery, and you can get up to 20 years. 
    (d), if you use a weapon or assault somebody in the course of committing (a), then it's an extra 5 years, and this Court in the Simpson case assumed that was an element, and even though it was... it... just as in this statute incorporated by reference all of the provisions of the previous statute.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Fleury, would you go back over your argument about the parenthetical other than an aggravated felony? 
    I didn't follow your--
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="536.112" stopTime="536.863">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    Well, what--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="536.863" stopTime="541.625">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --argument on that. 
    That doesn't suggest anything to me. 
    What does it suggest to you?
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="541.625" stopTime="569.454">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    --Well, if it was a sentence provision, then it would just say in gradations, (a), if you've got a felony conviction you'll get up to 10 years. 
    If it's an aggravated felony you'll get up to 20 years. 
    But if you put in the word, other than an aggravated felony, it takes care of a due process concern... I mean, a double jeopardy concern. 
    You could only get convicted under (b)(1) or (b)(2), because a felony could fall under both statutes, but if you add the clause, other than an aggravated felony, then you can only be convicted under (b)(1) and not (b)(2), otherwise there's no sense to having that clause in there.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="569.454" stopTime="575.608">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But you can only be sentenced under (b)(1) or (b)(2) also, under that... as it now stands, as the Government--
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="575.608" stopTime="587.824">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    Yes, but there would be no reason to put... it would... you could only be... you can only get up to 10 years if it was a felony and only up to 20 years if it was an aggravated felony, with or without that clause, but it does satisfy double jeopardy concerns if you view these as offenses.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="587.824" stopTime="591.837">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --But the clause could... even if this is a sentencing provision the clause is necessary, is it not?
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="591.837" stopTime="597.961">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    No, it wouldn't be necessary. 
    If my client has a felony and they don't prove it's an aggravated felony, he could only get up to 10 years, whether--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="597.961" stopTime="603.575">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but the whole point is they want to distinguish between aggravated and nonaggravated felonies for sentencing purposes.
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="603.575" stopTime="604.406">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    --Sure--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="604.406" stopTime="609.609">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So you have to have that parenthetical or something equivalent to it in the... in (b)(1).
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="609.609" stopTime="716.229">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    --I don't think it would be necessary for sentencing concerns, because again, if it's not an aggravated felony it still... it's... if it's an aggravated felony, it would be a felony, and that might raise double jeopardy concerns if these are offenses, which is our view they are, because if it doesn't say other than an aggravated felony, there might... it might not survive the Blockburger test, so... but that is not one of our more important points. 
    More importantly, subsequent enactments indicate clearly that Congress viewed these as creating separate offenses. 
    In... when they created 1326(d), they referred to... when they created 1326(d), they made it crystal clear, because they say that you cannot contest the validity of a deportation order under certain... under (a) or (b)(1). 
    Well, if you have a trial, and the Government proves the person has been deported and has reentered subsequent to that deportation, the deportation order issue will already have been resolved by the time you get to a sentence proceeding. 
    There would be no need for Congress to refer to (d)(1), saying you can't contest a deportation order under (b), when they created 1326(d), because the issue would never arise. 
    Also, they... there is no word, deportation order, or order of deportation, in (b)(1) or (b)(2). 
    Therefore, that indicates Congress assumed that (a) was incorporated by reference into (b). 
    Then they created sections 1326(b)(3) and (b)(4), both of which clearly appeared to be offenses, and they put them in with (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4), all of which are offenses. 
    They didn't separate those out into a separate subsection from (b)(1) and (b)(2).
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="716.229" stopTime="749.592">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Fleury, would you explain to me the consequences of accepting your position in two respects. 
    One is, there was here, if I have it right, no debate about defendant's prior convictions. 
    He conceded that the recitation of his prior conviction was true and correct. 
    So in light of that, that there was nothing to go to the jury on it, he had a prior conviction, he admitted it, what is the consequence of a reversal?
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="749.592" stopTime="754.984">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    The consequence of a reversal is a 2-year maximum penalty in this case to my client.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="754.984" stopTime="755.983">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Because it wasn't in the indictment.
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="755.983" stopTime="757.846">

    Because it wasn't in the indictment.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="757.846" stopTime="784.254">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Now, if it had been in the indictment, and given the certainty of the conviction, I... the defendant would end up with two offenses which would place the defendant in jeopardy of a three strikes and you're out, closer to the three, so why is it in defendant's interest to have this as a separate offense rather than an enhancement?
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="784.254" stopTime="789.136">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    I'm not... I didn't understand the question with regard to he would be convicted of two offenses.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    In other words, if you... you take your case. 
    You say, there are two separate offenses, that merely coming back once you've been thrown out is an offense.

    Mm hmm.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="797.962" stopTime="808.289">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And then a separate offense is coming back after you've committed a felony, been convicted, and then been deported.
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="808.289" stopTime="836.747">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    Subsection (a) would be a lesser included offense of (b) necessarily. 
    It would not survive the Blockburger test because there's no element in (a) that does not also exist in (b), therefore only one conviction could be had, but the value is clear, as the amicus brief indicates, to the defendant. 
    Most of the prosecutions under 1326 are in the Ninth Circuit alone. 
    There's... 60 percent of the cases under this statute are in the Ninth Circuit alone, which covers more cases than all of the other circuits combined.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="836.747" stopTime="843.943">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But you're telling me that's for sure that you'd end up... on your view of the case you can only have the one conviction.

    Yes.

    Mr. Peter M. Fleury

    Now, why is it that the defense bar, putting your hat on as a defense attorney, thinks it's better to have that placed in front of the jury before the trial than it is to have it placed before the judge after the trial.

    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    As pointed out in the amicus brief, 98.2 percent of these cases end up in a plea of guilty, and in the Ninth Circuit, as the amicus points out, the Government and the courts do not mind the fact that, with the glut of cases that could be prosecuted under this statute, that there's a certain degree of charge bargaining, and therefore some prosecutorial discretion over which of the two offenses to charge to dispose of the case, and in many cases, in this particular case it would benefit my client and, of course, it would benefit a number of clients throughout the land, most of the clients. 
    Secondly, under the Old Chief case, any prejudice to my client would be blunted if that were the issue, and thirdly, if the issue is whether or not this is the same person who's been previously convicted, my client or any client would rather have that issue litigated under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard when 18 additional years turns on a resolution of that fact.

   Argument of Beth S. Brinkmann
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="1506.125" stopTime="1687.876">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Section 1326, subsection (b)(2), is a sentencing enhancement provision. 
    It does not create a separate criminal offense. 
    Congress enacted (b)(2) as part of a three tier penalty scheme for violations of section 1326. 
    The statutory text, structure, and history compelled that conclusion, and that interpretation does not create a constitutional problem. 
    Subsection (a) of section 1326 sets forth the offense conduct. 
    It also sets forth a base sentence of up to 2 years that shall be imposed on such an offender, but specifies that that provision, that you shall be sentenced to 2 years, is subject to subsection (b). 
    Subsection (b) then states that notwithstanding subsection (a), longer sentences are authorized in some cases. 
    (b) does not set forth any additional offense conduct. 
    Specifically, (b)(2) authorizes a sentence up to 20 years for persons with aggravated felony convictions, a paradigmatic sentencing factor. 
    The reading of (b)(2) is confirmed by the circumstances surrounding its enactment. 
    As Justice O'Connor pointed out, the provision in the enacting legislation was entitled, criminal penalties. 
    That was not carried over into the codification, but it is part of the legislation that was enacted by Congress. 
    Moreover, if I could draw the Court's attention to the version of the statute in effect... it's in the appendix to the Government's brief at 2a. 
    Pages 2a and 3a reflect the changes from the 1952 version to the version which enacted in 1988 that added subsection (b). 
    Petitioner's counsel discussed at length the fact that subsection (b) applies notwithstanding subsection (a) into the case of any alien described in such subsection. 
    At the time that provision was added, Congress was looking at (a), which stated at that time that an offender shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be punished, so it was quite natural for Congress to use that language at that time. 
    As petitioner points out in his brief, later that guilty of a felony provision was dropped out. 
    That was part, as we explain in our brief, part of an effort of Congress going through and changing fine provisions and various provisions of the Immigration Act. 
    But at the time that (b) was enacted, to refer to an alien that was described in (a), it was clearly an alien who was guilty of a felony and who would be subject to a sentence of 2 years unless (b) applied. 
    We think that the legislative history also confirms that. 
    As we discuss in our brief, all the references to the subsection (b) that was added were penalty provisions. 
    The sponsors of the bill referred to it that way, the section by section analysis that was submitted to the Senate, and the predecessor statute, the sponsors and drafters had discussed at length the fact that this was a three tier penalty scheme.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1687.876" stopTime="1736.789">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask, just to be sure I understand the posture of the case, the case, the hypothetical case that troubles me is one... unlike this case. 
    I guess the facts were pretty clear... one in which at the time of the indictment and the plea hearing, all the Government knows is that this particular reentry was made unlawfully, but the Government is not aware of prior convictions, and as I understand the Government's position, if they subsequently discover before sentencing the prior felony the sentence could go up to 20 years. 
    Now... and supposing the defendant says, no, that was my brother or somebody else, it's mistaken identity... and our cases do have some claims of mistaken identity... I take it it's your position that the Government must prove that this particular person was the same one by only a preponderance of the evidence.
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="1736.789" stopTime="1744.372">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    That's correct, Your Honor, and that's what I meant before when I explained that this was the paradigmatic sentencing factor. 
    That is by proof of--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1744.372" stopTime="1763.627">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But normally it's a paradigmatic sentencing factor that does not increase the range of punishment beyond the previous maximum, which was true in McMillan, for example. 
    That was within the statutory range. 
    Here, if you... well, that's the argument, I guess, whether the maximum for everybody is 20 years, or only for those who find this out later.
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="1763.627" stopTime="1814.443">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    --Well, Your Honor, a couple of responses. 
    As a threshold matter, we would disagree that sentencing enhancements do not often increase the statutory maximum. 
    In fact, they do, and we discussed the early recidivist cases from this Court, where it makes clear that that is not a constitutional problem. 
    Graham v. West Virginia was the first case in 1912 that talked about the fact that prior convictions used for sentencing enhancements are not an offense. 
    They are a distinctive factor. 
    They can be determined at a separate hearing. 
    And in Oyler v. Boles, an early 1960's case, there were two defendants at issue there. 
    Both of them for their instant offense were subject to much lower than the enhanced sentence. 
    Mr. Oyler I believe was facing... he had a second degree murder conviction and he was facing a period of, I think it was--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1814.443" stopTime="1816.763">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Wasn't the argument in that case that it was--
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="1816.763" stopTime="1817.181">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    --maximum--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1817.181" stopTime="1818.874">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --double jeopardy to do that?
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="1818.874" stopTime="1845.552">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    They also discussed the fact that he had a maximum of 18 years, and his went to a mandatory life. 
    Also, Mr. Crabtree in that case had a maximum of 10 years and it went to life, so we think that that stands for the proposition that the Court has long recognized that the fact that a sentencing consideration enhances the maximum is not a constitutional problem. 
    I would--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1845.552" stopTime="1881.786">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is... do you apply that to all situations? 
    I mean, I'm not outraged when you apply it to prior criminal conviction, I guess, but suppose Congress passed a classic malice murder statute and it says, the maximum penalty shall be life in prison provided that if the murder is committed with malice aforethought it shall be death. 
    Now, is that a sentencing enhancement, so you need only a judge determination of by more likely than not of the malice aforethought provision?

    Well--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1926.314" stopTime="1932.879">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    McMillan said it was when the tail wags the dog, and the question was whether 20 years is the tail or the dog, as compared to 2 years.
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="1932.879" stopTime="1991.638">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    --Your Honor, I think one thing that McMillan makes clear, that it's not simply the length of the sentence. 
    The example that the Court in McMillan gave was a statute in which the presumption of innocence was undermined because of the elements that were shifted to the sentencing proceeding. 
    There was an old case, I believe, where there was a presumption that the gun had traveled in interstate commerce, and the Court gave that as an example in McMillan of something that would be on the other side of the line. 
    Also in McMillan, I'd like to point out, the Court cited with... favorably lower court rulings that had upheld the constitutionality of the old special offender statute. 
    The Third Circuit Davis case the Court cites favorably and discusses it as that's the lower court authority to look to that's citing the cases in discussing 3575. 
    3575 also includes the maximum authorized sentence. 
    That statute permitted the sentence to go up to 25 years. 
    In the Davis case, setting aside that sentencing enhancement, he was facing a maximum statutory sentence of 2 years.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1991.638" stopTime="2006.249">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask, to follow up on Justice Scalia's... supposing this statute, instead of reading, whose deportation was subsequent to a conviction for three or more, it simply said, whose deportation was subsequent to the commission of three or more crimes. 
    It would still be a sentence enhancement.
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="2006.249" stopTime="2018.248">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    We think in light of all of the other factors in this case it would be. 
    Again, I think it's a totality. 
    When the Court is discerning legislative intent here we just believe it's abundantly clear, and I don't think that that factor would make any difference in this particular case.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2018.248" stopTime="2038.811">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Are you sure on that one, because there's been no trial or conviction of the previous commission of a felony. 
    I mean, I think what Justice Stevens is driving at is that you then have to have a whole trial as to what the person had done previously. 
    Did he... three times, did he in fact... was he a felon or not?

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    I may have misunderstood the question. 
    I apologize. 
    I think what I'm trying to say is there may be situations certainly under the Court's recent decisions of Witt, or Watts, where sentencing proceedings include consideration of relevant conduct or acquitted conduct, uncharged conduct. 
    I don't see that that raises a constitutional area.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2058.684" stopTime="2099.329">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, but that doesn't increase the sentence. 
    When you commit the crime you know that if worst comes to worst you'll get 30 years, and within that 30 years the judge is allowed to find on the basis of probabilities that you had committed another crime, and he may increase your sentence up to the maximum of 30 years because of that. 
    But we're talking here about you commit the crime in good faith, thinking you can get only 30 years, and it turns out that there's a sentencing enhancement that turns it into a 50-year one, and the judge is going to make that determination on his own by... you know, more likely than not that you committed this earlier crime. 
    You think that's constitutional, raising it from 30 to a 50 maximum?
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="2099.329" stopTime="2100.721">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Wow.
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="2101.352" stopTime="2167.426">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    I think the Court made clear in Oyler it raised it... it was a check forgery case. 
    Mr. Crabtree was facing a check forgery case, and because he had had three prior convictions under that base sentence he would have been facing 2 to 10 years. 
    It was a mandatory life sentence in that case. 
    I think also I want to distinguish, Your Honor, between notice of what the penalty is and what the claim is in this case. 
    The claim is in this case there was a constitutional violation because this was not alleged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. 
    Sentencing enhancements do not need to be included there. 
    That does not mean, however, that it's not clear that Congress intended a person to commit this offense, be criminally sanctioned, and persons who commit this offense with this prior criminal history be subject to the sanctions. 
    That's clear on the face of this statute. 
    The statute gives full notice of that. 
    Those penalties are not required to be included in an indictment. 
    I think what the Court was focused on before helps in that regard, Rule 11. 
    That is the rule that requires that criminal defendants be notified prior to a guilty plea of the maximum sentence.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Suppose the Government thinks that there's just a 2-year case before it. 
    It doesn't have the evidence that Justice Stevens referred to of these other convictions, and the district judge says, I want you to know that the maximum penalty is 20 years. 
    Is that a correct Rule 11 advice, or should he say 2 years?

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    Your Honor, I think that in the context of Rule 11 colloquys trial judges often will explain that I can't be certain about your sentence, particularly under the guidelines, and even when they talk about statutory maximum in drug cases they explain enhancement provisions that do increase that maximum--

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    But the purpose of that is to have a knowing and voluntary plea, Your Honor, and I'd also point out under Rule 11 subsection (h) there's a harmless error analysis. 
    For example, in the advisory committee notes one of the examples they give of harmless error is a guilty plea proceeding in which the trial judge erroneously understates the maximum penalty. 
    If the penalty imposed in that case did not exceed that, that would be harmless error.

    And I would suppose that if we at least find arguments each way on what Congress intended, that we ought to rule against you to keep this constitutional issue out of the case.

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    Well, Your Honor, two things. 
    I also think it's been resolved by cases since McMillan. 
    In two death penalty cases this Court has upheld the death penalty sentencing schemes in the State of Florida and Arizona, and in both those schemes the existence of an aggravating factor is the fact that makes... that increases the maximum sentence to the death penalty in Hildwin and Walton, and in Hildwin the Court specifically said that McMillan does not change that result. 
    It was referring back to its results in Spaziano upholding judge sentencing--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but in those--

    --and judge determination of those factors.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --In all of... yes, but in all of those cases there was, if I understand what your argument is there's a fact that's different from the case here. 
    In all of those cases you were dealing, ab initio, with capital cases in which the capital result was a possibility. 
    It was part of the range to which the defendant was exposed. 
    The argument here is that the sentencing factor, or that the enhancement factor, as you put it, actually increases the range, so that the death penalty cases, I suppose, would not be authority.
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="2416.150" stopTime="2440.875">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    Your Honor, I'd have to respectfully disagree. 
    I think it's important to focus on how those sentencing systems worked. 
    In fact, once you're convicted of the offense... it's called a capital offense, just like this would be a 1326 offense, but you cannot be sentenced to death in those States unless after that verdict there is then a finding of the existence of an aggravating factor, and that aggravating factor is what then permits the imposition of the death penalty. 
    In the Zant case--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And did-- 
    --All of that has been done to comply with our ruling that you must... you cannot apply the death penalty automatically and you must allow... there must be aggravating factors to narrow the class, and that's a consequence of our constitutional ruling, which arguably is satisfied by a judge determination. 
    To reason backwards from that to what the common law requires with respect to conviction or sentencing for felonies is... doesn't seem to me--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, it's clear that in this particular case there's no problem, but we're concerned about the possible other cases, and you called my attention to Oyler v. Boyles, and I notice the opinion makes this point: the statute expressly provides for a jury trial on the issue of identity if the accused either denies he is the person named in the information or just remains silent, so apparently the court thought that when an identity is in question it might be a matter of some significance.
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="2576.276" stopTime="2603.842">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    --Well, Your Honor, we think that that was simply the statutory provision at issue there, and if there's one thing that we've learned in preparing for this case, there's a wide variety of recidivist statutes both in the Federal and State systems, different language, different structures, and I'd have to get back to the Court's opinions in Spaziano and Walton and Hildwin, where the Court made clear that, even in the case of an aggravating factor in a death penalty statute, that's a sentencing provision and it does not need to be determined by a jury. 
    I think Spaziano is dispositive on that point.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But is it the case... suppose we held against you in this case. 
    What would that do to the drug statutes? 
    My impression is the drug statutes are phrased in terms of a crime, possession with intent to distribute, and there follows a very large section called penalties which gives different statutory penalties ranging from a year to life, depending on the amount of the drug. 
    Now, is it the case that those reviewed by the Department normally are simply sentencing enhancements, or are they viewed as part of the substantive crime?
speaker="beth_s_brinkmann" startTime="2634.753" stopTime="2676.291">
    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    Those are sentencing enhancements, Your Honor. 
    They're set out under 841 (b). 
    It's captioned penalties, and there's a whole variety of factors that are sentencing enhancements under that. 
    It's not just the nature and quantity of the drugs involved, but again it's also the prior criminal history of the defendant, and in subsections (b)(1)(B)(C), and (D) those statutory maximum authorized sentences are also increased based on the prior conviction. 
    (b)(1)(A) it doesn't happen in because the... without any prior convictions the maximum is life, but under (b)(1)(B) the maximum is 30 years, and if you have a prior conviction it's 40 years, and if you have a prior conviction it's life, so that also is a common feature of 841 (b), and the use of prior convictions there.

    Ms. Beth S. Brinkmann 
    To the best of my knowledge, Your Honor, that practice has varied over time and over districts. 
    I believe in some districts they do include, for example, sentence... citations to sentencing statutes also. 
    It's... I don't think that there's a uniform rule on that. 
    I would also point out, though, just... our concern is not with other statutes in this case, it's with the fact that for 10 years, nearly 10 years, the Government has interpreted this according to what we think the clear intent of Congress is, section 1326, and we... as we said in our opposition to the petition in this case we don't have difficulty including this in the prosecution in the Ninth Circuit, but we have not proceeded that way. 
    We do not want to be subject to collateral attacks from defendants who are under conviction from all those other circuits, and we are also put in this ironic position of being subject then to these challenges that it will be prejudicial. 
    We do not believe that the Old Chief scenario would answer all of the challenges we would face, because as the Chief Justice pointed out, that simply sanitizes the prior conviction, if you will. 
    It doesn't eliminate it.

    I can't imagine the prejudice argument is very important.

speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="2898.997" stopTime="3003.195">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The... in McMillan and in Patterson there was a clear statement that those legislatures intended the fact at issue there not to be an element, and that was a big part of this outcome of both of those cases. 
    In this case we have no such clear statement, and in... both in McMillan and in Patterson the Court looked to the fact that Congress deemed the... whether or not Congress had deemed the fact... the facts that the jury did find to be so important to create a liability for the statutory maximum punishment, and since the jury did find all of those facts, the outcome was within the dictates of the Constitution. 
    Here we have the question left unresolved, and that is whether a fact upon which an additional 18 years, dwarfing the possible consequences to my client other than that resolution of that fact is to be alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and here we do not have what was present in Patterson and in McMillan. 
    We don't have the type of clear statement from Congress as they did in 21 U.S.C. 841, where they have (a), unlawful acts, (b), penalties, and 21 U.S. 851, which sets forth a sentence procedure in order to determine the prior convictions that might be used to increase the statutory maximum sentence under 841, where Congress has said as clearly as they could that the prior convictions in 841 (b) will be sentence enhancements for a conviction under (a). 
    That's not present in this case. 
    The traditional rule is that prior convictions used to increase a statutory maximum must be alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    This Court's never said otherwise.

    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    Oh, correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3043.150" stopTime="3044.492">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So this is a form of recidivist statute.
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="3044.492" stopTime="3093.413">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    But it requires a prior aggravated felony which occurred prior to the deportation, and it has to do with somebody who reenters with the status of a felon, just like 18 U.S.C. 922(g) is concerned with the status of the person. 
    It says, we want to have increased deterrence to keep felons away from weapons, and therefore it's an offense for a felon to have a weapon. 
    Here, we... Congress said, we want to have an increased deterrence for felons who don't even belong in this country. 
    Therefore, it's an extra offense, it's a 20-year offense for you to come into this country, and that has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and alleged to the jury. 
    In this case we don't have any... we have no indication that the constitutional right to have a grand jury to decide whether a 20-year offense should have been filed in this case, it did not occur. 
    That was not presented to the grand jury, and that's the purpose of the grand jury right.

    Is it your view that also all these things in the drug statute have to be submitted to grand juries... amounts?
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="3098.436" stopTime="3110.484">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    That presents a much more difficult question at least in the drug cases in 21 U.S.C. 841. 
    You do have what was present in Mulaney... in Patterson and McMillan. 
    You have the clear statement, and so--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3110.484" stopTime="3111.946">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Is there a constitutional problem there?
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="3111.946" stopTime="3114.979">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    --In our... in my view there is, but again--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3114.979" stopTime="3116.698">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So in your view it might be unconstitutional--
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="3116.698" stopTime="3117.039">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    --Yes.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3117.039" stopTime="3121.703">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --to... and therefore all the amounts would have to be submitted to grand juries and in the indictment, too.
speaker="peter_m_fleury" startTime="3121.703" stopTime="3129.980">
    Mr. Peter M. Fleury 
    Yes, that is correct, but again... and 21 U.S.C. 841 would present that issue clearly because there is a clear statement that that's what Congress intended.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3129.980" stopTime="3132.663">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Fleury. 
    the case is submitted.
