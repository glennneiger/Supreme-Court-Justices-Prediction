    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1279, George C. Rogers v. The United States. 
    Mr. Rubinstein.
speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="10.628" stopTime="55.678">
    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The question before the Court in this case is whether the removal of an element by the trial court of an essential element of the crime with which a defendant is charged from the jury's consideration is the type of error that can be subject to harmless error scrutiny even if the defendant admitted the element by his testimony. 
    We urge this Court to hold that it is not. 
    In this case, it is undisputed that the trial court completely removed from the jury's consideration an element of the offenses with which petitioner was charged. 
    Although the court of appeals recognized that there was an incomplete verdict, it nonetheless held that the error was subject to harmless error scrutiny because the trial court removed only one element of the offense.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="55.678" stopTime="60.340">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, when you say an incomplete verdict, you don't mean that the verdict formed was incomplete, do you?
speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="60.340" stopTime="68.664">
    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    What we mean is that the jury... what the jury found, the elements that the jury found do not constitute a crime, that the jury did not render a verdict on every element.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="68.664" stopTime="75.089">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Let's take a look and... are you saying that the form of the jury verdict didn't comply with law?
speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="75.089" stopTime="79.203">
    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    Well, in the sense that every element of the offense charged was not included.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="79.203" stopTime="87.098">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but that isn't in the form of a jury... that isn't in an ordinary jury verdict, that they find every element of the offense, is it? 
    They simply find a person guilty or not guilty.
speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="87.098" stopTime="88.359">
    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    That is true.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="88.359" stopTime="90.180">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And that was done here, was it not?
speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="90.180" stopTime="95.015">
    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    Yes, except that it was done in the context of jury instructions that did not instruct the jury--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="95.015" stopTime="101.648">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, yes, but that's a little different than saying the jury rendered a flawed verdict in the sense of some defect in the form of the verdict.
speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="101.647" stopTime="141.234">
    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    --Our contention is not with respect to the actual form. 
    It is with respect to the fact that, as this Court held in Gaudin, a verdict of guilty necessarily means a verdict that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, and in this case it is undisputed that the... one of the elements of that crime was explicitly removed by the trial court from the jury's consideration. 
    It is in that respect, and as this Court explained in Gaudin, without an element... without a jury finding on each element of the crime with which the defendant is charged, there is no verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and if there is no verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, as this Court held in Sullivan there is no object upon which the harmless error doctrine--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="141.234" stopTime="146.025">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    In Sullivan the failure wasn't to give an instruction about reasonable doubt, was it not?
speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="146.025" stopTime="146.746">
    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    --Yes, it was.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="146.746" stopTime="151.529">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And there, one could say that the jury had not found anything the way it should have.
speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="151.529" stopTime="193.189">
    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    Actually, in our view the error in this case provides an even clearer example of the type of error that cannot be subject to harmless error scrutiny than was present in Sullivan. 
    As The Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out in his concurring opinion in Sullivan, at least in that case the jury, there could be room for some argument as to whether or not the defective reasonable doubt instruction impacted the jury's deliberations, whereas... and in the concurring opinion, Your Honor drew a distinction with the case in which an element is explicitly removed. 
    In the case of an element that is taken away from the jury, there is no room for speculation, because it is clear that the jury did not, in fact, render a complete verdict within the meaning of the Constitution.

    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    --It would depend. 
    In light of this Court's decision earlier this year in Johnson v. United States, there would have to be a timely objection to the instruction. 
    In other words, the instructional error would have to be preserved for appellate review in order for the harmless error doctrine to even be potentially applicable, otherwise the plain error doctrine would apply and, as this Court held in Johnson, under those circumstances the analysis would be quite different, so in our--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="300.457" stopTime="327.836">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, the plain error doctrine as enunciated in Olano refers back to the Atkinson case and says you don't reverse if the reversal would seriously... unless it would seriously affect the fairness and integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. 
    How do you think a reversal here would affect the public perception of judicial proceedings where your client admitted the element that you say is missing?

    --I--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You know, that's what harmless error's all about, is technical things like that.
speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="332.418" stopTime="402.505">
    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    --I would like to answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice, in two ways. 
    First, Olano presented a circumstance in which there was no objection and so therefore, as this Court held in Johnson, the constitutional objection is forfeit. 
    In other words, the analysis is entirely governed by Rule 52. 
    And as far as the second part of your question, though, as far as the public perception, the reason why reversal is required when an element is omitted from the trial court's instructions and where there is a contemporaneous objection to the instructional error is because it is the right to the jury trial itself that is at stake. 
    When the... and in addition to that, what is also at stake when a trial court removes an element of the offense charged, as occurred in this case, effectively what is happening is that the trial court is directing a verdict in favor of the State as to that element. 
    It is taking the element away from the jury. 
    And when the appellate court, as occurred in this case, is faced with the removal of an element, and decides that to look at the evidence and make its own finding as to whether the element was established beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    The problem, as this Court explained in Sullivan, is that the wrong entity is judging the defendant guilty.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="402.505" stopTime="414.643">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Your rule would carry over to the States, too, I suppose, so that any failure on the part of a State court to charge on some element of a crime would be Federal constitutional error.
speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="414.643" stopTime="419.396">
    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    If the jury does not find the element that was omitted--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="419.396" stopTime="426.541">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, ordinarily juries don't find special verdicts. 
    They find general verdicts.

    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein

    Chief Justice Rehnquist

speaker="javier_h_rubinstein" startTime="444.272" stopTime="451.188">

    To give an example of entrapment, the burden of production that would be necessary on the part of the defendant to trigger the defendant's entitlement to a defense instruction like entrapment would be subject to appellate review. 
    But if an appellate court concludes that the burden of production was satisfied and that the defendant did have a right to have the instruction given to the jury, it would not be within the power of the appellate court to declare the omission of that instruction harmless because the appellate court has reviewed the evidence and decided that, in fact, no reasonable jury would have found that entrapment existed.

    In other words, if the judge had said, now, wait a minute, you can admit that if you want to, and we'll take it away from the jury if you understand that you are waiving your jury trial right and there's a burden of proof and so on, the kind of Boykin thing.

    It would make no difference if the defendant openly confessed on the stand that he or she committed the crime. 
    The Government concedes in its brief that if a defendant were to break down on the stand and openly concede guilt of the crime it would not be harmless for the judge to discharge the jury and enter a judgment of conviction.

    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    I'll give you an example. 
    The... a silencer as I understand it looks very similar to a flash suppressor, which is also an item that is attached to a gun. 
    A flash suppressor is not subject to registration requirements. 
    It is not defined as a firearm, and the two objects can look highly similar. 
    And so it is possible, and particularly when the silencer is not attached to the weapon itself it is not necessarily clear that someone will know that the cylinder that they have is a silencer.

    Justice Breyer 
    Well, you might think it's a grenade launcher. 
    [Laughter] 
    Right? 
    But if that's so, I don't understand... I really don't understand this. 
    As I read these instructions it seemed to me that they did instruct the jury that the jury is supposed to find exactly what Staples says they're supposed to find. 
    At most, it's ambiguous. 
    What the first thing is, jury, you have to find that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm as defined above. 
    Well, that's right. 
    That's what we said in Staples. 
    You have to know that the machine gun is that kind of thing which the statute is talking about, not a soap box derby racer. 
    It's a thing that looks like this, that has... et cetera, and the defendant has to know that, and they just said you have to know it. 
    And then, on the other instruction, it says it is not necessary for the Government to prove that the defendant knew the item described in the indictment was a firearm which the law requires to be registered. 
    In other words, that's ambiguous, but it's certainly able... and my natural reading is, defendant, you don't have to know that that thing, which you do know is the very thing described in section 5845, you do not have to know the fact that there's a statute called 5845 which makes it illegal to possess it. 
    Now, that's a natural meaning of that. 
    Now, given that, what we have here is not an omission. 
    What we have is an instruction that is ambiguous as to whether or not it does or does not tell the jury what we said in Staples was an element. 
    Therefore, if you are right, every ambiguous instruction ever given by any judge in the United States legal system is suddenly going to be absolutely unreviewable for harmless error, and that, of course, seems like quite a far-reaching proposition.

 Therefore, if you are right, every ambiguous instruction ever given by any judge in the United States legal system is suddenly going to be absolutely unreviewable for harmless error, and that, of course, seems like quite a far-reaching proposition.

 Well, you might think it's a grenade launcher. 
 [Laughter] 
 Right? 
 But if that's so, I don't understand... I really don't understand this. 
 As I read these instructions it seemed to me that they did instruct the jury that the jury is supposed to find exactly what Staples says they're supposed to find. 
 At most, it's ambiguous. 
 What the first thing is, jury, you have to find that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm as defined above. 
 Well, that's right. 
 That's what we said in Staples. 
 You have to know that the machine gun is that kind of thing which the statute is talking about, not a soap box derby racer. 
 It's a thing that looks like this, that has... et cetera, and the defendant has to know that, and they just said you have to know it. 
 And then, on the other instruction, it says it is not necessary for the Government to prove that the defendant knew the item described in the indictment was a firearm which the law requires to be registered. 
 In other words, that's ambiguous, but it's certainly able... and my natural reading is, defendant, you don't have to know that that thing, which you do know is the very thing described in section 5845, you do not have to know the fact that there's a statute called 5845 which makes it illegal to possess it. 
 Now, that's a natural meaning of that.

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The question in this case is not whether a criminal defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on every element of his offense. 
    He is. 
    The question is whether a defendant is entitled to an appellate remedy if the district court erroneously failed to instruct the jury on an element that the defendant admitted in open court. 
    In this case, the question is, at bottom, whether petitioner is entitled to reversal on the ground that the jury was deprived of an opportunity to find that he was not telling the truth when he testified under oath that he knew that a silencer was a silencer.

    Mr. Jonathan E. Nuechterlein 
    The question is ultimately whether he was subjected to some kind of procedural unfairness. 
    That is the foundational principle of the Court's harmless error jurisprudence. 
    And it's one thing for a defendant to claim that he has been subjected to procedural unfairness at his trial if the jury hasn't been given an adequate opportunity to test the credibility of the Government's evidence on some issue, but it's quite another thing for a defendant to claim that his trial was unfair if the jury wasn't given an opportunity--

    That depends on whether you consider it to be an ipso facto unfairness not to have a jury pronouncement that you committed all the elements of this crime. 
    I don't think it's unfair, procedurally unfair to say to somebody who comes in and says yes, I did all of the things that constitute the element of the crime, but I want to plead not guilty, I don't think it would be procedurally unfair for the judge to say, get out of here, you admitted it all. 
    You've admitted you're guilty. 
    Go to jail. 
    That's not procedurally unfair. 
    But unfortunately, the man has a right to a jury trial, and even though he's admitted it, you have to have a jury say he did it.

 That depends on whether you consider it to be an ipso facto unfairness not to have a jury pronouncement that you committed all the elements of this crime. 
 I don't think it's unfair, procedurally unfair to say to somebody who comes in and says yes, I did all of the things that constitute the element of the crime, but I want to plead not guilty, I don't think it would be procedurally unfair for the judge to say, get out of here, you admitted it all. 
 You've admitted you're guilty. 
 Go to jail. 
 That's not procedurally unfair. 
 But unfortunately, the man has a right to a jury trial, and even though he's admitted it, you have to have a jury say he did it.

    Mr. Jonathan E. Nuechterlein 
    --Well, I think there is an important distinction, Justice Scalia, between a total and a partial deprivation of any constitutional right. 
    For example, it is categorically unfair and reversible per se to deny someone counsel at his trial, but if counsel's appointed, and that counsel sleeps through nine-tenths of the trial, the inquiry then becomes whether there's been some particularized unfairness of the trial as a result of the counsel's failure. 
    And the same principle is applicable here. 
    The Court has distinguished between total deprivations of Sixth Amendment rights and partial deprivations. 
    Sullivan itself is an example of that. 
    In Sullivan, it was held to be categorically reversible if there is no... if there's no finding beyond a reasonable doubt on any of the elements, but by contrast, in the cases where this Court has addressed burden of proof errors that relate only to individual elements, it has held that harmless error analysis is applicable.

    In the normal question when we apply a harmless error analysis, we ask, can it be found beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict. 
    What we are asking is, did they return a verdict on the necessary elements despite the fact that there was an error, and sometimes the answer is, sure, because we can tell from what they found, assuming they followed the rest of the instructions, that they must have covered this point as to which specifically the instruction was inadequate. 
    But we can't do that in the case that at least we're assuming we have here in which there was a complete omission of any reference to the element, and it is not claimed that in finding some other element, or some other subsidiary fact, they must have found this element. 
    So the harmless error analysis is functioning, if it is applied here, I think, in an essentially different way from the way it functions in the normal case.

    I think... it is true that in the context of instructional errors in a typical case, it is the appropriate rule. 
    The question is whether or not the error had an effect on the jury's deliberations, but those cases all dealt with contested issues, and the defendant's claim was that the jury wasn't given an adequate opportunity to assess the credibility of the Government's evidence. 
    We have a quite different case here, where the defendant's claim is that the jury wasn't given an adequate opportunity to find that he had lied, in effect, about the element that he admitted under oath.

    Now, the only standard that I've been able to find that might do it is, you'd look to Olano, which is a different context, and you'd say, it is harm... you can't look for harmless error.

 So you agree in that case. 
 All right. 
 Then there are only three possibilities. 
 One is, you don't agree and it's never... you always look for harmless error. 
 The second possibility is that if it's an element of the offense that's omitted, it's never harmless error, and the third possibility is something in between, where you don't think the first two, so you must think something in between, and as to when the omission of the element is, per se, bad, no matter if it's harmless, and when it isn't. 
 Now, the only standard that I've been able to find that might do it is, you'd look to Olano, which is a different context, and you'd say, it is harm... you can't look for harmless error. 
 It's per se harmful. 
 It's structural... if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

    --Centrality is not an important part of our test. 
    What is important is that the jury have... play a role in the determination of guilt or innocence, and if the jury does do that and finds every element of the offense correctly described under the appropriate burden of proof, then the district court's failure to instruct the jury on an element that the defendant admitted under oath can be harmless error.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, part of your discussion with Justice Breyer I think is fairly academic. 
    I mean, if there's an omission of a central part of the charge, whether you say it's never subject to harmless error review or whether you say it's never harmless under a harmless error review may be a nice question for academic discussion, but it comes out the same way.

    Mr. Jonathan E. Nuechterlein 
    I think it does, and the... it is also the case that where the jury has not addressed an issue like that it may very well be that the error is not harmless. 
    In fact, I would imagine that is the case in almost all the circumstances, but that's not what we have here. 
    What we have here is a defendant who asked the jury to accept his statement of fact with respect to his own state of mind, and then, on appeal, has predicated his claim for reversal on the premise that he may have been lying when he told the jury what he told them.

    --I... again, I think it comes down to your question of procedural fairness, which is what the harmless error doctrine is all about. 
    It's one thing for a defendant to argue that his trial was unfair because the district court didn't give the jury enough of an opportunity to assess the credibility of the Government's evidence, no matter how compelling that evidence may seem on appeal, but it's quite another thing for a defendant to claim that his trial wasn't fair because the jury didn't have an adequate opportunity to find that his trial testimony, an issue within his knowledge, was false.

    Well, I... I mean, I think that it is always the role of a reviewing court to determine what the facts of the case are, and there is no particular impediment in determining that he testified about some... about his own state of mind, which is an issue within his peculiar knowledge, and that he did so under circumstances where there was no question about whether he was telling the truth. 
    In other words, this is a case where, if his admission was false, it was knowingly false. 
    If it was false, it was because he lied on the stand at trial. 
    I think it's also... I mean, it's significant to think about what would happen if this trial were... if in fact his conviction were reversed and a new trial ordered. 
    The new trial would not be about this element at all, because the testimony of his admission here would be introduced, and presumably he wouldn't contest it. 
    In fact, in his reply brief, he alleges that this is an essential element of his defense. 
    What he wants is a new trial so that he can have an... a second bite of the apple on all of the elements that he did not admit under oath at his first trial and that the jury resolved against him at his first trial.

    Mr. Nuechterlein, just a couple of clarifications. 
    In the court of appeals' opinion, the court of appeals says, as discussed above the district court, over defense objection, refused to inform the jury that the Government had the burden of showing Rogers knew the item in questions were firearms under the act. 
    In the question presented in this case, in the cert petition, the petitioner says that the trial court, over the objection of the defense counsel, the timely objection of defense counsel, refused to instruct the jury that the Government as an element of the offense charged was required to prove that petitioner knew the item in question was a firearm within the meaning of the statute. 
    Now, does the Government concede that the failure to object that the silencer was a firearm is an error?

 Mr. Nuechterlein, just a couple of clarifications. 
 In the court of appeals' opinion, the court of appeals says, as discussed above the district court, over defense objection, refused to inform the jury that the Government had the burden of showing Rogers knew the item in questions were firearms under the act. 
 In the question presented in this case, in the cert petition, the petitioner says that the trial court, over the objection of the defense counsel, the timely objection of defense counsel, refused to instruct the jury that the Government as an element of the offense charged was required to prove that petitioner knew the item in question was a firearm within the meaning of the statute. 
 Now, does the Government concede that the failure to object that the silencer was a firearm is an error?

    Mr. Jonathan E. Nuechterlein 
    --The error in this case was the district court's failure to tell the jury that it had to find... I guess I'm just not understanding your question. 
    It had to find that he knew that the silencer was a silencer, that he knew the silencer possessed the characteristics that made it a firearm within the meaning of the act.

   Rebuttal of Javier H. Rubinstein

    Mr. Javier H. Rubinstein 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    First of all, pointing to the same passage that Justice Thomas just read from, the court of appeals did find, as a predicate to its opinion, that the element in this case was omitted from the trial court's instructions. 
    And at page 10 of the Government's brief in the court of appeals it said that the instruction did not pass post Staples muster insofar as it explicitly withdrew from the jury's consideration the issue of appellant's knowledge that the firearm he possessed fell within the statutory definition.
