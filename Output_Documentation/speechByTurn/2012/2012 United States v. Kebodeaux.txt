    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    In 1999 a Special Court Martial convicted Anthony Kebodeaux, who's a member of the Air Force of a sex offense. 
    In 2006, after he served his sentence and had been discharged from the Air Force, Congress enacted a new law called SORNA to Registration Act, which requires those convicted of federal sex offenses to register in States where they live, work or study. 
    And subsequently, Kebodeaux failed to satisfy that law. 
    He didn't register properly. 
    He was convicted of violating SORNA, but the Fifth Circuit held that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to apply SORNA to Kebodeaux. 
    In that circuit's view, Kebodeaux, having completed his sentence and left the Air Force before the act was passed, was henceforth, no different no different from any other person in America, and Congress could not enact SORNA and apply to him simply because he once violated the Federal Law. 
    We do not agree with the Fifth Circuit's conclusion. 
    At the time, Kebodeaux committed his crime, and well before he was released, he was subject to a different federal registration law namely, the Wetterling Act. 
    That act imposed civil registration requirements upon him that were really the same or virtually the same as those that the later-enacted SORNA applied. 
    So, Congress possessed adequate constitutional authority to pass Wetterling Act under Article I, military regulation and the broad necessary and proper clauses. 
    So, when Kebodeaux was released, he was not the same as every other American. 
    He was different from most other Americans, because he was subject to the requirements of the Wetterling Act and that difference in our view, means that at a minimum, that the same constitutional clauses that gave Congress the power to continue to subject Kebodeaux to the same requirements or basically the same, that were in SORNA. 
    We explain our reasons more fully in our opinion. 
    We reverse of this circuit's judgment. 
    The Chief Justice and Justice Alito have each filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Scalia has filed the dissenting opinion and Justice Thomas has filed the dissenting opinion in which he is joined by Justice Scalia.
