    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    This case concerns the preemptive scope of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, its acronym F4A, an Act about motor carriers, not airplanes. 
    The F4A bar state laws related to a price, route or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property. 
    The question presented is whether that provision precludes state law claims stemming from the storage and disposal of towed vehicles. 
    We hold it does not. 
    Respondent Robert Pelkey owned a Honda Civic which he parked in the lot of his apartment complex. 
    Tenants were required to remove their cars in the event of a snowstorm so the snow could be cleared. 
    When it snowed heavily in February 2007 and Pelkey failed to remove his car, his landlord engaged Dan's City Used Cars to tow and store the Honda. 
    At the time and unknown to Dan's City, Pelkey was suffering from a grave medical condition. 
    Soon, thereafter, he had surgery, suffered a heart attack, and remained hospitalized for two months. 
    New Hampshire's Abandoned Motor Vehicle Law allows storage companies to dispose of unclaimed cars if efforts to locate and notify the owner fail. 
    Relying on that law, Dan's City set an auction date of Pelkey's car. 
    Pelkey learned of the upcoming auction upon his discharge from the hospital. 
    Two days, prior to the schedule of auction, Pelkey's attorney notified Dan's City that Pelkey wished to reclaim the car and would pay charges due for towing and storage. 
    Dan's City nevertheless proceeded on its disposal course. 
    Attracting no bidders at the auction, Dan's City traded the car away. 
    Receiving no proceeds from the sale, Pelkey sued Dan's City in New Hampshire state court. 
    He alleged that in selling his Honda, Dan's City failed to meet requirements of New Hampshire's Abandoned Vehicle Law. 
    Consequently, Pelkey sought damages under New Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act and common law. 
    The trial court granted summary judgment to Dan's City holding that Pelkey's claims were preempted by the F4A, but the New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed that judgment. 
    The F4A does not preempt Pelkey's suit, the higher court held, because his claims did not relate to the transportation of property or to a motor carrier's service. 
    We affirm the judgment of the New Hampshire Supreme Court. 
    The F4A, as I said a moment ago, preempts state laws related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property. 
    Pelkey's claims are not preempted because they do not concern the transportation of property. 
    He seeks redress for Dan's City's disposal of his vehicle after transportation by towing had ended. 
    Pelkey raises no objection to the manner in which his car was moved, nor does he question the price of the tow. 
    He seeks compensation only for what happened once the car ceased moving and was stored. 
    Furthermore, Pelkey's claims are unrelated to the service a motor carrier offers its customers. 
    The transportation service, Dan's City provided, was the removal of Pelkey's car from his landlord's parking lot. 
    That service, which did involve the movement of property, ended months before the conduct of which Pelkey complains. 
    We note the one-way street on which Dan's City seeks to travel. 
    The towing company relies on New Hampshire's Abandoned Vehicle Law to justify selling the Honda, yet it would stop Pelkey from invoking that very same law to demand Dan's City's compliance with owner protective provisions of the law. 
    We note finally that via the F4A, Congress sought to prevent states from impeding the free flow of trade and transportation in interstate commerce. 
    State law claims concerning the disposal of stored vehicles are a long distance from Congress' driving concern. 
    This Court's decision affirming the New Hampshire Supreme Court's judgment is unanimous.
