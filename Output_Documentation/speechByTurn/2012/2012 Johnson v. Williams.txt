    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    The question in this case concerns the meaning of the phrase “adjudicated on the merits and the provision of the federal habeas statute”. 
    This question, which implicates the standard of review in federal habeas proceedings, arises when a state court is arguably presented with a federal claim but does not address that claim in an opinion that, while denying relief, discusses other claims. 
    Applying our decision in Harrington versus Richter, we hold that in these circumstances, there is a strong but rebuttable presumption that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits. 
    We further hold that this presumption was not rebutted in the present case. 
    Therefore, the decision of the Ninth Circuit is reversed. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.
