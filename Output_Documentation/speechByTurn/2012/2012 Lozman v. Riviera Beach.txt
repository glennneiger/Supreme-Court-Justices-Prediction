    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Fane Lozman who is the petitioner here owned a floating home. 
    It consisted of a house-like plywood structure with French doors on three sides. 
    It contained a sitting room, bedroom, closet, bathroom, and kitchen along with a stairway leading to a second-level office space. 
    An empty build space underneath the main floor kept it afloat. 
    The home could not propel itself across the water, but it could be towed. 
    And it was towed a few times over several years from one marina to another, eventually ending up docked at a marina owned by the respondent, The City or Riviera Beach, Florida. 
    After several, rather heated disputes, the city brought this lawsuit against Lozman in Federal Court for dockage fees and trespass. 
    It invoked the Court's Admiralty Jurisdiction and the presence of Admiralty Jurisdiction, the lower court say, “Depends upon whether Lozman's floating home is a vessel,” as that term is defined in Title I of the United States Code, Section III. 
    The lower court said that it was a vessel. 
    And with the hope of resolving certain differences among the lower courts about to how to determine what is and what is not a vessel, we agreed to hear this case. 
    Now, the statute defines “vessel” as including, “Every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.” 
    To go to the bottom line, we conclude that Lozman's floating home falls outside this definition. 
    It is not a vessel. 
    In explaining why that is so, we have attached two pictures to today's opinion comparing Lozman's home with a wharf boat of a kind that this Court, many years ago, also held was not a vessel. 
    And even though a picture is worth a thousand words, we have written a few words of explanation as well. 
    We explained that the Court should not interpret the statutory phrase as if it covered virtually every artificial contrivance that floats. 
    They must avoid reading the statute, and we say some have not avoided reading the statute, as if it covered, for example, a wooden washtub, a swimming platform on pontoons, a door taken off its hinges, or Pinocchio inside the whale. 
    We believe the courts must interpret the statute in a practical way in light of its focus upon transportation, which is more than mere movement. 
    We state that often, as here, the proper test will be whether a reasonable observer, looking to a structure's physical characteristics and activities, would consider it to be designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things on water. 
    And applying this test, we hold that Lozman's home falls outside the statute's language capable of being used for transportation on water. 
    Lozman's home was structured like a normal home, not like a boat designed to carry people or things from place to place. 
    It was not capable of self-propulsion. 
    It had been towed significant distances only twice in seven years. 
    It was cumbersome to move it over the water. 
    On at least one occasion, a second boat followed along to prevent Lozman's home from swinging dangerously from side to side while being towed. 
    And then, there is the picture. 
    I need say no more. 
    We reverse the contrary determination of the Eleventh Circuit. 
    Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which she is joined by Justice Kennedy.
