    Justice Elena Kagan 
    This case concerns the preemption of trucking regulations at the port of Los Angeles. 
    It's our second case this term about the preemptive scope of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act or FAAAA. 
    That's quite a lot of A's, so I'm going to call it F4A for short. 
    The Los Angeles Port is the largest port in the country. 
    It's run by a Board of Harbor Commissioners under a city ordinance known as a tariff. 
    The port owns marine terminal facilities which at leases the terminal operators that load and unload cargo from docking ships. 
    Short-haul trucks called drayage trucks assist in those operations by moving cargo into and out of the port. 
    In 2007 and response to neighbors concerns about traffic pollution and safety, the port implemented a clean truck program. 
    As part of that program, the port developed the standard form agreement containing a number of requirements. 
    Two of those requirements are important here. 
    One requires trucking companies to display a placard on each truck with a phone number for reporting concerns. 
    The other requires companies to submit an off-street parking plan. 
    The other provisions of the agreement deal with things like a company's financial capacity, truck maintenance, and employment of drivers. 
    To make sure the drayage companies enter into the agreement, the poor amended it's tariff which again, that's municipal law to make it a criminal offense for a terminal operator to grant access to any company that didn't sign the agreement. 
    Each violation is punishable by up to six months in prison. 
    The petitioner here, American Trucking Association or ATA is a trade group that represents most of the trucking companies at the port. 
    ATA filed suit arguing primarily that the F4A preempts that is invalidates the placard and parking requirements in the agreement. 
    The District Court found out that neither provision was preempted and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 
    Today we reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision and hold that the placard and parking provisions of the agreement are preempted. 
    The F4A preempts any state or local provision having the force and effect of law that deals with trucking prices, routes, or services. 
    That's so those matters are the special providence of the federal government. 
    We've held in the past that language of that kind, the force and effect of law language, draws a line between a government's exercise of regulatory authority and its own proprietary participation in a market. 
    Actions that fall on the regulatory side of the line are preempted. 
    The Congress has made a decision that states and localities are not to be involved in those matters, but those on the proprietary side of the line where the state or locality is operating just as a commercial actor would or not preempted. 
    Now, the boundaries of that line might sometimes be fuzzy, but the outcome here is quite clear. 
    The port exercise classic regulatory authority. 
    It forced terminal operators and through them trucking companies to alter their conduct by means of a criminal prohibition backed by the treat of imprisonment. 
    That counts as action having the force and effect of law if anything does. 
    There is also another question in this case whether our decision in a -- in a case called Castle versus Hayes Freight Lines, prevents the port from enforcing other none preemptive provisions of the agreement by borrowing trucks from the port. 
    But we decide not to decide that question today. 
    The case comes to us in a pre-enforcement posture and on the current record, we cannot tell what the ports enforcement scam really is. 
    We will address that question if and when we have to after the port begins to enforce its agreement. 
    Our opinion is unanimous. 
    Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion.
