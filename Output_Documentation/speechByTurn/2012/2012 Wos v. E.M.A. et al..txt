    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    The second case is No. 12-98, WOS versus EMA. 
    When a Medicaid beneficiary is injured and later receives a tort judgment or settlement. 
    The Federal Medicaid statute requires states to seek reimbursement for the amount of the money the states expended for the beneficiary's medical care, at the same time, the Federal Medicaid statute prohibits states from placing a lien on any portion of the tort recovery not designated as payments for medical care. 
    A North Carolina law says that one third of any beneficiary's tort recovery represents payment for medical care. 
    Of course the state's share is capped so its recovery is the lesser, the full amount of its expenditure or one third of the beneficiary's tort recovery. 
    The question is whether this law is consistent with the anti-lien provision in the federal statute. 
    Respondent, E. M. A. and her parents sued her physician in a hospital where she was born after she suffered multiple serious birth injuries that left her deaf, blind and with little mobility. 
    She requires between 12 and 18 hours of skilled nursing care per day. 
    The lawsuit sought damages for E. M. A. and for her parents. 
    Though the damages sought were over $42 million, the suit was settled with the assistance of a mediator for $2.8 million and this amount apparently was driven in large part by the amount of insurance coverage that was available. 
    Under the statute here at issue, the state statute, North Carolina demanded one third of this amount as reimbursement for its expenses. E. M. A. and her parents argued that the state's one third rule violates the Medicaid anti-lien provision. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that this North Carolina's law is invalid. 
    This Court agrees. 
    In the opinion filed today, the Court concludes that the federal anti-lien provision does preempt North Carolina's irrebuttable statutory presumption. 
    In an earlier case from this court called Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services versus Ahlborn, the Court held that the Federal Medicaid statutes says both the floor and the ceiling on a state's potential share of the beneficiary's tort recovery through federal law that requires an assignment to the state the right to recover the portion of a settlement that represents payments for medical care. 
    But that same federal law also prohibits the state from taking any part of the remainder of the settlement. 
    Under North Carolina statute however, when the state's Medicaid expenditures exceed one third of the beneficiary's tort recovery, the statute establishes a conclusive presumption that the one third of the recovery represents compensation for medical expenses. 
    North Carolina's law in some circumstances would permit the state to take a portion of the Medicaid beneficiary's tort judgment or settlement not designated for medical care. 
    The law sets forth no process for determining what portion of the beneficiary tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses. 
    Instead, the state has picked arbitrary percentage, and by statutory command labeled that portion of the beneficiary's tort recovery is representing payment for medical care. 
    The state may evade preemption through creative statutory interpretation or description. 
    The Court's opinion in Ahlborn contemplated the possibility of an allocation. 
    It envisage that a judicial or administrative proceeding would be necessary where a beneficiary and the state cannot agree on what portion of the settlement represents compensation for medical expenses. 
    North Carolina's irrebuttable one size fits all presumption is incompatible with the federal statute. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas joined.
