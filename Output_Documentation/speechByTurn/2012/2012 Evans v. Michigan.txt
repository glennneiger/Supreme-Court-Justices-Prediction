    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    This case concerns the right of a criminal defendant not to be retried after he has acquitted of an offense. 
    Petitioner Lamar Evans was charged with arson under a Michigan statute that criminalizes burning a building or other real property. 
    The State's evidence at trial showed that the burned building was an unoccupied house. 
    When the State rested its case, Evans moved for a directed verdict of acquittal. 
    He pointed the trial court to the applicable pattern jury instructions which stated that an essential element of this offense is, “That the building was not a dwelling house.” 
    That act is covered by a different statute. 
    Because the state have failed to prove that the building was not a dwelling house, the trial court acquitted Evans. 
    It turns out that the trial court was wrong. 
    Under Michigan law, it is not necessary to disprove the greater offense of burning a house in order to establish the lesser offense of burning a building. 
    So, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed. 
    The Court also held that retrying Evans would not violate the double jeopardy clause, because he had not actually been acquitted. 
    The Court reasoned that the acquittal was not really an acquittal, because it was based on the States, fairly, had a proven an element of the offense that was not actually an element at all. 
    The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed. 
    We now reverse. 
    Our cases have long established that there can be no retrial following an acquittal, even if the acquittal was based upon an egregiously, erroneous foundation. 
    The reason is that the double jeopardy clause protects a defendant's interest in having his guilt or innocence decided only once. 
    Thus, we have held that an acquittal precludes retrial even when, for example, it is premised on a mistaken understanding of what evidence would suffice to sustain a conviction or upon a misconstruction of the statute, defining the requirements to convict. 
    In essence, an acquittal is any ruling that the prosecution's proof is insufficient to establish a defendant's criminal liability. 
    That is what the trial court ruled here. 
    As in our previous cases, the court's ruling was based on an antecedent legal error, but this ruling still went to the ultimate question of Evans' innocence or guilt. 
    Under our case law, it was therefore an acquittal that bars retrial. 
    The Michigan courts distinguished our previous cases on the ground that they involved the erroneous resolution of an actual element of the offense, whereas, here, no actual element of the relevant statute was resolved at all. 
    We failed to perceive a meaningful difference. 
    Whether we call a trial court's error, the misconstruction of an element of the offense as in our previous cases or the erroneous addition of an element of the offense as we have here, the defendant is declared not guilty because of the State's failure to prove some facts, it was not actually required to prove. 
    In both cases, the trial court has resolved the bottom line issue of the defendant's culpability and that is all that matters. 
    The State in the United States make additional arguments in support of affirmance, which we reject, for reasons discussed fully in our opinion. 
    They also asked us to reconsider our past decisions. 
    We declined to do so because our precedent has not become so unworkable as to justify overruling and the logic of our cases still hold. 
    Because Evans was acquitted, there should have been no appeal by the State. 
    The judgment of the Michigan Supreme Court is therefore reversed. 
    Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion.
