    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I have the opinion of the Court this morning in case 11-1347, Chafin against Chafin. 
    This case involves an international child custody dispute, but the question we resolve today is not which parent gets custody of the child. 
    It is instead whether an American court still has jurisdiction in the case when the child in question has been taken out of this country and it is not clear whether the Court could do anything about it. 
    The United States has signed a treaty known as the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. 
    If there is a custody dispute between parents in different countries, that treaty generally provides that the custody will be determined in the child's -- and this is a term of art, country of habitual residence. 
    If one of the parents has taken the child away from that country or prevented the child from returning to it, the other parent can get an order directing that the child be returned. 
    Jeffery Chafin is a member of the U.S. Military. 
    When he was stationed in Germany in 2006, he married a Scottish woman by the name of Lynne Hales. 
    Together, they had a daughter whom we will call E.C. Short time later, Mr. Chafin was sent to Afghanistan and Ms. Chafin took E.C. to Scotland. 
    When Mr. Chafin came back to the United States, specifically Alabama, Ms. Chafin and E.C. eventually came to join him, but the marriage degenerated and Mr. Chafin filed for divorce in Alabama Court. 
    As those proceedings went on, Ms. Chafin was deported. 
    She'd overstayed her visa and E.C. remained in Alabama with Mr. Chafin. 
    But then Ms. Chafin filed suit in federal court asking the judge to order that E.C. be returned to Scotland pursuant to the Hague Convention. 
    Ms. Chafin came back to the United States for a hearing, at the end of which, the District Court ruled that E.C.'s country of habitual residence was indeed Scotland and that Ms. Chafin could take her back. 
    Ms. Chafin and E.C. got on a plane headed to Scotland within hours. 
    Mr. Chafin appealed, but the Court of Appeals dismissed his case as moot because E.C. was in Scotland, the Court of Appeals thought that it was powerless to grant Mr. Chafin any remedy even if he were to win. 
    The District Court then ordered Mr. Chafin to reimburse Ms. Chafin for her attorney's fees and travel expenses to the tune of $94,000. 
    Now, the Constitution tells us that federal courts may only adjudicate real cases or controversies. 
    Federal courts do not engage in empty gestures, but so long as it's possible for a court to grant some effectual relief, there is still a case or controversy and the case is not moot. 
    Here, it is possible for courts to grant effectual relief to the winner. 
    Mr. Chafin seeks an order that E.C. be return to the United States. 
    Ms. Chafin argues that he will not win on that claim, but that argument goes to who is right on the merits. 
    The mootness issue is whether if Mr. Chafin is right, any court order remedy would be effective. 
    Now, on that point, Ms. Chafin argues that Mr. Chafin's requested remedy would not be effective because Scotland would ignore any U.S. order that E.C. be sent back, maybe. 
    But U.S. courts have the power to order people who have appeared before them to take certain actions even if they are outside the country and courts can back up those commands with sanctions. 
    So, an order that E.C. be return to the U.S. would bind Ms. Chafin and she might decide for a variety of reasons to comply. 
    She might refuse to comply of course, but that does not make this case moot. 
    Courts can issue orders even though it is unclear whether they will result in actual relief. 
    For example, a court can order a person to pay damages of $100,000 even though that person is broke. 
    As long a decision could have some impact, as long as the person might be able to pay something someday, the case is not moot. 
    Now, Mr. Chafin also wants the order that he pay Ms. Chafin $94,000 overturned. 
    Again, Ms. Chafin argues that Mr. Chafin will not succeed because he did not separately appeal that order, but that's beside the point. 
    Remember, for mootness purposes, we ask whether if Mr. Chafin succeeds, the relief ordered will be effectual, it would be. 
    Relief in the form of not having to pay $94,000 would not be entirely satisfactory to Mr. Chafin. 
    His daughter would remain in Scotland. 
    But $94,000 is $94,000 and it's enough to keep the case alive. 
    For these reasons, the Court of Appeals should not have dismissed this case as moot. 
    Instead, it should have decided it. 
    We send the case back to the court below to do just that. 
    Our opinion ends by noting how important it is that these cases be decided as quickly as possible. 
    The best interest of the child demand that custody proceedings begin promptly and nothing about our ruling today prevents that, quite the opposite. 
    We think that if these cases did become moot between trial and appeal, courts might grant stays in virtually every case holding up the effectiveness of their opinion to prevent parties from loosing any right to appeal, but then children would loose precious months when they could've been readjusting to life in their country of habitual residence. 
    Instead, we think courts should carefully balance several factors, including the best interest of the child in deciding whether or not the grant stays pending appeal and courts should take every effort to decide these cases as quickly as possible so that stability can be returned to the lives of these children and their parents. 
    Our opinion is unanimous. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Scalia and Breyer joined.
