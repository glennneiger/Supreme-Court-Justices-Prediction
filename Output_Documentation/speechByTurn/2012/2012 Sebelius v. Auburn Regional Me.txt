    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Hospitals providing Medicare services may pursue an administrative appeal from the initial determination of the amount of reimbursement they qualify to receive from the Department of Health and Human Services. 
    This case concerns the time within which the internal appeal maybe pursued. 
    Under the Medicare Act, a government contractor, known as a fiscal intermediary, annually determines the reimbursement amount due each hospital in the intermediary's area. 
    A hospital that disagrees with the intermediary -- intermediary's calculation, the Medicare Act provides -- may appeal to an -- to an administrative body called the Provider Reimbursement Review Board. 
    Such an administrative appeal, the Act specifies, must be brought within a 180-day timeframe. 
    In 1974, HHS adopted a regulation allowing the board to extend the 180-day period for a maximum of three years if the hospital shows good cause for the appeal-filing delay. 
    But three years is it. 
    The regulation wins. 
    No appeal filed after that time will be entertained. 
    In 2006, the board released a decision in an appeal timely brought by a hospital that is not a party to this case. 
    In that decision, the board determined that the intermediary's reimbursement calculation was flawed because the Government had not given the intermediary the best available data. 
    Many other hospitals were similarly disadvantaged by the government's flawed calculations and likely had been underpaid for the Medicare services they provided. 
    The hospitals in this case sought to piggyback on the board's determination in the timely appealed case. 
    Their appeal, however, was brought more than a decade after the 180-day clock ran out. 
    To overcome this obstacle, the hospitals invoked a doctrine called equitable tolling. 
    “The clock should be stopped,” they urged, until the Government's use of faulty data came to light. 
    The board refused to consider the untimely appeals. 
    Under -- under the HHS regulation, the board observed three years was the maximum stretch permissible. 
    The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed. 
    There is a presumption, the appellate court said, that equitable tolling applies to limitation periods stated in federal statutes. 
    Under that presumption, the court ruled, it was open to the hospitals to argue to the board that in fairness, they should be allowed to present their long post-deadline appeals. 
    We reversed the Court of Appeal's judgment. 
    First, we agree with both parties and the DC Circuit that the statute's 180-day limit on provider appeals is not jurisdictional. 
    That is, it does absolutely preclude HHS from allowing appeals once 180 days runs out. 
    But we also hold that the regulation which puts a firm three-year limit on late appeals was within the bounds of HHS' authority under the Medicare Act. 
    But we need to type the 180-day statute -- statutory deadline jurisdictional, it would mean that under no circumstances could the board hear and appeal outside the 180-day window. 
    Consequently, HHS' provision of a three-year outer limit would fall. 
    The language Congress used does not support such an iron bar to late appeals. 
    Several of our recent decisions confirm the directions like the statutory 180-day limit are claimed processing rules, not jurisdictional barriers. 
    There is a next question and it is dispositive of this case. 
    Given that HHS could adopt the three-year for good cause dispensation, could the department legitimately say, “This much, three years, but no more.” 
    Our answer is, “Yes.” 
    The presumption of equitable tolling relied on by the DC Circuit generally applies to limitations on commencing suit in Court. 
    We have never applied the presumption to an agency's deadline for appeals inside the agency and we declined to do so for the provider appeals that issued here. 
    The presumption of equitable tolling is based in part on the premise that Congress ordinarily attends to allow such tolling, but that premise is inept in this context. 
    The regulation as just observed, controls what goes on inside an agency, not what leeway, a court can allow when a case travels from agency to a court. 
    The time prescription before us has remained in place for nearly 40 years. 
    Congress amended the underlying statutory section six times in that period without indicating any disapproval of the regulation. 
    We further note that unlike some administrative review -- review schemes, the Medicare provider appeal system applies not to vulnerable unsophisticated individuals. 
    Rather, it applies exclusively to sophisticated, well-counseled institutions, who -- who we'd like to participate in the Medicare system and do so with notice of HHS' regulations. 
    We hold in some that the regulation at issue is a permissible construction of the administrative appeal scheme, Congress enacted, hence HHS acted within its authority when it declared the hospitals' administrative appeals time-barred. 
    The Court's opinion is unanimous. 
    Justice Sotomayor has filed a concurring opinion.
