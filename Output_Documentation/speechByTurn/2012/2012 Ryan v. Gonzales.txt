    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Ryans -- Ryan versus Gonzales comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    Tibbals versus Carter comes to us in a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    In the first case, Ryan versus Gonzales, Valencia Gonzales, a death row inmate in Arizona, sought Federal Habeas Relief. 
    His counsel moved to stay the proceedings on the grounds that Gonzales was mentally incompetent and that his incompetence prevented him from rationally communicating with or assisting counsel. 
    The District Court denied a stay finding that the claims before it were record-based on resolvable as a matter of law and thus, would not benefit from Gonzales' input. 
    Gonzales then sought a Writ of Mandamus in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    The Ninth Circuit applied its recent decisions in Nash versus Ryan and Rohan versus Woodford, and concluded that Section 3599 of Title 18 of the United States Code gave Gonzales the right to stay pending competency proceedings. 
    In the second case, Tibbals versus Carter, Sean Carter, death row inmate in Ohio, likewise initiated Federal Habeas proceedings but eventually moved for competency determination and a stay of proceedings. 
    The District Court granted the motion because it found Carter incompetent to assist counsel. 
    Relying on the Ninth Circuit's decision in Rohan, the Court determined that Carter's assistance was needed in order to develop four of his claims. 
    It thus dismissed as habeas petition without prejudice and perspectively told statute of limitations. 
    On appeal to Sixth Circuit relying in part on our decision in Rees versus Peyton found a statutory right to competence in Section 4241 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code which provides a mechanism for competency determinations in certain situations. 
    It thus ordered that Carter's petition be stayed indefinitely with respect to any claims requiring his assistance. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse in both cases. 
    The Ninth Circuit located a right to competency in Section 3599, which grants federal habeas petitioners on death row, the right to federally funded counsel, but nothing in the text of the statute provides habeas petitioners with the right to stay of proceedings when they are found to be incompetent. 
    Furthermore, we have never held that a right to competence is a component of the right to counsel. 
    We, therefore, will not assume that Congress embedded a right to competency-based stays within Section 3599's right to counsel. 
    The Ninth Circuit first identified the right to competency-based stays in Rohan, concluding there that a petitioner's mental incompetence could have eviscerate the statutory right to counsel in federal habeas proceedings. 
    But given the backward looking record-based nature of Section 2254 proceedings, counsel can generally provide effective assistance to a habeas petitioner regardless of the petitioner's competence. 
    Moreover, our decision in Rees versus Paton, which involved an incompetent death row inmate's attempt to withdraw his petition for certiorari offers no support for Gonzales' position because Rees did not so much as suggest the possibility of a statutory right to competence, much less hold that such a right exist. 
    The Sixth Circuit's approach is similarly incorrect. 
    Section 4241 does not provide a statutory right to stay of federal habeas proceedings based on a petitioner's incompetence. 
    The Sixth Circuit based its holding largely on a misreading of our decision in Rees, which as noted, did not recognize such a right. 
    Moreover, Section 4241 does not apply to federal habeas proceedings. 
    By its own terms, it applies only to federal trial proceedings before sentencing and “at anytime after the commencement of probation or supervised release.” 
    Federal habeas proceedings fall into neither of these categories. 
    As part of their inherent power to manage their dockets, District Courts ordinarily have the authority to issue stays where a stay would be a proper exercise of discretion. 
    We hold that a stay is generally unwarranted however when a petitioner raises only record-based claims subject to review under Section 2254(d), because counsel may present such claims regardless of the petitioner's competence. 
    We also hold that indefinite stays are inappropriate because they frustrate the state's attempts to defend their presumptively valid judgments. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous.
