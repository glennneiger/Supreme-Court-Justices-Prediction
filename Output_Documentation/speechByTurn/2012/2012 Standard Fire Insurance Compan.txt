    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The second case is simpler. 
    It's called “Standard Fire.” 
    The Class Action Fairness Act provides that federal “District Court shall have original jurisdiction” of a civil “class-action” if among other things the “matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of five million dollars.” 
    The statute adds that to determine whether the matter in controversy exceeds five million dollars, the claims, including the claims of any proposed class member shall be aggregated. 
    In this case, a plaintiff filed a proposed class-action complaint in Arkansas State Court. 
    The defendants sought to remove the case to federal court. 
    The federal court aggregated the claims to those who fit the definition of the purported class. 
    The Court found that the aggregate amount exceeded five million dollars, but the Court, nonetheless remanded the case to state court because the plaintiff had also filed a stipulation in which he promised the damages would not exceed five million dollars. 
    This stipulation, the federal court decided, would assure that the sum or value of the claims would still, and nonetheless, fall below the five million dollar threshold. 
    In our view, however, the stipulation could not defeat otherwise proper federal jurisdiction. 
    Our reason is a simple one. 
    The stipulation was not binding. 
    The class had not yet been certified and a stipulation does not bind proposed class members prior to certification, thus the stipulation cannot assure that the sum or value of the claims will fall below five million dollars. 
    Our opinion sets forth the authority for these basic legal propositions and it explains our reasoning at somewhat greater length. 
    Our decision is unanimous.
