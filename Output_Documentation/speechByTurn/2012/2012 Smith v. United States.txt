    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    The petitioner, Smith, was indicted for crimes connected to his role in an organization that distributed illegal drugs in Washington, D.C. for about a decade. 
    Among other things, he was charged with two conspiracy crimes. 
    One, conspiracy to distribute narcotics and to poses narcotics with the intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. Section 846. 
    And two, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act to conspiracy, RICO, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1962(d). 
    At trial, Smith argued that the conspiracy counts were barred by the applicable five-year statute of limitations which is 18 U.S.C. Section 3282 because he was no longer a member of the conspiracy on the earliest date as to which that statute permitted prosecution. 
    The Court instructed the jury that “the relevant date for purposes of determining the statute of limitations is the date, if any, on which a conspiracy concludes or a date on which that defendant withdrew from that conspiracy.” 
    Over the defense's objection, the Court also instructed the jury that “once the government has proven that a defendant was a member of a conspiracy, the burden is on the defendant to prove withdrawal from a conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence.” 
    The jury convicted Smith of the conspiracy counts and the D.C. Circuit affirmed those convictions, we granted certiorari, and today, affirmed the D.C. Circuits' judgment. 
    Petitioner asserts that once he presented some evidence that he ended his membership in the conspiracy, prior to the statute of limitations cut off, it became the government's burden to disprove his affirmative defense of withdrawal. 
    This position draws support neither from the Constitution nor from the conspiracy and limitations statutes at issue here. 
    Allocating to the defendant, the burden of proving withdrawal, does not violate the Due Process Clause. 
    Our precedent established that unless an affirmative defense negates an element of the crime, the government has no constitutional duty to overcome the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    Withdrawal does not negate an element of the conspiracy crimes charged here, it terminates a defendant's liability for his co-conspirators' post-withdrawal acts but he remains guilty of conspiracy. 
    Moreover, withdrawal that occurs before the earliest date on which the statute of limitations permits prosecution does not render the underlying conduct non-criminal but merely non-prosecutable. 
    Thus, while union of withdrawal with a statute of limitations defense can free a defendant of criminal liability, it does not place upon the prosecution a constitutional responsibility to prove that the defendant did not withdraw. 
    As with other affirmative defenses, the burden is on him. 
    Of course even though the constitution does not place the burden on the prosecution, Congress may do so by statute. 
    It did not do so here. 
    Neither conspiracy statute at issue addresses the burden of proof for withdrawal, so it is presumed that the common law rule subsists. 
    Affirmative defenses are for the defendant to prove. 
    The analysis does not change when withdrawal is the basis for a statute of limitations defense. 
    In that circumstance, the government need only prove that the conspiracy continued past the statute of limitations cut off. 
    The burden of establishing withdrawal before that cut off rests upon the defendant. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed. 
    The Court's decision is unanimous.
