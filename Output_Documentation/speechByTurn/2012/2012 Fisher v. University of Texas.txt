Fisher v. University of Texas

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    In my view, the courts below adhered to this Court's path marking decisions and there is no need for a second look. 
    My dissenting opinion questions the -- the starting premise on which this case has proceeded. 
    Texas' top ten percent law requires public universities to admit any graduate of a Texas High School ranked in the top ten percent of her class. 
    Petitioner calls that law race-neutral and the Court accepts the characterization. 
    The diversity achieved by the top ten percent law, petitioner urges, is accomplished without resort to a racial criterion so the university has no constitutionally permissible basis for treating race as a relevant factor in reviewing individual admissions applications. 
    In truth, is the top ten percent law racially neutral in comparison to the university's explicit regard of race as one among many factors relevant to its educational mission? 
    Is it not blindness to race, but indeed race consciousness that drives percentage plans such as the one Texas has adopted? 
    But for de facto racial segregation in Texas' neighborhoods and schools, there would be no top ten percent law. 
    The Texas Legislature deliberately used the state's demographics primarily to achieve a measure of racial diversity in the state's public universities. 
    The notion that the top ten percent law is race-neutral calls to mind Professor Thomas Reed Powell's famous statement, “If you think you can think about a thing inextricably attached to something else without thinking about the thing to which it is attached, then you have a legal mind.” 
    Only that kind of legal mind could conclude that an admissions plan specifically designed to produce racial diversity is not race conscious. 
    I have several times explained why government actors including state universities need not blind themselves to the still lingering everyday evident effects of centuries of law sanctioned inequality. 
    Among constitutionally permissible options, I remain convinced, those that candidly disclose what they are doing candidly disclose their consideration of race as a relevant factor are preferable to plans that conceal or obscure what drives them. 
    Like so many educational institutions across the nation, the University of Texas modeled its admission plan after the law school policy approved in Grutter v. Bollinger and the Harvard plan referenced as exemplary in Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. 
    The Court rightly declines to cast off the equal protection framework settled ten years ago in Grutter. 
    Yet it stops short of reaching the conclusion that framework warrants. 
    Instead, the Court vacates the Court of Appeals' judgment and remands with the Court of Appeals to assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity. 
    As I see it, the Court of Appeals has already completed that inquiry and its judgment, trained on this Court's Bakke and Grutter path markers, merits our approbation.
