    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    The question in this is case is whether petitioner Salinas' Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination was violated when the prosecutor at his trial commented on his failure to respond to a police officer's question during a voluntary noncustodial interview. 
    We hold that petitioner's right was not violated. 
    I filed an opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy have joined. 
    We conclude that there was no Fifth Amendment violation in this case because petitioner failed to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege. 
    With limited exceptions that do not apply here, our cases have long required defendants to invoke the privilege in order to benefit from it. 
    Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Scalia joins. 
    Justice Thomas would not extend the Court's holding in Griffin versus California to a defendant's silence during a pre-custodial interview. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan have joined.
