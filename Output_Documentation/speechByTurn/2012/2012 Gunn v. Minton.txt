    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I have our opinion this morning in case 11-1118, Gunn versus Minton. 
    Legal malpractice cases typically go to state court. 
    Patent cases must go to federal court. 
    So, what about a legal malpractice case that arises out of the lawyer's mishandling of a patent case? 
    Now, different courts gave different answers to that question, so we granted review of this case from Texas to resolve that conflict. 
    Now, in most cases, it's pretty easy to tell which cases should go where. 
    If it's a state law that lets you sue, as in a malpractice case, you go to state court. 
    If it's federal law that gives you the right to sue, as in a patent infringement case, you go to federal court. 
    But there is a tiny group of cases where you can go to federal court even though it's the state law that lets you sue. 
    That's when The Court has to rule on a very important federal issue to decide the state law claim. 
    We had a case about a hundred years ago that has become the classic example of this. 
    The claim was that a bank could not purchase certain bonds because they were invalid. 
    That's a state law claim. 
    It should go to state court. 
    But the reason that the bonds were claimed to be invalid was that they were issued by the federal government and the federal government acted unconstitutionally in issuing them. 
    Now, in that case, we said that the federal issue had such broader significance to the federal system as a whole that the case could go to federal court even though the right to sue came from state law. 
    But this case isn't like that. 
    Now, it's true in deciding whether the lawyers were guilty of malpractice, the state court will have to opine on how the lawyers should've handled the patent case, a federal issue, but that will not have a significant effect on the federal patent system. 
    The patent case itself is over, the plaintiff lost. 
    Now, he may win his case claiming that his lawyers messed up, but that won't change the result in the patent case, nor will there be any broader effect on federal patent law. 
    Even if the state court makes a mistake in explaining how the patent case should've been handled, that will not disrupt the uniformity of federal patent law. 
    If the issue comes up a lot, the federal courts, where actual patent cases are brought, will clear out any confusion soon enough. 
    If the issue does not come up a lot, it was not an important one for the system as a whole in the first place. 
    So the state legal malpractice case goes to state court even though it is about malpractice in a federal patent case. 
    Our opinion is unanimous.
