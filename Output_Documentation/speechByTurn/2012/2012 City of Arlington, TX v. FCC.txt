    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    These -- these cases are here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    A landmark administrative law case, Chevron USA versus Natural Resources Defense Council established a proposition that when statutory text is ambiguous, courts will differ to reasonable resolution of that ambiguity by the agency charged with administering the statute. 
    Fifth Circuit precedent holds that this deference principle applies even to an agency's resolution of an ambiguity pertaining to its own statutory jurisdiction. 
    In this case, that precedent led the Court of Appeals to apply Chevron in a Court deference to a dispute over the scope of the Federal Communications Commissions' authority to administer the Communications Act. 
    We need not dwell on the details of that dispute which are set forth in the opinion because we granted certiorari only to answer a discreet question of law, namely, whether a court should apply Chevron to an agency's determination of its own jurisdiction. 
    We hold that Chevron applies equally whether or not an agency's interpretation of statute it administers can be termed jurisdictional. 
    We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit. 
    There is no distinction between an agency's jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional interpretations. 
    The jurisdictional, non-jurisdictional line is meaningful in the judicial context because Congress has the power to tell The Courts what classes of cases they have the power to decide that is to define their jurisdiction, but has no power to prescribe how they decide those cases. 
    But for agencies charged with administering congressional statutes, both their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress. 
    When they act improperly, no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires. 
    When a Court reviews an agency's interpretation of a statute it administers, the question is simply whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority. 
    There is no principle basis for carving out an arbitrary subset of jurisdictional questions from the Chevron framework. 
    That is why, as we explain in our opinion, we have consistently afforded Chevron deference to agency's constructions of the scope of their own jurisdiction. 
    A false dichotomy between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional agency interpretations would produce chaos squared in the federal courts. 
    Some judges would be confused, others tempted by the prospect of making public policy by fixing the meaning of ambiguous statutory commands. 
    The effect would be to transfer from the agencies that administer statutes to judges any number of interpretive decisions arched at typical Chevron questions about how best to -- to construe an ambiguous term in light of competing policy interests. 
    We have caution that “judges ought to refrain from substituting their own interstitial lawmaking” for that of an agency. 
    That is precisely what Chevron prevents and what a jurisdictional exception to Chevron would allow. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 
    Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Kennedy and Alito joined.
