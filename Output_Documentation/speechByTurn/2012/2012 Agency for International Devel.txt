    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I have our opinion this morning in case 12-10, United States Agency for International Development versus the Alliance for Open Society International. 
    In 2003, Congress passed a United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act. 
    That Act set forth a comprehensive strategy to among other things combat the spread of HIV/AIDS around the world. As part of that strategy, Congress appropriated billions of dollars to fund efforts by nongovernmental organizations to assist in the fight. 
    The money, however, comes with two related conditions First, no funds made available by the Act may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking. 
    And second, no funds may be used by an organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. 
    This case concerns the second condition referred to as the Policy Requirement. 
    The respondents are grant recipients under the Act who object to that requirement. 
    They work with prostitutes to try to stop the spread of AIDS and think that it will be hard to do that effectively if the prostitutes are afraid the organizations want to take away their livelihood. 
    The organizations claim that the Policy Requirement violates their First Amendment rights by compelling them to adopt a particular view on a matter of public concern. 
    Now, if the requirement were a direct regulation, it would of course violate the First Amendment. 
    The Government cannot tell you what to believe. 
    What makes this case hard is that the requirement is imposed only as a condition on the receipt of federal funds. 
    As the Government puts it, “If you do not like the requirement that you have a policy opposing prostitution, don't take the money.” 
    Under our cases, that answer is usually sufficient when it comes to funding conditions in general. 
    In some cases, however, we have said that a funding condition can give rise to a First Amendment violation that it's not enough to say, “Just don't take the money.” 
    The line that emerges from our cases and it is not a clear one is between conditions that regulate how the federal funds are to be used in the program and conditions that seek to leverage the funding to regulate speech outside the program. 
    So, where does the Policy Requirement fall? 
    It does not just tell an organization how it can use the funds. 
    If you remember, the first condition does that. 
    It says, “You can't use the funds to promote legalization or the practice of prostitution.” 
    The Policy Requirement does more. 
    It tells an organization what it must believe. 
    It must have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution. 
    That compelled belief goes with the organization wherever it goes. 
    The organization cannot say it has one belief when it comes to the federal program and the different belief when it is working on its own time and dime. 
    It is the very nature and purpose of the Policy Requirement that it apply outside the confines of the particular federal program. 
    The Government, therefore, cannot insist that organizations adopt the anti-prostitution policy as the price of obtaining Leadership Act Funds. 
    The Government says, “Organizations that receive funds under the Act should not be allowed to undermine the Government's policy opposing prostitution.” 
    But the Policy Requirement does not just say, “Don't do anything to undermine the government's policy.” 
    It says, “You must adopt the Government's policy as your own.” 
    Now as to that, we cannot improve on what was said in this courtroom, from this bench 70 years ago last Friday. 
    That was when Justice Robert Jackson announced the decision of this Court in the Flag Salute case. 
    He said, “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” 
    The judgment below has affirmed. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Thomas has joined. 
    Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
