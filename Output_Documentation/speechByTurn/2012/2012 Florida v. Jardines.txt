    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Come out from behind these briefs here. 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    The police received a tip that the respondent Joelis Jardines was growing marijuana in his home. 
    A surveillance team went to the home but saw nothing. 
    Two officers then took a dog trained to detect the smell of illegal drugs and approached Jardines' home. 
    The dog and his handler walked up to the front porch. 
    After sniffing around and going back and forth on the porch, the dog eventually sat down in front of Jardines' front door which is what he was trained to do upon finding the odor's strongest point. 
    The officers then secured a search warrant using what they had learned as establishing probable cause and marijuana plants were found in the home. 
    At trial, Jardines moved to suppress that evidence arguing that when the officers brought the dog up to his door, they had searched his home without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment. 
    The trial court agreed with him, so did the Supreme Court of Florida and so do we. 
    The Fourth Amendment protects the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
    This case does not concern what it means for a search to be unreasonable. 
    Rather, the question here is more fundamental. 
    What actions constitute a search? 
    The basic rule is that a search occurs for Fourth Amendment purposes when the Government physically intrudes for investigative purposes on one of the areas that the amendment protects, that is, intrudes on to persons, houses, papers, or effects. 
    Our later cases have supplemented this test but the basic approach keeps easy cases easy and by those lights, this is an easy case indeed. 
    First, there is no doubt that the officers physically intruded into an area protected by the Fourth Amendment. 
    In our law of search and seizure, the home is first among equals. 
    At the amendment's absolute core is the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from the state's gaze. 
    The area immediately surrounding the home which is called the curtilage has long been regarded as part of the home itself. 
    The police cannot without a warrant based on probable cause hang around on the lawn or in the side garden, trawling for evidence and perhaps peering into the windows of the house. 
    And the officers here had all four of their feet and all four of their companions planted firmly on that curtilage. 
    The front porch is the classic example of an area intimately associated with the life of the house. 
    The only remaining question is whether Jardines had given the officers permission even implicitly to be on his porch. 
    He had not. 
    It is true that by hanging a knocker on the front door, we implicitly invite visitors including the police to approach our homes in hopes of speaking with us. 
    But the scope of that invitation is limited to a particular place, to a brief duration, and just as importantly to a particular purpose. 
    No one is invited to come up to the home simply to snoop around. 
    No door-to-door salesman would think himself licensed to stand on the front porch and peer into the windows. 
    And no neighbor would think it proper to slip a metal detector around the front lawn before coming to the door and asking permission. 
    The officers here were on the porch to gather evidence, nothing more, and we have no trouble concluding that the social norms that invite a visitor to the front door do not extend that far. 
    We therefore need not and do not decide whether the officers violated the reasonable expectations of privacy approach described in Katz versus United States, that the officers learned what they learned only by gathering evidence in a constitutionally protected area is enough to know that a search occurred. 
    The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is affirmed. 
    Justice Kagan has flied a concurring opinion in which Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor joined. 
    Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Kennedy and Breyer joined.
