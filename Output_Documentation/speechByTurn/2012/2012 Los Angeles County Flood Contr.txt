    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    This case involves the meaning of “discharge of a pollutant” as that term is used in the Clean Water Act. 
    Petitioner Los Angeles County Flood Control District operates a municipal separate storm sewer system or MS4. 
    An MS4 is a drainage system that collects, transports, and discharges stormwater. 
    Stormwater is often heavily polluted. 
    The Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations therefore require MS operators like the Los Angeles District to obtain a permit before discharging stormwater into navigable waterways. 
    Respondents, two environmental advocacy groups, filed a citizen suit against the District under the Clean Water Act. 
    Their complaint alleged that water quality measurements from monitoring stations in the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers showed that the District was not operating in accord with its permit. 
    The US District Court granted summary judgment to the District on those claims, but the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 
    The monitoring stations for the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers, the Court of Appeals said, are located in concrete channels controlled by the District and constructed for flood-control purposes. 
    Stemming from this impression, the Court of Appeals held that the District had discharged pollutants in violation of the Clean Water Act. 
    The discharged occurred, the Ninth Circuit concluded, when polluted water detected at the monitoring stations flowed out of the concrete channels and into downstream portions of the waterways lacking concrete linings. 
    We had a certiorari to decide the following question. 
    Does the flow of water from an improved portion of a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of the same waterway qualify under the Clean Water Act as a discharge of pollutants? 
    The parties in the United States, as amicus curiae, agree and the opinion released today holds that the answer to this question is no and that means the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed. 
    Our holding follows ineluctably from our decision in South Florida Water Management District v. Miccosukee Tribe. 
    We held then Miccosukee that the transfer of water between a canal and in a nearby reservoir would count as a discharge of pollutants under the Clean Water Act only if the canal and the reservoir were meaningfully distinct water bodies. 
    Homing in on the terms of the District's permit, respondents alternatively argue that the exceedances detected at the monitoring stations sufficed to establish the District's liability for its upstream discharges. 
    This argument was made and failed in the Ninth Circuit because it is not embraced within the narrow question on which we read its certiorari. 
    We do not address it. 
    Our decision reversing the Ninth Circuit's judgment and remanding is joined by eight members of the Court, Justice Alito concurs in the judgment only.
