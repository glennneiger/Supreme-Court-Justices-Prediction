    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Monsanto invented and then patented a genetic modification that enables soybean plants to survive exposure to glyphosate, the active ingredient in many herbicides. 
    Monsanto calls seeds carrying this trait, Roundup Ready seeds. 
    Monsanto will only sell Roundup Ready seed to farmers who sign a licensing agreement. 
    That agreement allows farmers to plant one and only crop of soybeans from the Roundup Ready seed they purchase. 
    The farmer can then consume the harvested beans or sell them as a commodity. 
    But the farmer cannot do according to the agreement is saved and replants the soybeans he harvests. 
    The petitioner in this case, Vernon Bowman, is a farmer who likes Roundup Ready technology. 
    For his first soybean crop each year, Bowman purchased Roundup Ready seed from a Monsanto affiliate and complied with the terms of the agreement, I just described. 
    But for his riskier, second soybean crop of each season, Bowman wanted a way to rip the benefits of Monsanto's technology without paying its premium prices. 
    The answer, Bowman decided, lay and buying seeds from the local grain elevator. 
    Soybeans from a grain elevator are meant for consumption, but because soybeans are themselves seeds nothing prevented Bowman from planting them. 
    And because most Indiana farmers used Roundup Ready seed, Bowman suspected that most of the grain elevator soybeans he purchased would carry the Roundup Ready trait. 
    He was right. 
    When Bowman planted the grain elevator soybeans and applied glyphosate to his fields most of the soybeans plants survived. 
    Bowman then saved seed from that crop of Roundup Ready beans for his second planting the next year, and Bowman repeated that process year after year for eight years. 
    So, he was able to produce eight crops a Roundup Ready soybeans all without buying any seed from Monsanto. 
    When Monsanto discovered this practice, it sued Bowman for patent infringement. 
    The question here is whether Bowman can defend against Monsanto suit based on what's called the ?doctrine of patent exhaustion. 
    Under that doctrine, the authorized sale of a patented article gives the purchaser or any subsequent owner like Bowman the right to use or resell that article without the patent holder's permission. 
    The District Court held a patented exhaustion did not protect Bowman's conduct and ordered him to pay damages to Monsanto. 
    The Federal Circuit affirmed. 
    We also agree. 
    We hold that patent exhaustion does not allow a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holders permission. 
    As I just explained, exhaustion prevents a patent holder from controlling the use or resale of a patented article after that article is sold. 
    The patent exhaustion has always been limited to the specific article sold. 
    It does not entitled the purchaser of a patented item to replicate that item at will. 
    That limit exists for a simple reason. 
    If anyone who bought a patented invention could make and sell new copies of that invention, then the patent would not be of much value. 
    That principle decides this case. 
    Here, Bowman bought soybeans, most of which contained Monsanto's invention. 
    He planted those beans, he applied glyphosate to the plants killing any that did not contain Monsanto's invention, and then he harvested the resulting Roundup Ready soybeans ending up with many, many more of those patented beans than he started with. 
    That is how you make new copies of a patented item when that item is a seed. 
    And so the exhaustion doctrine does not shield Bowman's activity. 
    If the rule were otherwise patents on seeds would be largely worthless because as soon as the first few seeds were sold, anyone else could reproduce and sell them. 
    Accordingly, we affirm the Federal Circuit, our opinion is unanimous.
