    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    In this opinion for the Court as the Chief Justice indicates by -- written by Justice Breyer, the bench announcement is as follows. 
    Last year, in Martinez versus Ryan, the Court was faced with an Arizona prisoner who asserted that his trial lawyer provided constitutionally ineffective assistance, but before he came to the federal court seeking habeas release â€“ relief on that claim, the prisoner had procedurally defaulted that claim in the state court. 
    Under Arizona state law, he was forbidden to raise the claim on direct repeal. 
    The state instead required him to raise a claim in a state habeas proceeding. 
    But the petitioner had failed to do so. 
    This was because he said of his lawyers default. 
    So, under the rule that this Court had earlier said out in Coleman versus Thompson, the federal courts could not consider the merits or the petitioner's ineffective trial-counsel claim because that default took place during his first state habeas proceeding, rather than on state direct review. 
    But remember, that in the Martinez case in Arizona procedural rule prevented him from raising the inadequate trial-counsel claim on direct review. 
    It required the prisoner to raise the claim of trial ineffectiveness in his state habeas proceedings. 
    So on Martinez we reasoned that a narrow exception to the Coleman rule is necessary. 
    Otherwise, the prisoner might be deprived of any review at all of his ineffective assistance of trial-counsel claim. 
    And so, we decided that in Arizona a procedural default would not bar a federal habeas court from hearing the prisoner's substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if in the State's initial collateral review proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that initial collateral review proceeding was ineffective. 
    In the case decided today, we are faced with the prisoner from Texas. 
    Like the prisoner in Martinez, he asserts that his trial lawyer provided ineffective assistance. 
    And like the prisoner in Martinez, he has procedurally defaulted that claim. 
    And like the prisoner in Martinez, this prisoner asserts that his procedural default is due to the ineffectiveness of his initial state habeas lawyer. 
    But here at Texas, unlike Arizona, does not require prisoners to race ineffective assistance of trial-counsel claims on state collateral review, rather on its face, Texas law permits prisoners to bring such claims on direct review and we must decide whether this difference matters. 
    We conclude that it does not. 
    As explained in detail in today's opinion, the Court concludes that the Texas system does not offer most defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal. 
    As a practical matter, a typical defendant will not be able to race such a claim in Texas into state collateral review proceedings. 
    And so, we conclude that the law should treat the Arizona and Texas systems similarly. 
    The Martinez exception applied to the Arizona system should also apply in Texas. 
    We vacate the Fifth Circuit's judgment to the contrary and remand the case before the proceedings. 
    Those proceedings can determine, in the first instance, where the Trevino's trial counsel ineffectiveness claim is substantial and whether he was provided ineffective assistance in his initial state habeas proceeding. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which he is joined by Justice Alito. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which he is joined by Justice Thomas.
