    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    The second case is Adoptive Couple versus Baby Girl, No. 12-399. 
    This case involves the custody of a young girl who through her biological father has some Native-American Ancestry. 
    Specifically, we are told she is 3/256 Cherokee and as a result falls within the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. 
    Before the child was born, her biological father refused to provide any support for her mother even though he was able to do so and he sent the mother a text message giving up his parental rights. 
    The mother arranged for the baby to be adopted and the biological father initially signed papers stating that he did not object to the adoption. 
    However, he later changed his position and sought custody. 
    The South Carolina Supreme Court held that certain provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act required the child at the age of 27 months to be taken from the only parents she had ever known and handed over to the biological father. 
    We hold that the Federal Act does not support this result. 
    A provision of the Indian Child Welfare Act 25 U.S.C. Section 1912(f) bars involuntary termination of a parent’s rights in the absence of a heightened showing that serious harm to the Indian Child is likely to result from the parents “continued custody of the child, the key phrase there is continued custody.” 
    We hold that this provision does not apply when, as in this case, the relevant parent never had custody of the child, continued custody cannot be terminated if there never was any custody in the first place. 
    Another provision of the same statute, Section1912 (d), conditions involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that remedial efforts have been made to prevent the “Breakup of the Indian family.” 
    We hold that this provision is inapplicable when, as in this case, the parent abandoned the Indian child before birth and never had custody of the child. 
    In that situation no Indian family is broken up. 
    Finally, we clarify that Section 1915(a) which provides placement preferences for the adoption of Indian children does not bar a non Indian family like adoptive couple from adopting an Indian child when no other eligible candidates have sought to adopt the child. 
    We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court and remand for further proceedings. 
    Justice Thomas and Justice Breyer have filed concurring opinions. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Justice Sotomayor has also filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg and Kagan have joined and in which Justice Scalia has joined and in part.
