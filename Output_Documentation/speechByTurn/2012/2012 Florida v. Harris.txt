    In this case, a drug detection dog alerted at a truck, signaling the drugs were inside. 
    The question we consider is how a Court should determine whether that kind of alert provides a police officer with probable cause to search the vehicle. 
    Our opinion first discusses the wrong approach and then describes the right one. 
    Officer William Wheetley pulled over a truck with an expired license plate while on patrol with Aldo. 
    A dog trained to detect certain narcotics. 
    After the driver, Clayton Harris, refuse to consent to a search. 
    Wheetley had Aldo sniffed the drug's exterior the truck's exterior. 
    In a way, this Court has previously approved. 
    Aldo alerted at the driver side door. 
    On that basis, Wheetley decided he had probable cause to search the truck. 
    And in that search, he found illegal ingredients for making methamphetamine. 
    Harris challenged the search is legality, arguing that Aldo's alert did not give Wheetley the probable cause to search. 
    The Florida Supreme Court agreed. 
    At first, he said that a dog's alert provides probably cause only if the dog is a reliable detector of narcotics. 
    And then it held that to show the dog is reliable, the state must produce extensive documentary evidence on a variety of matters including statistics about how the dog has performed in the field. 
    How many times the dog's alerts have lead to the discovery of drugs and how many times they have not. 
    Because Wheetley didn't have those records, the Court held, he didn't have a sufficient basis to search Harris's truck. 
    Today, we reverse that decision. 
    We agree that a dog must be reliable for its alert to provide probable cause for a search, but we disagree with the Florida Supreme Court about how to establish the dog's reliability. 
    In evaluating, whether police have probable cause, we have rejected rigid rules in favor of a flexible inquiry into the totality of the circumstances. 
    The Florida Supreme Court's approach was wrong first and foremost because it required the states to tick off every item in a lengthy evidentiary checklist in order to show probably cause. 
    That's inconsistent with our instructions to balance all the evidence relevant to reliability in a more holistic way. 
    Making matters worse, the Court treated records of a dog's field performance as the gold standard in evidence. 
    When in most cases, those records have relatively limited import. 
    That's because a dog might have been right to alert even if no drugs are found. 
    Maybe the drugs were too well-hidden or maybe they would just recently remove and the dog responded to a lingering odor. 
    For reasons like that, the better way to asses a dog's reliability is through the controlled testing that is a standard part of training and certification programs. 
    The Florida Court put too much weight on the dog's field performance and too little on its certification and training. 
    We make clear today that a Court should evaluate a dog's reliability in the same way it assesses probable cause and other contexts. 
    By the telling the state to put on its best case, allowing the defendant to rebut it, and then weighing all the evidence presented. 
    If the State has offered evidence that a dog performs reliably in finding drugs in controlled testing environments and the defendant has not contested that showing, then the Court should fine probable cause. 
    If the defendant has challenged the state's case by contending, for example, that the dog was inadequately trained or that the officer improperly cued the animal, then the Court should balance that evidence against the states. 
    The ultimate question is whether all the facts surrounding a dog's alert viewed through the lens of common sense would make a reasonably prudent person to think that a search would reveal evidence of a crime. 
    Here, that test was satisfied. 
    The state offered ample evidence of Aldo's training and his superior performance in controlled testing. 
    Harris did not contest that evidence and offered no other valid reason to think that Aldo was not a reliable detector of drugs. 
    Accordingly, the Florida Supreme Court should have found probable cause. 
    Our decision is unanimous.
