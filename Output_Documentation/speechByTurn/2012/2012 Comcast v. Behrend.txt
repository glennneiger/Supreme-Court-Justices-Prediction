    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    In this dissent, the others agree with Justice Ginsburg and I will try in a minute to explain why I think when we ignore our usual procedure of practice is we risk going quite seriously wrong of a substantive subject here as monopolization. 
    So, to explain and imagine a roughly analogous case, suppose a plaintiff were to claim that the defendant company through exclusionary practices had obtained 90% of the market for the product in California. 
    And the defendant says, “Well, California buyers because of that are paying 13% more for the products in buyers in other places.” 
    Then the plaintiff introduces an expert and he produces a model. 
    And the model shows that California buyers pay 13% more for the product than others do and that the explanation after he goes through all the possibilities are that the defendant does exercise unlawful monopoly power in California. 
    That's why they're paying more. 
    Now, that model, everybody I think would say, is at least evidence that the California buyers were hurt and they constitute an appropriate class of plaintiffs. 
    However, many there are who wants to buy the product. 
    Now, the case before us, in our view, in the dissent does not differ meaningfully from that example and the Court doesn't agree with that. 
    That's because they think the model works differently. 
    The Court points out that the plaintiffs did give four reasons or theories why other firms found it difficult to enter the market here in Philadelphia. 
    And the District Court did strike three of those reasons or theories as being invalid. 
    Now, the Court says, “That back means they have to reconsider the model,” but the District Court found explicitly that removal from of the three theories or reasons or whatever they were from the case didn't have anything to with the model. 
    Its creation was not premised on their viability. 
    In the District Courts words, “Whether or not we accepted all four theories is inapposite to Dr. McClave's methods and the Court of Appeals affirmed that.” 
    How Dr. McClave's model actually works is a matter of fact. 
    We don't normally disturb findings of fact in which two courts below have concurred and having looked to that model is like -- he had to do. 
    I believe those lower courts were actually right when they held here as a matter of how the model work, but like Justice Ginsburg, I think at a minimum and that's the more general point, at a minimum, we should not hold to the contrary without having the benefit of the parties argued the point specifically.
