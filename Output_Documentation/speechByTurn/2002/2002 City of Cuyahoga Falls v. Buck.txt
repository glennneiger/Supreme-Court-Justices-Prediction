    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    In 1995, the respondents purchased land zone for apartments in the City of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. 
    They submitted the site plan to the City Planning Commission proposing to build multi-family, low-income housing on the property. 
    The City Council eventually approved the plan but strong public opposition to the project eventually coalesced into a referendum petition drive calling for the repeal of the city ordinance authorizing the project. 
    Pursuant to the City Charter, the filing of the petition for referendum stayed the implementation of the site plan until the final vote on the referendum. 
    While the petition was the pending, the City refused to issue respondents the building permits necessary to begin the construction. 
    Respondents brought suit in Federal District Court alleging that the city by submitting the petition to the voters and refusing to issue the building permits gave effect to the discriminatory sentiment reflected in the public's opposition to the site plan. 
    Thus, violating the equal protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteent Amendment, as well as the Fair Housing Act. 
    The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the City and its officials. 
    The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed concluding that respondents had produced sufficient evidence to go to trial on each of its claims. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we reverse in part and vacate and remand in part that decision. 
    Respondents have not presented an equal protection claim capable of surviving summary judgment. 
    Neither of the official acts respondent challenge reflect the intent necessary to support equal protection liability. 
    Both the decisions to submit the referendum petition to the voters and the refusal to issue the permit while the petition was pending constituted non-discretionary ministerial acts consistent with the City Charter. 
    Respondents point to no evidence suggesting that these acts were motivated by racial animus, nor did they demonstrate that the allegedly discriminatory private motives that triggered the referendum drive can fairly be attributed to the City. 
    Respondents also fail to present a valid substantive due process claim. 
    We need not decide whether they possessed a property interest in the building permits denied them by the City, because the city's refusal to issue the permits while the petition was pending in no sense constituted a egregious or arbitrary government conduct in violation of substantive due process. 
    Moreover, our precedent forecloses respondent's claim that the City's submission of an administrative ordinance to popular vote was per se arbitrary. 
    The City's voters retained the power to govern through referendum with respect to any matter, legislative or administrative within the realm of city affair. 
    Finally, because the respondents now have abandoned their Fair Housing Act claim, we vacate that part of the Sixth Circuit's opinion and remand the constructions to dismiss the relevant portion of the complaint with prejudice. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion which Justice Thomas has joined.
