    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Fisrt case I have to announce is Chavez versus Martinez, No. 01-1444. 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    While respondent Martinez was being treated for gunshot wounds received during an altercation with police, he was interrogated by petitioner Chavez, a patrol supervisor. 
    At no point was Martinez given Miranda warnings. 
    Although he was never charged with a crime and his answers were never used against him in any criminal proceeding, Martinez filed a 1983 suit claiming that Chavez violated his Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself and as Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right. 
    The Ninth circuit affirmed the District court's ruling that Chavez was not entitle to qualified immunity. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceeding. 
    Chavez is entitled to qualified immunity as to Martinez's Fifth Amendment claim. 
    While the majority of the Court remands as to Martinez's Fourteenth Amendment claim, the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia and I would conclude that Martinez's Fourteenth Amendment rights were not violated. 
    The opinion is joined by the Chief Jjustice in full, by Justice O'Connor as to parts 1 and 2A and by Justice Scalia as to part 1 and 2. 
    Justice Souter has filed an opinion, part 2 of which is for the Court and is joined by Justices Stevens, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Breyer, and part 1 of which concurs in the judgment and is joined by Justice Breyer. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part in the judgment; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part; Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which Justice Stevens joins in full and Justice Ginsburg joins as to part 2 and 3. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurrring in part and dissenting in part that. 
    So, you can see I am a consensus builder.
