    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Michigan. 
    Before 1994, the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed States to charge interstate motor carriers operating within their borders annual registration fees of up to $10 per vehicle. 
    In the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Congress directed the ICC to create a new system called the Single State Registration System which caps state registration fee by directing the ICC to establish a fee system that would result in a fee for each participating state as equal to the fee not to exceed $10 per vehicle that such state collected their charge as of November 15, 1991. 
    The ICC ruled that under the new system, the States could not terminate reciprocity agreement that were in placed under the old regime. 
    To allow State to do so, the ICC concluded it would be inconsistent with the statute's fee-cap provision and what Congress' intent that the flow of revenue for the States be maintained while the burden of the registration system for the motor carriers be reduced. 
    We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether the Michigan Supreme Court erred in holding that the ICC's rule is inconsistent with the language of the fee-cap provision. 
    We hold that the ICC's interpretation of the Act's fee-cap provision is a permissible reading of the statutory language and reasonably resolves any ambiguity in it. 
    We therefore, defer to the agency's interpretation under the principles that established in Chevron U.S.A. versus Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. 
    The statute can easily be read as the ICC chose, making that unlawful for a State to renounce and modify a reciprocity agreement so as to alter any fee charge that collected as of November 15, 1991. 
    Under the ICC's rule, where a State waives its registration fee, its fee collected or charged is zero and must remain zero. 
    To allow States to disavow their reciprocity agreements that can permit States to increase their revenues substantially, a result that the ICC reasonably believes Congress did not intend. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.
