    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    If the Court please, the question involved in this litigation concerns the constitutional validity of two ordinances and petitioners' conviction there under. 
    The ordinances were enacted by the City of Little Rock, and by the City of North Little Rock, as amendments to what is known as their occupation license ordinance and they're set out -- we've set out the Little Rock ordinance on page 6 and 7 of the brief for petitioner but the ordinance of North Little Rock is identical. 
    This ordinance or these ordinances require that any organization operating within the confines of the municipality give on demand information concerning the organization to the City Council and on page 7 is a list of the things that the ordinance demands, the name of the organization, the official place of business, the name of the officers, the purpose, or purposes of the organization and Section E, the financial statement of the organization with fees and assessments and to whom such (Inaudible) paid in an affidavit from the president of the organization if it is an -- an affiliate of a national group of what that group is. 
    Pursuant to these ordinances, demands were made on petitioners here for the information.

    Now, insofar as we're concerned, this makes no difference since financial contributors includes the entire membership list.

    We -- we argued -- this case was -- was briefed and argued in the Supreme Court of Arkansas and at the -- at the trial of this case throughout the trial, as a requirement that the names and addresses of members and contributors be furnished. 
    We raised this issue in the Supreme Court of Arkansas contending that if the statutes that required this, it was a violation of the First Amendment rights. 
    The Supreme Court of Arkansas indicates, deals with this question that we've raised and indicates that this is no infirmity in the statute even though -- in the ordinance even though this is required. 
    So that, as far as our understanding of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, it is that the -- the this -- this -- the ordinance reaches membership list and contributions, but that -- in reaching it, it is -- it is being done as the -- the exercise of a valid taxing authority of the State -- of the City of North Little Rock and Little Rock and therefore, the breach of First Amendment rights is mere incidence of this and it has to be sustained.

    Yes sir. 
    The -- the -- I think that the confusion which is -- had come is because of -- that the respondent has contributed, is -- is saying that this section could be interpreted as to not to include a membership list. 
    Our view of this is that the Supreme Court of Arkansas has construed the statute as reaching members and contributors. 
    And it was so treated and therefore, insofar as this, as our problem before the Court is concerned, we are bound by that construction and the ordinance must be read as reaching that problem that there is no -- so that, the difference between members and contributors is not really before the Court.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Maybe this isn't the time to raise the question that is in my mind.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, the duty which the -- the trial court and the Supreme Court of Arkansas treated the duty on the petitioners as custodians of the records of the members -- membership list and the contributors list of the organization and assumed that the petitioners were being called upon to supply this information for the organization and that therefore, their failure to do so that the ordinance -- that they had violated the ordinance. 
    This is how -- this -- this is how the case was tried and this how the case was -- was decided both in -- in the trial court and in the -- and in the Supreme Court of Arkansas.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="691.691" stopTime="703.017">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker

speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="703.017" stopTime="752.401">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, I -- our -- our feeling on this is that insofar as the custodian of the membership list of an organization is concerned that the custodian is the person, since these -- these are penal -- is the penal statute that the custodian of the membership list on refusal to give up the membership list is -- if it is required that the custodian could be reached. 
    And we did not and the Court raised any issue with respect to the fact that whether they could reach the organization or the custodian of the membership list. 
    We took -- we -- we based the assumption on the fact that they -- that the custodian could be reached because having the membership list and refusing it that they could be reached by the statute and this is how -- this probably (Inaudible)

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="764.290" stopTime="785.367">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I notice also, Mr. Carter that the trial, it opened with the stipulation, I'm looking at page 5 and 6 between Mr. Kemp, apparently, attorney for the city and the attorney for Mrs. Bates which includes that the violation of the ordinance was -- and that it failed to supply the names of the membership of that organization.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="785.367" stopTime="786.606">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Yes, sir. 
    I --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="786.606" stopTime="787.511">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    He stipulated that --
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="787.511" stopTime="1003.892">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Yes, sir. 
    This was the -- this was the issue. 
    I might add, if the Court please, one other issue which I think that the respondents make which they cannot make at this stage of the proceeding on that -- that particular point. 
    They seek to argue that insofar as Mrs. Bates is concerned that her conviction can be sustained aside from the question of the validity of the demand for the membership list because they contend that Section E, that she did not comply with Section E by making a full statement to the -- to the -- which they say is demanded through the City Council. 
    This stipulation on -- on page 6, it seems to us forecloses that because the stipulation was that the only manner in which there had been a failure to comply with the ordinance was -- was the failure to give the membership list. 
    This is how the case was argued, briefed, tried and treated in the Supreme Court of -- of Arkansas. 
    And we do not think that the defendant respondents can at this stage of the litigation say that there is anything else in the case. 
    So, our contention is that the only issue in the case in terms of the failure to comply with the ordinance is whether petitioners were required to supply to the -- to the city the names and addresses of their members since they complied in all respects according to the stipulation at trial with every other phase of this -- of the ordinance which is now before the Court. 
    We make two contentions in -- in respect to this problem. 
    I might -- I might say if I will to complete the facts that both Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Williams were tried separately, that they were convicted and fined. 
    They -- appeals were taken to the Supreme Court of Arkansas where the cases, although separate, were consolidated because of the fact that they raised the same issue. 
    And the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that our contentions that these statutes are unconstitutional were without merit, with two justices dissented but with no opinion and the case is here. 
    I am advised the City of North Little Rock has not trialed in affirmance here, but Mr. Kemp, in representing the City of Little Rock since the statutes -- the ordinances are the same, I -- I think that the issues which are involved here can -- will be presented. 
    Now to -- back to the first question that Mr. Justice Stewart asked me about the differences, I think that what was a alluded to here was that the -- the arguments that I've just referred to that Mr. Kemp believes he can make and which I don't believe he could make here, and that is that there was compliance with the statute insofar as Mrs. Williams was concerned because she gave a more detailed statement in respect to her -- her financial statement which he indicates is required by Section E of the ordinance. 
    But our contention is that in view of the fact that there was -- has been has a stipulation that the only failure to comply with the ordinance was the failure to give a membership list that this contention can't be made and therefore, there is -- there -- there are no differences in the facts, the essential facts in this case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1003.892" stopTime="1006.907">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That stipulation was made in the Little Rock case not in the North Little Rock?
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="1006.907" stopTime="1159.309">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Yes, sir, made in Little Rock. 
    Now, we make briefly three contentions. 
    We contend first that if this is not tax ordinance, that it is unconstitutional in view of the fact that there is the demand for the names and addresses of members and contributors and therefore, that N.A.A.C.P. versus Alabama is controlling. 
    We contend that if it is tax ordinance as the Supreme Court of Arkansas has -- had held that it is a tax ordinance, that in the application of this ordinance to us that the Supreme Court of Arkansas has failed to meet the standards which this Court held must be met in this kind of situation in Speiser versus Randall. 
    We contend further that if the Court disagrees with our -- our -- with us and that this is a valid tax ordinance and that it has been applied without due process arguments -- without a due process argument being -- without being able to make a due process argument as to its application that nonetheless, the ordinance is unconstitutional in that, there is no reasonable relationship between the objective of the ordinance which is to determine tax status and the demand that the disclosure of names and addresses of members and contributors be given. 
    Now, the -- the first question that that is -- that this is which we -- it is our view that realistically, that this is not really a tax ordinance, the purpose of this act -- the purpose of this -- of this ordinance in both the Little Rock and North Little Rock was an effort to curb the activities of the N.A.A.C.P. branches in those areas because it has been found that the -- the most effective way to curb the activities of the association in areas in the South is by the publication, public disclosure of the names of the members and contributors because this has, as the record in this case discloses, fact is frightening things for people. 
    And what will happen is the people become afraid to participate in the organizational activities. 
    They are often as the record also discloses when they are so identified as Mrs. Williams and so forth, they are subject to various pressures. 
    So that, our view it is that this was the purpose of the ordinance.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1159.309" stopTime="1161.801">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    How do you show that, Mr. Carter?
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="1161.801" stopTime="1263.234">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, I want to -- I will come to this. 
    I think that -- I'm -- I'm talk -- what I'm trying to say is that this is realistically what we regard as the purpose and effect of the ordinance. 
    We went -- we attempted to indicate in the record to -- to obtain testimony from the -- from those who were the authors of the ordinance as to what its purpose was. 
    And in this, to attempt to show that in -- insofar as the purpose of the ordinance was concerned and that, that there was testimony in the record by the sponsors of the two ordinances, that what was desired was to -- in one instance to find out what was going on in the organization and secondly, to find out whether there were violations of gambling ordinance and so forth. 
    We believe, we don't to -- in order to show this, we think of course that from the -- from the stand point of the legal position, in which we are at the present time, we maybe required to accept and the -- the Court may not want to go behind the analysis of the ordinance which the Supreme Court of Arkansas has made up, and that is the -- the tax ordinance. 
    But our -- my argument was addressed to the fact that what I considered to be the realistic purpose of this ordinance that we call the "Bennet Ordinance" which is the -- the Attorney General of the State of Arkansas and there has been no reasons, we think, to support the ordinance on any tax for a tax purpose shown in this record or by the Supreme Court of Arkansas.

    So one could easily find out?
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="1389.906" stopTime="1928.179">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Yes, sir. 
    The -- I suppose that the most serious contention which has been made with respect to this ordinance is the -- the analysis of it by the Supreme Court of Arkansas. 
    The Supreme Court of Arkansas construes this ordinance as being an exercise of a valid taxing authority of the State. 
    Now, if I may bring the Court's attention to page 5 of our brief? 
    State of Arkansas, in 1947, enacted Section 19-4601, the pertinent portions of which we've set out on page 5 and top of page 6. 
    This was a grant to municipalities in the -- in the State of Arkansas of authority to secure from persons, firms and corporations engaged in various kinds of businesses and professions and callings in their respective communities, a privilege or a license tax for the -- for the privilege of doing business, of doing this kind of business within the confines of the city, an annual license tax. 
    The statute sets out that the -- this -- the municipalities are empowered to -- to levy the tax on the trade, on the -- on the character of the -- to differentiate of -- with respect to the character of the calling and they can levy it on the goods and stocks, but they cannot make a levy on -- on income or earnings. 
    Pursuant to this grant of authority, and I'm only going to discuss Little Rock because -- Little Rock of the ordinance because of the facts that as I've indicated, they are identical. 
    Little Rock enacted an ordinance, 7444 and this ordinance may set a various classifications of persons who were at trades, businesses and callings within the city. 
    This ordinance, a copy of which in the record in the clerk's office, we did not print it, levies a tax either a flat tax on it -- on a profession. 
    It levies a tax based upon the character of the business for example, a tax is graded in the on with respect to parking lot, the tax might be graded based upon the number of cars that are parked each day. 
    The tax on mechanic shops, the tax may be levied based upon the number of -- of persons who are employed. 
    There are -- in this particular statute, there are about a thousand classifications which are subject to tax. 
    In order to engage in the occupation listed, before you can engage in this occupation, you are required to pay this particular fee and to pay it annually. 
    The city collector then issues you a license in your name, indicated for what period it is supposed to operate and you are required that have this license on public display in your place of business and -- and if you are an attorney, you'll -- the license is supposed to be in your office. 
    Now this ordinance, 7444, was amended several times when various other businesses came into the city and added classifications where to -- were taxed. 
    The Supreme Court of the State refers to a Section 7809 and I would point out to the Court that on page 15 and 16 of petitioners' brief, we have listed the various amendments and where they will be found in the unprinted record. 
    17809, which the Supreme Court of Arkansas refers to, granted to charitable institutions, who engage in the business of manufacturing or selling, an exemption from the payment of the license tax. 
    Then the present ordinance with which we are now dealing was enacted, last year. 
    You will note that this ordinance recites that the -- and it's whereas clauses, that whereas many organizations claiming exception from 7444, the original occupation license tax, are that their claim of exemption is a mere subterfuge and that they are really operating for profit and therefore, this ordinance was passed in order to determine tax there. 
    The Supreme Court of Arkansas construes our position in this particular litigation as being that the N.A.A.C.P., one, is subject to -- to 7444 and its amendments. 
    In other words, that we are either engaged in an occupation or some kind of occupation which is subject to tax, and two, that we have claimed an exemption from the occupation. 
    There is no evidence in the record to establish by the city that; one, that the association has engaged in any occupation which is subject to license under this statute -- under these ordinances. 
    Two, there is no evidences in the record that we have claimed any exemption because of the fact that not being engaged in the occupation which was subject to license, we had no occasion to claim any exemption at all. 
    Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of Arkansas in its opinion presumes that we are seeking tax immunity and therefore that we are subject to the -- to this ordinance and therefore holds that we could be required to give up our membership list and therefore be required to comply with the ordinance. 
    We think that under this construction of the law and of the ordinance that this is clearly within the area which this Court condemns in Speiser versus Randall. 
    Our position is that if the City of Little Rock is to bring the association within the confines of this particular ordinance, it would have to show that we are engaged in some occupation which is subject to license. 
    And that we have either not paid it for the demand for -- for payment of a fee has been made upon the -- the N.A.A.C.P. that they have failed to do so and that they are claiming tax exemption and tax exemption from the payment of business. 
    We contend that this would have to be shown or else the application of the ordinance to us is a violation of due process. 
    It's clearly a violation of the standards which this Court said have to be met in the area of -- where free speech is involved as it was indicated in Speiser versus Randall. 
    Now, as far as we're concerned, we think that this was the construction placed on it, it was now placed within the ordinance, and the -- the ordinance has been invalidly applied to us for this reason. 
    But to -- to end on my final point, if the Court, and this we say that if the Court is persuaded, this Court is persuaded that the Supreme Court of -- of Arkansas in assuming that we, that the -- the organization was subject to the ordinance and in assuming that the organization was seeking a tax exemption without having any facts in the record upon which to base that assumption, if it could do that and not raise serious due process questions, then our contention is that the ordinance is still bad because 7444 which is an occupation license tax, as I had attempted to indicate applies to the character and kind of business or to the amount of stock and a determination as to whether or not an organization is invalidly seeking tax exemption from its application in our judgment, has nothing to do with the -- who the members are or anything of that kind. 
    It has to do with the activity of the organization and we say therefore that insofar as the ordinance seeks the disclosure of the names of our members and contributors that this does not further, what is the purpose of the ordinance and therefore at best, there can be no -- there is no reasonable relationship between the two and the statute must fall.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    No sir because our -- our as I've indicated, I think that the -- that under the grant of authority from the state, there can be no tax on income and therefore the -- the tax has to be on the occupation on what is being done. 
    And is now -- our -- our view is that the City of Little Rock under this grant of authority could levy a tax on -- on activity, on what is being done and that -- and that these -- these circumstances, if it made that kind of classification, this, under this grant of authority would be proper. 
    But since it cannot tax income, then it seems to us that there can be no possible relationship between the disclosure question which we think the raises the First Amendment questions and the objective which state seeks.

    But our understanding of the -- I think that actually, in the municipal court which is the record is not here, we, if I'm not mistaken, we made or attempted to make such a defense, but we were convinced that the law of Arkansas reached the individual custodian of the record in order to reach the organization. 
    And since our basic problem was the question of the free speech issue which we thought was the basic issue here, we do not pursue that at all. 
    So that, I'm in no -- frankly, I'm in no position to argue that question here because I am reasonably certain that is the stage of the proceedings that if -- if the question is present. 
    The question is present that as far as the petitioner is concerned, as far as we are concerned, that we have waived it in the court below and I don't think we're in a position to make that kind of argument before this Court.

    I might point out to the Court that we've taken the position insofar as we could in an attempt to comply as nearly as we could with these various regulations even though we might have a -- a constitutional claim except insofar as the question of our membership list was concerned. 
    We could have, we think take -- taken the position in this case that the ordinance had no application to us and that we would not give up any of the information which the ordinance demanded, but our view was that we should do as much as we could in compliance with this, except with the -- the basic issue which affects the freedom of association of our members and the -- the effective activity of the organization itself. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Joseph C. Kemp

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Kemp.
speaker="joseph_c_kemp" startTime="2323.122" stopTime="2596.869">
    Mr. Joseph C. Kemp 
    Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Counsel made reference to the distinction between the cases here and I'd like to make one reference to that as a City Attorney for the City of Little Rock, I can speak only for that City and do not propose to -- at all refer to the trial and the matter involved in the City of North Little Rock. 
    I do however have limited knowledge of certain -- certain testimony and matters of record in the North Little Rock case and that it is combined with our transcript. 
    We referred to a distinction between the two because specifically, one of the defender, rather the defendant in North Little Rock case as I remember, it has -- was privileged without the objection of the city to make statements regarding the adverse effect which the revealing of this information would have on the N.A.A.C.P. and her city, that is the new membership dried and possibly the loss of old members. 
    Those questions were not -- no testimony was made in the Little Rock case that was admissible. 
    It was read into the record that certain witnesses would have testified to facts concluding that this information if revealed would and possibly had affected their membership, but those are some of the distinguishing features which we think make the cases entirely different and therefore, we would confine ourselves to the Little Rock case only. 
    Mr. Carter confines his argument and I'm very surprised that he has, to the fact that this is not a tax ordinance. 
    We wonder what the Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas or how it could have made it more clear that this was an ordinance designed to aid the City of Little Rock in determining whether or not taxes were proper against alleged charitable and nonprofit organization. 
    Certainly, if in this case the N.A.A.C.P. were privileged to make a self-serving declaration and have it go by the Board without contest and without being able to pierce the veil and determine if the facts alleged therein were in fact true, if that were the case, then it is entirely possible that no revenue at all would be forthcoming. 
    They feel that its -- it is possible further that if they're unable to go behind this statement, a self-serving statement, that not only this organization, and I don't refer to the N.A.A.C.P. as -- I refer to it only because it's a petitioner in this case, because there were other organizations that did furnish information required by this ordinance and it's reflected in the statement in the letter of Dr. Crenshaw who originally contacted the city, relative to this thing for the N.A.A.C.P. 
    He, in that letter admitted that various – several -- various under organizations had been readdressed to the plaintiff. 
    Now, if those organizations who claim immunity and I inject here that I don't think it's necessary that a claim be made from immunity in order to have this ordinance in effect, but if those organizations claiming immunity from the previous tax laws, are privileged to continue to be active in -- in any community, in any state, without revealing factors upon which the governmental agencies or bodies could in fact determine if they really were non profit. 
    They could be engaged in activities that produce revenues far in excess of the imagination of most of us. 
    They could be engages -- engaged in a profit venture, only by being able to determine these factors from our own investigation or from the city's investigations can we be assured that the taxes which are justly due are received by the city.

    Rather, the ordinance requires information of all organizations seeking exemption from privilege tax. 
    Other organizations have complied. 
    Why should this one have immunity as though it were a favorite child? 
    Now, they must have had something in the -- in the record there or told something to indicate that -- that this was not discriminatory as another -- all other people in the same position had complied.

    It's not been my notion that a criminal statute which with imposes some kind of a liability in criminal in character for the corporation, may nevertheless be imposed upon its agents, the crime may -- the penalty upon its agents for the corporate failure, is that right? 
    Can that be done?
speaker="joseph_c_kemp" startTime="3584.677" stopTime="3800.341">
    Mr. Joseph C. Kemp 
    Yes. 
    In some instances that can be done -- I -- as I understand it, Your Honor. 
    We, in -- in this case had attempted to get this case tried and the issues resolved in (Inaudible) and -- and before the Court and for that reason the stipulation was made that petitioner had failed to comply with the provisions of the ordinance and that she was (Inaudible) to the jurisdiction of the Court. 
    Now, if I may just briefly and in conclusion, touch on the matter of, what I thought was the petitioner's point in his lawsuits and that is that this case is -- is to be determined by the case of Alabama, the N.A.A.C.P. versus Alabama, recently decided by this Court wherein this Court held that the requirement by court order for the revealing of membership list was a depravation of the rights of the First Amendment and that as such would be void. 
    But that Court in -- in the Alabama -- this Court in the Alabama case also identified an exception, namely if there is a controlling justification for an alleged deterrent effect, a controlling justification barred the deterrent effect which the revealing of this information might have, then the Court here will balance the interest of the individual. 
    The Constitution gives that balance between the individual and the government so that it is not always a -- a paramount right which can never be subjected to -- to some sort of governmental investigatory power or authority. 
    Further, this Court, in the matter of a recent decision, Uphaus versus Wyman, 360 U.S., a 1959 decision, again confirmed the holding in the Alabama case by stating that and I quote, "Whether there was justification for the production,” they were producing a list of the guest at a summer camp and the -- and the defendant denied that this was a proper being in view of the holdings of the Alabama case and the Court says, "Whether there were justification for the production timed on the substantial question of the State's interest in obtaining the identity of a guest when weighed against the individual's interest asserted by the fellow. 
    The Court found certainly that the -- the State was privileged or should be privileged to investigate and determine whether or not, there were Communists in the -- in their State. 
    I think unless this Court can agree that the State or the city of -- whatever political subdivision we have in -- has the authority and the power to determine whether or not a tax is due, then that government will deteriorate without taxation, without revenues, it just can't function and perform and render the services which the public are entitled to and demand. 
    Therefore, there is a justification, a controlling justification for whatever aspect, the revealing of this information may have had or may in the future have.

    And then, the funds are paid out that are taken in but you don't know to whom it is paid.

   Rebuttal of Robert L. Carter
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="5125.508" stopTime="5126.377">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    If the Court please.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5126.377" stopTime="5128.217">

    Mr. Carter.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="5128.217" stopTime="5313.970">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    I think that Mr. Kemp has mislead the Court in -- at least in my understanding in -- in answer to his question about the public, a publication of this information. 
    My understanding of Arkansas law is that a pubic record is -- is -- that there is an entitlement on the -- the public access to it and this was set out in a decision, Collins versus State which is at 143 Southwest Second 1, in which the Supreme Court has -- has determined what is a public record. 
    So, that I -- I think that the interested party, information that he is dealing with concerns a definition of what is an interested party and litigation and not with the kind of problem that we have here. 
    One other thing, I would like to bring the Court's attention to and that is, the question was asked, I mean I was trying to find it. 
    Where did it appear in the opinion of the Court that the -- this ordinance was interpreted as applying only to members as of -- as reaching membership in contributions. 
    I might refer the Court to the top of page 71 where the -- of the record on the case where the -- in the -- in the opinion of the Court where it says that -- about the third sentence that each in prosecuting her appealed to this Court raises this federal question. 
    The ordinance involved insofar as it requires the names and addresses of their member of and contributors to the local branch of the N.A.A.C.P. is an invasion of rights etcetera in all questions merge into this. 
    And I might also refer the Court to page 76 further on in the discussion of the opinion, at the top of the page about, mid the -- the paragraph when the -- there's a -- the -- the Court seeks to distinguish N.A.A.C.P. versus Alabama. 
    That says that the ultimate aim in N.A.A.C.P. versus Alabama was to stop the activities of the N.A.A.C.P. 
    But in the case at bar, the disclosure of N.A.A.C.P. list of members and contributors is a mere incident to see if legal taxation is being evaded. 
    So, I think that the -- this has been the -- this -- the -- this ordinance has been interpreted to reach members and contributors. 
    Finally, I would like to point out to the Court that this 7444 as I indicated before, list various occupation under which there is this -- this occupation tax with the listing of what the amount of the tax is and the taxes on the business on the -- on the activity is not -- is indicated on any organization itself.

    I have a -- Section 1 reads that the carrying on of any business, profession, occupation of whatever kind or nature within the City Little Rock, Arkansas is hereby declared to be a privilege. 
    And from here on after the effective date of this ordinance, any person, firm or corporation engaged in any business, occupation or profession of whatever kind or nature within the City of Little Rock, shall pay various tax. 
    But then, there is a list, there is a listing of the various occupations that are subject to the tax with the gradation of what the tax is.
