    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 436, Cory Corporation et al. Petitioners, versus Ernest J. Sauber. 
    Mr. Rothschild.
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="22.298" stopTime="351.981">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is an excise tax case which involves more than a question of revenue. 
    It involves questions, which, I think, touch on the integrity of the process of judicial review.In fact, one of the principal questions raised is what questions are before this Court. 
    The taxpayers, whom I represent, recovered a refund judgment in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on excise tax assessed and paid on to our conditioning units. 
    This was a test case. 
    The Government appealed and obtained the reversal of the District Court on issues of law and fact which were not presented to the trial court. 
    And we applied for certiorari and raised the questions that appear in our petition for certiorari. 
    There were five of them. 
    And the Government responded to that petition saying that the Court of Appeals was right. 
    Between the time of the filing of the Government's brief in opposition to certiorari and the filing of its brief on the merits, 12 days ago, the Government changed its position again and admitted error in the basic rationale of the Court of Appeals but, nevertheless, seeks to salvage the reversal of the District Court. 
    On no grounds, they were not presented either to the District Court or to the Court of Appeals. 
    And I think that the record shows an -- a trial de novo in the Court of Appeals in an attempt to obtain a new trial de novo in this Court after the certiorari papers were filed. 
    The facts are simple. 
    Taxpayers file suit in the District Court, as I stated, for the refund of excise tax paid on the sales of two air conditioners sold in 1954 and 1955. 
    And by stipulation with the Government, these refund suits were test suits to determine the applicability of the excise tax to more than 50,000 similar units on which excise taxes had been assessed but not paid. 
    The statutes Section 3405 (c) of the 1939 Code and Section 4111 of the 1954 Code impose a -- this impose excise taxes on various types of household type equipment impose a 10% tax on the sale of self-contained air conditioning units. 
    And until 12 days ago, when the Government's brief on the merits was filed, both parties agreed that this tax applied only to units of a household type. 
    Now, since 1948 and until really, until a few months ago and a new regulation was issued in response to the decision of the Court of Appeals, the Internal Revenue Service has consistently administered the tax under published revenue rulings which provide that the -- and I'm quoting from the ruling now, "type of self-contained air conditioning units subject to tax" is the unit of certain specified physical characteristics, window type and such, that has a total motor horsepower of less than 1 horsepower, and the parties have stipulated that consistently since 1948, this tax has had been administered so that the Commissioner has not know -- as it consistently exempted air conditioners with a motor horsepower of 1 horsepower or more. 
    Now, at the trial and incidentally, the only issue raised by the pleadings was the question of horsepower, that is whether the units of the taxpayer were 1 horsepower or less than 1 horsepower. 
    And there are only two standards for determining what horsepower is. 
    One is the actual horsepower that you can measure under standard operating conditions when the machine is in operation, and the other is the rated horsepower of the electric motor which drives the compressor which runs the air conditioning unit. 
    The rated horsepower means the rating standards published by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association have published standards for the guidance of their members in rating and putting horsepower ratings on the electric motors which drive the compressors and the air conditioners.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    By that, do you mean a label or some kind on the motor?
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="356.606" stopTime="466.939">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    Well, the -- the label is what I would call nominal horsepower reading. 
    In other words, each motor manufacturer who makes an electric motor assigns to it a nominal horsepower rating. 
    Now, he can, if he -- and he is more or less expected to follow the industrial standards, the NEMA rating standards but he doesn't have to. 
    And in this case, he didn't. 
    In other words, perhaps, I can explain it just by referring to the facts of this case. 
    The issue at the trial of this case was whether, under the rating standards, the NEMA standards of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the air conditioners in question should have had a 1 horsepower rating. 
    The District Court, and this was the only, incidentally, the only contested issue of fact in the case, the District Court held against the Government, held that they did have a 1 horsepower rating under the NEMA standards. 
    Nevertheless, the motor manufacturers who made the motors signed them a nominal rating of three quarter horsepower and the issue at the trial was that the -- had these motor manufacturers mislabeled their motors or had they done so correctly? 
    The Government's trial counsel, and I'd like to quote his own words because I think the issue at the trial is rather crucial in this case, had framed the evidence. 
    It said as follows, and I'm quoting from page 105 of the record, "We say that a 1 horsepower motor is used in the ruling means the motor that can be rated as a 1 horsepower motor.”

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That can be what?

    Rated, R-A --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Rate.
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="469.163" stopTime="578.464">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    Rated, yes. 
    We have tried to prove today that these motors, under the NEMA standards, cannot be rated as 1 horsepower motors. 
    And on the next page of the record, we were talking about this nominal three quarter horsepower rating, Government counsel again said, “That is the rating that was put on them by the manufacturers of the electric motors in conformance with the NEMA standards.” 
    You can find that's on page 106 of the same record. 
    Now, the issues that were raised on appeal were simply eliminated from the trial by another stipulation that was made between trial counsel and myself, while I was trial counsel below, as I am here. 
    At the very beginning of the case which followed a pretrial conference when we did narrow the issues. 
    Government trial counsels stipulated that the revenue rulings were entirely valid as the Government construed them. 
    And as I've already shown from quotations from the Government's counsel statements, the Government construed them as applying these NEMA ratings. 
    And this completely removed from the trial of the case a vast number of miscellaneous issues of evidence which, of course, were not needed to be tried. 
    The District Court, the only issue of fact left that was tried in the District Court was one and that was whether our air conditioners had a NEMA rating of 1 horsepower. 
    The trial --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="578.464" stopTime="581.820">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is the NEMA rating the normal or the -- the
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="581.820" stopTime="583.046">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    That's the standard, yes.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That's -- that's the actual?

    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    That's -- that's the -- that's the -- the industrial standard rating. 
    Actual horsepower is something that you determine by measurement, and we contented incidentally for that at the beginning of the case, and we still think that's proper. 
    But -- and it was stipulated that -- that our motors have an actual horsepower of 1 horsepower. 
    But the issue was -- at the trial was whether if -- if the industry standards, the NEMA rating standards had been applied where there are units would have had a NEMA rated horsepower of 1 horsepower. 
    And the District Court held that they have.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="626.875" stopTime="640.399">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    May I ask this, why -- why the difference? 
    Why do you use two in your business? 
    Why do you use two standards? 
    One an industry standard and one -- one an actual standard?
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="640.399" stopTime="658.549">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    Well, it's really a question of interpreting rather the revenue rulings. 
    The industry by and large follows the NEMA ratings. 
    That's the -- the NEMA ratings are -- are published as a guide for the guidance of motor manufacturers in rating their motors. 
    We -- we --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="658.549" stopTime="663.074">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was that normally for tax purposes?
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="663.074" stopTime="696.209">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    Well, for -- the fact of the matter, Your Honor, is this is a new case as far as tax purposes are concerned because I don't believe its ever -- there's ever been a -- a contest where it appeared that the label, that is the nominal horsepower rating, was inconsistent with the NEMA standard rating. 
    Here, you see they rated the units of three quarter horsepower. 
    If they followed the NEMA standard, there wouldn't have been any question. 
    They did not follow the NEMA standard in this case.

    What was the actual horsepower?

    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    The actual horsepower is more than 1 horsepower.

    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    There's a pretty close correlation between the rating standards they just do it in a different way, the NEMA rating standards and the actual horsepower.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, do I understand you, Mr. Rothschild, that the purposes of the tax, if the tax is exacted it, it's under 1 horsepower. 
    Is that it?
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="725.525" stopTime="726.608">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="726.608" stopTime="732.276">

    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    That's right.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that what your test case is about?You talked a lot about what this record shows, but I understood you to say at the beginning, this was a test case to determine some point of law.
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="748.330" stopTime="795.293">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    Well, the -- was -- simply, the -- the test case was to determine whether there are some 50,000 air conditioners on which the Commissioner has levied assessments.We haven't paid the tax on those because we say they're not taxable because they're 1 horsepower units. 
    Because of the procedural difficulty on an excise tax case in getting an adjudication, you have to pay the tax and sue for refund. 
    We stipulated with the Government that the applicability of the tax, as adjudicated by the results on the -- of the trial on these two units, would govern the applicability of the -- of the tax to these additional 50,000 units on which the assessments have been made.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="795.293" stopTime="800.722">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What is the -- what is the point of law you are trying to get determined?

    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    The point of law?

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes.
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="804.231" stopTime="870.323">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    Well, the point of -- the principle point, Your Honor, is that the point of law that was passed on by the District Court is one that was agreed to by the Government, that is that the NEMA standards applied that these were -- these -- these units were exempt under the NEMA standards. 
    And therefore, there really wasn't anything for the Government to appeal on because the Government does not challenge the finding of fact of the District Court that these are 1 horsepower units under the NEMA standards. 
    In order to appeal, the Government was required to change its position and repudiate that stipulation that I just called to Your Honors' attention. 
    On appeal, the Government said, “Our rulings are void even if they -- even if you will interpret them to include the NEMA ratings,” and they said, “These -- these air conditioners are taxable because they are of a household type, irrespective of their horsepower rating.”

    The Court of Appeals held that the rulings were void.

    And the Court of Appeals held that the horsepower test was simply invalid because it wasn't the -- the Commissioner didn't have that much power. 
    The Court also held the household type. 
    And at this point, Your Honors, the Government was still contending for household type.

    This matter was brought to the contention of Congress in 1956.

    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    The stipulation appears in the briefs. 
    Well, there are two stipulations, Your Honor, both of which have been repudiated. 
    The first stipulation --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'd like to see them before I find out whether they were repudiated.

    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    All right, the first stipulation, Your Honor, is the one that was made in the trial court. 
    And that does -- that's at page 56 of the record. 
    Mr. Stetson was the attorney for the Government and after we had our conference, we -- he -- he made this stipulation, “Your Honor,” and this is to the trial court, “there is one more matter which I think we agreed on as a stipulation.I would like to dictate a stipulation into the record, if I may, which is this, if the Court should determine that the ruling must be interpreted in a manner as contended by the plaintiffs, that's actual horsepower,” as distinguished from NEMA --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1178.520" stopTime="1178.623">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Correct.
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="1178.623" stopTime="1215.904">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    -- rating, I'm interpolating there. 
    “The plaintiffs will not argue that the Government doesn't stop to argue -- argue that the ruling is invalid,” and I said, “So construed,” and he said, “As so construed”. 
    In other words, he reserved the right to attack the validity of the ruling only to the extent that it incorporate actual horsepower and then I said, “I'll agree to that,” and we did that in order to shorten proof in issues. 
    My understanding is that the Government's position is the ruling is entirely valid as the Government construes it but not as we construe it. 
    “Is that correct?” 
    And he said that is correct.

    Of course that -- yes, Your Honor, that's exactly what I'm saying. 
    I'm saying that we didn't put in any evidence to show that there are units where -- of a household type independently of the revenue ruling that was involved. 
    We didn't put in any -- any witnesses to show that our units were not self-contained within the meaning of the statute if the -- if it has that more limited meaning. 
    These issues were never tried because the Government stipulated that their rulings were valid and we've narrowed the issue down to this one point, the horsepower point.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Then, tell me this. 
    Am I wrong in drawing the inference that I do draw from what you just said, namely, that assuming you're right about everything you've said in this implication, you -- you are not entitled to ask us to give a stipulated construction of the statute but you maybe entitled to say that the case should go back so that the issues maybe properly canvassed. 
    Which are you asking us to do?

    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    Well, I'm asking you to do more of the latter than the former because I -- I admit that this Court is not bound by a stipulation of law. 
    Of course, that's well settled. 
    But I am saying that -- that when the case is tried on issues and those -- and specific defenses which could've been raised are waived and --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I didn't want to know what it is that you may properly press upon this Court for a decision. 
    And as the Chief Justice indicated, the fact that they stipulated their view of the statute doesn't foreclose us in saying that that's not an admissible construction of the statute. 
    And it may be that it's so inadmissible that it's immaterial even if you've been allowed to having made it, you couldn't have put in that proof for that claim because so it's so fancible. 
    I'm not saying it is.

    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    No, I am suggesting that -- to the Court that the Government be tried -- that the Government try the cases and have this -- this Court review the issues that were presented to the trial court and the issue that was presented to the trial court was not the issue that was presented either to the Court of Appeals or to this Court, and this Court has held many times that this Court will not consider, regardless of the merits of an issue, will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal and certainly issues raised for the first time after the filing of a petition for certiorari.

    That here, you also have a longstanding government regulation and that the Court of Appeals, forgetting all about the stipulation, and that the Court of Appeals had no business disregarding that regulation and saying that a horsepower was immaterial and therefore that the case ought to go back to the Court of Appeals to try out the one issue that remains, namely, whether there was government regulation means rated or nominal horsepower.

    And we think we could invoke 1108 (b) if, in a proper case, if and when suits for refunds are bought, and if and when we have to pay taxes on these 50,000 units and then bring a suit for refund, then -- then that's the first time we can invoke 1108 (b) and in that case, we would of course. 
    But at this point, that can't be an issue because there is no machinery protesting the applicability of the tax.

    Because we'd have to -- in other words, we'd have to pay the tax, we'd have to pay over a million dollars of tax to the United States on a tax that we claim as wholly inapplicable. 
    There's nothing we can do about it. 
    And then file -- claim for refund and at the end of six months, if that claim hasn't allowed, then, for the first time, we can bring the same kind of suits we brought here on 50,000 or more air conditioning units. 
    And that's the first time that we can raise the issue of 1108 (b). 
    We just can't do it any other way. 
    The whole purpose of making this a test case was to determine the tax -- the applicability of the tax to these units and thereby avoid the necessity of going through thousands of separate proceedings in order to obtain refund suits on similar units.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't -- don't you know what they -- when you say they may present, what, in your views, are the issue which you think this Court should adjudicate in this case on this question, not what it makes?
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="2019.634" stopTime="2152.961">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    I say may because I think there are alternative issues here. 
    One of which may be reached. 
    And if it is reached, the other need not be. 
    But I will present both issues. 
    First, what does the ruling mean when it says total motor horsepower of one or more exempts from tax or conversely that a total motor horsepower of less than one qualifies for tax. 
    What does total motor horsepower mean in terms of the various possible standards which maybe conceived of in measuring the horsepower of a motor used in an air conditioner? 
    Now, there are several alternatives. 
    One alternative is engineering horsepower. 
    You take the motor, you use predetermined test conditions, you make various measurements, and you compute horsepower mathematically. 
    Another method is to look at a little metal plate which appears on the compressor itself which is what the air conditioner manufacturer receives. 
    That metal plate has a designation horsepower. 
    In this case, that metal plate reached three-quarter horsepower. 
    So we're faced first with the question of which of these two possibilities is referred to in the ruling? 
    Then we reach the second question, in our view, only if the construction of the ruling is resolved in favor of that set forth by the air conditioner manufacturer, that is if the ruling is construed to refer in terms of motor horsepower to the engineering horsepower, we have here admittedly air conditioning units whose motors exceed 1 horsepower. 
    Therefore, under that interpretation of the rulings, they would be exempt from the tax. 
    The next question which is presented is, if these rulings are to be construed in such a way as to exempt these units from the tax, are they valid under the statute or are they, as the Government contends, inconsistent with the statute and void because there is no rational connection between self-contained air conditioning units which is the only language in the statute and engineering horsepower? 
    Now, those are the two issues.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2152.961" stopTime="2156.397">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You say horsepower is an irrelevant factor.
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="2156.397" stopTime="2323.400">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Well, we say that the rulings refer to the so-called nominal horsepower. 
    And we say that for a variety of reasons. 
    In the fist place, the tax is imposed upon the manufacturer of the air conditioning unit. 
    Now, the manufacturer buys a compressor from a compressor manufacturer and it uses it in the assembly of the finished unit. 
    The compressor which he receives has a little metal plate on it which designates the horsepower. 
    Now, the compressor manufacturer didn't -- doesn't dream that horsepower up out of thin air. 
    He receives the horsepower from the motor manufacturer. 
    The manufacturer of the motor determines the horsepower to designate for this motor. 
    He informs the compressor manufacturer. 
    The compressor manufacturer then puts a metal plate on his motor and calls it as, in this case, a three-quarter horsepower compressor. 
    The air conditioning manufacturer receives the compressor and he then designates it as a three-quarter horsepower air conditioning unit. 
    He relies wholly upon the plate horsepower which he receives as counsel for the air conditioner manufacturer conceded below at page 105 of the record. 
    The compressor manufacturer takes the same rating and puts it on a plaque on the outside of the housing. 
    And if you are going to sell an air conditioner with that compressor in it, you can't very well sell it for something other than the rating the compressor manufacturer puts on it. 
    Now, we're taxing air conditioning manufacturers not motor manufacturers. 
    The air conditioning manufacturer is not concerned with the motor. 
    He's not concerned with the specifications. 
    He doesn't test the motor. 
    He doesn't have access to the specifications under which the motor are tested from which you could compute the horsepower in an engineering set. 
    He's not concerned with that because he relies upon the compressor manufacturer who furnishes him a finished compressor which embodies the (Inaudible). 
    This compressor is adapted to the air conditioning requirements of the air conditioner manufacturer. 
    So if we're looking for a test, which the Internal Revenue Service was here concerned with which would be ease of application which would permit certainty when the air conditioning manufacturer who, after all, self-assesses the excise tax, the simplest thing, which was apparent to the Commissioner at the time, was to tell the air conditioning manufacturer, “Well, look at the plaque on the compressor. 
    And if it says it is less than one, collect the tax from your vendee. 
    If it says it is an excess of one, you need not collect the tax from your vendee.” 
    Now, that is the issue with respect to the meaning of the ruling.

    In other words, all the factual characteristics necessary, whatever self-contained air conditioning unit may mean in a peripheral case, for example, where there are accessories needed, whatever it may mean in that sort of case, that issue is not presented here because every characteristic, which anyone could rationally ascribe to a self-contained air conditioning unit, is evidenced by the record in this case as applicable in these units.

    This case presents a -- a special problem in that respect because it does involve the excise tax. 
    And there is a special statutory provision which protects manufacturers from the imposition of the excise tax retroactively in cases where they relied. 
    I mean, we're dealing here with manufacturers who are producing thousands of units. 
    They self-assessed the tax. 
    They collected from their vendee. 
    They need an easy test which they can use to determine what is taxable and what is not because if they sell that unit without collecting the tax, they sell an irreparable damage.

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    We say there is no question of whether he collected the tax in this case. 
    It is not in the case because it is not part of his cause of action. 
    He hasn't relied upon any such contention. 
    This would be a reason why the exaction of the tax is unlawful. 
    He is bound by the allegations in his claim for refund and in the complaint. 
    He has never made the smallest suggestion of such a question.

    It is relevant to the claim that the Government and the Commissioner is now going back on his regulation. 
    He says his regulation walks out on him for some such phrase as Justice Harlan used that -- that you yourself said. 
    The Commissioner is now scuttling regulations. 
    If his regulations failed him or properly or in -- in a business way lead a manufacturer to pay us -- to pass on that tax to the customer, it would be unfair now to make him out of -- put him out of profit, is that right?

    And therefore, there are two very distinct questions. 
    One, whether in fact there was a reliance on what now turns out to be an invalid or an enforceable regulation and then he must come within the statutes which showed that he did rely on, would be out of pocket.

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    And it is our position that the only issue properly before this Court is to and only that because if the Court will examine the claim for refund, the complaint, the pleadings, the way this case was tried, there was only one issue ever asserted by the taxpayer as a reason why he ought to recover and that is the ruling exempts my units. 
    He never said, "And alternatively. 
    If you find it, it does not exempt my units. 
    I urge because of my reliance that I'd be granted the refund." 
    He never made that alternative assumption that he is barred by -- by all the rules relating the tax refund suits for making it. 
    It is not in the claim for refund. 
    Now, he -- he drafted his claim for refund. 
    It was open to him to assert any number of grounds why he should recover. 
    He has never made that assertion. 
    He has not even making it in this Court.

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    I mean that is an alternative position here. 
    One position is that the ruling, if construed in terms of nominal horsepower, imposes the tax and even though that test may too narrowly restrict the statute, that -- that would not be an issue here because it does apply to these units. 
    On the other hand, if it is an actual horsepower test, it is clearly invalid because these units which are taxable by every conceivable criterion would be exempt from the tax. 
    So we say there is no basis upon which to remand it to the District Court here. 
    These units are taxable under the statute by any test that can be conceived of. 
    The horsepower test is not rationally consistent with the statute. 
    Therefore, the Court of Appeals was correct in reversing the District Court in holding that the units were taxable. 
    That's our basic position.

    No, precisely the same issues would be involved. 
    The taxpayer would still be contending that under the ruling, however -- whatever the statute says, under the ruling, and this is his sole contention, "Your ruling exempts my units from tax." 
    Now, there's nothing in the ruling which refers in terms to household type. 
    There is nothing in the statute. 
    It has always been open for -- to the taxpayer to say, "My unit is not self-contained for reasons A, B and C. 
    All of my unit is not household type for reasons D, E and F." 
    He has never said that. 
    He has said only one thing and one thing only at every stage and that is “Because of the horsepower test in your rulings, my units are exempted."

    Now, if that's true in this case, why should the Government insist that he'd be cutoff from that because of that test?

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Well, because that -- that issue came into this case simply by way of the Government's attempting to show this Court that there was no collection of the tax on the theory that if there was such -- that if the taxpayer has failed to collect it, they would have asserted it and won their case based on this estoppel ground.

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Well, this was raised below.

    The Government counsel, in his closing remarks to the District Judge, said, "Why hasn't he alleged that he failed to collect the tax? 
    We've conceded that this ruling is ambiguous. 
    Why hasn't he alleged it to you, District Judge? 
    Why doesn't he make that claim now?" 
    And the response was, and this is in the record and the Court can read it there, the response was, "There is nothing in the record about what we did about this tax and that's not in the case."

    He stated that below.

speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="4792.649" stopTime="4869.366">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    On these two units? 
    We certainly did as I explained to, I think was Justice Whittaker. 
    These were units that happened to have been sold to -- directly to a lawyer and to an accountant of the taxpayer before it came to our attention that -- that these units were exempt under the rulings because they had been mislabeled. 
    We simply selected these two units which had a $29.93 was paid to the Government without a protest passed on to the consumer and collected from him on these units. 
    And it was after we decided to bring a test suit that we happened to pick these two units, and it was after that point that we sold the $50,000 units, and we brought these suits on these two test units simply to test the taxability of the 50,000. 
    And there is no conceivable procedural way in which we could've put on any evidence such as Mr. Heffron says, "We should have put on to prove that we had suffered a loss in the 50,000 without going through 50,000 claims for refund in -- in the same manner."
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4869.366" stopTime="4886.799">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Tell me this. 
    Is it -- is it strange that I should think that it is strange that you should stipulate that 50 -- as to 50,000 cases, they should be governed by these two instances as a test suit when there's such a cardinal difference between the two?
speaker="edwin_a_rothschild" startTime="4886.799" stopTime="4904.119">
    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild 
    No, because the only -- the only similarity, Your Honor, and the only reason that -- that we stipulate it was because these suits in these air conditioners, the 50,000 in physical content, in size, in horsepower were the same as the two and --

    Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild

    Well, certainly, Your Honor. 
    Household type, whether or not these air conditioners were primarily designed for -- to meet the needs of a household was a question of fact which was not tried because of the Government's stipulation. 
    The other question is whether they are self-contained which is the new issue raised by the Government on its brief on the merits. 
    Self-contained is now a word of art because the Government has actually an exhibit saying that it covers anything from a small portable to 1000 horsepower plant. 
    And the only expression of the industry as to the meaning of self-contained, and that's urged by the Government's issues of fact, the only expression of the industry takes in horsepower and the Government itself says horsepower applies so that if self-contained -- so that if these units are just self-contained as a matter of law as the Government contains now, why would they be relying as they do in their brief, Your Honor, on the horsepower test on the understanding of the industry and on the intention of the Commissioner?
