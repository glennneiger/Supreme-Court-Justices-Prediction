    Mr. Solie M. Ringold 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Mr. Justice Whittaker, in response to a question concerning the necessity or the right to a hearing, it was our opinion that this statute in this particular situation deprived the plaintiffs of a hearing. 
    For that reason, at its inception, our complaint was drawn on that basis and paragraph 5 of our complaint as it appears on page 2 of the printed record, upon they did execute such oath, his employment be terminated. 
    Thereupon, there was a denial by the State. 
    Request for admissions were made which admitted that the statute would be construed in that fashion to deny a hearing. 
    The findings of fact in conclusions of law, conclusion, Finding of Fact number 6 was then included.

    Let me ask you this, Mr. Ringold. 
    In your brief, you state that -- that the 1955 law repealed that portion of the law which -- which accorded a hearing.

    This --

    Now, and Mr. Fuller says that that law as it set out on -- on page 67, 68 of his brief is still a law and that such a hearing can be held. 
    Will you tell us why there is that difference of opinion between you and what you base it on?
speaker="solie_m_ringold" startTime="160.360" stopTime="227.128">
    Mr. Solie M. Ringold 
    The question I assume, Mr. Chief Justice, depended upon whether or not a review by implication took place or not. 
    This was why we interpreted as a review by implication having taken place by virtue of the 1955 Act. 
    And again, that was why we framed the complaint originally to specifically raise the question. 
    And this matter was argued in the lower court, it was argued in the Supreme Court of the State of Washington. 
    We of course extensively argued it with respect to the Attorney General's list. 
    We did raise the question with respect to a -- we -- we cited Slochower and those other matters. 
    Then when the original opinion of the Supreme Court came down, the focal point then, it became much more pointed as to whether or not the hearing issue was raised. 
    And in our petition for rehearing, pages 41 to 45 of the unprinted record, we specifically raise the --

    The Wyman case clearly establish that public employment was not a privilege which could be denied for any reason whatsoever. 
    The United States Supreme Court's unanimous holding was that eligibility for public employment can only be conditioned on requirements which had a reasonable relation to fitness. 
    The importance of this aspect of our argument was totally overlooked by this Court in its failure to mention and apply the doctrine of Swayze, Schwer, Canniburgh, Slochower.

    It is no answer to say Learner Dylan and Adler. 
    Each of these cases involved hearings to determine the fitness of the employee for employment under the state's right to investigate the qualifications of the employees. 
    And then we underlined. 
    "There is not one case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States which holds that the State may discharge an employee solely upon refusal to subscribe to an oath that he is not a subversive person."

    The heading under which it appeared is under due process that scienter is a necessary element in oaths of nonmembership in proscribed organizations. 
    We then cited Slochower. 
    The plaintiff claimed this privilege, we quoted Mr. Justice Clark, then we said the Court discusses Adler Garner and then says, “But in each of these cases, it was emphasized that the State must conform to the requirements of due process. 
    The summary dismissal of appellant violates due process of law.”
