    Mr. Julian T. Abeles 
    -- District Court held that if the author did not survive the 28th year, there was nothing that could be acquired by the executor. 
    He had nothing to leave. 
    And of course, out of the -- the Court of Appeals, that is the majority of the Court of Appeals affirmed upon the determine -- upon the decision of Judge Bryant. 
    Now, Judge Bryant and also the respondent, cite in support of this contention, two authorities. 
    That is two -- rather two, I would say, two textbook writers, two copyright textbook writers. 
    One, Ball another known as Ladas, and if I may respectfully do so, Ball says in accord with what they contend, “When can I grant personal property in which he has no existing title of vested right?” 
    Consequently, an expectancy and a drawing out of property cannot be the subject of an assignment at law of a valid mortgage sale, nor be devised by will. 
    And Ladas answered the same effect, the author cannot dispose the rights, he may never have. 
    Now, as I said yesterday, in -- in Fox Film against Knowles, the precise contention was raised and the Court of Appeals, in affirming said, “That while they recognize there could be no distinction between an assignment by the author or divide -- or devise that he can, having not survived the 28th year, he could do neither.” 
    In this Court, I will say it that, this Court in a -- in a reversing said, that as the -- as the executor represents a person of his testator in the absence of a widow and child, he can exercise the same power that the testator might exercise if he had been alive.

    Mr. Julian T. Abeles 
    No question about it. 
    You see, our difficulty is, sir, this position. 
    We cannot go to the executor. 
    We can go to the wife and go to the children. 
    We can't go to the executor because the executor has to take an office. 
    He won't take it, if a man dies.

    Mr. Julian T. Abeles 
    In this way, sir, and as this Court has -- has pointed out in the -- in the De Sylva case, yes. 
    De Sylva-Ballentine, I'll get there in a second. 
    You see it -- it names the -- it names the wife and the children first. 
    But that he says, if there are no action showed and then the -- the other calls the executor. 
    In other words, the way the statute works is this, he cannot take away this right of the wife and child. 
    It's a compulsory request to them. 
    It's for their protection after he dies. 
    But if -- what if he has no wife and child, then they give him the right to dispose of, they don't care how he disposes that. 
    He dispose it by request or by assignment or otherwise. 
    But if he doesn't, then I suppose, so that he won't go into the public domain and who -- whoever is next of kin maybe scattered through out the world or otherwise, they've held that this next of kin do acquire the right, if they apply for it within their 28th year. 
    But you see, the wife and children are mandatory because they're before the executor. 
    In other words, the executor can't -- the -- of the author cannot step in so through the executor unless there is no wife or child. 
    He cannot take that away from them.

    There's no widow or children here. 
    I say if there was a widow or child, their rights would go to them. 
    I wouldn't have anything through the -- my assignment when the author has a -- cut the widow child, a wife and child, would do the wife now. 
    So, don't you don't see judge -- might I say, that it's only if the -- you see -- you see, I'm -- somewhere in my back of my mind, never thought, they did say I remember now, that the idea, I think, you mention -- you mention, Justice -- Justice Whittaker, yes, that if the -- if the author did not take advantage of the fact that he could get money during his lifetime by disposing of these rights, then make a will or not, then it grant of course, and going to the public domain, it went to the next of kin. 
    That seems to be the idea. 
    I recall somewhere I read that. 
    So, in other words, it's protected to go in the public domain. 
    They said alright, whoever this next of kin are, let it go to them. 
    And that was the idea. 
    But don't you see judge, Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, that if there's no widow or a child, I'm going to point that out. 
    That's your De Sylva case. 
    This Court specifically held in that case that in the absence -- in the -- that the -- that the statute is a mandatory request to the widower and child. 
    And that the only restriction upon the assignment of the author's interest in the renewal is for the protection of the widow and child in the form of compulsory request, is there. 
    That seems to be quite important.

    Mr. Julian T. Abeles

    I think, I didn't get that far in this case, sir. 
    You see, there's no way to it and yet, as I say is compulsory request to the widow and child. 
    That was the idea of the statute. 
    They -- to protect them -- but therefore, the author can do nothing to dispose of them without a right. 
    And if he has his widow or child, it goes to them, no question about it, but if he didn't, then he has a right, why not. 
    In other words, why shouldn't he enjoy that during his lifetime? 
    Here's a man who's unmarried, he has no wife or child, he has nobody particularly he cares of by worrying about taking care of perhaps. 
    And so, they say let him enjoy during his lifetime, say comes to a public, he comes to Motion Picture company, stage producing company, he gets them for a very large sums of money for these rights and enjoys them. 
    But what should -- why shouldn't he? 
    I mean, should it go to some next of kin he doesn't care about in faraway lands or wherever they are, I mean some -- there, the third cousins of somebody.

    And I -- I -- the only question I want to have you explained to me if you -- if you could, how the words of the statute give you the right to make these distinctions that you're making?
speaker="julian_t_abeles" startTime="1224.061" stopTime="1311.926">
    Mr. Julian T. Abeles 
    Well, because -- well, this -- this Court said in the De Sylva case sir, that the -- for the reason the statute plainly imports that his protection of the widow and children, that was the uppermost state of their mind of -- of Congress, and that they intend to protect the widow and children if they wanted, but they weren't -- then they gave the man the right to dispose of by assignment or request. 
    He could enjoy that during his lifetime. 
    But if he didn't make an assignment or if he didn't make a will however, you see by in another case, you held that the -- in the Fisher -- Fisher against Witmark case you held (Inaudible) -- to appoint a special committee which is (Inaudible) committee with reference to the statute in which they -- in which they said, that in the absence of a widow or child, then to the -- then it permits the author to designate by will, the executor to apply for the renewal. 
    In other words -- in other words, no widow or child, the man can do what he wants to that's his -- it's his -- he can go ahead then. 
    He could let him get the benefit of it. 
    But if he doesn't do so, then they don't want it to lapse because I'm only repeating myself, it goes to next of kin and that's the distinction between the three. 
    They -- they really done this. 
    In other words, two only comes to just being -- if one -- one, isn't there wife and child, one. 
    Two, exactly, there must be no wife and child. 
    Three, the next of kin only if there are no executors, no wills, see?

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Do you ever, in taking these assignments, just as a matter of curiosity and to the covenant that the composer shall by his will, if he makes one confirm the assignment.
speaker="julian_t_abeles" startTime="1325.271" stopTime="1589.867">
    Mr. Julian T. Abeles 
    I gave that great thought as far as you -- as far as you brought that up, because that has never sought the great deal of discussion. 
    We thought it's far better to put in the general clause, which says, if he's to execute, make and execute any or all further documents, is because the rights maybe necessary to perfect this, if this rather say the will particularly because they didn't want a question of a breach of -- of contract which is -- and I know they were farfetched, but that was (Inaudible) And I thought that has do with the way I did. 
    I might be wrong. 
    Now, in the (Inaudible) case, did I mention that? 
    I think, I did, did I not? 
    Well then, it will only take me a second. 
    In (Inaudible) as I said, the District Court's determination is affirmed by the Court of Appeals, this Court denied certiorari. 
    In that case, they said, a man had left a family will -- left the [Laughs] the renewal to his hometown of (Inaudible). 
    And the contention was that he, a sole right that -- that an author has is a name the executor filed for the renewal. 
    That he has nothing that he -- that the executor is in no position to act for him. 
    He cannot act for him. 
    And therefore, the executor was compelled to turn his rights so it's a next of kin. 
    And the Court held that such a construction would deprive the author of the right to dispose of his renewal if his contract to congressional intent. 
    Now, in the Fisher against Witmark case, as I went to mention before, Mr. Justice Frankfurter made a various -- history -- exploitation of background, explained the background of the historical background of this section. 
    And he said in the final analysis that there would have to be expressly set forth in the statute, something, some wordings, somewhere, to prevent the author to make an assignment, that is to restrict his assignment. 
    Of course, there's in that case, the man had lived -- he had lived in that case during the 28th year. 
    But to say, but that they contend, you see it in a away that contention is exactly as the same because they contended that prior to the 28th year, this man had nothing he could assign, same as they contend here and Judge Bryant contended. 
    And therefore, even though he took out the renewal in the 28th year, he didn't have anything before that so this assignment was worthless. 
    But the -- this Court's, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, writing the opinion said to the contract, that it would have to be expressed, any such restraint upon the assignment and that it certainly was not manifest. 
    Now, of course, they have to show somewhere, somehow, that the executor of this case had the right, his brother, to effectuate his transfer to his children, the children of his elder brothers. 
    They've already set, of course, that the executor requires no rights whatsoever from the testator, because the testator has nothing to leave up to the 28th year although this Court even have said to the contrary. 
    Now, and Judge Bryant said, and -- and of course the majority of the Court of Appeals said to the same effect by (Inaudible) opinion, that the rights of vest -- vest in the executor, the same as a widow or the children next of kin vest, these are his words. 
    And he says, the right standards solely from the statute independently, of any right of the author, of any right whatsoever of the author. 
    And might I say that Judge Bryant in fact, he -- just one sentence, he speaks of defendant's contention which he (Inaudible) important that if you don't mind, I'll read this, please this one line. 
    Defendant contends, this is at page 28 of the record, “Defendant contends that since a designated person, including the executor derived their interest solely and directly from the statute, the author may not, by a prior assignment, deprive any of them including the executor of the right which a statute expressly grants to them.” 
    In other words, he says -- counsel says that is the opinion says, I'm sorry, that the author can't tell the executor what he must do. 
    The executor is entirely independent that's the judgment, entirely independent of the rights of the author. 
    He gets this from the statute do it to what he please. 
    Then therefore, the author could do nothing to deprive the executor of his rights.

    It's a conduct for the purposes of affecting the disposition by the author, that's all. 
    He doesn't own these rights, they're not really vested on him and certainly, he didn't get him the independently of any rights of the author, sir.

speaker="julian_t_abeles" startTime="1902.143" stopTime="2123.703">
    Mr. Julian T. Abeles 
    Pardon me a second. 
    (Inaudible) I think, I mentioned before, but I'll repeat it, that in Fisher against Witmark, this Court pointed out that the congressional committee -- in the report of congressional committee, which was adopted by the Senate Committee, where they -- they said, has intention of the statute to permit the author who had no widow or children decreed by will to the rights to apply for the renewal as we say to effectuate the disposition there of the renewal rights on behalf of the author. 
    Now, counsel argues, brings up the argument that on the same lines that the Chief Justice mentioned before and that is, he says, that we have to take the risk, it's a gamble he says. 
    We can't complain. 
    He says, “Alright, you took these rights from this man, he had no wife or child, and never mind his age or what he could have married maybe had a child and therefore, you lost him anyhow, so what difference does it make? 
    That's a risk you take, it's a gamble.” 
    But as I said before, we found as a practical proposition, we have no difficulty once you've gotten from the. 
    Often, you can understand that, if he will get the wife and the child. 
    Also to transfer of the rights over to us and we found that to be no difficulty as they said. 
    Now, but the -- but what he doesn't justify is this, this is a big point, I think. 
    That is how can an author as in this case, who has made an assignment by his own deliberate act, defeat that assignment by making a will and disposing these rights contrary to his prior disposition -- and derogation, I should say, this prior disposition. 
    Now, Judge Bryant said, that he recognizes that this maybe in Congress. 
    Judge Washington says, “It's not only in Congress, but in truth, out any legal justification.” 
    Now, as this Court said in National Labor Relations Board against the Lion Oil Company, in which they referred to the prior opinion in that -- that -- Master Plastics, the fact that it also against National Labor Relations Board. 
    They said that, “We have caution against accepting a construction of a statute where a -- which were produced and in Congress result.” 
    Now, in closing, I -- I think I should mention this, I don't think it has a legal significance, but he makes quite a point of it, the counsel does in his briefs so, I think I'll be permitted to answer, if I may. 
    He says in this case, 15 years ago, “We only gave $1000 advance for this kind against royalties, of course, therefore, this composition and several others -- I cant see how the compositions meant nothing, because the fact, this is the only one we're fighting over. 
    But that was 15 years ago and the cost today, if I respect -- and might say so, as counsel for the Music Publishers Association which -- to the membership which comprises I believe all leading publishers in the United States. 
    (Inaudible) Motion Picture companies, I know in my own knowledge, the very, very substantial sums of money have been paid to the last 10 years for their proposition of renewal rights upon the supposition over Fox Films against Knowles and Fisher against Witmark, there would be no question that that assigment would be valid.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2123.703" stopTime="2132.110">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well now, on the record in this case, the sums do not seem to be so substantial, it's $1000 to some 18 -- 18 songs, isn't that right?
speaker="julian_t_abeles" startTime="2132.110" stopTime="2186.219">
    Mr. Julian T. Abeles 
    But as I said, sir, that was a $1000 advance against -- that was 15 years ago. 
    In those days, they didn't pay him very much but all of a sudden, they have a right with association music and they send letters around. 
    This association said, “Don't -- don't let -- don't let writers, don't go direct to the publisher, come to us, we'll get you big money,” and they do. 
    We pay today $10,000, $15,000, $25000, $50,000 as a bonus for a very important song and the Motion Picture rights goes into six figures. 
    One, going at the wind which this case depends on, they had to take a renewal. 
    This woman, she -- she was this writer, she didn't have any husband, no children, they took her renewal quite loosely, under my advice. 
    If I lose this case just to bad for me that's all. 
    But they paid (Inaudible) of the -- you -- you probably call gone at the wind. 
    They want to reissue this very valuable piece of property.

   Argument of Milton A. Rudin

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Rudin.
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="2192.944" stopTime="2285.189">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Court. 
    I feel somewhat remiss that at this point that our brief perhaps did not cover to a greater extent the statutory history of Section 24. 
    We felt to a great extent, this had been set forth in Fisher versus Witmark and as Mr. Justice Harlan noted in the De Sylva-Ballentine decision and not repeating that statutory history that having been set forth, there was no need to set it forth again and even in De Sylva-Ballentine. 
    I'd like to advert to the history very briefly without going into the great detail which this Court's opinion did in Fisher-Witmark by considering briefly, “What is the nature of a copyright?” 
    It is after all a congressional franchise. 
    It is the statement of property copyrighted. 
    Congress in Article 1 Section 8 provided for the protection of exclusive period of monopolies to promote the arts and sciences. 
    To a great extent, we adopted, pointed out in the Fisher-Witmark decision without detail, the statute then in the 1790 statute. 
    We had a 14-year term with a right to the author his executive's administrator or assigns to renew for additional 14-year period if a contingency occurred. 
    The contingency had to be the author's survival. 
    There is no --

    The statutes say that?
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="2286.836" stopTime="2288.292">

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    Yes. 
    The statute made it clear that he had to survive. 
    There was a condition even he's at -- while he could assign it, there were certainly no limit on the assignability. 
    But still, no, they are only by contingency. 
    It was -- that was a strange situation as I -- I --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2310.004" stopTime="2314.525">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In other words, if he didn't -- if he didn't survive there was not renewal right at all, in anybody, is that what your point?

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    That's right. 
    And I believe there was another condition. 
    I believe he also had to be a resident in the United Stated, in the 1790 statute.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2322.945" stopTime="2327.055">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    That's the case then, as I understand it, where the right died with the person?
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="2327.055" stopTime="2340.213">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    That's correct. 
    Well, he may not have even retained the right. 
    He may have assigned it prior to the expiration of the 14th year but whoever purchased it from him would only purchase a contingency --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2340.213" stopTime="2341.678">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    -- which expired at his death.
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="2341.678" stopTime="2535.735">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    That's correct. 
    But if he survived and I believe with six months prior to that date, Mr. Ellsworth's report which is the reference is in Fisher-Witmark to the place in the debates or the House reports. 
    Report before the 1830 statute recognized that there should be further protection and the 1830 statute extended the protection to the widow and children. 
    In other words, if the author would not living at the expiration of that particular period of time, then the widow or children -- and this was really the same problem that came about in the 18 -- the subsequent revisions. 
    The concept of just extending the protection to the widow and children without getting into the problem and/or which this Court has heretofore dealt with was in those two statutes. 
    Going beyond the widow or children did not come into being until the 1909 Act. 
    When you got the language of Section 24 which is now Section 23 which went on the -- on widow and children, and said if the author, if there be no author, widow, widower or children, then to the author's executor in any absence of a will to his next of kin and the problem relates to what was does that include, the author's executor and next of kin. 
    It was a renewal copyright and again, it was a congressional grant for a second period and they are called depended upon certain matters happening, registration of the claim in the -- during the 28th year. 
    There were differences also in the period of time, the 1831 statute had it for 28 years and 14 years for the renewal period and 1909 became to -- to 28-year terms. 
    I don't think there's any problem and there should not be any problem of the question of the assignability of this rights. 
    It is not inherent to our position that there'd be any restraint on the assignability like this Court made it quite clear did notwithstanding what some people have interpreted or the minority view in which to have as this Court concurred in at that time, felt that there should be an absolute restriction against assignment. 
    This Court did hold that these rights were assignable and it so held in 1943 and if it had perhaps held otherwise, there would have not have been other problems but it's so held and Congress has not changed the Act since that time. 
    And so, we have -- to approach this problem that the author's right is assignable, the widow and children's right is assignable. 
    I believe the reference to be executor is really just a testamentary power of appointment to the author which is assignable but which was not assigned in this case and the next of kin who may not all be determined have a certain in court contingent right which is assignable. 
    And --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2535.735" stopTime="2540.823">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The executor haven't been named in the statute, there'd be no power of testamentary disposition.
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="2540.823" stopTime="2559.468">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    That's exactly correct, but it's a power of appointment and it was not assigned in this case and it is not inherent to our position that we are arguing against the assignability of these rights. 
    What we contend here is what has been assigned and that is the issue in this case because -- yes, Mr. Justice Whittaker.

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    Correct.

    He raised the question of predators, what the predators would take.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, May I ask you, Mr. Rudin, by whom is it assignable, the executor's power?
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="2588.685" stopTime="2609.655">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    I think -- I think, the power of appointment, I think it is subject to an agreement. 
    It's not before the Court in this case. 
    I don't believe it's an issue here. 
    But, I think the power to leave a will, an agreement to leave a will should be assignable under federal law, under the copyright law based on Fisher versus Witmark. 
    If I am to examine that a little bit further at this point, Mr. Justice Brennan which I would --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2609.655" stopTime="2614.694">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I want to -- I -- I'm just interested, whom it would be that would assign it, this would be the author?
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="2614.694" stopTime="2616.041">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    That's not the complete answer, I think.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2616.041" stopTime="2616.401">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I see.
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="2616.401" stopTime="2903.144">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    It would be the author under federal law but I think you then have to refer to state law under De Sylva-Ballentine. 
    If you decide and follow the philosophy of Fisher versus Witmark that in the absence of an express restriction against assignability, the right must be assignable. 
    Under federal law, we must then look to state law to determine if an agreement to assign or an agreement to bequeath would be valid. 
    And if in a particular case, the various formalities of such an agreement had been satisfied. 
    And in this case, interestingly enough Mr. Justice Brennan, even if we were to go that far because this is the thing that has interested us several times. 
    The original complaint in this case, transcript of record reference is on page 3, paragraph 9. 
    The allegation of the complaint was, Mr. Black bequeathed by will the right of his brother David Black, as the executor, in the Bank of America to apply for the renewal of said copyright, and said musical composition for on be -- for and on behalf of plaintiff. 
    In other words, the plaintiff in this action started out on the theory that he was a legatee, that he was a beneficiary under the will. 
    But when in the trial court confronted with the fact he said might say -- by saying that you're a beneficiary, you should have come in the San Francisco Probate Court and claimed as a beneficiary. 
    You should have asked for this as the beneficiary if this was to be interpreted as an agreement to label well. 
    Not having done so, the decree of a probate court distributing this testamentary power, this property right acquired by virtue of the exercise of the testimony power, is a final judgment, it's res judicata and your foreclosed. 
    Then he said, “Then when we find the argument that matters,” he said, “No, I'm claiming it by virtue of the assignment from the author,” ais assignment, not his assignment of his testamentary power of appointment. 
    And as to that, we say that assignment you got it, it was assignable but you just didn't buy anything because it didn't vest, you bought a contingency. 
    The very nature of Section 24 in the absence over an express restriction against assignability prior to the vesting of the rights creates contingencies. 
    This was the argument of Mr. -- Judge Frank in the dissent in Fisher versus Witmark in the lower court. 
    He said, “If you don't restrict assignability so as you're going to get to gambling, you're going to have contingencies.” 
    This Court in its majority opinion was not impressed with that argument. 
    It said, “If Congress intended no assignability, then it should have said so.” 
    It is true, the value goes up. 
    If one were to write a book which a Motion Picture Company wish to make into a picture and the book had been out one year and had remained in 27 years in this country that's beside the foreign situation. 
    The company would buy figuring 27 years is enough to exploit the book. 
    If the book is 15 years old, the company would face another problem. 
    It'll figure what, “I can get the picture out in about two years, that's 17 years, and least me about 11 years and I may want to exploit up to 20 years.” 
    If the man doesn't live, I may not have anything. 
    True of -- Mr. -- Mr. Abeles has been many years more at the bar than I have but I have been active in the acquisition of acquiring rights and active in the selling of such rights. 
    Then we face such a situation in Lust for Life with an Irving Stone book which was recently a few years ago made into a Motion Picture, Mr. Abeles' client. 
    They came to us and purchased the rights from the author. 
    They purchased to what rights from the widow. 
    They purchased the rights from the children. 
    They required an agreement to bequeath by will to them if there were no wife and children, the additional right. 
    They didn't go to the next of kin but notwithstanding all of that in negotiating for the price to be paid. 
    The argument was made, we're buying a contingency. 
    If I may say, life and death intervene and there's another thing here since De Sylva-Ballentine in this Court which we have to admit and that Section intervenes. 
    The man has an illegitimate child, what they thought would be an exclusive grant would become a nonexclusive grant. 
    And if the wife and children were killed in a common disaster, the man might well remarry and die prior to the 28th year and the new wife would take, only, didn't acquire from the next of kin suppose he didn't leave a will. 
    It would be a contingency, I think they would become general predators of the State for breach of contract perhaps if the contract was otherwise enforceable in California but they would have not been entitled to specific performance because the executor or administrator took nothing in such an event.

    Congress is granting a renewal period. 
    Now, suppose Congress takes it away two years before it vest, is there anything that the man signs a contract that he has a -- an agreement from Congress, they are not going to change the renewal principles or in effect change it? 
    There has been considerable agitation on the copyright part to adopt the European system now, extending one term of copyright for life plus 50 years or some definitive terms if they don't have to become concerned about the renewal period but that's a matter for Congress whether or not there should be a renewal period.

    But -- well, the only help we could get perhaps this one line, it says, it was not the same report in connection with the 1909 Act. 
    It was not the intent -- it was not the intent to permit the administrator to apply for the renewal but to permit the author who had no wife or children to bequeath by will the right to apply for the renewal.

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    Nor do I think we need it for the position here. 
    We might put it -- in other words, I'd like to clear it up for an opening, Mr. Abeles made a statement that would seem to shock me when he quoted Mr. Ladas and Mr. Ball as to what they said were the law applicable of what we are relying on that this was not a right that is assignable at all. 
    Nothing could be further from what the volume says. 
    Mr. Ladas in Harvard Studies of International Law points out in referring the renewal rights says, “It will be noted that the incoherent rights of these persons are personal and cannot be assigned.” 
    But he goes on to explain what he meant by that. 
    He says, “An assignee cannot obtain a renewal copyright merely in his capacity as assignee.” 
    He was talking about his function in filing the application. 
    That was his view at that time. 
    Nor can an administrator take out a renewal copyright for the general benefit of the author's estate. 
    If the author has made a contract for the assignment of the right to obtain original copyright, and of the right to renew the same, he maybe compelled to carryout his undertaking by himself applying for renewal of the copyright and assigning it to the other party to the contract. 
    In other words, Mr. Ladas was not talking about the general contract law Your Honor, questioned about assignability but he was specifically referring to the mechanical exercise of the rights.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3410.117" stopTime="3423.358">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I understood that Mr. Ladas dealt with the copyright problem but it was -- excited my curiosity of what Mr. Abeles read from Ball as a general proposition of property law which surely --

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    It says, “If the author survives the first 27 years of the original term, a prior assignment of his expectancy is valid and enforceable but if he dies before the 28th year of the first term, the right to renew passes to his beneficiaries in the order on which they are mentioned in Section 23 of the Act, thus invalidating any previous -- previous assignment of his expectancy.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3461.059" stopTime="3465.538">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    -- were argued but points out that this Court sort of rejected those reasons in Fisher versus Witmark. 
    There was this concept in thought. 
    There were -- there were two misconceptions about Section 24 before this Court ruled and there have been three cases --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3481.524" stopTime="3486.977">

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    Well, I'm confessed with the fact that if the present members of the Court who voted in that case with vote we might find that were reversed, Your Honor. 
    [Laughs] But in that if there were --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3497.084" stopTime="3501.286">

    -- certainly personal data -- were certainly interesting (Inaudible) data.
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="3501.286" stopTime="3523.467">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    [Laughs] But if they were the same mind then perhaps over the time -- the point is the case has been decided, I think this is very persuasive. 
    Fisher versus Witmark was decided 17 years ago, if this Court misconstrued the congressional intent as to assignability, Congress has had 17 years to correct that misconstruction. 
    It has failed to do so to this date. 
    And so aside from any question of re-argument --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3523.467" stopTime="3528.245">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't think any -- any bill relating to that subject would be considered around the clock, would it?

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    No. 
    It would not. 
    [Laughter] I think we'd have great difficulty even getting some basic consideration. 
    That has perhaps been the trouble but I think the point made by Mr. -- Mr. Judge Frank and adopted by the dissent is quite true that any absence of a restriction against assignability, you've got gambles in the copyright law and he made quite a fuzz about that in his minority views are -- remember his -- this shouldn't be a gambling matter. 
    Well, there are many gambles in life, life insurance is a gamble in -- in many ways in which you place a bet and hope that your opponent will win his bet. 
    In this case, you place a bet and you hope that you will win, you hope to acquire certain rights if you buy them in futural aside from the gamble of whether the styles were changed or whether you're really interested in exercising the right you'll acquire but I think the situation is this in Mr. Abeles' case. 
    He gambled, there were four outstanding rights that Congress created which he could purchase. 
    There were tickets one, two, three and four, he bought a ticket on number one, the author's right if he lived until the 28th year. 
    I'm sorry, that offer did not make it so that ticket paid him nothing. 
    He couldn't buy a ticket at number two at that time because the man had no wife or children that he knew of. 
    He felts quite confident that the man had bought a wife and his wife could be purchased for the same $1000 and get an assignment. 
    Didn't think there'd be any problem by just confidence in the pliability of new wives is great, but nevertheless, he would have had to purchase something but he didn't buy it. 
    But that never came into being but he did not buy number three and that is the testamentary power of appointment which he did not put in the will. 
    He -- he intimated that the will should be so interpreted or his assignment should be so interpreted. 
    I submit clear language of the assigment does not give him that comfort and even if it did, he would run into the California problem that -- as a legatee. 
    There is a claim legatee's foreclosed because he has never made his claim, and there's enough claim. 
    He's never come in and there's been a decree of distribution. 
    The fourth, take it to the next of kin, he bought but that one lost too because the author left a will. 
    He could have perhaps bought all four tickets and still have lost. 
    And this is -- this is the -- the interesting problem. 
    Suppose Mr. Black had bought all three tickets, suppose he had contracted with Mr. Black to leave a will designating Miller Music as the beneficiary of the exercise of this right. 
    Could Miller Music required Mr. Black to agree not to marry and not to bear children until the vesting of renewal right until the 28th year? 
    It seem to me that might be a contract against the public interest. 
    There is just no way as long as you can assign prior to the vesting of the right and the vesting of the right depends upon certain conditions. 
    There is no way to control those conditions because they deal with human elements and therefore, there is no positive acquisition of a right when you buy it prior to the 28th year.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    May I ask you in this connection, Mr. Rudin please? 
    As I understand, you do not question the fact that the author's death prior to the 28th year leaving neither wife nor child ended all rights to renewal but that something the right did continue.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, now let's see. 
    The statute says that the author of the work if still living or the widow, widower or children of the author if the author be not living now or if such author, widow, widower or children be not living, then the author's executors. 
    Or in the absence of will, the next of kin shall have this right of renewal. 
    Now then, do you say that the death of the testator -- of the death of the author without wife or child prior to 28th year extinguished all rights of renewal?
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="3813.193" stopTime="3826.742">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    I do. 
    It extinguished all rights of renewal that the author had. 
    It extinguished it on step one to the author if he'd be living. 
    It did not extinguish the widow's rights until there were no widow or children.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That all depends how we construe the statute and you can't assume the conclusion and argue there from -- he hasn't got anything and those questions or the -- the statute doesn't give him something because the statute projects itself beyond his death, certainly, as to the wife and the children.

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    I think, perhaps so, Your Honor. 
    But and may I respectfully submit two points in answer to that. 
    And that is, one, that if this right was assignable, this power, did the present instrument accomplish that at all (Inaudible) required by contract to agree that he will leave a will, naming an executor authorize the executor, renew the copyright and transfer it to his assignee. 
    He agrees to bequeath and it's a separate assignable right. 
    He agrees to transfer his right if he lives and he agrees to bequeath if he dies. 
    And the second answer to that if I may respectfully submit, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, is that in this case, we only mentioned the point because under the theory of the District Court, he rejected our California argument as I -- I call it. 
    His -- he said, “The author's death prior to the 28th year met the -- the assignment in this case conveyed nothing because the author died and that the people who are the legatees therefore, get the right that the executor had, are not bound by that prior assignment.”
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4002.806" stopTime="4020.103">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Am I to infer from what you said that the -- that the author could make a contract binding his executor with the creation of a right for specific performance by the assignee so far?
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="4020.103" stopTime="4023.704">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4023.704" stopTime="4035.862">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, but by specific performance I mean that he could get a renewal that the executor would have to in his designated capacity as for the renewal and then transfer it, that's was I loosely called --

    -- in effect, specific performance.
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="4036.946" stopTime="4049.655">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    -- I'd like to answer that in three steps. 
    Yes, under the copyright law that it would be possible, two, you'd have to refer to the state law to see if the state law will permit it. 
    I submit, under the authority of De Sylva-Ballentine that once you have --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4049.655" stopTime="4050.873">

    Moreover even --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4054.354" stopTime="4075.580">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All I'm saying is, I'm -- I'm interested in your argument that this could be accomplished by making an arrangement using a neutral term, an arrangement in the light of the author who predeceases his 28th year and yet have to be effectuated by the executor so that the assignee have to almost get the reality, namely the assignment.

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    If -- if under particular state law he was able to buy the right to -- to inherit by will, if he was -- I could go to a man and say, “I will give you” and it's done. 
    Let's give the typical example of some of these annuity policies or all the folk songs, where they go to someone who say, “You turn over all of your assets or you give us $10,000 or if we renamed as his beneficiary of your -- of Black then -- then we will support you for the rest of your life.” 
    It's an agreement to live a will.

    Well, I should think it raises a number -- created a number of questions that we did not decide or face in De Sylva that you could so construe the copyright law that you could work out an assignment that after the author's death before his 28th year in some states not in other, that would give me a lot of trouble myself.

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    I believe the executor represents the first of the beneficiaries in this case and not the person of the testator. 
    That's the difference. 
    I think if I -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter, said in question, the executor is a legal institution, he must represent something. 
    You can only get what the decedent had. 
    And I differ in that respect to some extent, Mr. Justice Frankfurter because -- let's take a common situation of a power of appointment in the will where a man is given the life interest but no right to invade the corpus. 
    But it is provided that he may on his death, by will, executed the due formalities of the state in which he lives, exercise a power of appointment to distribute the corpus of the trust and direct his executor to do so or should go to his executor for that purpose. 
    Or he might under some constructions and under some trust even exercise it to become part of the general assets of his -- his estate. 
    It's a very common thing these days. 
    We've had with men who put their assets in the hands of a bank, say even in a irrevocable inter vivos trust to provide for a power of appointment he exercised by will and he exercise that power of appointment in favor of their executors for the purposes set forth in the will.

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    Yes. 
    I do Your Honor. 
    I believe then that we come up to a question which should -- should really not be before this Court but which we've cited authorities below that the appellant would be bound by the judgment of the Superior Court in California which distributed the right which the executor exercise. 
    This copyright was renewed by the executor, went into the estate. 
    If you interpret the instrument as an agreement to leave a will then it becomes a question of state law whether it complied with those aspects of it and then under state law becomes a further question if he is not bound by the decree of distribution distributing it for the nieces and nephews. 
    See, what happened here was, they got it from three brothers and the man quite naturally having brothers have the same ages as he was, made a general request, some specific request and left everything to his nieces and nephews, those are nephew -- nieces and nephews that took the right that was exercised by the executor. 
    But we do get a question of state law if you want to interpret the instrument but it has not been urged. 
    He started out urging that but when faced in the lower court unless the res judicata question departed from that and has rested this case. 
    I submit solely, on the assignment of the author which is step one in which assignment I say never vested that right, never vested because the man died before the 28th year. 
    Then the widow, child -- the children came in since their being not -- we went to the third step, the author's executor and as I hoped that I have now made clear and I apologize if I did not make it clear before. 
    We're not arguing that the author during his lifetime could not assign that right but we say, the Court doesn't reach that question because he didn't assign it.

    That Fisher versus Witmark dealt with the right given by Congress to the author to renew the copyright if he survived the 28th year. 
    This case deals with the right given by Congress to an author who does not survive the 28th year and who does not live surviving him a wife, widower or children or child to bequeath by will.

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    -- than it is, Your Honor. 
    [Laughs]I believe that, that's it. 
    I'd like to briefly refer to Fox versus Knowles which was cited for a proposition, I didn't understand to hold. 
    It very simply held that the executor has the rights and renew which is independent of the author's right. 
    It's -- it's of significance here prior to the Fox case. 
    There seem to be the thought that the executor was in the statute only exercise the right of renewal if the author made it into the 28th year but he didn't exercise the right during the 28th year. 
    And therefore, the executor had a limited function in the statute. 
    In Fox case held otherwise and said that it was a separate and independent right. 
    Referring to what is exercising the same right of the decedent, it didn't mean the same grant of right under step one, the same type of right. 
    Just as this Court has said that the widow and children exercise the same right that the author have if he dies (Inaudible)
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="5577.476" stopTime="5584.570">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    And that -- that so even though the author died prior to the beginning of the 28th year

    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    Yes.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="5585.576" stopTime="5591.880">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    And that was the situation in the Fox case. 
    So, something did survive through the executor.
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="5591.880" stopTime="5595.489">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    Yes. 
    That's right. 
    If something survived to the author in a way --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="5595.489" stopTime="5595.727">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Now, then --
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="5595.727" stopTime="5598.418">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    -- he could exercise it prior to his death, the power of appointment.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="5598.418" stopTime="5609.324">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Then does an executor at least normally take assets in his hands subject to valid contracts made with the testator?
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="5609.324" stopTime="5611.258">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    Yes. 
    That's a true statement of general law.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Now, does that apply to copyrights, I don't know?
speaker="milton_a_rudin" startTime="5614.641" stopTime="5671.594">
    Mr. Milton A. Rudin 
    It would apply to copyrights if that was the type of contract involved here, Your Honor, but it was not. 
    If he had made a contract about the balance of the original term and the executor took it in the same manner he took Black Acre, the executor would be bound by it. 
    But what he had, what the author had was a power of appointment and our basic position is that the petitioner here by the bargain for nor obtained the -- that right but he -- that his assignment doesn't carry with it, he didn't bargain for it when he obtained -- obtained it. 
    He might have gotten it but perhaps if he appointed out for the man, he might have given him more than $1000 but he didn't buy that right. 
    And it's a separate and independent right, this is a case where an executor exercises the power of appointment and it's not the question of a divulsion of property that the man own. 
    This is after all a franchise, a grant by Congress which comes into being after the man dies and that's our position.

    He has whatever the -- for the left. 
    Even your case of a power of appointment is not outside of that because he has that something called he could make a disposition on his death and there is no -- there's no immaterial moment there between the death of the executor and -- between the death of the testator and the executor.

    Of course you see as this Court said if I may respectfully say so, that if he has no wife and child he has a power, see, to designate by will, the executor apply for the renewal which of course would be for the purpose affecting the author's disposition thereof. 
    That's the way it is done. 
    If it intended, if the statute intended, may I say, that it should only be applied -- it should only apply for beneficiaries undergo it until he said so. 
    Instead of saying, he didn't leave a will or to have to save us if I might respectfully say so, if -- if there's no beneficiaries this is -- it is not disposed at the beneficiaries.
