    Mr. Pesek, you may proceed.
speaker="leon_f_pesek" startTime="4.449" stopTime="76.257">
    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    Thank you, sir. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart asked me a question before recess I would like to go into and that involved the case of United States -- Pollard versus the United States. 
    In that case, Your Honor, the petitioner there was convicted of a federal offense at an earlier time and he thought he was being led off that without any sentence at all. 
    He left the courtroom and later on that day, the District Attorney came up to the judge and said, “Judge, what are you going to do about Mr. Pollard?” 
    He says, “Oh, yes, give him three years and probate the sentence.” 
    Some two years later, he got into some more trouble of federal offense. 
    It faded me just what it was. 
    And instead of going and trying in for that one, the judge revoked the probation and he was confined in the penitentiary. 
    He filed for his writ of habeas corpus, but in --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="76.257" stopTime="78.208">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that was under Section 2255.
speaker="leon_f_pesek" startTime="78.208" stopTime="209.619">
    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    On the -- that's right, sir. 
    And then, in that case, he was saying that the judgement itself was unlawful that the Court did not have jurisdiction to try the case because there's no question about him not being present or his attorney being present at the time and as a matter of fact, he didn't even know that he was under such a sentence. 
    And that -- in that particular case, they said however that because there -- there were other factors involved that would make the -- him lose on his merits, they refused to -- this Court had refused to grant him the writ because it said it would not -- it would serve no use for purpose, because he would lose on his merits, if they send it back to the trial in the federal court. 
    This Court also held that it will not render a judgement unless it can in some way be of material effect. 
    Now, comparing that case with -- to our present case, where we -- we come to the question of some type of moral stigma that might be placed upon the petitioner here. 
    The one stigma that was alleged it might -- could have occur would be that of a -- his failure to vote. 
    But the records of this case disclosed that he had been previously convicted in other States on -- I believe it was eight other felonies under Texas law whether this case was set aside or not, he would lose. 
    He would not be able to vote. 
    Also, I might call the Court's attention to the language that he used in the St. Pierre case where the man was saying that -- applicant was also saying that -- suggesting that the judgement might impair his credibility as a witness in future legal proceedings, the Court here held that the moral stigma of a judgement which no longer affects legal rights, does not present a case or controversy for appellate review since it causes moot, the writ will be dismissed.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I'm told that -- as my understanding that -- that the Secretary of State has -- has the right to prevent a man from traveling out of this country if he's -- if he's convicted of a felony.

    And I -- I have no doubt if we went through the votes so we could find a good many other situations where a man might loose very substantial rights by -- by virtue of a conviction of this kind if it was not set aside, and if it's -- if it's constitutional infirmity in the case, and he was in prison when he came here, why -- why shouldn't he provided to adjudicate it here?
speaker="leon_f_pesek" startTime="468.804" stopTime="511.187">
    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    Well, in this particular case, as I understand it that he -- Mr. Chief Justice, as I see it, if he was illegally tried and convicted, he has another remedy. 
    I do not believe that the writ of habeas corpus procedure is a remedy that he should follow. 
    There is a constitutional provision in the State of Texas which allows a man who is -- has been unlawfully tried and convicted and -- and then one who is tried and convicted to serve a sentence to go, first of all, to get a pardon from the Governor. 
    If he has served time, he can go to the legislature and ask the -- and have someone --

    -- isn't it?
speaker="leon_f_pesek" startTime="515.220" stopTime="550.578">
    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    -- but that is a procedure that he has to follow which would determine first of all whether he was in fact convicted of a crime unjustly. 
    And for that reason, I'm saying, Mr. Chief Justice, that -- in this particular case, he has come up here under a writ of habeas corpus. 
    I'm saying that because of the -- the specific points of the writ of habeas corpus cover, that is one who is in confinement, unlawful confinement can be released.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="550.578" stopTime="552.342">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, I understand.
speaker="leon_f_pesek" startTime="552.342" stopTime="583.695">
    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    That -- and -- because he is no longer confined, because there is no one to serve the writ on at this time even if it were issued, because Mr. Ellis cannot discharge him because he has already discharged him. 
    So therefore, the question has become moot, it is in regard to the habeas corpus procedure possibly not moot in regard to some other legal procedures that he might go to, to clear up his good name if in fact he was not tried and convicted properly.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="583.695" stopTime="592.494">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What -- which -- I think I stopped you when you started.

    Would you -- would do that please?
speaker="leon_f_pesek" startTime="592.494" stopTime="673.144">
    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    I've never followed -- I had occasion to try a case of that power to use a procedure, but my understanding, Mr. Chief Justice, is that anyone who is -- contends that he was unlawfully convicted or served time can by himself or through counsel file an application to the Governor and ask the Governor to pardon me. 
    The Governor, I maybe in error here, but it's my understanding that the Governor asked the Board of Pardon -- Parole to investigate it, and then he makes a determination. 
    He also has a right to -- if he is -- from the evidence adduced at the hearing that he was unlawfully convicted. 
    He can then, in a served time, he can then go to the legislature and have this Congress -- representative or Senator introduce legislation saying -- which is a new constitutional provision in Texas. 
    I believe it's about two years or -- if I'm not mistaken. 
    And they will or can, I won't say that they will, I say that they can grant him certain amount of money because of his conviction and that -- the pardon plus that certainly would clear the man's name.

    There is no occasion that I can recall reading that a nunc pro tunc order as such has been issued or -- by this Court in a habeas corpus procedure as such. 
    In the Pollard case, it was discussed but it went off on another theory and it was not introduced or was not granted. 
    In summing up, the respondent's position that on the question of mootness, there is nothing that can be gained at this time by the Court granting a writ because there is no restraint. 
    It is our position that some type of restraint must lie before a writ of habeas corpus can issue.

    Mr. Justice Whittaker, I believe in regard to -- if he were retried again and say, for instance, he -- I believe the question was if it'd be -- writ was issued and granted. 
    He went back and it was determined that he was not lagally tried, then it would go back to the trial court. 
    What repercussion would that be? 
    They could retry -- it is my understanding of the law that they could retry him. 
    It would be up to the Court. 
    It'd be up to the judge to determine whether he would grant him good time or grant him the time that he has already served, but I think that would be within the discretion of the Court because he was the one that set the wheels in motion to get his trial, his case reversed. 
    So I would say that in our probability, that the trial judge would allow this time that he has served and be credited on the -- the amount of time that the -- the jury could give but it would be within his discretion.

    Someone might have been arrested right or maybe four or five months before the grand jury would meet and have to stay because he could make a bond.

speaker="leon_f_pesek" startTime="959.276" stopTime="1085.751">
    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    No, sir, I don't. 
    I -- I think that in going into the -- the case, first of all, whether the petitioner here was denied due process, as -- I differ very strongly with petitioner in his -- in his briefs and in his application. 
    The record discloses and throughout that his contends that he was denied due process mainly for two reasons, one that he was denied counsel and he stated in his application for habeas corpus that he asked the Court for counsel which was promptly refused. 
    Then he states that he was denied a motion, his motion was denied for a continuance because of ill health or illness. 
    There is nothing in the record. 
    The transcript of the entire record from the first word to the last that he asked for either one of these. 
    So therefore, the question of whether he knew that -- what his rights were to ask for counsel. 
    Now, as Mr. Chief Justice stated that there -- never was properly brought before the Court that he was tried and convicted eight different times, but for the purpose of this argument here, the report shows that if it was true, the man was no novice in the court -- in the courtroom procedure. 
    He -- the eight -- the record discloses that the eight offenses that he was tried and convicted up were offenses of forgery and passing hot checks. 
    I ventured to say that he was more qualified in that respect as to any possible defenses that he might have and as to any type of contentions and plans of defense as many attorneys might have themselves.

    Mr. -- Mr. Justice, I have found that to be that some of the students of the criminal law are in our penitentiaries. 
    They come in or referred to them as guardhouse lawyers. 
    And in several cases, I have come up against them and they spend their time well. 
    But -- and I would say that this man was one of them. 
    I think that this was a premeditated type of defense. 
    He had an idea. 
    He knew from past experiences what it would take to convict him. 
    He considered his age. 
    He considered the fact that he was ill. 
    And he -- he thought to himself that they -- they've got -- they've got me on the low but maybe I can attract the sympathy of the jury. 
    The fact that he went there didn't even question his brother-in-law. 
    And if there were any ill feelings among the family circle, he would have brought that point out. 
    He sat by and let all of the evidence come in. 
    He had a right as -- as the trial judge in his certificate stated that he was given -- afforded the opportunity to first of all talk with the potential jurors in the voir dire that he had a right to challenge the jury, that he was given that and informed of that right that he did not do any of these things. 
    Then the only thing that he did, when he got up there, was to put on a bunch of callings to say that he was ill and there's no denial, possibly he was. 
    And -- and he was hoping that because of his age and because of his ill health that the -- that the jury would be lenient on him, which might have been a good defense before another jury, but this jury just didn't buy it. 
    And now, he comes before this honorable Court and asked this honorable Court to -- to correct his mistaken judgement.

    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    No, sir. 
    I don't. 
    I -- I don't. 
    I think it -- the fact that they -- it can be weighed makes me -- there are many cases that is not necessary, but I think that it's -- it's good. 
    Well, I have no -- no quarrel with our legislature in that regard, sir. 
    But as far as the denial of due process is concerned and in regard to the question that you just asked, Mr. Chief Justice, with the -- there's -- there's no -- I mean the -- the law asserted by this Court in regard to the fact that the -- the States may themselves prescribe their own procedures in accordance with its ideas in the most inefficient administration of criminal justice. 
    This along, as in doing so, a man is not deprived of due process. 
    Now, there was a case of Adamson versus California where the question came before this Court where the accused was -- the prosecution commented upon the failure of the accused to testify. 
    And this Court said that that would not in itself be a denial of due process. 
    And also, in Wolf versus Colorado, where evidence obtained by illegal search and seizure was admitted into evidence, this Court held that it would -- that'd be a denial of due process. 
    Then Gallegos versus Nebraska where a confession was admitted into evidence, where the defendant was not given an appearance or an arraignment. 
    In that case, the Court says that they all -- that the Due Process Clause does not prevent a State from allowing the prosecution to comment on the evidence or this evidence -- this other type of evidence coming in. 
    It says unlike the specific requirements and restriction placed by the Bill of Rights upon the administration of criminal justice by federal authority, the Fourteenth Amendment did not subject criminal justice in the States to specific limitations.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Pesek, in this case, I -- counsel pointed out in fact that although you have a -- a statute which prohibits the use of a -- a confession unless it is taken in a certain way that you're -- you're sharing when this man was not represented by -- by counsel and in all probability, did not know that law took the stands and that the instance of a prosecution testified to a confession contrary to that statute.

    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    It -- Mr. Chief Justice, what went on at the trial, I -- I don't know.

    If you might conceive it to be that there was some -- he -- he might've wanted you to come in. 
    I mean there's a possibility I can't proceed in this particular case. 
    He did not object to it. 
    He -- he also have to show that a confession must be made after the man was arrested and was in confinement, that wasn't brought out.

    So that's the reason I'm -- I'm saying that. 
    I -- it could've been mentioned prior to that time. 
    I do know that even in his own application here that he had -- he had mentioned --he admits that he told the sheriff that he was guilty of writing some checks and I don't be there in regard to this particular case. 
    But he makes certain admissions. 
    He admits that he is -- in his petition that he is guilty of passing a forged instrument, but now, he says he's not guilty, but he is not guilty of forgery. 
    But the facts of this case is -- is, honestly, it -- are -- are two -- first of all, he was not as lay down by this Court.

    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    He was not denied due process, as that term has been laid down by this Court in the rules formerly Betts versus Brady. 
    He did not urge that at his time of his trial that he was denied right of counsel. 
    He didn't ask for it. 
    This case -- the -- in McKenna versus the State, this Court had held that it's denial of due process to appoint an attorney where he's not -- where he's not wanted. 
    Here, the man did ask for one and he didn't get. 
    He didn't get counsel to defend him. 
    He did not urge as he contends in his petition that he was sick. 
    There's a statement in the -- in the trial here and in the statement of facts that by the judge who said that he was afforded every fair opportunity that the -- many of the things that he alleged here just didn't happen as the record clearly discloses. 
    It is not attacked -- the record that the person taking the record did not put everything in there.

    Mr. Leon F. Pesek 
    That's true. 
    But, Mr. Chief Justice, there's a difference in being -- in failing health and -- and being sick at the time of the trial. 
    A man can be feeling by at all of the time. 
    But I mean you could be much more or ill a whole lot more at one time, you see, at the time of trial that he just couldn't go, and the man is suffering from a heart -- heart disease and he gets around. 
    The facts in this case show that he did conduct some type of defense and that he had an idea in mind -- he didn't indicate or doesn't indicate that he was sick at the time of his trial.

    Mr. Frank M. Wozencraft 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Perhaps I can answer one of the questions which Mr. Justice Clark just asked by reading the document which was written by the Court of Criminal Appeals. 
    I can find it here. 
    There were four points that he -- that he brought up in that or -- in that order, sir, when he -- when he denied habeas corpus. 
    It says here that it was admitted in printing in the place where I was looking for it, but I think it's somewhere else as well. 
    One point was that he had not properly shown that the -- that he -- we needed counsel. 
    Another was that the evidence was sufficient at the time of the trial and that he did not raise the question of his illness correctly because he did not ask for a motion of continuance. 
    The contention that George Lee Parker is so experienced in his trials that he needed no lawyer. 
    The contention that his defense was premeditated. 
    The contention that appears at page 13 of respondent's brief that it was only in the quite confines of his jail cell that he first realized that he's plan of defense had failed. 
    Founder upon this record. 
    The contention of respondent that this man was not denied due process. 
    Founders upon his admission that this man was not competent to conduct his own trial and that indeed no layman in any matter this intricate can hope to conduct competently his own trial. 
    The critique procedures which respondent has suggested that Parker can go to a legislature for relief and can go to the Governor for relief and make it more imperative, not less that this Court reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals because how can this man hope for any hearing from the legislature or from the Governor in the face of the opinion of the Fifth Circuit in this case.

    And I believe that -- as Mr. Pesek has said, there is no judicial procedure in Texas for him to prove so. 
    And that is why I think it's very important for this Court to make that statement. 
    Now, I have suggested the method of a habeas corpus writ issued nunc pro tunc. 
    This is a suggested form of relief which I propose. 
    I certainly feel that petitioner and certainly I would be entirely satisfied with any other form of relief which this -- this Court considers more appropriate.

    The plaintiff died and instead of doing what on the Iowa law could be done when it's authorized to be done adding a survival proceeding, they went ahead and decided the merits. 
    The question then came up in this Court on whether that was a void judgment in Iowa, which is a case different from this to me as nights and days.

    Mr. Frank M. Wozencraft 
    The doctrine of nunc pro tunc certainly has been used to collect -- is to correct clerical errors, but it also has been used to correct judgments -- not to correct judgments, to enter judgments which have not been entered. 
    And this Court has entered no judgment now -- in this case. 
    Now, in Harris versus Commissioner in 340 U.S., nunc pro tunc was used by this Court after the death of the Commissioner to avoid abatement. 
    In Quon Quon Poy versus Johnson which was mentioned earlier, nunc pro tunc was used to enter a judgment which had never been entered and which indeed reversed -- no, it didn't reverse, it -- it affirmed and remanded that man. 
    But there again, it was the entry of a judgment not the correction of -- of a clerical error.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You made a thorough study knowing you as I do.

    Mr. Frank M. Wozencraft 
    The -- the only habeas corpus case which I have found, sir, is Quon Quon Poy which was the other side of the coin. 
    But I do believe that -- that did constitute a case. 
    Harris does constitute a case where this Court has entered a judgment after the death of a party which otherwise would have subjected the decision to -- the case to abatement. 
    And I'm asking here, sir, that the same theory be applied.

    How strongly if -- at all do you think Pollard against the United States supports your position?
speaker="frank_m_wozencraft" startTime="2631.925" stopTime="2711.850">
    Mr. Frank M. Wozencraft 
    Your Honor, I believe Pollard versus the United States is in point in its declaration that there -- there is a possibility of continuing legal consequences and that these are sufficiently substantial to justify your dealing with the merits. 
    And I believe that the Pollard case although it happens to involved Article 2255, Your Honor's conquering opinion in the Heflin case concurred in by four other justices equates the matter of custody as far as 225 -- 2255 is concerned and as far as 2241 is concerned. 
    I would hope therefore that this man may also obtain a review on the merits which Pollard obtained. 
    Now, if there is some other method by which -- if -- if the Court doesn't happen to like nunc pro tunc or it doesn't think it's applicable, if they prefer to say that there is a continuing constructive custody because of the degree to which this man's civil liberties are restrained, that will leave us to say be entirely satisfactory to -- to petitioner because what we believe is that petitioner is entitled to a declaration that his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained. 
    Now, if --

    Mr. Frank M. Wozencraft 
    I would regard this as a decision, sir, which would have in it a declaration but would also be a decision and indeed an order issued as of a date when the man was in custody. 
    But I repeat that the -- that the main thing that we're after is a recognition here that his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained. 
    Now, if this Court does feel that the case is now moot, then I believe its course is clear under Duke Power Company versus Greenwood under U.S. versus Munsingwear, this Court should vacate the judgments of the two courts below not leaving them standing to spawn adverse legal consequences as Mr. Justice Douglas mentioned in the opinion of the Court in the Munsingwear case and remand the case to the District Court for dismissal as moot. 
    Thereby, at least wiping out the Federal stamp of approval which to this day rests upon this conviction.

    There maybe some other form of order which this Court would regard as more appropriate, but that is the -- that is the form which I've suggested in my brief. 
    The very availability of the legislative remedies and of pardon as is now sought are the factors which certainly as far as this individual petitioner is concerned do mean that a definite function will be served by having his unconstitutional conviction is -- his conviction held unconstitutional because then obviously his position in going to the Governor for a pardon or particularly to the legislature for compensation, and I assure you, that's not that he is interested in, would be vastly improved by a recognition that the decision was unconstitutional, whereas in the present state of the record, there is just the reverse determination by the federal courts.
