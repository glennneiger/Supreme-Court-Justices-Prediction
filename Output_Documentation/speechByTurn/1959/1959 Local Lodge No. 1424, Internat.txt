    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    May it please the Court. 
    As I started to point out at the -- at the recess, the kind of situation that you had here -- well, you had the continuing application in the union security clause going on. 
    We kept the dispute, as the court below pointed out, rankling at least once a month in the mind of the employees, and the record bears this out. 
    It shows that an error of uncertainty prevailed among the employees as to how the Union got in when they learned of the union security agreement. 
    Their inquiries met evasive replies and accusations of being troublemakers. 
    Now, what --

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    I think that the findings of the Board, as set forth in -- in our brief, bear out -- I'm paraphrasing, Your Honor, “However, the continued application of the contract kept the employees wondering and toward the end of the first year of the contract when it became appropriate to reopen it, the questioning resumed and at this time, the IAM representative explained to a group of the employees that the Union had gotten in because it had the company connected with Bryan over a barrel.”

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    The IAM representative explained to the employees, as late as the summer of 1955, about 10 months after the contract had run when they were continuing to wonder why it is that they -- that the IAM had -- had gotten this contract.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    That the Union had gotten in, this is the IAM representative explaining to the employees because it had a company connected with Bryan, the petitioner here, over a barrel. 
    In other words, the contract with the Union and Bryan was part of the quid pro quo for settling some other dispute that the Union had with another related employer. 
    And shortly, thereafter, the charges here were filed. 
    So you didn't have something that -- that died down right at the outset. 
    And, we submit, the realities of industrial life are such that, in a matter of this sort, you do not end with the execution of the contract, particularly where, as I pointed out earlier, you have new employees that are being added here throughout the period.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    That was given in June of 1955, after the contract had run about 10 months, Your Honor, the -- the initial contract.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, what there -- by that, do you mean that he said they had them over a barrel and -- and they forced him to do it?

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    That is correct.

    Answer -- “Was anything said by anyone else on that?” 
    Answer, “Well, general conversation.” 
    Question, “What was that general conversation?” 
    “They wanted to crept to -- they wanted to get it across that they came in legal.” 
    That's what they were trying to get across to us. 
    Apparently, not that they had not gotten them over a barrel and coerced them into do it, but -- doing it but, apparently, that they -- there were some relationship that made it legal for them to do this.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="352.191" stopTime="375.629">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, the inference, Your Honor, that the Board draws from this testimony and from the related testimony of the other witnesses was that the union organizers made no secret about the fact that they got in not because they had organized the employees but because the employer had given them a contract.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="375.629" stopTime="377.109">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker

speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="377.109" stopTime="403.250">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    No, that is not disputed. 
    The Union is not denying here or disputing, as I understand it, the findings of the Board that it did not have a majority at the time the contract was -- was entered into. 
    I just wanted to indicate that the employees continued to have some question about this, long after the contract was -- was executed.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, I think it bears on -- on the issue in the sense that the argument is made that the statute of limitations are intended to -- to give repose. 
    And our answer to that is that, that is true in a situation where the conduct has stopped but where you have a continuing enforcement of the contract, as you had here, you continue to dispute and it rankled -- it bothered the employees each month, and I was just pointing out that that fact which you could reasonably expect would happen was indeed borne out by the -- by the record here.

    You have that same -- you could make that same argument in the (Inaudible) where there's no union security clause involved.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="474.529" stopTime="504.932">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    I think you could, Your Honor, but you'd have greater difficulty in -- in proving that that was sought. 
    I think that where you have something as affirmative as a continuing collection of dues, you are taking some positive steps within the period to continue the wrong that was perpetrated at the -- at the outset.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="504.932" stopTime="525.001">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Supposing the Union, during this period, had been complaisant about the -- the security fee, it accepted the fee and voluntarily paid a followup -- followup on those who pay, what would your situation be like?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="525.001" stopTime="725.123">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, I think that we might get close to those company union cases that Mr. Dunau has -- has cited. 
    It might make a difference where there was no -- where the situation remained passive within the period, but that is not this case and I think that, in this case, we have some very positive acts that were occurring which are clearly -- would amount to additional unfair labor practices but for the 10 (b) problem here. 
    And we submit that that is no barrier here because we looked at the past events merely for shedding light on what occurred here. 
    In other words, what I'm trying to say is that whatever may be said of the situation you present, Mr. Justice Harlan, it's pretty well settled, at least in the Courts of Appeals, that you have separate unfair labor practices not only when you enforce an illegal union security clause. 
    You've got an unfair labor practice at the time of the execution and you have got it when you -- when you enforce it. 
    The Second Circuit, I think, made that clear in the Gaynor News case which is a little bit closer to the situation that we have here than the illegal on its face cases that I mentioned at the -- at the outset. 
    In the Gaynor News case, you had a union security clause that was illegal not because of anything that appeared from the face of the contract, I mean, the clause there provided for becoming a union member within 45 days is permitted by 8 (a) (3), but the clause was illegal because, at the time the contract was entered into, there had not been a union shop election as required by Section 9 (e) of the Act. 
    So, it was necessary to leave the face of the contract for the purpose of ascertaining whether this past event had occurred. 
    And the Board found and the Second Circuit in an opinion by Judge Frank upheld the Board's finding that 10 (b) was not barred here. 
    Whatever may be said about the execution of the contract, the maintenance of that illegal contract within the limitations period, notwithstanding the fact that you had to leave the face of the contract to determine its illegality, was a separate unfair labor practice as to which, as Judge Frank put it, the limitations period had not yet begun to run.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="725.123" stopTime="763.520">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, are you arguing, in effect, that through the active enforcement of the 1954 agreement within the statutory period, the 1954 agreement has made a continuing unfair labor practice just as an innocent overt act may continue a conspiracy to demand people in jail or the conspiracy itself has been outlawed and nothing remains except this innocent overt act which pose the agreement into the requisite statutory period? 
    Is that what you're arguing?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="763.520" stopTime="769.795">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    I think that my argument comes close to that, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="769.795" stopTime="790.425">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, it's a very different thing from saying that the original illegality is a continuing illegality and saying that an isolated act within the statutory period is a new unfair labor practice. 
    They are different things. 
    It may come to the same result but I think the analyses are different.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="790.425" stopTime="827.678">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Mr. Come, let me ask you this. 
    Suppose this charge had not been brought when it was and toward the end of this three-year agreement that they had, the parties entered into another agreement for five years, based upon the same relationship, and nothing was done there until toward the end of the five years of the next contract. 
    Could they date that back to -- to this unfair labor practice that you are talking about and -- and avoid those situations then?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="827.678" stopTime="839.437">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    I think that the logic of the -- of the Board's position, assuming that the contract continued to be enforced --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="839.437" stopTime="840.686">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="840.686" stopTime="871.590">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    -- would permit that. 
    However, we have running across that however. 
    The concurrent principle of the weight and relevancy of -- to be given to -- to ancient evidence in a situation such as that, it might be extremely difficult for the Board to obtain any probative evidence that could establish the original illegality.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="871.590" stopTime="883.115">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That's true. 
    Well, these don't -- these don't bother about how difficult it would be. 
    Would -- would the Board have the power to do that in the light of this Section 10 (b)?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="883.115" stopTime="885.392">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    I think it would, Your Honor.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    It --

speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="905.046" stopTime="939.069">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    We are not predicating any liability on the original making of the contract. 
    We are looking to the events surrounding that and it's not necessary for us to determine that that is an unfair labor practice. 
    It's -- it happens to be accidental that those past events would to add up to an independent unfair labor practice of their own, but that is irrelevant to the use which the -- which the Board puts the facts that it gathers from the past period.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="939.069" stopTime="948.296">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Why do you look to it (Inaudible) at all?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="948.296" stopTime="1018.850">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, we look to the making of the contract to see whether or not, within the current period, the Union has available to it the defense that it is privilege to exact these dues payments because it was the majority -- it is the majority representative. 
    The collection of -- of dues and the requiring of employees to join a union as a condition of employment is the clearest form of violation of the Act and had we had nothing more than that and this contract were -- were not in the picture, there'd be no question that there'd be an unfair labor practice. 
    Now, the company comes forward with the -- with the contract. 
    At that point, the question is whether the contract really affords them a defense, and the Board is going to the past period there to ascertain whether or not the defense of majority status is available to the Union with respect to the acts that it's performing currently.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1018.850" stopTime="1050.614">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is there anything in the Act, aside from 10 (b), that would provide for any repose, any lack of -- any -- any time at all within a period of years which would make the contract not subject to attack if it would had originally a -- some defect in it, nobody raised it and it was renewed and renewed from time to time for 10 years? Is there anything in the statute?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1050.614" stopTime="1056.438">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    No, Your Honor, I do not think that there is, other than the difficulties of proof that you would have.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1056.438" stopTime="1074.081">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I suppose you -- if it -- like you do now, you'd look back to this first time am I -- employees might have going along for years. 
    If you ask what year, it's been almost a year, and you just look back to see what happened the first time, then there is no statute of limitations.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1074.081" stopTime="1081.885">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    There is a statute of limitations with respect to a conduct that has -- that has seized.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1081.885" stopTime="1092.096">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    As I understand it, here, you will seize it if they have a contract and then renewed a contract and renewed a contract and renewed a contract. 
    It's still going on. 
    That's right, isn't it?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1092.096" stopTime="1102.869">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    That is right, Your Honor. 
    The original dispute is being continued currently. 
    It's the -- it's the nature of this particular controversy.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1102.869" stopTime="1117.216">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think the Court, under circumstances like that, they might -- I expected you to give another answer, maybe it's -- maybe it wouldn't be a good answer, the courts is just acting somewhat in the equitable capacity to hold that it's barred by laches?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1117.216" stopTime="1164.071">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, it's been held that laches does not apply to the Government in particularly, the Board proceedings. 
    However, the Board itself, prior to the enactment of 10 (b), did have a laches principle which it invoked on its own. 
    If it found that an employee, for example, was unduly delayed in -- in filing a charge of a wrongful discharge, it would toll the running of -- of back pay. 
    And I think that it is within the Board's discretion and power to do that even apart from -- from 10 (b). 
    Now, I'd like to talk --

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, the -- as I -- as I think I indicated earlier, this continuing violation theory is not a new one. 
    That has been applied in a number of -- of illegal union security cases, all of which are mentioned in our brief, in situations where the agreement was invalid on its face --

    Is that right or is it you, the Board, who relies on the contracts?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1272.296" stopTime="1289.059">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, I think, analytically, it is probably the company and the Union that do but as soon as the contract comes to light, the burden is then shifted to the -- to the Board to establish the validity of the contract.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1289.059" stopTime="1290.043">

    And I ask that because the Board, in construing this -- in dealing with this problem and recognizing the novelty of it, as they did in terms, don't seem to discuss the legislative history problem.

    I was just coming to that.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Good.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1670.782" stopTime="1952.080">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    We have discussed it in our brief however. 
    We believe that the riders had a broader sweep than 10 (b). 
    In the first place, the language of the original rider which was introduced in 1944 provided in relevant part that no funds shall be used in any way in connection with a complaint arising over an agreement between management and labor which has been in existence for three months or longer without a complaint being filed. 
    This language would have precluded using the agreement for any purposes. 
    You couldn't predicate a violation on the contract even if it were invalid on its face, a situation which petitioners concede would not be barred by Section 10 (b). 
    And I think the reason for that is that, and this is borne out by the legislative history of the -- of the riders, that the purpose that Congress had there was a broader purpose than they had with respect to 10 (b). 
    They weren't concerned solely with protecting against stale claims rather, the riders were designed to prevent interruptions to war production through a tax by outside unions on closed-shop contracts that had been entered into in the -- in the defense industries and -- and the shipyards where the necessary production was being gotten out and the employees immediately involved weren't complaining about the illegality of the contract. 
    In other words, it was aimed at preventing disruption to wartime production. 
    What this wartime objective, Congress could well have continence and, we in -- as we think the language of the riders shows, more of an invasion on the statutory rights of the employees. 
    Then, it was going to permit in 1947 when it came around to enacting a limitations provision as such. 
    And therefore, we think that when Congress said in the Senate Report that the riders were unnecessary because they were now enacting a limitations provision. 
    This was merely a generalized statement to the effect that, since they were dealing with questions of liability for past unfair labor practices, specifically in 10 (b), the rider was no longer needed without necessarily suggesting that the scope of the rider was the same as that of 10 (b) which, from the reading that I have given to this Court, it is apparent that it is not. 
    Moreover, it is very interesting that by the time Congress got around to enacting 10 (b), the rider had -- had been so watered down that in fact, it would even have had less scope than 10 (b) has even under the Board's interpretation because in the years subsequent to 1944, when it was first enacted, they excluded contracts with company-dominated unions. 
    In other words, the three-month bar didn't -- didn't apply to that kind of a contract. 
    They excluded renewals of an -- this is from the riders, renewals of an existing contract on the three-month limitation. 
    And then the very same Congress which enacted 10 (b), despite the fact that they said that the rider wasn't necessary, goes ahead and nevertheless enacts a rider for 1948. 
    And in that rider, they give immunity only to contracts with a majority union, and the reason they say that is that they didn't want to sanction these sweetheart arrangements. 
    But a contract is entered into when the union does not represent a minority.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Now, it refers to the current appropriations within the three-month period. 
    The rider to the then current appropriations bill to which the Senate Report referred has this provision which has been in existence for three months or longer without complaint. 
    I understood you to say that at the time this report was written, the rider had been watered down. 
    Is that right?

    Now, what rider are you referring? 
    It can't be the rider that the Senate Report was referring to because I gather that Mr. Dunau wants me to believe, wants me to assume that the rider referred to in this Report No. 105 is the one he sets forth on page 36, and that isn't any watering down.

    Mr. Norton J. Come

    Mr. Bernard Dunau 
    We -- we can divide it into two parts. 
    The Board made one finding, namely, that maintenance of the first agreement into a -- in effect, constitute a violation of the Act. 
    That could certainly not have been litigated under the rider because it -- the charge came more than three months after that agreement. 
    Now, it seems to me that when the rider said a renewal can be -- a renewal agreement can be attacked within three months, it said, “Yes, from three months on August 31st, 1955, you can attack that agreement,” but I do not think it said at the same time that if your evidence necessary to attack that second agreement has to go back to the evidence which would open the first agreement, and you were barred from opening the first agreement, that the rider would not have protected both the first and the second, otherwise, on the renewal, you would have reopened what have been closed by the first --

    The pro -- yes, sir, it is different because under the rider, there is no possible claim that you there -- under the rider, you have to file your charge within three months of the inception of the agreement. 
    It says so in so many words. 
    Now, our argument is, if under the rider you have to file your charge within three months of the agreement, we cannot understand an interpretation of Section 10 (b) which replaces the rider which says that you do not measure the limitations from the inception of the agreement but from -- well, you don't measure it from anything because it continue -- it never runs.

    Mr. Bernard Dunau 
    What we draw from the riders and all we draw from the riders is that when Congress was dealing with this explicit situation of an agreement valid on its face but illegal because it was entered into with a minority union, it started its limitations period running from the date the execution of the agreement -- from the date of the execution of the agreement and the Board always understood, even after the 1945 rider was enacted which had the renewal language in it. 
    It said in its annual reports, “We cannot attack an agreement once the three months has expired even with a union which did not represent the majority when the agreement was executed."

    Mr. Bernard Dunau 
    The 1948 rider was enacted subsequent to Section 10 (b). 
    It's a meaningless rider the way it's written because you don't need a rider to protect an agreement entered into with a majority union. 
    And if you read the rider -- the 1948 rider literally, that's all you get out of it. 
    You get nothing from it. 
    It seems to us that the true explanation of the 1948 rider is that this whole limitations problem had already been settled by Section 10 (b) and if a couple of Senators or Congressmen wanted to enact the limitations rider having a different policy than Section 10 (b), nobody in Congress was interested in opposing it because the problem had already been settled in 10 (b).

    Mr. Bernard Dunau 
    Well, probably not. 
    If there were no contract at all, the Board would have a heck of a lot of more problems by way of proof, but I don't see that -- that -- analytically, it makes a difference whether the contract which reports the relationship is reduced to writing or whether the relationship is a practice which is unrecorded in writing. 
    Now, what we always get back to, and this is the finding of the Board from which, it seems to me, there is no escape of where we must begin, this is a product contract used defensively, all kinds of -- of verbalisms have been resorted to. 
    The finding is explicit. 
    The finding is that at the time the company and the IAM executed the August 1954 agreement, the Unions did not represent the majority of the employees covered by the agreement but that --

    What page is that?
speaker="bernard_dunau" startTime="3001.880" stopTime="3093.591">
    Mr. Bernard Dunau 
    I am reading from page 10 of my brief, Your Honor, which cites the Board's relevant finding on this subject. 
    This is the finding, that on August 10, 1954, the company and the Union entered into an agreement and the Union didn't have a majority. 
    And then, we have the crucial finding of the substantive violations. 
    It follows, therefore, and we find that the company violated Section 8 (a) (1), (2) and (3) and the Unions 8 (b) (1) (a) and (2) by maintaining in effect the 1954 agreement and by executing and maintaining in effect the 1955 agreement, both of which, contained unlawful union security clauses. 
    But what the Board was doing was finding that the agreements constituted unfair labor practices, the maintenance in effect and the execution and maintenance of the second agreement. 
    Not defensively, they weren't finding unfair labor practice upon any other basis. 
    And I might just add this, Your Honors, the union security provision of this agreement is, in this case, a red herring. 
    Nothing turns upon the fact that there is a union shop provision in this agreement. 
    We have the cases cited on our brief. 
    Without a union shop agreement, you get exactly the same violation of Section 8 (a) (1) and (2). 
    As the Board has stressed, all that the union shop provision does is to aggravate the violation. 
    It accents it. 
    But the violation exists with or without the union shop provision.
