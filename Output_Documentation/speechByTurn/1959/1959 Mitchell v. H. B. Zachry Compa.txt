    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    -- the scope of the production. 
    It also -- it went further and held that the 1949 amendment to production coverage was intended to exclude construction projects or as local enterprises. 
    We think it's significant that it's admitted here by respondent that if this were -- were just simply to repair or maintain the existing water system that it would still be within the coverage of the Act, as closely related and directly essential. 
    At least, I don't understand them to deny that and as I shall later point out the -- the cases, the decisions have long since settled that and the legislative history shows that Congress expressly approved the coverage of -- of maintenance and repair of this type of utility. 
    Respondents also assert that they -- they don't put any special -- attach any special importance to the new construction doctrine. 
    I think it's fair to say that they come pretty close to abandoning the Fifth Circuit's reliance on that doctrine. 
    They say that certainly, the language, at least the language of Vollmer and Alstate and Lublin should be applied as much to production coverage as in commerce coverage. 
    And that in general, the liberal construction doctrine should apply. 
    But they also say that if -- if this were a case where the water -- the dam and reservoir were being constructed solely or primarily for interstate producers and interstate instrumentalities, then they concede that there would be a forceful case for holding that the employees here were closely related and directly essential to production of goods by the producers within the area. 
    Their argument turns largely, if not entirely, on their construction of the amendment to the production coverage of the Act in 1949. 
    And respondent like the Court of Appeals below doesn't spend much time on the other grounds on which the District Court upheld coverage the Alstate ground. 
    The Court of Appeals dismissed that as -- said -- assumed that the Government wasn't relying on it mistakenly and their only comment was that the employees here certainly weren't producing any goods for commerce when they were construction the dam that they were -- they were simply producing the dam. 
    Our -- our answer to that is that this is the way you produce waters to construct the dam. 
    It's an engineering fact that you produce water by constructing a dam and a reservoir. 
    Just like --

    You gather water, don't you?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="207.441" stopTime="627.356">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    You impound it and they've -- and -- and producing is very broadly defined in the Act, actual producing it's -- is like you drill -- drill wells for oil or you mine -- dig and mine for coal and that this is as much producing water as the mining of coal is producing coal of a digging -- drilling of oil wells is producing oil so that the -- we don't need to minimize that ground of coverage when we direct most of our brief in answering the arguments of the Court of Appeals and respondents. 
    They do not give any answer to that and that is still, we think, a -- a sufficient basis of coverage. 
    Coming though to there -- in -- to the interpretation of the legislative history of the 1949 amendment to production, the Court of Appeals said that it didn't have to look to the legislative history to decide that Congress intended to expand the local enterprises that it was removing from the Act and it obviously assumed that what it did was to extract a part of the reasoning from this Court's office building case in Callus and relating to the performing activities of -- of rendering services for a miscellany of customers. 
    And relying heavily on -- on that reference to Callus, the Court said that this type of service to a miscellany of customers was intended to be excluded as local enterprise. 
    And this, in effect, is respondents' argument as I think is evident from their -- from their admission that if -- if this facility was designed primarily as solely deserved interstate producers and interstate instrumentalities, then it could forcefully be contended that the employees were covered as closely related and directly essential. 
    Both the Court of Appeals and respondents' argument rest on the assumption that it was a legislative intent in 1949 to very substantially curtail the scope of coverage. 
    They -- respondents said so in so many words. 
    Now, he -- respondent does look to some of the legislative history just the House Report and only parts of the House Report. 
    The Court of Appeals below didn't look at any of the legislative history. 
    Respondents, however, interpret what legislative history they looked at in the same way that apparently the court below interpreted it. 
    And I did want to say a word in answer to the Court of Appeals reliance on the new construction doctrine since the Court clearly relied pretty heavily on it. 
    It was the only basis on which it differed from the Eighth Circuit in the Chambers case, where the Eighth Circuit had pointed out that the Vollmer decision didn't establish anything new, it was just asserting the principle that had applied generally to the Act's coverage, and that this type of improvement are enlargement of an existing facility. 
    It had always been ruled within the coverage of the Act. 
    That original construction which had previously been thought to be by some outside the scope of that -- of the Act in which the administrator had earlier thought might be a basis for determining coverage on this Act meant something quite different from improvement and enlargement or expansion. 
    Now, the Fifth Circuit obviously treated this as new construction. 
    And our position is that whatever remains of the new construction doctrine in either phase of coverage, it clearly -- this Court's rulings have established that this does not apply to an improvement or an enlargement or -- or an expansion if that falls in the same category as repair and maintenance. 
    Now, there is nothing in the legislative history at all to -- relating to new construction. 
    The legislative reports did make clear both House and Senate reports stated in no uncertain terms that it was not the intent to make any drastic change in -- in the scope of coverage. 
    The House Report, I should point out that there was a divergence of -- between the House and Senate proposals originally. 
    The Senate didn't want to make any change in the definition of coverage, production coverage. 
    The House had proposed a more drastic language of closely related and indispensable. 
    The language, if the Act is enacted was a -- a compromise, and the reports of the Senate and House, I think, are the best evidence of what that compromise was intended to accomplish. 
    The House Committee Report stated explicitly, the amended section gives the courts a more specific guide as to the intention of Congress. 
    It does not, however, radically revise the coverage of the Act as it has been interpreted by the courts in the past. 
    And this -- and the Senate conferees report also stated that it was not intended to substantially change and limit the decisions construing the prior necessary to production language but rather to provide more certainty in this field. 
    And the Senate report specifically stated that the amended language adopts the standard of closely related which the Supreme Court has supplied in most of its decisions interpreting coverage.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Are those quoted in your brief?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="629.114" stopTime="1204.235">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    On page 45 of our brief. 
    And then the Senate report went on and said that the amendatory language is descriptive of activities which although not an integral part of productive operations have a relationship to production which may reasonably be considered close as distinguished from a remote entanglers and contemplates activities which are directly a production in a practical sense by providing something essential to carrying on in an effective, efficient and satisfactory manner of operations which are a part of an integrated effort for the production of goods. 
    Now, we say that that language comes very close to the test this Court has established for determining whether activities are within the in commerce coverage. 
    In the Vollmer case, the Court stated that the test was whether the work is so directly and vitally related to the functioning of an instrumentality or facility of interstate commerce as to be in practical effect a part of it rather than isolated local activity. 
    And in the Lublin case, I'm relating to the plans and specifications for improvement of interstate instrumentalities, the Court say -- stated that it was whether the work is directly and vitally related to the functioning of those interstate facilities. 
    Now, that language, I think -- we think parallel so closely the -- the Senate and House or the legislative statements as to what they intended by this closely related and directly essential language that it follows that work which is just as vitally and directly and closely related to production of goods for commerce as where the lock in dams and -- and the lock in dam and the lock in canal and the plans and specifications in the Vollmer and Lublin cases that there's no more reason for more restrictive they are -- more restrictive interpretation of the production coverage as amended in 1949. 
    Now, the -- prior to 1949 as the Eighth Circuit pointed out, it was settled that the production coverage was much more flexible and broader than the in commerce coverage. 
    So that the position of respondent and of the court below is that by the 1949 amendment, Congress reversed the situation that production coverage now is not even coextensive with the in commerce coverage that it's narrower and more rigid. 
    In addition to the general statements in both House and Senate reports stating that they did not intend to have such a drastic change in their scope of production -- production coverage, the specific cases were mentioned -- were listed in both reports more in the Senate than in the House state -- stating what they specifically did not intend to change as to the scope of production coverage. 
    And significantly, most significantly among those cases were the public utility cases producing and supplying electricity, gas, fuel, water, specifically mentioning water among those, the manufacturing of tools and dies and machinery to be used by other producers of goods and production of other goods for commerce and custodial and maintenance service furnished by an independent firm that might be serving customers generally. 
    In fact all of these -- these -- in these three areas which both House and Senate reports endorsed and stated specifically would remain within the coverage of the Act, our typical examples of -- of facilities serving a general miscellany of customers but also well-known to be vitally essential -- vitally and substantially essential to the production of any goods for commerce. 
    Ignoring all of these specific examples approved by both Houses, respondent relies primarily if not entirely on a few examples in the House Report which the House said it understood that the language would exclude from the coverage in two cases that respondents rely on, particularly the Super-A Fertilizer case and which was a decision of the First Circuit. 
    I might point out that except for the window washing case, neither House nor Senate report disapproved any decision of this Court. 
    They specifically approved the test of Kirschbaum. 
    They said they intended -- both Houses said they intended to adopt the immediate -- close and immediate trial test of Kirschbaum. 
    And -- that only -- not the Senate but the House said that it objected to holding at an industrial window washing company was within the coverage of the Act. 
    Now, the -- in strictest logic some of the things the -- the House said would be excluded by the language if you apply it in constrict logic, it might be hard to reconcile those cases with the cases they explicitly said they intended to remain within the coverage of the Act. 
    But the -- certainly, that is no grounds for overwriting the joint intent as to the types of cases, both Houses intended to retain under the Act. 
    And there certainly no reason for extending those cases, beyond what even the House suggested, they should go in order to narrow the coverage of the Act. 
    Moreover, the cases are distinguishable. 
    The Super-A Fertilizer case was the production of fertilizer used by farmers to produce sugarcane -- to fertilize the soil for production of sugarcane. 
    And it's hard to reconcile that with a specific approval of the Reynolds water case which the Senate report specifically said they intended to endorse and would continue within the coverage. 
    But apparently, the -- they could be reconciled and are distinguishable on the basis that fertilizer, although useful in the production of goods is not thought to be as vitally essential as water and fuel and electricity and gas and heat and tools and dies and machinery. 
    The other case on which respondent relies and which is cited in the House Report is the Schroeder case, the production -- the quarrying of rock for the construction of a dike which was to protect an oil field from being flooded by a government project. 
    The respondent emphasizes that case because he says it's like this one because it's a construction of a dam. 
    But the -- the purposes are obviously quite different. 
    But apart from that, it's significant that the House Report just says they disapproved of holding the quarry employees. 
    The employees quarrying the rock and significantly, did not say that they disapproved of covering the employees engaged in the actual construction of the dike. 
    And of course, we are concerned here with the employees engaged in the actual construction of this dam and reservoir. 
    The window washing case in the same way -- in fact all of these -- all of these supplies and materials, the fertilizer and the rock and window washing could be said to be services or supplies which are not vitally essential to the productive process whereas plainly water, live electricity, gas and -- and coal and fuel and tools and dies and machinery is absolutely vital and essential to the production to -- of any goods for interstate commerce. 
    We want to spend a few minutes on the injunction point and then reserve --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1204.235" stopTime="1214.298">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Could I ask you one question? 
    What do you conceive to be the strongest case in your favor that's been decided by this Court?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="1214.298" stopTime="1715.064">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    I conceive our strongest argument to be that the utility cases that Congress expressly approved cases like the Florida Power and Light, the -- also the McCrady case which was a new -- construction of new plants for an existing steel company and some of these were new plants and was related to that particular company. 
    I think the utility cases, the maintenance and repair cases and the custodial cases and the West Kentucky-Florida Power and Light, the coal company, gas case and electric cases and the Reynolds Water and Farmers Reservoir cases which were approved by Congress. 
    Now, those were cases where the water was being furnished to exclusively, almost exclusively for farmers. 
    But our point is that obviously that was not the -- a determinative factor with Congress in approving these cases because the general utilities do not furnish exclusively or even primarily to industries. 
    In this case, it's submitted that some 40% to 50% of this water supply, of the existing water supply was devoted to industrial uses. 
    And that practically, all the industrial users in Corpus Christi produced goods for interstate commerce. 
    And it's been settled and generally and consistently held and, as I say, the legislative history of that 1949 amendment approved it obviously that it's the substantial and regular need and use of the facility for interstate commerce and not that it must be primarily or solely devoted to that use that invokes the coverage of the Act. 
    So that I say that all these utility cases and the repair and maintenance holding, that the repair and maintenance and protection of utilities, facilities that unless you adopt a new construction give the broad interpretation to the new construction doctrine and apply it technically, you cannot distinguish this between the repair, maintenance and protection of the existing facility which has been consistently held covered. 
    That the fact that it's a large and a big -- a big plant and a large construction project does not make it any less closely related or directly essential to supplying that absolutely essential and directly necessary facility for the production of goods for commerce. 
    And that the same principles of the -- we -- we rely on the principles of the of Vollmer and Lublin case and with respect to the practical considerations which show that this is vital and essential. 
    And that what is vital and essential to the functioning of interstate instrumentalities under those decisions is equally closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for commerce under the production coverages. 
    And that or neither the court below nor respondent has taken issue with -- with the fact that -- that this water supply is just as closely related and directly essential and vital to the producers of goods for commerce and interstate instrumentalities as was the construction of the lock and canal in -- in Vollmer to the interstate traffic on that water-way or the plans and specifications in Lublin were to the interstate uses of the instrumentalities there being improved. 
    No issue has been taken with the -- with practical fact that the relationship and the -- and the vital essentiality of this water supply is equally close and direct as -- as the facilities in those cases. 
    Coming then to the injunction point, we recognize, of course, that the issuance of injunctive relief is largely discretionary with the trial court. 
    But we believe this case illustrates that what is becoming or something of a problem in the lower courts particularly in this region where most the violations of -- large proportion have been appear that they're taking a mistaken view of the purpose and nature of the injunction and thus really obstructing enforcement and compliance rather than encouraging it or helping to deter violation. 
    The attitude has been that the employer should be absolutely unfettered in -- in contesting doubtful coverage questions, questions which he in good faith thinks may be doubtful or if he relies in good faith on advice of -- of counsel. 
    And that this is sufficient reason not to give any relief and in effect relief was denied here because that one project was virtually completed. 
    This attitude, we think, just encourages employers to contest and litigate or take or decide not to comply until they have an opportunity to litigate because they have absolutely nothing to lose not even the -- they can be even pretty sure they're not going to be enjoined for the future. 
    And meanwhile, they're underpaying their employees if it's later determined that they held covered -- covered. 
    And they stand to retain in -- permanently, again they acquired during -- during this period if they're litigating. 
    Well, it is true that the Congress in Section 17 when it denied the courts the power to grant restitution for past violations apparently, intended to give the employer at least one bite of the -- the apple free if he wants to contest coverage, then they would leave it just to the employee remedy. 
    But in enacting that provision, Congress made it clear that it was not saying that in a contempt action, the Court couldn't compel compliance by ordering past payment of wages. 
    But the only way that the Court can really compel that type of compliance is if it first issues an injunction. 
    Now, the courts have also said something about employ -- employers should not be required to act if they're peril to -- in the future. 
    And this is what they conceive the injunction is doing apparently. 
    Well, all of the -- I think they overlook the peculiar nature of the injunction under this Act which is not like and extraordinary equity injunction. 
    It requires nothing except that they comply with what the Act -- the duties the Act imposes on them in any event. 
    And they're not subject to any peril of criminal contempt if they in good faith believe they are not covered -- it -- because criminal contempt has to be a willful violation. 
    And they have every opportunity to present to the Court after an injunction has been issued any doubtful coverage questions.

    No, I'm not suggesting it's -- what I'm suggesting is that the courts -- the trial courts should give more consideration to public interest and the burdens and that when cause has been shown for the -- for the issuance of an injunction, where there has been a prior record of considerable investigations and finding of violations there were a total of eight investigations here within -- this is our second law suit with this company. 
    And this case illustrates, I think, what -- of what can happen by -- to these narrow injunctions. 
    We had a case in New Mexico against the same company. 
    They were building runways at the Holloman Airfield in New Mexico. 
    And we got an injunction in that case. 
    They were litigating on what we thought was a rather frivolous grounds but it was -- that it was an instrumentality of war and not of commerce and they distinguished this Court's decision in Powell where -- where the Court held that the fact that production of ammunitions was for war, it mean it couldn't be for commerce. 
    They distinguished that case on the same grounds they're urging here. 
    That in commerce coverage is quite different from production and therefore Powell didn't apply to.

    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Because this injunction does not compel them to do anything, it doesn't compel them to restore any past benefits they have. 
    They just go to any advantages they may have acquired at the expense of competitors to -- to make restitution to employees. 
    It doesn't require anything except that in the future, they -- they assume the risk of doubt as to coverage. 
    And all that risk is -- all that risk is, is that they paid the employees in accordance with the Act. 
    They can -- the Court is then in the position to order them to comply really. 
    It's the first time the Court gets in the position to order them to comply is after it issues an injunction. 
    And what we say is when there have been a past record of violations, where we'd have to inspect several times that the burden and expense to the Government is a consideration which the trial court has said it wasn't impressed with the fact that we'd already made eight investigations and had two lawsuits and that the employer had been found to have owed some $4000 and the other lawsuit which there was never any indication he ever paid off. 
    And admittedly here, if this coverage here, it's admitted that there's been some $50,000 underpayments in overtime.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I can put in a single word. 
    What I want to know is whether the Government is arguing that when it comes to relief by way of injunction, in these fair labor standards case, you would deny, you would say, “No, it isn't -- it is no -- it does not permit to have a case, that an injunction after all is an extraordinary remedy.”

    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Well, I don't think that under this Act, it is a very extraordinary remedy because all it requires is not like the antitrust acts, where you may have -- you may enjoin legal and illegal acts because of their context.

    He'd always shown cooperation in the past, and we had not had any expense and -- and litigation wherein many have passed.

    There are so many coverage and exemption questions that I think that these cases get quite confused when they go to the jury. 
    This is one of the difficulties they find in two in the 16 (c) remedy where the administrators requested to sue on behalf of the employee. 
    They have to be -- they tried before a jury too. 
    And it's extremely difficult even though there suppose to be no unsettled question of law in those cases, and I supposed to bring them unless no unsettled question of law. 
    Just talking to -- just having the Court charged the jury and having the employers counsel talk to the jury about the coverage and exemption questions here involved confuses them. 
    And it's -- it's also very long drawn out in expensive process. 
    In fact, one of the judges had just told us in Alabama that these cases involved so little money and this is so burdensome to try.

    And with -- even with that, although respondent said that it was relying on advice of counsel that it wasn't covered, but the judge told him at that time, “I think you've covered. 
    I'm convinced I don't see what other evidence you could bring in that would change my mind.” 
    But respondent still went on -- went on with his noncompliance. 
    He wasn't willing to accept the judge's tentative view. 
    He preferred to accept his own doubts or his counsel's advice, and he went on and didn't went on with his noncompliance in those circumstances.

   Argument of R. Dean Moorhead
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3711.877" stopTime="3719.659">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you, Ms. Margolin. 
    Mr. Moorhead.
speaker="r_dean_moorhead" startTime="3719.659" stopTime="4099.314">
    Mr. R. Dean Moorhead 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In view of the colloquy which has just ensued the temptation is strong to again discussing immediately the question of the scope of the injunction in this case. 
    However, Mr. Johnson and I have reached a draft apportionment whereby subject to questions of the Court. 
    I was to discuss primarily the question of coverage which, of course, is the fair amount question as far as we're concerned. 
    And again, subject to the questions of the Court, he proposes to deal with the injunctive feature. 
    So I will mention at the beginning, the question of coverage in this case which we feel is a most serious one and certainly is, by no means, as clear as counsel for the Government has indicated that she believes it is. 
    Now, we start and we've tried to start throughout this litigation with the proposition as this Court has several times stated that in a coverage case of this kind, the problem that faces all of us, that faces the Court in rendering its decisions, that faces those of us in private practice in advising our clients, our -- our joint problem, our mutual problem is to try to decide where to draw the line in these coverage cases. 
    And this Court, of course, has observed in the past that looking for a dependable touchstone as a guide in attempting to draw that line is, as I think the Court put it, about as rewarding as attempting to square the circle. 
    We have no quick answer. 
    We have no easy answer to urge upon the Court as far as coverage is concerned under the facts of this particular case. 
    All that we think we can do is to marshal to the Court, as we've tried to do in our briefs and as I shall try to do in argument, the factors which we think will assist us and assist the Court in drawing the line of coverage in this case. 
    And we began, of course, in setting both -- for those factors with the actual facts in the case. 
    We have a dam here built on a non-navigable river located solely within the boundaries of the State of Texas. 
    The dam was not constructed for flood control purposes unlike other dams that have been before this Court in other context. 
    It was not constructed to aid navigation. 
    No federal funds were used in the construction of the dam. 
    The dam produces no hydroelectric energy. 
    It's merely a dam on the Nueces River approximately 42 miles above the City of Corpus Christi which was built by the respondent here in the H. B. Zachry Company pursuant to contract between it and the Lower Nueces River Water Supply District. 
    And the actual outline contractually speaking and also physically speaking of the facts in the case are these. 
    Zachry, the respondent contracted with the District for the construction of the dam and built the dam. 
    And of course the activities of his employees in constructing the dam are what are before this Court for review. 
    The District in turn and the District is no coextensive with the City of Corpus Christi and under the laws of the State of Texas, the District is an entirely different animal than a municipality such as the City of Corpus Christi. 
    The District entered into a contract whereby it agreed to sell to the city the water impounded by the dam. 
    And as far as the flow of the water is concerned, once my client, the respondent built the dam, once his employees left the scene, water began to be impounded and is still being impounded behind the dam. 
    When that water is impounded, it's the property of the District. 
    But the District has, by contract, sold it to the City of Corpus Christi. 
    And as water is released through this dam, it's metered, the City takes title there, that water is discharged into the bed of the Nueces River where it flows down the old riverbed 26 miles downstream to a little town called Calallen. 
    And the City of Corpus Christi has constructed a treatment plant, a purification plant at Calallen. 
    The water goes through the treatment plant. 
    It then goes downstream another 16 miles for a total of 42 miles where it enters in to the old distribution system, water distribution system of the City of Corpus Christi. 
    And once it enters that distribution system and is sold and distributed by the -- the City, it sold, of course, to the usual miscellany of customers that any sizeable city sells water to. 
    And among those customers are numerous industries in the City of Corpus Christi which use water in connection with the production of goods which they manufacture for commerce. 
    So, we have a question here whether a basic question, the -- the Government has -- has interjected a few tangential factors but basically, this lawsuit begin with this question, and I think it's the principle question now before the Court. 
    The question is simply this. 
    When respondent's employees built the dam up the Nueces River, were they, in some way, performing some kind of activity which was tied so closely to the production of goods for commerce by the manufacturing plants in Corpus Christi as to make it possible for the courts to say that the workers upon that dam were, in fact, connected with the production of goods for commerce and that therefore, coverage should obtain under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

    I -- I have doubts to this extent, Your Honor, if it be true as counsel for the Government argues that the Eighth Circuit in its Chambers case decision, there are two Chambers cases as the Court may know and we -- we will be talking about both of them. 
    The one by the Eighth Circuit is the one which is the strongest or the stronger of the two against us, if it be true that what the Court for the Eighth Circuit held in the Chambers case is that an employee who works on the actual distribution system who's part and parcel of parcelling out the water is covered by the Act, then your driver in your case would -- would be -- would be covered and have conceded.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4217.767" stopTime="4252.677">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I want to say that I'm -- I'm most sympathetic to anybody who finds it difficult to draw a line. 
    I don't think you can jump from one thing to another, nice distinctions have to be made, and Congress vested the trust of making those distinctions in courts instead of an administrative agency. 
    But I want to be -- to care to differentiate the relation, the word “nexus”, I think has been used in this case, of the relation, the tie-in between my -- tank trucks or truck drivers and the window washer and -- and the Kirschbaum case.
speaker="r_dean_moorhead" startTime="4252.677" stopTime="4284.834">
    Mr. R. Dean Moorhead 
    In the Kirschbaum case, of course, Your Honor, was dealing with maintenance workers including window washers, as I recall, who worked on buildings which released to persons engaged in the actual production of commerce. 
    Probably, I would say that as a matter of physical causation tie in between what a man's doing and the furnished goods that your man driving the tank truck is closer than the man. 
    He is certainly more directly essential --

    Suppose, in the -- all this had been done by the City itself, it had built the dam, it had conducted the canal and sold the water, would that change the situation, or does your different relationship because you are not the ultimate seller though it would make a great distinction in your mind?

    I think we would be on very thin ice if we have to appear before the -- this Court saying that that fact that we are one contract farther back is the dividing line between coverage and -- and a lack of average.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I suppose on the fact that this dam is some miles away from the -- from a situs of these industries would make no difference, would it?
speaker="r_dean_moorhead" startTime="4364.584" stopTime="4547.360">
    Mr. R. Dean Moorhead 
    That, my answer, Mr. Chief Justice, would be almost exactly the answer that I gave to Mr. Justice Black. 
    We don't think geography is the solution to the matter in the –- the Borden Company versus Borella which this Court decided after the Kirschbaum case. 
    There was quite a distance there between the building involved and the physical manufacture. 
    There again, if -- if we had to rely upon that 42 miles, we -- we would have a slender reed. 
    But we do say that the Court cannot ignore or should certainly, can it -- it perhaps should not ignore the factors of distance and contractual connection in considering the whole of the picture and deciding where to draw the line. 
    And I was going to elude and I might just make brief reference to it now to the fact that in trying to find touchstones, in trying to decide where to draw this line, the Labor Department itself has named a series of factors which we have set forth at two places in our brief and they're also contained in the regulations which are copied verbatim in the appendix. 
    They have set -- set forth at least six factors. 
    We list them seriatim on page 58 of our brief. 
    And the very first of those factors that the Labor Department itself lists is where -- where, when and how the activity in question is performed in relation to the production to which it relates. 
    We think the 42 miles is at least pertinent to the where, the when enters into in the sense certainly that our employees perform their activities months ago from the standpoint of time. 
    Their -- their labors have in effect upon the production of goods for commerce today only and whenever a man in one of these factories who was over to take a drink of water or put water in a boiler or a cooling tower. 
    How the activity is performed? 
    Well, of course, we have a totally different activity performed here, the building of the dam being utterly dissimilar to the manufacturing of selling these or the other products that are manufactured in the City of Corpus Christi. 
    They go on down the line. 
    The Labor Department doesn't say and we don't say that the answers to when, where and how determine this, but -- but they have to be considered. 
    The Labor Department then says another factor to consider is whether the activity is performed within or without the productive enterprise. 
    Well, certainly, the answer to that consideration is in our favor because here, the building of the dam was utterly outside the various productive enterprises that you find in the City of Corpus Christi.

    Mr. R. Dean Moorhead 
    And I think the answer to the next factor here, the third factor where the Labor Department says consideration should be held of whether its performance is with the primary view of aiding production or is for some other purpose. 
    We say there that we were interested as the trial court recognized not in aiding this handful of industries down on the waterfront. 
    We were interested rather in aiding the whole of the Corpus Christi area, the residential consumers, the schools, the other customers as well as the industrial ones.

    Mr. R. Dean Moorhead 
    Now, I -- I'm glad, Your Honor, that you mentioned that because that -- and I mean no criticism, I'm trying to be factual when I say this, that is an 11th hour argument.It is one that we did not hear in the District Court. 
    The only support the Government confined for that argument that that our workers were really producing water and that the water itself was the good lies in the fact that in a bunch of string citations which it gave on -- on an elementary proposition, the trial court cited this Court's decision in the Alstate case. 
    If it be true that our people in building the dam were producing water, and I might add that that kind that the Government has said at great length in its both brief that this case should, pursuant to the admonition of this Court in Vollmer, be decided upon practical considerations rather than technical conceptions. 
    If we use those tests and if we assume that it is practical to say that in building a dam, we are producing water. 
    I don't see where -- where that argument avails the Government in this case. 
    They, themselves, admit that they made no attempt to develop any theory that the water so produced if such it is becomes an ingredient in -- in any good that is produced for commerce. 
    And if the Court will look at the only portion of the record on that point which is set forth verbatim in our brief in a footnote on page 44, the only evidence on the point was that nobody knew of any case where water becomes an ingredient in any product. 
    And as a matter of fact, the -- the counsel for the Government, they even interjected a helpful quip there to the effect that he didn't know of any at least in the case of petroleum products. 
    I don't see where -- where the -- the theory that by building the dam, we produce water and that the water is the particular goods in this case can't avail the Government at all. 
    And certainly, the case has been tried and argued and the brief below almost 99% and 4400% upon the theory that the goods involved are not the dam, of course, because the dam can't be a good, but rather are the products of the industrial plants in the Corpus Christi area, and the question has been, what's your relationship between the route picker out here who's working on the dam and selling this becomes out of -- for a factory of Corpus Christi.

    Could I ask you a question? 
    Do you see in this case a -- do you -- or do you see this case as involving a difference between you and the Government on general principles of law as distinguished on the application of existing principles to a particular state of facts?
speaker="r_dean_moorhead" startTime="4845.143" stopTime="5086.984">
    Mr. R. Dean Moorhead 
    No, sir. 
    I -- I think that the only new law that might be involved in this case in any sensitive word would be that the case, I believe, affords this Court its first square opportunity to write upon the possible effect and we think very significant effect of the 1949 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act which changed at least in wording and we think insignificant tenure, the tests to be used in -- in drawing the line. 
    And I -- I was about to -- to come to that because I think it is highly important because it is practically the only new law within this case. 
    Now, a question was asked counsel for the Government as to what case she relied upon strongest in support of her position on coverage. 
    And I believe she gave the -- the Court a large number of samples to choose from. 
    I have no hesitancy in saying that as far as logic and rationale are concerned, we rely strongest upon the decision of this Court in the Callus case which was another one of the building cases following upon the hills of -- of Kirschbaum and Borella. 
    And we think the -- the Callus case ties directly in to what was accomplished by the 1949 amendments. 
    And since I haven't mentioned those amendments yet, I'd like to get to them now. 
    As the Court notes, prior to 1949, in the case involving goods -- production of goods for commerce where the activity in question was, as we think is true in this case, not an activity involving actual production but rather if it was anything at all was an activity in a closely -- in a related process or occupation. 
    Where that type of situation was before the courts prior to 1949, the portion of the Act which governed that situation said that the activity was covered if it was in a related process or occupation necessary to the production of goods for commerce. 
    And of course, under the necessary test, although this Court said that not everything that was indispensable was necessary, certainly, under the necessary language, there were reasons for extending the bounds of coverage quite broadly. 
    I believe one of the judges some years ago complained saying that the extensions were getting to the point where under the necessary tests, it was like tossing a pebble into a pond, and then because of the infinite ripples that went out saying that -- that everything that occurred beyond the point of impact was in -- in some way caused by the pebble. 
    It's certainly under the necessary language, there was a basis for this Court and the lower courts saying that coverage was quite broad in these related occupation or process cases. 
    However, in 1949, Congress by deliberate act inserted the word "closely" before the words "related process or occupation" and deleted the word “necessary” and substituted therefore the words “directly essential”. 
    With the result since 1949, that portion of the statute has provided that coverage obtains only where the activity in question is in a closely related process or occupation directly essential to the physical production of goods for commerce.

    The Callus case was decided under the old necessary case.
speaker="r_dean_moorhead" startTime="5089.282" stopTime="5219.555">
    Mr. R. Dean Moorhead 
    The Callus case was decided under the old necessary case. 
    And yet, we think we've learned much from the language of the Callus case even -- even under the old test. 
    And certainly, the -- the logic there employed we think becomes even more pertinent under the 1949 amendments. 
    In the Callus case, for example, this Court said that remoteness of a particular activity from the physical process of manufacturing while not decisive of the question is certainly a relevant factor to aid in drawing the line. 
    And if remoteness was a relevant factor even under the necessary test, we think it's even more a -- a relevant factor under the closely related and directly essential test. 
    Now, the Government has argued both in brief and here today that actually, the 1949 amendments with this change in language were of but little effect. 
    The Department of Labor has not said so in its own regulations on the contrary. 
    In the regulation which we've quoted at the bottom of page 79 of our brief and at the top of page 80, the Labor Department itself has said that the legislative history shows that the new language, and I'm quoting here, “In the final clause of Section 3 (j) of the Act is intended to narrow and to provide a more precise guide to the scope of its coverage in exactly the type of case that we have here at the bar." 
    The Fifth Circuit, I mean the Fifth Circuit of course in our case has so construed the -- the 1949 amendments, but in addition to the fact that the Fifth Circuit has construed these amendments as having a limited effect, the Sixth Circuit has so construed them in Mitchell versus Moore, which we have cited and -- and discussed in our brief, and the 1949 amendments have been given such a construction also by the Seventh and the Tenth Circuits in two additional cases which we referred to as the hospital cases in their briefs.

    Mr. R. Dean Moorhead 
    As I read, Your Honor, the Secretary's own construction and his own regulation at the bottom of page 79 and at the top of page 80 in -- in our appendix, he says precisely what the courts have held in -- in those cases to wit that it is intended to narrow the scope of its coverage in this type of case. 
    And I might add, he goes further than that. 
    He says some employees whose work might meet the necessary test are now outside the coverage of the Act because their work is not closely related and directly essential to such production. 
    We are willing to meet him in his own arena. 
    On that point, we think that the 1949 amendments were written into the Act purposefully that they should be given effect and that their effect, as applied to this case, is simply that when our employees were out on the dam building that dam, they were too remote to be considered as being in an occupation or process closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for commerce.

    Mr. R. Dean Moorhead 
    There is a serious question about that which we -- we did not attempt to bring that when this case came here on certiorari. 
    The record shows that the respondent had over 300 employees working in and about this dam. 
    This Court has said all the way from Kirschbaum down to Lublin that the test is not the business of the employer it's the activity of the particular employee. 
    The Government made not a single attempt to set forth in the record what a single want of these 300 people was doing on the dam. 
    Now, we -- we can take it for granted, I assume, that dams don't build themselves. 
    And so in someway, somehow, it was before building the dam. 
    But there has been, and we complained, we raised this in the Court of Appeals but because of its disposition in the case, it did not come to it, there is not an iota of evidence in this record showing what any single, what activity, any single employee or respondent performed on this dam. 
    We have gone into greater detail in our brief on other factors the details that the legislative history where Congress itself at least the house managers stated. 
    Now, they were trying to -- to limit the scope of the Act and how they in effect were repudiating some of the decisions in the lower courts. 
    We have gone into detail in discussing the six criteria in the Labor Department's own regulation. 
    And we're prepared to meet them with the test of those six criteria in determining whether remoteness is or is not --

    Mr. R. Dean Moorhead 
    I -- I was coming to -- to that -- that point. 
    After writing that first opinion, we -- there had been no -- no actual brief submitted to the trial judge. 
    So, by the end of the second hearing, the question had been briefed substantially as -- as it now appears. 
    And the trial judge in his second opinion in the case, the opinion which terminates at least on page -- which begins on page 71 of the record. 
    When faced with the distinction which was argued, and you'll find this on page 72 of the record, faced with the distinction which we urged between the in commerce cases and production of goods for commerce cases and also with the terms of the 1949 amendment, which, I say, the Court itself italicized here, did give consideration to them stating on the top of page 73 that he too believe that they undertook to narrow the scope of the coverage, but then he, in effect said he didn't think that they narrowed it this far. 
    Now, we -- we do to Your Honors and less I trespass on all of my -- my colleague's time. 
    I merely say that even under the old necessary test in the Callus case, this Court concluded with the holding that the activity there involved was in the -- the Court's words too many steps removed from the actual physical process of the production of goods.

    If the Court decides against to some question of courage, certainly, I do not think the Court should disturb or broaden the injunction granted by the trial court. 
    The trial court had a variety of factors before including the past record of this employer the magnitude of the work that it does both in terms of jobs and dollars, the very few instances where even the Government has even contended that we have stepped over the line. 
    The only other case that we've ever been in on the coverage was a complicated case, which Your Honor cited in your decision in the Lublin case, a -- a war, a -- an army type of -- of construction job. 
    And in deciding that case against us, the district judge in Albuquerque said that in his opinion, the question was extremely close but he was deciding against us.

    Mr. Chester H. Johnson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I had prepared to make a few remarks in connection with the injunction feature but in the light of the questions that were propounded from the bench, I'm going to make them very brief. 
    Now, I do hope to say this at the outset that my -- my colleague here we subscribe to the statement contained in the -- the Kirschbaum case that, and I'm footnoting Mr. Moorhead's statement with the permission of the Court that we do subscribe to the statement in Kirschbaum versus Walling that to search for this dependable touchstone is by which to determine coverages as we -- rewarding as the attempt to square the circuit. 
    Now, we, therefore, recognize the problem -- the test that is before the Court. 
    And -- but however, we feel and sincerely feel that the problem here presented in this case, in the case at bar, is a little further removed from any other case that has thus far been presented to the Court. 
    And we start, of course, with the building of a dam of a local stream in the State of Texas which when completed will impound water which will in turn to be sold to a municipal corporation which will in turn sell and distribute that water to a miscellany of some 200,000 people among whom are some little and thus some large industrial consumers who, in turn, produce goods for commerce. 
    Now, there is a considerable distance between the building of the dam and the actual production of goods for commerce, and I think Mr. Moorhead has covered that very nicely. 
    Now, the collateral question comes up at -- in the event this Court determines coverage. 
    And that is that the trial court has abused his discretion in limiting or attenuating the effect of the injunction so granted. 
    Now, to -- I -- I believe I should address myself to the -- the cases cited by petitioner rather than to talk about the cases --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5922.383" stopTime="5922.458">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Right.
speaker="chester_h_johnson" startTime="5922.458" stopTime="6284.662">
    Mr. Chester H. Johnson 
    -- that we have cited. 
    And I want to direct the Court's attention to page 72 of petitioner's brief wherein the McComb versus Jacksonville Paper Company case is cited for the proposition -- I believe it is cited from the proposition that a mere violation of the Act of the -- of the Fair Labor Standards Act entitles the -- the petitioner to an injunction without further redo. 
    The point I want to make here is that the -- the Jacksonville Paper Company case was strictly -- it wasn't a contempt case. 
    And there is simply -- there is simply a great distinction between a hearing on a contempt order than a hearing or an application for an injunction. 
    Now, further pursuing the point, petitioner cites this Court to the Union Tool Company and the Overnight Motor Company case at pages, I believe, at 67 or 68 of the brief. 
    Likewise, the Union Tool Company case was -- it was a contempt case. 
    Now, it issued out of a patent infringement. 
    And the -- the Overnight Motor Company case was a liquidated damage case. 
    The employee, the facts being clear, the employee was entitled to recover the liquidated damages as a matter of law. 
    There -- there was nothing left in either of those cases for the Court's discretion to be applied to the facts were clear so that it was more or less mandatory that remedial relief follow. 
    It only had to do was to draw the order. 
    Further pursuing the point, petitioner would cite the Court, and I'm trying to group these cases rather than to take them -- as I've cited them on numerous cases. 
    So I'm just going to talk about two cases, I believe, that -- that were injunction cases. 
    The -- for instance, we cite the (Inaudible) case out of the Fifth Circuit, the Circuit which is so condemned. 
    And that was a -- a child labor violation case, a very flagrant case. 
    The only reason the -- the trial court did not wrap the injunction was that he believe the defendant to be a law-abiding citizen. 
    And he didn't believe that he would violate the law anymore. 
    The Fifth Circuit said, “That's not sufficient to withhold the grace of the Court.” 
    That injunction should issue -- had so many further excuses. 
    In that connection, the petitioner cites another injunction case called the -- the Walling versus Youngerman-Reynolds Hardwood Company case. 
    And -- and another with like case was Southwest Engineers case which is a very recent one. 
    And they hold to -- as about the same effect. 
    Now, further pursuing the point in there's -- for you to overcome the decision of the Fifth Circuit. 
    They condemned the Hodges case and they condemned the -- the Bland case. 
    Now, the Hodges case reminds me very much of -- of the situation that we are confronted with. 
    There, Hodges was a contractor. 
    He had 11 -- he performed 1100 contracts. 
    The administrator selected five of those contracts to test. 
    The trial court found that -- that three of those cases, there was no coverage. 
    That -- I believe that three, that there was no coverage and two that they were -- that there was coverage or may -- might have been vice versa, but an appeal was taken. 
    The court though withheld the injunction, did not grant it. 
    In that connection, the -- the defendant had a labor counselor who it had hired from -- that used to work for the -- for the Labor Department or the Wage and Hour Department to counsel with it to help it to -- along its way to keep to -- keep down the infractions of the labor laws. 
    So that case -- those cases, in other words, the -- the -- are in keeping with the general trend or the general line of decisions of all the courts that say that -- that if the facts are clear and if the cause has been shown, he maybe entitled to his injunction absent any mitigating factors, but it's usually always within the discretion of the Court. 
    Now, I want to point to page 73 of petitioner's brief, and I'm going to conclude. 
    They complained that bitterly of the prohibitive cost of carrying on the program and maintaining a constant vigilance over these employers. 
    I especially point to that in the light of the record and the record here shows that -- that respondent had a legal department and it also has, in its employer, pages 64 and 65 of the record, a man whose job it is to police all jobs in an effort to keep the -- the workers on the payroll in a proper classification even under Davis-Bacon and Walsh-Healey as well as the Fair Labor Standards Act, and to minimize any infractions. 
    Now, in spite -- in spite of all these efforts, they say that they need a broad blanket injunction. 
    I'm going to agree with them that it is costly program. 
    I'm further saying that -- that we're doing our part to minimize that cost and we're doing the best we can. 
    Thank you.
