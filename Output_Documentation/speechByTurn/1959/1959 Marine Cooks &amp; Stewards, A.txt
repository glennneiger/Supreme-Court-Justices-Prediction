    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- Marine Cooks &amp; Stewards, AFL, et al., Petitioner, versus Panama Steamship Company, Ltd., et al. 
    Mr. Mosser, you may proceed with the argument.
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="13.608" stopTime="185.975">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    May it please the Court. 
    The position of the respondents here is that there is no labor dispute within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act so as to deprive the District Court of jurisdiction to issue the interlocutory injunction which it did issue. 
    I would like to make clear at the outset that the basis upon which we make that contention is that the dispute was over terms and conditions of employment, a board of foreign flag vessel, only transiently in a United States court. 
    It is not a claim of special position for a foreign shipowner and some of the colloquy particularly between counsel and Mr. Justice Brennan yesterday, seemed to me to be turning on the question of a foreign shipowner in an American court. 
    I'd like to point out the difference between the owner of a foreign ship and a foreign shipowner. 
    One looks to the corporate owner, the other looks to the ship. 
    It might well be that you would have an American owner of a foreign flag vessel and we believe that such an American owner in court would be entitled to the same relief here as these respondents are. 
    It is not the position as a foreign shipowner, but as the owner of a foreign ship which centers around the question of whether there is a labor dispute because of the terms and conditions of employment aboard that ship. 
    Now, there is some question as -- in my mind as to just what the petitioners are claiming the labor dispute here is. 
    In response to a question for Mr. Justice Whittaker yesterday, counsel stated that there was no dispute with the crew members. 
    In the reply brief at page 5, the statement is made in the first full sentence at the top of the page after the quotation. 
    The petitioners in picketing were not seeking to change wages, hours or working conditions on the S. S. Nikolos. 
    In response to a question from the Chief Justice yesterday, counsel said that it would make no difference so far as the Norris-LaGuardia Act was concerned, if the wages here were not far below the American standar, which their members have aboard competing American flagships. 
    In fact, the position that counsel took yesterday was that they were here seeking to shut this foreign flag vessel out of this trade. 
    Now, as counsel admitted in --

    But if this weren't -- if -- let's forget, for the moment, the foreign relation aspect of the problem, would have -- would picketing by union in order to extend a membership by shutting out -- shutting out in the market on the -- on the Court, let's forget the foreign aspect, ships that carry foreigners and therefore not members of the American union, would that not be a labor dispute?

    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    Well, if they were seeking to enlarge the membership of the union, if they were seeking to become the agent for these people and to have them join the union --

    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    I -- I don't think it would be a labor dispute, Your Honor, anymore than, let me put this example. 
    The railroads have taken a great deal of business away. 
    In fact, the intercoastal American trade has practically dried up. 
    Now, suppose this union were to go out and picket the railroad with the intent of stopping the railroad from loading all intercoastal -- all transcontinental cargo, in order that American ships would have more business so that their members would have more jobs, I don't think that would be a labor dispute.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="332.926" stopTime="340.337">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Why don't you read the specific definition of what labor dispute is in the Norris-LaGuardia Act? 
    That's what the case must turn on
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="340.337" stopTime="382.317">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    I'll be glad to do that. 
    And, I think, Your Honor is correct that it is the statute that we are here construing that the problem is to determine just what that definition is. 
    Now, the term, “labor dispute,” this -- it's found in 29 U.S.C 113 (c) and at page 40 of our brief, we have quoted the definition from the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. 
    The two definitions are identical except for one small word which I will point out in --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="382.317" stopTime="390.447">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm just curious to know why you did that, why you didn't quote from the Norris-LaGuardia Act, pure curiosity -- academic curiosity.
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="390.447" stopTime="410.807">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    I was comparing this case at that point, Your Honor, to the Benz decision of this Court which was rendered three years ago and in which the Court held the Taft-Hartley Act was not enacted with any eye to foreign labor relations or disputes over employment conditions aboard a foreign flag vessel.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="410.807" stopTime="416.964">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I can understand your quoting both. 
    I can't quite understand your partiality to one.
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="416.964" stopTime="471.931">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    Barely to say if -- that the argument I make in my brief, Your Honor, is that the sections are identical except for one word and I quote the different word. 
    The definition in the Norris-LaGuardia Act is, "The term, labor dispute, includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment regardless of whether the dispute stand in approximate relation of employer and employee." 
    Now, the only difference between the two acts is that the Labor Management Relations Act, instead of saying terms or conditions of employment, says terms tenure or conditions of employment. 
    The one word tenure is the difference.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="471.931" stopTime="480.142">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Perhaps the proximate relation clause means that it doesn't have to be a quarrel between a particular employer and his particular employee.
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="480.142" stopTime="620.020">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    That's correct. 
    But I think the definition does point that it must be a dispute over the terms or conditions of employment or over the right to represent persons in seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment. 
    And if as the respondent say in their reply brief, they are concerned and don't want to change wages, hours or working conditions aboard this vessel and don't want to represent this crew, it's hard for me to see where there would be any labor dispute even if this were an American flag vessel. 
    Now, I hasten to -- to point out that I don't think the records supports the interpretation of this dispute which counsel has put on in it the last minute in this reply brief. 
    It's not the position they took anywhere up until that time. 
    The position which they took in their opening brief in this Court is it stated at the top of page 13 of that brief and it states the evidence shows that the controversy between the parties concerns terms and conditions of employment. 
    The fact is that when this vessel arrived in court Mr. Willoughby, the petitioners Seattle agent, went aboard the vessel. 
    And at page 61 of the record, he testified that he told the captain, "Well, I told him by virtue of the policy of my union that I was interested in the wages, hours and conditions existing aboard the ship." 
    At page 29 of the record, in his affidavit, he's outlined his efforts to find somebody with whom he could negotiate and states that affiant has not been able to find or talk with any person or persons in this area or been referred to any person who could be contacted by long distance who would admit to having authority to negotiate and to adjust the difference with affiant's organization. 
    In the Court of Appeals, in both their briefs, they made quite clear that what they wanted to do was change the wages, hours and working conditions aboard the vessel.

speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="622.653" stopTime="647.302">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    Well, then, I think, we come to the real legal question in this case which is whether the term, labor dispute, was intended by Congress to encompass a dispute over terms and conditions of employment aboard a foreign flag vessel. 
    And I think I would like to go into that question now.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="647.302" stopTime="669.468">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well then, do you -- see if I understand, do you now say that they did want to change that they did bring themselves within the terms of he law -- the labor dispute of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, on that page of the problem?

    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    I think that the record should be read on that basis that they were seeking to change wages, hours and working conditions, if -- if not, I don't see how there would be any labor dispute here at all. 
    But I think that the records supports them that far. 
    That they were seeking to change wages, hours and working conditions to bring them up to the American standard so that that competitive difference would be eliminated between the foreign --

speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="786.885" stopTime="915.143">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    I -- I think exactly that that is the problem which has led this Court in the past to say that the delicate international relations and the possibilities of retaliation in these situations, make this a matter for the Executive and the Congress to negotiate and to specifically spell out, if they want our laws to apply to foreign ships. 
    Because if we can insist that a ship and this ship is a tramp vessel, a great claim here that it entered this trade. 
    Well, it had signed articles in Cardiff, Wales two years before. 
    It had been all over the world. 
    It had never been in this trade before . 
    It came in this one time to deliver this cargo. 
    The testimony was that it wasn't coming back to the northwest. 
    It was going to Europe. 
    Now, if a vessel that comes in like that for one call, serves as a focus where we can come aboard and say, "You negotiate for this ship American standards and conditions, then every ship -- that every port that it touches, can be subject to the same renegotiation according to the local laws and customs. 
    And it is that which has led the nations through comity to recognize the law of the flag. 
    Normally in a contract situation, you'll to the place of performance or the place where the contracts executed, but this Court has said that those things for seamen are -- are pretty much where a matter of happenstance. 
    And so the law of the flag governs. 
    The articles are governed by the law of the flag, the relations aboard the ship are governed by the law of the flag and only in rare instances such as where the tranquility of a port is disturbed or where Congress specifically spells out as it has in a few instances, that our laws are to apply. 
    Do American laws apply to a foreign ship within our harbors? Now, the Romero case which is important here on another point to but --

    Before we get to that, I -- I wonder if conceding everything that you say, Mr. Mosser, if -- if this country doesn't have the right to -- to say, well you can't have an injunction in these circumstances. 
    Perhaps you could have damages or something else to compensate you for any loss, it -- it might be occasion, but the policy of our nation is that -- that in this -- in these circumstances, you can't have an injunction anymore than one of our own sentences could get an injunction.
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="956.737" stopTime="974.465">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    I think that the Congress could -- could certainly say that, Your Honor. 
    The question here is whether in passing the Norris-LaGuardia Act and defining labor dispute in it, they intended that to encompass a labor dispute on a foreign flag vessel.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="974.465" stopTime="1047.536">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    Well I -- I understand that. 
    But it seemed to me that in your argument just a moment ago about the foreign vessel, you were taking the position that if -- if we interfered with them here, we would be denying them the comity and the -- and the rights under their -- their treaty that they were entitled to, namely, to -- to protection while they're in our country. 
    Now, it -- it may be that our -- our Congress wants to limit not on their own citizens, but everybody to a particular kind of action. 
    And the only question is whether they have done it here under the -- under the Norris-LaGuardia Act. 
    But as I understood you, a moment ago, in response to Justice Frankfurter, you -- you said that you believe that they -- that they were making a claim in this case, that is the union, which -- which would've prevented the granting of an injunction in the event this was a -- American citizen.
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="1047.536" stopTime="1050.665">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    No, not an American citizen, an American ship.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1050.665" stopTime="1054.878">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    An American ship. 
    Yes. 
    Yes, I'm -- I'm sure that you said that.
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="1054.878" stopTime="1141.378">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    I -- I think that's correct, Your Honor. 
    If this was an American flag vessel, there would be a labor dispute here, leaving aside a question which I don't think we need to go into as to whether they can try to change terms and conditions of employment while articles of shipping are in effect or whether they have to wait until the termination of particular articles. 
    But I think that generally, there is no right question, but what a -- an American union has a right at some point to go into the question of wages, hours and working conditions aboard on American flag vessel. 
    But the question here is whether Congress intended that an American union be free from the prohibition of an injunction in a dispute over terms and conditions of employment aboard a foreign flag vessel. 
    And, I think, it may go farther than mere injunctive relief, because the Court has indicated that the Norris-LaGuardia Act serves as a shield not only against injunctive relief, but to a substantive effect. 
    In the Hutcheson case, they said, there could be no criminal prosecution. 
    And I think that by amendment of the Clayton Act as -- as counsel argues and we could concede, if the Norris-LaGuardia Act applies, then their conduct is probably protected from being a violation of any law of the United States in this situation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1141.378" stopTime="1162.901">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You say -- you referred two or three times, certainly twice, to the fact that whenever Congress wanted to exercise its undoubted power to touch, to deal with a foreign flag vessel, it said so, explicitly, have you collected those -- that legislation?
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="1162.901" stopTime="1198.270">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    That legislation was collected by the courts, Your Honor, in the Benz decision. 
    It's largely a series of enactments relating to the advances of pay to seaman and the right to make a draw by a seaman in an American court. 
    And the Congress has specifically said that a seaman aboard a foreign flag vessel has the right to make a demand for pay in an American court. 
    The whole series of -- of acts and the controversies that grew out of them are outlined in --

    That's the basis of your argument.
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="1503.251" stopTime="1824.441">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    I -- I think so, Your Honor. 
    I don't -- this is a -- this is shipping and it -- its -- its unique in this sense that it's the only case were foreign conditions of employment actually come into the United States territorial waters. 
    But I don't think it's any different than if the United Auto Workers picketed General Motors and said, "We want you to stop paying German wages in your Opel factories in Germany." 
    Or someone picketed General Electric and said, "We don't want you to -- to build anymore parts in Japan for our television sets using Japanese labor." 
    It's a question of whether American labor has the right to picket over the use of foreign labor and -- and to try to change the conditions of labor all over the world. 
    Now, in past cases, the Court has been very clear that when Congress wanted to apply our laws, labor laws, to foreign employment, it required that that be spelled out. 
    There was a case of Foley Bros. versus Filardo, which involved the Eight Hour Act. 
    And there you had an American employer and American employee, working on the United States base in Iran. 
    And the question was whether the Eight Hour Law applied to that employment. 
    And the Court said there was universal language. 
    Every laborer, every employer, it said, this does not apply, because if Congress wants us to apply laws to situations of labor in foreign countries, where everyone knows labor conditions are far different, they must specifically spell it out. 
    In another transportation field, there have been two cases, as to whether the Federal Mediation Board had jurisdiction to determine a bargaining agent or hold a representational election for the right to represent airline dispatchers working in foreign country. 
    And both the Board and the -- the Courts of Appeal, upholding them, have said not. 
    They have said that Congress must be explicit when it wants us to apply American laws to foreign employment situations. 
    Then they closest case we have, of course, is the Benz case, which was a situation virtually identical with his concerning the Labor Management Relations Act. 
    You had there an American union picketing a Liberian vessel in an American port. 
    And the question was whether the Taft-Hartley Act preempted the District of the -- of the -- the jurisdiction of the District Court. 
    Now, that was a jurisdictional question just as this is a jurisdictional question. 
    There, as here, the crew was foreign and had signed articles subject to Liberian law abroad. 
    And there is here, the terms and conditions of employment were far below those in American ships competing. 
    And there as here, the union said that we are trying -- they -- they clearly said there as they don't here, “We want to represent this crew and -- and be its bargaining agent." 
    But they also said, “We're trying to protect our interest in the grain trade between Portland and India." 
    And, I think, that if in that case, the Taft-Hartley Act didn't apply with virtually -- except for that one word tenure the same definition of labor dispute. 
    It is hard to see how the Norris-LaGuardia Act would apply in this situation. 
    Getting outside the labor field, we have the example of Romero and Lauritzen, where this Court has said that the universal -- every seaman of the Jones Act does not necessarily apply to a foreign seaman injured aboard a foreign ship. 
    And in Romero, the Court specifically pointed that it would be -- it's -- it's not within any policy of the United States and would be a terrific burden on commerce if the standard of compensation must change in every port to which the vessel goes. 
    Now there, you were talking about compensation for an injury which may or may not occur. 
    But I think the standard of wages is much more significantly a standard of compensation that can't change in every port to which the vessel goes. 
    If you look at the legislative history of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the Act itself says nothing about applying to foreign shipping or to foreign commerce at all. 
    If you look at the -- its legislative history which we have included a few excerpts that we were able to find that shed any light at all and they aren't talking about this foreign shipping problem, but there is language there, such as the Court relied on in the Benz case that it was enacted to take care of domestic disputes involving American working men, the working men of this country which would indicate that it was not intended to apply in this situation.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1824.441" stopTime="1856.169">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    One of the reasons that I understood from the passage of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was that many people thought that it was doing an injury to courts to issue an injunction to the -- such controversial field. 
    As far as that reason was concerned, if it is about that reason, is to be no difference between foreign ship controversy and the domestic one when you --
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="1856.169" stopTime="1955.419">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    I think that the reason, so far as it applies would be the same, Your Honor. 
    I think, though, that the question here is -- certainly, Congress has since given back to the courts power to issue injunctions in many cases. 
    And I'd like to point out here the -- the problem that arises, if Taft-Hartley doesn't apply, if we aren't going to go aboard these ships and certify collective bargaining agents, then there is no equality if these treaty means equality between of -- the owner of a foreign ship and the owner of an American ship, because without certification, you can never put an end to your labor disputes. 
    Whereas, in -- on the American ship, once you had a bargaining agent, it would be an unfair labor practice and you could get an injunction through the Board, if some other union came along and picketed you. 
    Under the new Act, if somebody wants to represent the seaman aboard a ship, they -- or aboard it -- for any employer, they can picket, but within 30 days, they must apply to become for an -- certification election. 
    Here, they could never apply under the interpretation that's been given to the Taft-Hartley Act. 
    And so, you would have the situation that one union could picket for 30 days then it would to stop, perhaps, if there's any way to get to the Board to stop it. 
    But another union could come along.You just never have an end to the organizational problem which are our laws supplementing Norris-LaGuardia have taken care of for American employers.

    Let me ask you this, Mr. Mosser. 
    I think Mr. Jennings, though may misinterpret him, but I got the impression that he was not show whether relief could be held even by way of injunction in a state court. 
    It all events whether I'm right or not as to what he said. 
    What do you say, could the relief he had? 
    The reason I ask you this, there was real abuses, which led to the enactment of the Norris-LaGuardia Act derived from the abuses of issuing injunctions in the federal courts by a reason of diversity of citizenship. 
    There were hardly -- there were few cases in which the Court had jurisdiction as such in the federal courts, in the Debs case, of course, where they strike an example. 
    But on the whole, in the main overwhelming mischief that was complained of and that was felt in rightly -- as I believe, was that the adversity cases got into the federal court. 
    The jurisdiction and that led to this injunction. 
    And that embroil the federal court in -- in none -- so-called federal litigation in issuing injunction.

    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    -- of the District Court was challenged for the first time in the Court of Appeals. 
    In the District Court, the only argument had been the one we've had here so far as to whether Norris-LaGuardia labor dispute was present. 
    The Court of Appeals found jurisdiction under Section 1331. 
    And as counsel points out, there is a seeming conflict between that decision and the decision of this Court last year in Romero. 
    Now, I think the sounder basis for jurisdiction here is in admiralty, which -- and the question is whether admiralty has the power to issue the equitable relief of an injunction. 
    At the outset, I'll say that there is dictum in decisions of this Court that admiralty does not have equitable remedial powers and does not issue injunctions except in cases of limitation of liability. 
    However, that decision was in the case of Schoenamsgruber versus Hamburg American Line. 
    These cases are discussed at 22 and -- to 24 of our brief. 
    That was a -- a case in which the question was whether a -- a District Court could stay proceedings pending arbitration. 
    And the Court held that it could and in the process of it, noted that a stay of proceedings was not an injunction, but it went on to have this gratuitous language that admiralty doesn't issue injunctions. 
    There are earlier cases. 
    The Eclipse is perhaps the fountain of this doctrine from the Supreme Court. 
    That was a case where the request was that a court of admiralty, reform a contract for the sale of a vessel and enforce some trust provisions. 
    Now, admiralty doesn't deal with sales of vessels to begin with. 
    The sale of a vessel is not a -- a suit over the sale of a vessel isn't the suit in admiralty. 
    So, of course, this claim for equitable relief, in connection with a sale of a vessel, wouldn't be within admiralty. 
    The Court there noted the claims were -- there was nothing maritime about the claims. 
    That was the language of the Court. 
    Yet, it went on to give again this dictum that admiralty -- although it exercises its jurisdiction upon equitable principles, has not the characteristic powers of the court of equity. 
    Now, I think recent decisions of this Court has made clear that the real doctrine is that when admiralty has jurisdiction, when the basic subject matter of the suit is an admiralty claim, admiralty has equitable powers, whenever they're necessary to justice. 
    Romero, itself, said that all claims regardless of the remedy sought involving a maritime cause of action where cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. 
    It said that in giving its reason for lack of jurisdiction under 1331, that the admiralty courts had been completely adequate to the vindication or protection of rights grounded in federal maritime law. 
    Now, if they didn't have equitable powers when they were necessary, they couldn't be completely adequate to the protection of those rights. 
    In Swift &amp; Company versus Compania Colombiana, in 1950, this Court pointed out a lot of this dicta in passed decision and described them as a good deal of loose talk and said that in that case, admiralty could set aside the fraudulent transfer of a vessel. 
    The libel there was in personam with foreign attachment and the attachment was necessary to the jurisdiction of the Court. 
    The basic libel was clearly within admiralty's jurisdiction. 
    And the Court there -- what happened? 
    The respondent in the suit transferred the vessel to somebody else, before it was attached. 
    And unless that fraud -- that transfer which the Court held was fraudulent, could be set aside. 
    The attachment would have to be dissolved and there would be no jurisdiction in the Court.

    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    In -- in the District Court, no question of jurisdiction was raised, Your Honor. 
    The pleading has denominated the complaint, not a libel, so we clearly -- as far as labor was concerned, weren't on the admiralty side. 
    In the Court of Appeals, the situation was this. 
    The arguments were both had before this Court's decision in Romero. 
    There we briefly pointed out to the Court that admiralty was a possible basis of jurisdiction, but our main argument was centered around the -- what was decided in -- in Romero. 
    We were arguing that any case of federal merit -- involving federal maritime law was one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, within the meaning of Section 1333. 
    The Court of Appeals' decision followed the dicta of this Court and said that admiralty cannot issue an injunction, but said this is a clear distinction from the situation in Romero, because Romero had a completely adequate remedy in admiralty. 
    Here, this is a case in equity. 
    It is -- there is no completely adequate remedy in admiralty and therefore, we think that the reasoning of Romero would not apply to this case. 
    And since it is a maritime claim arising under the Constitution of the United States, it is one where federal question jurisdiction exists. 
    There is no implied exception as was found in Romero, because of the -- an adequate alternative remedy.

    Mr. Mosser, why do you say this is involved in the maritime claim?
speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="2733.679" stopTime="2780.812">
    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    Your Honor, the suit here was to stop picketing which was occurring on navigable waters with one ship circling around another. 
    It was to stop the intentional interference with maritime contracts of affreightment and for the discharge of the vessel. 
    The Court found that it was the intention of petitioners, through their picketing and through their circling and through the threats which they made to the consignee of the cargo to prevent this ship from securing a berth and discharging its cargo. 
    Now, those were maritime rights, the right to proceed with the vessel, the right between -- the contract between the vessel and the -- the dock, which were interfered with.

    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    They maybe both Your Honor, but I think they're clearly maritime rights. 
    They may also, as we argue and this is an alternative ground of jurisdiction that these rights arise under the treaty between the Republic of Liberia and the United States
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2811.741" stopTime="2825.429">

    Mr. John D. Mosser

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    An action for an injunction is one in tort?

    They -- the basic cause of action is for a tort.

speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2842.741" stopTime="2853.608">

    Mr. John D. Mosser 
    I think so. 
    And if you look at Section 1350 of the Judicial Code, it specifically gives a -- a right of action to any alien and all the plaintiffs' respondents here were aliens. 
    The District Court shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a Treaty of the United States, so the Judicial Code clearly recognizes that you can have a tort violation of a treaty.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    I don't question that. 
    It seemed to me that if this is an action for an injunction in equity, it's on the law side of the Court under Section 1333. 
    And that you have a jurisdiction on the basis that the actions, one that does arise on the constitutional laws of the United States and you never run into the Romero problem.

    Well, if your -- that if, as I said, this is an alternative ground of jurisdiction and one which we urged both below and hear that under 1331 or 1315, we've added in this Court, if there is a right here under a treaty or the law of nations which was violated, then there is a federal question entirely separate from the maritime rights that are involved. 
    It's only if the basis of jurisdiction is maritime that you get into the question of whether the jurisdiction is in admiralty under 1333 or under 1331, under the exception which the court below found to the Romero decision.

   Argument of John Paul Jennings
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3598.014" stopTime="3601.684">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Jennings.
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="3601.684" stopTime="3882.855">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if Your Honors please. 
    I would like to clarify one matter which is in nature of its dispute that we have here. 
    We have issued all intent to interfere anyway with the internal economy of this ship. 
    We realize because of this Court's decision in the Benz case and we could not represent or seek to represent these foreign seamen or to bargain for them. 
    The position of the union is best expressed in the picket sign which was used on board the Willoughby, as it circled the Nikolos. 
    The AFL-CIO seamen protest loss of their employment, because of the use of foreign flagships employing seamen at substandard wages. 
    That was the nature of the protest. 
    The dispute could have been settled in a variety of ways. 
    The record indicates that Mr. Schultz, who was the assistant operating manager of National Boat Carriers also he's the assistant operating manager of Transea and of Seatankers which is a respondent in this case, so that these American corporations are closely related in Seatankers. 
    Seatankers was the agency which selected the Nikolos to use in this trade. 
    And necessarily, we hope that the economic pressure which we used could influence Seatankers, perhaps, to change its mind. 
    And certainly if the only reason for employment of a foreign ship is that the wages, hours and conditions on that ship, are one-fifth of those on American ship, but that reason disappears and American ship would be used, so that the conditions on the Nikolos were important with the union. 
    They existed as conditions. 
    The conditions work that the wages were one-fifth of those on these American ship. 
    But this was a fact which existed when Seatankers procured the Nikolos to enter the salt trade. 
    So that that is the nature of the dispute and we think that the Norris-LaGuardia Act should apply to it. 
    There are other problems Mr. Mosser suggested that if we picketed a railroad company that that might be within the protection of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, but obviously it would not, because the industry would be different. 
    The trade, craft and occupation would be different. 
    We would not be in the same industry. 
    It would be a different industry and Norris-LaGuardia would not apply. 
    We think that a case more closely analogous would be a case in which, for example, in American Longshore Union would picket in a -- in American port to protest the use of foreign non union longshoremen on the -- American joined the foreign ship unloading the ship. 
    Or if, for example, an American shipowner during the course of a maritime strike, should use a foreign registered vessel, which he might even know in a trade which had been occupied by the struck ships so as to break the strike. 
    Or, if an American shipowner and there are some operating foreign ships under American contract, should have the termination of the contract say, I won't bargain any further and the union would be told of -- if you put up a picket line and try to strike, the Norris-LaGuardia Act will not prevent an injunction at the behest of the American shipowner. 
    We think those are cases more closely analogous to the present one. 
    Now, there was one question asked by Mr. Justice Whittaker the other day with respect to the possibility that on this foreign ship, it might be considered a little piece of Liberia in the port of Tacoma. 
    That problem was dealt with in the case of Scharrenberg against the Dollar Steamship Company, in which Mr. Justice Clark wrote the opinion of the Court. 
    That's at 245 U.S. 122 at page 127, decided in 1917. 
    Mr. Justice Clark said this, “It is, of course, true that for the purposes of jurisdiction a ship, even on the high seas as often said to be a part of the territory of the nation whose flag it flies.” 
    But in the physical sense, this expression is obviously figurative. 
    Quoting, International Law Digest, Moore, vol. I Section 174, “And to expand the doctrine to the extent of treating seamen employed on such a ship as working in the country of its registry is quite impossible.” 
    And the case was quoted with approval by this Court in the Cunard Steamship Company case.

    With reference, what was involved in that case, Mr. Jennings?

    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    That was a case, Your Honor, in which it was maintained that the employment of a foreign seaman on an American vessel in a foreign port constituted use of foreign labor importation of foreign labor into this country in violation of the statute forbidding it. 
    The Chinese seaman had been employed on --

    Chinese citizen.
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="3909.681" stopTime="3912.639">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    He was employed under an American ship in a foreign port.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3912.639" stopTime="3914.318">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The question was whether the law applied in American --
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="3914.318" stopTime="3924.490">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    Whether that amounted to employment in American territory because the ship was to be treated as American as an extension of American sovereignty.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3924.490" stopTime="3925.351">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And they held not.
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="3925.351" stopTime="3926.964">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    And this Court said not.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3926.964" stopTime="3942.642">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Are many cases -- doesn't the Harrisburg hold the crime committed in the port of New York confined vessel is one committed on foreign island or foreign lands, foreign territory?
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="3942.642" stopTime="3979.170">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    I think not, Your Honor. 
    The -- the courts have uniformly recognized that the sovereign of the territory in which the ship is even though it be a foreign ship, may exercise jurisdiction, but as a matter of comity, they normally do not, if it involves inner -- internal relations, relations between the -- the members of the crew and the foreign government. 
    So the result is if it's a minor crime, normally, we do not exercise jurisdiction. 
    If it's a major crime, we do. 
    And for example, the Prohibition Act was applied to foreign ships when they entered American Courts. 
    That was the Cunard case.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Jennings, don't you think we have enough problems on this case without getting into that?

    I think so, Your Honor.

speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="3988.815" stopTime="3989.967">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    I wanted to answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3989.967" stopTime="3994.641">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes, I appreciate all the information, but I just wonder when you thought we have to decide that too.
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="3994.641" stopTime="4054.767">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    In conclusion and we think that the Benz case in this Court, which I think is a case relied on principally by Mr. Mosser, is not controlling in this litigation that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does apply and that the injunction was improvidently granted. 
    We urge also that in any event, the jurisdiction did not exist below and I wanted to point out that the Court of Appeals believed that the respondents here were not relying upon Section 13 -- 1333 because it is stated in the majority opinion at page 143, “Appellee," that is a respondent here, "has also refrained from invoking jurisdiction on the admiralty side under 28 U.S.C. 1333." 
    This position may have been dictated by the inability -- unavailability of a jury trial on the damages in the admiralty and because of appellee's belief that admiralty cannot afford injunctive relief so that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4054.767" stopTime="4055.703">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, if -- may I ask you (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="4055.703" stopTime="4058.621">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    -- the Court felt that they were not relying on Section 1333.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4058.621" stopTime="4067.582">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It is your position that this isn't within admiralty jurisdiction of the Court, admiralty is incapacitated from granting the injunction?
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="4067.582" stopTime="4072.418">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Our position is that, if this be a maritime tort at all and we don't think it has been --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4072.418" stopTime="4072.581">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="4072.581" stopTime="4073.668">

    -- established that it is.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4073.668" stopTime="4074.234">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes. 
    Go on.
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="4074.234" stopTime="4090.744">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    If it be a maritime tort, it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty and that in that event, the choice is either to sue an admiralty in which event, there is no injunction or to sue one at savings clause in the state court where you may procure an injunction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4090.744" stopTime="4107.024">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, didn't -- and my question was whether -- because admiralty -- it isn't within admiralty. 
    Of course, one starts that there must be a substantive offense. 
    The injunction is a remedy, but you say assuming it is an admiralty clause, start with that --
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="4107.024" stopTime="4107.673">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4107.673" stopTime="4111.026">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- then why is it not admiralty because admiralty can't issue an injunction, was it?
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="4111.026" stopTime="4113.758">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    It is in admiralty, Your Honor, but the remedy of injunction is unavailable.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4113.758" stopTime="4115.140">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that -- yes, it is an admiralty --
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="4115.140" stopTime="4115.816">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4115.816" stopTime="4120.667">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- and since admiralty can't issue an injunction, admiralty has no power in the premises.
speaker="john_paul_jennings" startTime="4120.667" stopTime="4121.435">
    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    Admiralty would have no power.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4121.435" stopTime="4128.837">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And since it is admiralty, although it can't accord relief, you can't go on the law of equity side.

    Mr. John Paul Jennings 
    That's correct, Your Honor.

    That was because, as we explained in our brief, we felt if the Norris-LaGuardia Act applies in the conduct of the -- the union in picketing, it was protected by the provisions of the Clayton Act and therefore, it was perfectly lawful. 
    That was the reason.

    No, Your Honor, only the conduct of the union here which was only peaceful patrolling and no more than that.
