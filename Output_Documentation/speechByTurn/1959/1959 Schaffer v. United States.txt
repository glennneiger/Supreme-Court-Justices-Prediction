    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 122, Hyman Karp and Benjamin T. Marco, Petitioners, versus United States. 
    Mr. Steinberg.
speaker="harris_b_steinberg" startTime="20.847" stopTime="310.658">
    Mr. Harris B. Steinberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I represent here two of the petitioners who were tried at the same time as Schaffers. 
    I yielded part of my time to Mr. Kossman because he was treating questions common to both of us. 
    I now wish to treat something which is in our brief, petitioners Marco and Karp, and that is the deprivation of a fair trial which we claim and sue because of the summation, the improper summation of the District Attorney. 
    I must confess it was a queer feeling, as I've said here before and hear myself quoted and to hear questions about why I did thus and so at the trial and casting about the reasons -- the only reasons I could think of it would appear would be either an aptitude or deviousness. 
    And as Mark Twain said, "If it weren't for the honor of the thing, he would just as soon pass it up to mention." 
    But I have to rest on the record as it is because I didn't make those motions at the time and Your Honors will draw whatever inferences you feel proper. 
    But in one respect, I did make a motion. 
    And I made a motion for mistrial at the time of the summation by the District Attorney, had brought to his honor's attention what it felt was an improper statement prejudicial to my client. 
    And at the trial, I represented only one client. 
    Here, I represent two because that man from West Virginia just couldn't go on with the case unless I'm willing to take it. 
    And since there were no conflict of interest and my other client consented I'm here for both. 
    What he said was an answer to what I said, and in order to put this in proper focus, I must tell you what I said. 
    And that brings me in a full circle to what the facts are about. 
    This case involved one where three people, Mario Stracuzza, Anthony Stracuzza and Dorothy Stracuzza were engaged in stealing packages from trucks in the garment district and selling them on a very large scale. 
    In fact, the largest of the scale was so amazing, it's like the Purloined Letter. 
    I mean you put it right out in the open and nobody thinks there's anything wrong with it. 
    They had an office with a name on it, not a telephone and credit bill heads and invoices and a checking account. 
    They held themselves out as a discount house or a job as outlet on which there are many in the garment area. 
    They bought about a half million dollars worth of packages a year from these thieves. 
    They had numerous customers of which these people are only a few. 
    They kept books of account, they mailed invoices, they were paid by check, and they sent their things out through the railway express, which is the way our people received them. 
    They were open for business from morning to night where people came in from a street and from recommendations and bought from them. 
    And the Stracuzzas, who operated in this way for a lengthy period, were all indicted by the Federal Government in three cases, one, for conspiracy and the one you've heard about in the joinder problem, one for another conspiracy, the phrase had posed it, and another where they were in conspiracy with all of the package thieves, dozens of them, drivers of trucks. 
    And all three cases, Mario and Anthony, two of them, pleaded guilty but their sentences were held over their heads until they should have completed testimony in this case. 
    Dorothy Stracuzza, who was the wife of Anthony, was not required to plead. 
    After this plea and after the Stracuzzas had come to the conclusion that the Government had the goods on them, both men said, "We're going to cooperate with the Government." 
    And they started to talk with the FBI. 
    After this soul-cleansing operation began and after they had changed their stripes, so to speak, they were both picked up again for more package thefts and indicted in the state courts. 
    And the District Attorney and the Federal Government hide themselves across the street to make representations to the judge and the prosecutor of the state court that this man, as my witness, placed off, disposed of this case until after we use him in our case.

speaker="harris_b_steinberg" startTime="350.124" stopTime="374.865">
    Mr. Harris B. Steinberg 
    The records -- the record is clear, Your Honor. 
    They had a book of account in evidence, and they weren't all just bills of lading and checks. 
    There were other evidence -- there were other documents in evidence. 
    The record is clear that they had many other customers who came in and bought in the same fashion for the same discounts and were -- sold goods of the same nature. 
    This was a half million dollars worth a year, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="374.865" stopTime="378.966">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Just as a matter of curiosity, did it appear how long they carried on this kind of business?
speaker="harris_b_steinberg" startTime="378.966" stopTime="759.544">
    Mr. Harris B. Steinberg 
    I would say they carried on for a considerable period before these defendants here were involved, and I think that appears in the record. 
    It was a matter of many months, if Your Honor please. 
    Now, let me come to something the Chief Justice asked me before. 
    There is not an iota, there is in fact the Government's own witness, principal witness, Tony Stracuzza said, "I never told any of my customers including these, that the stuff was stolen." 
    So they relied on circumstantial evidence as Mr. Kossman told you. 
    Now, what was the circumstantial evidence? 
    You mentioned, Your Honor, these invoices. 
    I'd like you to look at the invoices. 
    They were invoices with the tops taken off so you couldn't tell who was the sender. 
    There were invoices with the consignee scribbled out illegibly so you couldn't tell but you could see an identifying stock number perhaps, the quantity and the price. 
    Now, a discount house or a job that operates in exactly that way if he's handling the goods of some highly styled conscious manufacturer who wants to sell his goods for $20 or loose cash in the field, he doesn't like a discount house selling those same goods to someone else for $19 or for $18 or $12. 
    But sometimes you have broken lots, there are a few sizes. 
    There are undesired colors and in this Jungle at Seventh Avenue, this is a common, accepted widespread practice. 
    So when you look at the circumstances which were relied upon in this case to fasten circumstantial evidence of guilty knowledge on this man, what do we find? 
    You find these invoices. 
    You find various other things but let me tell you what else you find. 
    You find that Dorothy Stracuzza, the wife under indictment, who worked in the office with her husband and her brother-in-law from morning until night, was the one who prepared the invoices, shall we say, she's any better or worse off than the one who received them? 
    Either one. 
    She kept the books. 
    No one said that my client kept any books. 
    She got the checks, she mailed out the invoices, and she tore off the labels and she put the tickets on it. 
    So if there was any invidious inference to be drawn from these circumstances, I submit to Your Honors that that had been in this inference is at least as worthy against Mrs. Stracuzza as against any of these defendants. 
    Yet what do we find? 
    Mrs. Stracuzza was never called as a witness, either at the package thieves' trial or in our trial. 
    And in fact, shortly after our trial and shortly after our sentence, the District Attorney prepared and signed and submitted to the Court nolle prosequi in all the cases against the lady. 
    And they are set forth in the record here, if Your Honors please, at pages -- I thought I was going to do this with a flourish but I have to look. 
    At pages 12 -- at page 12 of the record, and what do they say? 
    They say that Dorothy Stracuzza has admitted assisting her husband in this business but has denied that she had knowledge of the fact that the merchandize handled by her husband was stolen. 
    The defendant Anthony Stracuzza in his testimony as a witness for the Government stated that his wife Dorothy never knew the extent of the operations. 
    As a result of that, that representation by the Government shortly after the completion of this trial, shortly after she had not been called or subjected to cross-examination, on that representation, the cases against her were thrown out. 
    Now, what are the facts that this record discloses? 
    At this trial, her husband, Tony, was under cross-examination by myself. 
    I asked him, "Did your wife know that these things were stolen?" 
    He said no. 
    And then I confronted him with his testimony at the prior trial where he had sworn under oath that his wife had known all about it, and he said, "Yes, I did testify to that effect." 
    I said, "What is the truth now? 
    Is that or is it this?" 
    He said, "Well, if you press me, I'll have to say she didn't know it." 
    Well, we left it at that because the truth wasn't in Tony Stracuzza and I wasn't trying to get the truth from him but I was trying to show what a liar he was. 
    Because for three days, I cross-examined that man to show he was a liar and I elicited the facts that he was a thief for many, many years, that he had a huge quantity of money and property not accountable for by any endeavor that he had ever reported to the income tax people. 
    That he was a gambler, a loan shark and whatever you will, and he admitted a lot of these cheerfully and in fact boastfully. 
    I would say that at the end of his cross-examination, he didn't look as cheerful as he did at the beginning. 
    I don't say that in vainglory of my powers as a cross-examiner, I say it for this reason. 
    Because we then expected that they would bring Mario around, the other brother for cross-examination. 
    And the reason Mario was important, was first, because he had testified at the -- at the State's trial and second, the Government had represented to the State District Attorney and the state court judge across the street"Please hold up Mario's sentence because he is a necessary material witness at this trial" 
    But they never produced him. 
    Why? 
    Because they didn't want him cross-examined, because he was the man who went out and bought this stuff from the thieves. 
    Tony said, "I didn't buy from the thieves, it was Mario." 
    Mario went out everyday with a pocket full of cash, $1000 to $1500 everyday and came back with packages and dumped them on the desk and Dorothy took the packages apart, stripped the labels off, put tickets on, did all the busy, homely, friendly little things that people do with packaging.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    [Laughs]
speaker="harris_b_steinberg" startTime="760.494" stopTime="888.095">
    Mr. Harris B. Steinberg 
    But they didn't bring Mario out for cross-examination. 
    And I say that it was our defense and it was our contention from the opening consistently through the trial right through the summation that there was a hope for a deal, I'll put it as euphemistically as I can, I'll say that the Stracuzzas hoped to be benefited by their change of heart, by their cooperation with the Government. 
    And the hope was (a), that Tony wouldn't go to jail, (b) that Mario wouldn't go to jail and (c), that Dorothy wouldn't go to jail. 
    And their hopes were realized to the fullest extent. 
    Not only were they indicted here in three cases, not only they pleaded guilty in three cases except for Dorothy, but they got suspended sentences and across the street in a state court where the people are cooperative. 
    And they use that cooperative, in the same sense in which they used it in the Knapp against Schweitzer case in a very friendly sense. 
    They -- the -- they gave him a suspended sentence too. 
    So here, you have the three Stracuzzas with their half million dollar yearly business in stolen goods and sold stupendously large scale that would stagger the imagination going off free, scot free because Tony gave his testimony and withstood the cross-examination for three days in a little braggy but he was still there, and they thought it would be the better part avow not to put Mario on and they were gentlemanly enough not to subject Dorothy to him. 
    In addition, what else did that accomplish? 
    When Dorothy and Mario were arrested, Dorothy had $900 -- $1900 in cash on her person and Mario had $900 in cash on his person. 
    And from the previous testimony, it was quite clear that that was a sort of money and the type of money they were using everyday to go out and buy stolen stuff with. 
    And the Government seized it as evidence and impounded it. 
    But after they began to cooperate, it was given back to them. 
    I wanted to cross-examine about that too but I couldn't because he didn't call Mario, they didn't call Dorothy.

    She is the wife of the man who has pleaded guilty testifying for the Government. 
    Could I in all practical common sense call her as a witness? 
    Couldn't she have pleaded the privilege? 
    She was still under indictment.

    She was physically in the jurisdiction.

    They said, "No, you have a right to call her." 
    And I -- I resented that -- that suggestion. 
    I thought it wasn't fair.

    The summation went on and it was a cry to the jury, "Where are Dorothy and Mario?

    Now, the Government tenders me a short impingement. 
    They say that was shoddy trial tactics and that it justified the answer they made to me. 
    If it does, Your Honors will tell me that. 
    I don't think it does. 
    I think that was a proper summation based on the record, based on my duty as a counsel for a man charged of crime and based on this evidence as to the type of people I was cross-examining and it's a type of thing I expected to get from the people who had the right to expect them to bring if they wanted an objective search for the truth in these circumstances.

    Mr. Harris B. Steinberg 
    Now, I'm not here to plead for myself. 
    I'd say to Your Honors read it. 
    If you think that my summation was improper in someway, then I say to you there are cases which say that the standard of advocacy of a defense lawyer may enlarge the scope of the standard of advocacy of the Government. 
    And if I did something improper, forget that part of my point, but I don't think you're going to find that. 
    What did he say in answer? 
    Three things, although I say three things for the purpose of handling it easily and for the purpose of relating with the cases, he said one thing because the whole thing is in a short compass and I jumped up and I said I want a mistrial. 
    Now, the first thing he said, what Mr. Steinberg says, "Where is Dorothy Stracuzza?" 
    And he says, "I'm telling you that Dorothy Stracuzza is still a defendant in this case. 
    The case is still pending against her. 
    The indictment is still open against her." 
    Now, I say to Your Honors in the context of what was in preparation, in the context of that statement in the nolle prosequi that was filed shortly thereafter, in a context of accepting that nolle prosequi the denial by -- by Tony of his wife's guilt knowing that Tony had said something just to the contrary under oath and not pointing that in nolle prosequi, in the context of her own denial of guilt but with all the admitted circumstances and far more than we used to fasten guilt on these defendants. 
    I say that was as phony as a $3 bill. 
    I say that was a misrepresentation. 
    I say that does not accord with the high purpose and principles of a prosecutor and I say that that was improper and deprived my clients of a fair trial. 
    What else did he say? 
    He said this to the other defendant Mario, "It is the Government's representation to you," 
    That he could have proffered nothing in a way of additional evidence that was not presented to you through to his brother because if you will recall from the testimony of Agent Miller, both Stracuzzas were interviewed on each and every occasions by him, the story, the testimony, if you will, given to the FBI was a joint story and therefore, the testimony of Mario Stracuzza, if he will call to testify, would be in a sense a repetition of all the details that you heard from the witness Anthony Stracuzza. 
    I submit to Your Honors that's for me. 
    That wasn't because he wanted to save the time of the Court. 
    That wasn't because he wanted to say repetitions. 
    I submit to Your Honors that it's clearly apparent that in view of the search and cross-examination, Mario had undergone at the first trial. 
    In view of these items of his money in his pocket, in view of the benefits he was getting across the street on this very Court, I say they wanted to protect him. 
    And that's why that's a misrepresentation although it's proposed to be a representation. 
    And the third thing is and this as I said, tired cliché of advocacy, this quotation of what it says over the Department of Justice, "The Government wins when justice is done of citizens and the Court". 
    That's true. 
    But I don't like to see that used in this captious phony sense and which is used here. 
    And when I say captious and phony, I could cite to you cases in our brief where the same quotes and the same tired reference that same chiselled thing is made in other occasions. 
    What I'm getting at is this. 
    This is not advocacy that heat of passion or something said that they're sorry for a moment later. 
    If I can understand that, I say that all the time. 
    I say it at home and I say it in Court. 
    This is shoddy tactics.

    Mr. Harris B. Steinberg 
    I'll tell you what's shoddy about it. 
    He follows with this. 
    If you believe that the Government had in some way or other, prevented you from getting the full truth of this entire case, that in some way here concealed the true facts pertaining to any of these defendants, you have only one duty. 
    You have to march right into that jury room and acquit every one of these defendants. 
    That's what's shoddy about it, Mr. Justice Black. 
    The cases, I've cited them in my brief, say that when you take away from a jury the real issue of the guilt or innocence of a defendant and you give them the phony issue of trying this handsome, clean-cut, cultured fine young man for impropriety, no jury is going to want to convict him of impropriety. 
    Now, when you say to -- when you say to him, "Here's this clean-cut, handsome young boy with a good law school, speaks well," is obviously the kind of board or jurors would be proud to have who he suddenly stands up, they're doing his duty against some people under indictment that if you believe I did anything wrong, I quit. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals in New York citing the Berger case of this Court says that's bad, it's reversible, dump to it because it's tendering a false issue. 
    Now, I don't know whether Your Honors would have given me certiorari in this point. 
    I don't know whether Your Honors are primarily interested in the points Mr. Kossman talked about, but it was in my heart to bring you this point because the time has come, so many years after the Berger case to get the word around in the federal courts that this is not the way to try a case because the same cliché, the same exact phrases come up in case after case. 
    Young fellows are learning how to try cases and they think this is the way to try the case unless you tell them differently. 
    From the cases I've cited in my brief, you will find repeated references to Berger. 
    Berger had a good effect on the New York Court of Appeals in the last five years has had five cases touching on summations, propriety or propriety summations reversed in every case and citing Berger, but it's losing its steam. 
    And I say to Your Honors you will do a service to the dying out of advocacy if you tell us how to try a case and put teeth into what you tell us, and say, "This is not the way to do it." 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John F. Davis

    Mr. Davis.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1489.447" stopTime="1590.756">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    The issue on this part of the case is considerably narrower than my brother would have in detail. 
    Issue was not whether the Stracuzzas -- whether the district judge should have given the Stracuzzas sentence, whether the Government should have known across the case against Dorothy Stracuzza. 
    The question here, although I'd be glad to discuss those points before I get through because they're in the background of this thing, but the specific question here is whether or not the United States Attorney misconducted himself before the jury so that the jury could have missed the trial. 
    There's very little that I can say on that. 
    What's the -- what the United States Attorney has set -- said is set forth at pages 9 to 10. 
    Everything that's objected to is set forth on pages 9 to 10 of the record. 
    This is an answer to an assertion that was made in the trial that the Government had entered into a deal with Anthony Stracuzza under which he would get these other people convicted and he and his family would be dealt with lightly. 
    There is not a thread of evidence of indication that the Government was buying urgent testimony. 
    Anthony Stracuzza --

    Well, whether it was buying testimony or not, I do not know. 
    There's no question that -- I think there's no question that Anthony Stracuzza by pleading guilty and turning states evidence expected to receive a lighter sentence as a result although the --

    I am certain that the United States Attorney in this case -- well, I'm not certain but I would assume he brought to the attention of the Court that this -- that Anthony Stracuzza testified in this case for the Government. 
    Now, whether or not Anthony Stracuzza should have -- should have been punished for all of his misdeeds, whether the judge should have given them a sentence or whether it should suspend the -- the sentence, I don't know. 
    I mean that's the question -- it's -- he is not here for the trial. 
    The only question is whether the United States Attorney, when he is accused of -- of -- in effect accused of making a deal for 30 pieces of silver of buying -- buying testimony, whether he is entitled to reply as he did in the words which appear in this record. 
    The Court of Appeals felt that he was. 
    I feel that he was. 
    I feel that none of the cases which counsel cited come anywhere near this when they talk about misconduct. 
    I don't -- I don't -- I do not only think that this wasn't misconduct which should have read -- lead to a mistrial, I don't think this was misconduct at all. 
    I think this was a perfectly proper and appropriate thing for the United States Attorney to tell the jury when he was presenting this case to them.

    There's no reason to believe that he had any information about the Schaffers and Mr. Marco and Mr. Karp. 
    I mean this was the first part of it and it wasn't part of the case to show the disposition because there, it wasn't an interstate shipment of stolen goods.

    It felt it proved its case that way.

    No, but it might -- it might go along ways to show what motive prompted him to testify as he was testifying in this case if he went so far as to testify to the opposite of what he testified to in another case shortly before it.

    Mr. Harris B. Steinberg 
    Just one moment, if Your Honor please. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked about whether this was only a New York doctrine or a federal doctrine. 
    Let me just tell you about two cases. 
    (Inaudible) was Second Circuit decided very recently by three different judges and sat on this case, Judge Waterman, Judge Lumbard, Judge Moore. 
    They reversed the conviction where they said there was overwhelming evidence of guilt. 
    And they reversed because the counsel for the defendant, in his summation, said that the bail of the informer, that is the government witness, the bail had been lowered and as soon as he agreed to cooperate that was done and therefore, he had every motive for lying. 
    That was the defense summation. 
    And in answer to that, the District Attorney said, "They'll ask you to draw the deduction that I made a deal, I never make deals" 
    And that was the word. 
    Now, that's weak and in our case, it was reversed.

    Mr. Harris B. Steinberg 
    The other is Lovello in New York Court of Appeals, 1 N.Y.2d. 
    Here's what the D.A. said there, "There, the defense summation, counsel criticized the prosecutor for failing to have and produce one witness." 
    So, why didn't he produce that witness so I can cross-examine? 
    The D.A. said this, "If that conversation didn't take place, stop right there. 
    Don't waste another 10 seconds on this case. 
    Come back and say the defendant is not guilty. 
    If that conversation didn't take place, I'm an aid on a federal perjury." 
    That's all it was. 
    Court of Appeals cited Berger and said this is tendering his own integrity as an issue. 
    It's a phony issue. 
    The issue was is he guilty or innocent.
