Wolfe v. North Carolina

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 7 Lean Wolfe, George Simkins, Jr., et al., Appellants, versus the State of North Carolina. 
    Mr. Atkins, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="j_alston_atkins" startTime="16.257" stopTime="261.486">
    Mr. J. Alston Atkins 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Today at the outset, I would like to address my remarks in answer to the question of Mr. Justice Brennan which was pending at the close yesterday involving all the facts on racial discrimination. 
    If Mr. Justice Brennan and Court will indulge me, I would like to make a brief background statement with regard to these additional facts which I think ultimately will show that this identical conduct of appellants, the identical acts of appellants which I held to be a crime in this case have been held by the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina to represent their constitutional rights and that the acts of State's agents which the State has held to be lawful where an unlawful denial of these constitutional rights under the Federal Constitutions solely on the grounds of race and color. 
    Now while the appellate process was running its course in connection with the first set of warrants toward the first opinion of the State Supreme Court in this case to which Mr. Justice Stewart referred yesterday, these appellants as plaintiffs have sued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against State's agencies, City of Greensboro, Greensboro City Board of Education who held title of the land and Gillespie Park Gold Club, Inc. which was operating it and with -- about which they have no question of -- they've also became agents of the State. 
    The case was found Simkins against City of Greensboro and others the opinion of which is reported in 149F.Supp.562, In due course the case was tried by the honorable Justice J. Hayes in response to request for two types of relief which the appellant's plaintiffs here asked. 
    First was a declaration of the rights of the parties concerning these identical conduct here, these are identical acts of playing golf on this golf course and the right of appellants so to play and also the rights of the parties with reference to the conduct of the State's agencies in interfering with that right. 
    Second type of relief asked was injunctive relief against any future repetition of this type of conduct about which are declaratory judgment was asked in the first type of relief. 
    Upon the trial of issues, the appellants prevailed and a declaratory judgment was issued declaring number one but this -- these identical acts represented the constitutional rights of appellants and second that the acts of the defendant's agent says interfering with that right to play was unlawful under the Constitution of the United States and that it was done solely on the grounds of race and color.

    Mr. J. Alston Atkins 
    No sir, there were four other plaintiffs. 
    They were total of ten, but I think that the record in that case and opinion and all of the items showed that the facts of the State Supreme Court say in this case is that this identical conduct was before them.

    Mr. J. Alston Atkins 
    Well, I'm not as familiar with the verifications of res judicata as to say categorically that I think would be exactly a question of res judicata but we think that the federal court having held -- having found by a declaratory judgment that when they were on that golf course, they have a constitutional right to be there. 
    And that the interference on the States agency is whether that being that was unlawful under the constitution of the United States that the State could not bear after finding that conduct of being a crime and to punish them by jail sentences (Inaudible)

    Mr. J. Alston Atkins

    So the question is whether the legal issue was the same and even if it wasn't the same, it has then a question either of res judicata of independently a violation -- infringement of what this Court held since Brown against Allen, is that your -- is that it? 
    I'm trying to find what the constitutional claim is that you make other than the one you made yesterday that the conduct of this trial on the charge of whether essentially was a breach of the thieves or something like that.

    It was trespassing.

    That is what the North Carolina prosecuted them for.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, as I understand the Attorney General's brief and whether what -- that you have say to this. 
    It's in the fact that while this record has says you have pointed it out to it, it's nevertheless also the fact that 6 and 7 physically were not before the Supreme Court of North Carolina and that the fact that they were not before that Court explains largely the conclusion it has reached, then I think the Attorney General does not argued that since they were not before the North Carolina Supreme Court that its his judgment we're reviewing, we can't take any notice of them either.
speaker="j_alston_atkins" startTime="892.025" stopTime="957.196">
    Mr. J. Alston Atkins 
    They were not falling in this record. 
    They were tendered to -- to the Supreme Court on the theory of judicial notice and the Court did not take judicial notice. 
    There is one little item that I think is pertinent to this because as I understand the decision of this Court that -- a State Supreme Court must be bound by its rule and decisions that it cannot, it's forbidden to consider matters which technically do not appear in the physical record. 
    But, that if the State Supreme Court does have discretion to consider matters which do not appear in the physical record, that then this Court may look into the matter and it's not concluded absolutely by such inadvertences as appear here.

    Days other than holidays and weekends and greens fees are a dollar and quarter. 
    White citizens were permitted to play without being members by paying fees above set forth and without paying the extra dollar and without any questions being put to them. 
    And the plaintiffs applied to be given the same privilege, they were refused on the ground that they were not members but primarily because of their color. 
    Plaintiffs laid the greens fees on the table in the club house, went out to play and after they got through third hole, the pro in-charge of the golf course ordered them off and they insisted they have the right to play and would not get off unless they were arrested by an officer whereupon the pro had them arrested and they were tried and convicted.

    It's the third paragraph of our brief. 
    As far as I know that there is no question about that being faithful and accurate reproduction of -- that declaratory judgment. 
    Whereas you see the Court said that this will actually (Inaudible) on the plaintiffs there, appellants here, defendants in the criminal case represented a constitutional rights and that they have been unlawfully denied because of race and color.

    On the facts was -- presented to him, Judge Hayes issued an oral enjoining racial discrimination in the use of golf course. 
    Now there are two things about that; number one, there are prior to State Supreme Court who could've filed that by ignoring outside the record and looking at the decree and injunction which was just one document, the bottom part of it was the injunction the part was just a declaratory judgment which is -- you see on page 92 of the record, but the crucial thing about that is -- it seems to me and -- and we have asked ourselves a thousand times, is it conceivable great and distinguished judge like an honorable Johnson J. Hayes would have issued an order forbidding discrimination at this golf course where no racial discrimination existed. 
    If as the State would have this Court believe that its agencies have been (Inaudible) circumspect in opening this golf course to every citizen without into regard to race and color, is it conceivable that Judge Hayes would have enjoined what did not exist at this golf course.

    Now, they have put into the -- to their brief excerpts, editorials from newspapers. 
    They put in to their brief parts of the findings of fact that they say that Judge Hayes made in the District Court. 
    They have put into their brief parts of the declaratory judgment that they read to you and they have also put into their brief excerpts from a manual, if I recall correctly from the work progress of administration. 
    Now I respectfully say to this Court that none of those things at all were ever before that trial court. 
    None of those things were before the trial court insofar as this record shows at all. 
    Certainly, he will not contend to you that the portions of the manual from the works progress administration which I think maybe was used in the federal trial whatever into it introduced in evidence, none of these at newspaper editorials and these petitions and proceedings that they say were had before the City Council of Greensboro, were ever put before the trial court in order -- did it ever appear before the Supreme Court of North Carolina.

    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    Well, I think they got that from another part of the record over here which I wish to call to your attention. 
    I think they got that from the testimony at -- of the deputy clerk that they have there at that time. 
    Mrs. Myrtle Cobb, I'm looking now Your Honor at page 71, Mrs. Cobb is there and she said that she had some records. 
    She said that it's her duty to keep in possession the public possession, the records in the case of Simkins and others against The Gillespie Park Golf Course. 
    I have all (Inaudible) there's no papers in that case. 
    Now, there's nothing there that says their exhibit 6 and 7 may it please the Court. 
    The 6 and 7 at all is nothing there that ties them with 6 and 7. 
    She said she happened. 
    Then, counsel get off into this question which my friend here talked about the other day about examining people as an adverse witness under GS8-50. 
    And as you will see if you go to 72, they get off into the question of about an adverse witness and we don't hear about anything anymore until we get over to where Mrs. Kennedy says that she'd like to get a ruling on these, whatever these are and the Court says that he was sustained to 6 and 7. 
    And as pointed out by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, which is correct, I want them to be the -- I subscribe to equal protection law and I don't think that constitutionally, we can set up a new procedures or event, new motions or things to exclude them for the setting up their federal rights. 
    I don't think that for a minute, but, as suggested by Mr. Frank -- Justice Frankfurter, they have charge of the preparation of the case what we call the case on appeal. 
    We have two things. 
    We have a record which consists of the permanent part of the case, things that we'd like to think of as permanent, the Bill of Indictment, the judgments and things like that and then we have what the case -- about we call the case on appeal which consists of the various flexible fluid things that transpire at the trial, motions, evidence, rulings on evidence and things of that nature. 
    Now, it was up to them to make up their case on appeal. 
    Had I been in their position, it would have been up to me, and I say that this is not a -- an unusual, unheard of anomalous procedure for an attorney who's get -- making up their own case on appeal if they thought some exhibits had been excluded that when -- wrongfully excluded and to which they are -- wanted an appellate review that they would make an offer or tender of those exhibits for the basis of a exception.

    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    And yes, that is my point. 
    And of course you -- I think you have a State record. 
    I'm not sure if certified here, I believe it is and you will see there is no record of 6 -- exhibit 6 and 7 in the State record at all. 
    The exhibits were there that were sent up. 
    Now, I think they're bound by the same rules of practice that I would be or anybody else, and I've tried to cite in my brief to show this Court that North Carolina is simply following things that it's been following all the time and that it is invented no new or anomalous practice to try to exclude these people from a federal -- raising a federal question at all. 
    It's the same practice that all lawyers have to follow and it's the same thing that's been followed all the time. 
    The same thing is true about their questions -- they had some question over there if the -- beginning when he was raising this part about closing mouths of witnesses. 
    (Inaudible) those were our witnesses that they were cross examining and the prosecutor simply objected to evidence of -- he tried this case like any other trespass case this record shows it. 
    He simply objected the evidence of some other colored people that had been down there and that was sustained and they say that's closing the mouths of witnesses. 
    At that time, they had never told the Court that now we wish to make a defense. 
    They had filed a motion to quash. 
    I'm not overlooking that but the motion to quash is relying upon the efficacy of this declaratory judgment obtained in the Federal District Court and they rely on that as an estoppel among other things and of course an attempt to raise a question on form of jeopardy and various things like that. 
    But in the motion to quash, I -- I there have set forth in my brief case after case to show Your Honors that the motion to quash is not the way to raise a question and that pertains that matters that appear on the face of the record.

    I do call your attention but let me comment just one minute on the facts that they say -- talk about the facts over the great deal. 
    Greensboro and the City Administrative unit which is an educational unit leased the land to Gillespie Park Golf Course. 
    Now, it wasn't as bogus lease, a straw lease or a fictitious lease I say for this reason. 
    The directors of the corporation pledged their own faith and credit and put over $100,000 into the development of the property and built a small club house and the rules are stated the -- they have their rules for membership. 
    I have in my set forth in my brief a list of things that these gentlemen are now raising for the first time and were not presented to my courts, who you're now passing upon, one of them was the sufficiency or the adequacy of the rules where they too nebulous and too broad and did they contain too much arbitrary discretion? 
    They haven't raised that question, the trial judge didn't pass on that, the Supreme Court of North Carolina didn't pass on such questions as that. 
    Now, they had a rule that people could play that were belonged to golf clubs affiliated with the Carolina Golf Association and as to the rules themselves as stated in the bylaws, there is -- I can consider some ambiguity. 
    I don't see them right now but when you look at them, there is some ambiguity and it -- here in the Article I, membership in this corporation should be restricted to members or approval to Board of Directors. 
    For membership in the club, there should be two types of membership and that was the $60 plus taxes and so on. 
    And then, they said the golf course and its facilities should be used only by members and invited guests, members in good standing of other golf clubs, members of the Carolina Golf Association and people -- or the professional and his invited guest. 
    There's an ambiguity there as to whether that golf clubs who affiliate with the Carolina Golf Association or whether it's a person who is a member in good standing in the golf club can -- would also be entitled to play in this. 
    In either case, it makes no difference in this case because these gentlemen, three of them who weighed something around 100 pounds had decided to got down there and play golf and -- they didn't go down there and say, “Now – here is a letter showing that we're in a good standing with the Nocho Golf Club” which one of them says they belonged to, only one of the defendants testified, they presented no letter to the pro or anybody else like that, saying “We are members in good standing of this golf club.” 
    They just came down -- 75 cents down pushed in and said “we're going to play golf” and they were prosecuted for trespass which Judge Hayes said it was a -- he seems to think in his opinion according to the federal supplement that it was a matter of discrimination. 
    But that was never presented and we don't -- even if they -- is the same incident that was adjudicated in the Federal Court. 
    Even if it was, we don't know under what circumstances they went in and what they did even in exercising a right to say we're entitled to exercise.

    I believe he told him I'm not too sure of this. 
    I think he told them they were not members or -- and they said they formed a line he said, they form a sort of a rough of line, threw 75 cents down on a counter of a little club house that they've built there and proceeded to go out and play golf.

    They said they knew who the members of the club were, merely all of it -- all of the members were and these gentlemen never made then who came down there and did this never made any (Inaudible) membership. 
    They said they were going to play golf and it was quite evident of course that they've been intended to make such a move at this for sometime because Simkins testified that over a year and a half ago, he'd written his lawyer about it and that he had a letter from his lawyer. 
    Under this statute if they had a bona fide license to enter on the property or a bona fide belief that they had a license to go on the property and the defense might have been different as to the technical defense is in the statute. 
    They never claimed that at all. 
    Simkins said, “I have a letter from a lawyer about it” and he never -- they never offered the letter in evidence -- evidently thought that what he read in this letter was license for him to do what he wanted to do. 
    Whether here then that was all. 
    They never claimed membership at all.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    So, make that this record were Federal Court record were before the State Supreme Court, what would be the effect of it in your view as -- as to the collateral estoppel as far as relitigation of that issue is concerned?
speaker="ralph_moody" startTime="2832.351" stopTime="2895.071">
    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    Well, I admit it. 
    It's my contention that that is matter in which the State is not bound by at all. 
    The State of North Carolina is not bound of that finding as a matter or a collateral estoppel or as any estoppel at all. 
    They keep talk about these being agencies of the State. 
    One was a private corporation, the other was a City Administrative Unit and the other was a municipal corporation. 
    But the State of North Carolina has -- as I've stated in my brief to you, has not authorized those agencies to stand in judgment for it in criminal matters and in criminal proceedings. 
    Now, if -- if the State can be bound by this as an estoppel, assuming first of all, let's assume they had it and properly all there and properly approved and offered it in evidence, I still say that it was proper to exclude it and that the -- a State constitutionally, as I say doesn't -- as a matter of constitutional law is not required to extend recognition to the doctrine if it doesn't want to.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2895.071" stopTime="2896.344">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You have such a doctrine?
speaker="ralph_moody" startTime="2896.344" stopTime="2955.048">
    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    We have such a doctrine as been applied in civil cases. 
    I think I believe I point that out, but I say that a State constitutionally does not have to extend the doctrine and it does not have to accept criminal, civil issues and criminal cases. 
    We have tried to discuss that in our brief and I received -- I thought a great deal of comfort from the statement in your opinion against Hoag -- Hoag against New Jersey. 
    For there, I believe you will find language in which you said it was very doubtful or there was very grave doubt as to whether a State had to extend to or recognize the doctrine of collateral estoppel. 
    Now, I'm aware that you have considered it in old (Inaudible) case of the (Inaudible) case in which I believe there was a statement that -- that even the issues adjudicated in a civil case might be available in the criminal case. 
    But I would call to your attention there sir that you were dealing with Federal Courts all the way through.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2955.048" stopTime="2987.550">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    One gets the impression perhaps mistakenly from reading of your Supreme Court's opinion that you do have a doctrine of collateral estoppel and that apart from the question of whether this record was properly before the Court that the vice that they found or the difficulty they found in applying the State doctrine was because the State itself has not been a party to the proceeding in the Federal Court.
speaker="ralph_moody" startTime="2987.550" stopTime="2988.335">
    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    You're correct --

    Is that fair reading of the opinion (Inaudible)
speaker="ralph_moody" startTime="2989.737" stopTime="3025.233">
    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    Yes, I think so. 
    But I would call to you attention though that the doctrine of collateral estoppel, as far as I know of it in my jurisdiction has only been applied in civil cases, the adjudicating of issues as between the same parties or perhaps privies of those -- were connected or related in the determining and concluding matters, but I haven't found it in where it has ever been applied that a civil -- a conclusion or an adjudication in a civil matter has been reached -- has been placed over and used as an estoppel against the State in a criminal prosecution.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3025.233" stopTime="3027.888">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Has it indicated such things that in this opinion?

    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    No, sir it did not. 
    I don't think you find any such authority of such.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3033.913" stopTime="3038.871">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    They didn't reach any of these questions because of their view as to the deficiency in the record?
speaker="ralph_moody" startTime="3038.871" stopTime="3042.657">
    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    I think so except they did consider the question of judicial notice.

    Mr. Ralph Moody 
    And there, I will not debate that unless someone wishes for me to go in to any of it. 
    It's suffice it to say that they -- they're now asking for judicial notice make up for all of these and -- as some of the question while ago about these motions that were filed in the Supreme Court of North Carolina, they filed a motion suggesting a diminution of the record, but they never said anything about this in that motion at all. 
    They thought that their record has been sufficiently shown appeals -- appeal interest from the Municipal County Court which had original and exclusive jurisdiction.

    I filed a motion to dismiss it but the Supreme Court held against me and -- with them.

   Rebuttal of J. Alston Atkins

    First if I may be permitted, I would like to suggest the number of questions in our brief that manifest the time we're not permit and we would appreciate it very much if the Court would consider all those questions which we have and I -- an opportunity to the argument as submitted on the brief. 
    Now on the question of collateral of estoppel is, a file prior to judgment at the State, it confuses the question of a estoppel and collateral estoppel in the supremacy on this federal judgment which is not based upon the question of estoppel at all although the -- the supremacy clause, we understand that it makes this judgment supreme as a matter of supremacy and not because of any question of estoppel.

    However, that the Federal Court having jurisdiction of this case could in fact determined well in that -- these specific acts were constitutionally protected and that several months after when these warrants were drawn -- and they withdrawn months after that determination had been made --

    I cannot answer that, Mr. Chief -- Mr. Justice Black except to say what counsel have said. 
    They said that -- they understood the North Carolina procedures to be that the exception that you mentioned in talking with the Attorney General did preserve any questions as to improper exclusion of those records and they call it to the attention of the Supreme Court on page 14 of their brief as they -- was proper to do. 
    That brief was no printed in the record where it was set up and requested to be presented but the clerk thought that it was not properly printed, but it is in the original transcript on full on page 14, they said the Court erred in refusing to admit the defendant's exhibit 6 and 7 as set out in exception 22. 
    These exhibits were under the decree of the findings of fact, conclusions of law and opinion of the Federal District Court in the Simkins case and opinion of the Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit in the same case.
