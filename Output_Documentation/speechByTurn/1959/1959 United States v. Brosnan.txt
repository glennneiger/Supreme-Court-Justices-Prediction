United States v. Brosnan

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Bank America National Trust and Savings Association, Petitioner versus the United States. 
    Mr. Stewart?
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="11.189" stopTime="217.326">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit. 
    It is an action pursuant to Title 28 of the United States Code, Section 2410, about which the Court heard something in the argument of the Brosnan case yesterday. 
    It is an action by The Bank of America, a National Bank, doing business in California against the United States to quiet title of the bank in and to certain land and chattels, specifically a sawmill and the equipment of it, in Calaveras County, California. 
    The action was started in the Superior Court of the State of California as permitted by California law and was removed to Federal District Court on the motion of the United States. 
    Both sides moved for summary judgment. 
    The District Court granted the motion of the plaintiff bank, denied the motion of the defendant Government and decreed that the bank is the owner of the land, the buildings, and the equipment in question and that the Government is barred from asserting any adverse claim. 
    The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and this Court last October granted certiorari. 
    The bank's title was acquired by purchase at a foreclosure sale held pursuant to a power sale of in a first deed of trust on the land and the power of sale in chattel mortgages on the personal property. 
    The Government was made a defendant because it holds tax liens against the former owner of the land and chattels and the Government claimed that its tax liens attached to the land and chattels and are still effective in spite of the fact that the taxpayer no longer held a free and unencumbered title to the land and chattels at the time when the tax lien attached. 
    The deed of trust, and I may from this point on refer simply to the deed of trust without elaborating to include the chattel mortgage because I think the principles are the same on both types of documents, the deed of trust given in connection with the bank loan and the chattel mortgages had been executed by the taxpayer or a predecessor in title some time before the tax lien attached. 
    Legal title to the real-estate was actually in the trustee under the deed of trust when the government acquired its tax lien. 
    When the taxpayer defaulted in the payment of his indebtedness, the land and chattels were sold at public auction in accordance with the contract powers of sale and the bank became the purchaser at that sale at public auction. 
    All notices required by California law were given, but these did not include in a special notice to the Government which had failed to request special notice as it might have done under California law. 
    The primary question presented here is --

    How does the Government (Inaudible)
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="223.733" stopTime="266.767">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Well if Your Honors please, the Government initiates its proceedings by filing a notice of tax lien. 
    Presumably with due diligence it would investigate the assets of the taxpayer to see what the means of collection might be. 
    It would discover that the property was subject to an outstanding lien and could then request the notice even though no default had occurred, in the event of default or in the event of sale and it would then receive the notice automatically. 
    Also these things are recorded in the public offices and there are any number of services and publications which most people subscribe to, which reveal them.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Where is it in your brief?
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="345.944" stopTime="492.169">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    The statute -- the state statute, I think we have cited and I think we did not quote it sir. 
    It is cited just below the middle of page three of our brief, its California Civil Code, Section 2924 (b), just at the end of the first full paragraph on page three of our main brief. 
    The primary question presented to the Court is, does the purchaser of land and chattels that a foreclosure sale held pursuant to a power of sale and the first deed of trust and chattel mortgages, acquire title free of subordinate tax liens of the United States? 
    There's no question about these liens being subordinate and then there is the secondary question, may such a purchaser establish his clear title by a quiet title suit against the United States? 
    The Government has stated the question somewhat differently and I pause here momentarily to emphasize the correctness of the question as we have stated it because as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in the events in the Vanston Committee case in 329 United States, “putting the wrong questions is not likely to beget right answers even in law.” 
    The Government says that the question is whether a junior federal tax lien maybe extinguished through a non-judicial sale of the property by a mortgagee under a contractual power of sale. 
    It is my view that there is no issue in this case about extinguishment. 
    No suit was brought to extinguish. 
    The statute, Section 3670 of the Internal Revenue Code, says that the Government's lien is, “Upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person” that is the taxpayer. 
    In our view the taxpayer's right out or to which the Government lien attached was a defeasible right which subsequently dissolved or evaporated.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I don't quite get your distinction there between you and the Government.

    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    This is --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="496.934" stopTime="497.521">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It's my fault but I don't --
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="497.521" stopTime="539.039">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    But I know Mr. Justice I sympathize with you because it's -- it's one that has caused trouble all the way in this case and if -- if you'll bear with me just a few moments, I -- I'm going to address the next few minutes of my -- my argument right to this point and -- and then if I don't clarify it I'll try to do it again. 
    This suit assumes that the Government lien against the taxpayer is still just as valid as it ever was as to any property and rights to property belonging to the taxpayer. 
    But it asserts that the taxpayer no longer has any right to property insofar as the land and chattels in this action are concerned. 
    And --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="539.039" stopTime="549.891">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And that -- pardon me, but I don't see the -- quite the difference. 
    It seems to me this is vague -- maybe it's a difference in the use of the word, they're saying that it extinguished that lien on this particular piece of property.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="549.891" stopTime="576.242">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    If you say it that way sir there is no difference in practical results at all. 
    The importance of the point is that you do not extinguish a general federal tax lien by this method because the tax lien is applicable to all property of the taxpayer. 
    We're dealing here only with specific property and we say this specific property is no longer subject to the lien although the lien may still be in effect as to all the properties that the taxpayer may own.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="576.242" stopTime="580.942">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But does the Government differ from that? 
    I -- I don't gather that that's the difference.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="580.942" stopTime="585.298">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Well they stated differently and I think that difference in statement has caused confusion in the fact.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="585.298" stopTime="599.274">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You used the word extinguished and you read that as meaning extinguish the lien it would have to be nothing else. 
    When in reality I -- I gather it correctly, they're saying it is extinguished, that lien is drawn so far as that particular piece of property is concerned.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="599.274" stopTime="599.637">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    And if you --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Under these proceedings.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="600.631" stopTime="603.226">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    If it is stated that way sir, we have no disagreement.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="603.226" stopTime="607.613">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    If the taxpayer had no other property; it would be extinction in every sense of the word.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="607.613" stopTime="729.593">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    That's correct, sir. 
    Now, the same federal statutes are involved in this case as were involved in the Brosnan case, which was argued to Your Honors yesterday. 
    However, as this Court reaffirmed in the Best case in 357 United States, Section 3670 of the Internal Revenue Code creates no property rights. 
    All it does is attach consequences to such right as are created under state law. 
    I think it maybe worth a few moments without over emphasizing it therefore to discuss the nature of a deed of trust under California law, as well as to go into a little more detail about the alternative procedures that are available both to lienholders such as the bank and lienholders such as the Government. 
    The clearest statement that I have found of the nature of a deed of trust in California is found in a 1933 case of the California Supreme Court entitled Bank of Italy against Bentley and I'd like to read just a sentence or two from that opinion which states it, I think quite clearly. 
    The Court there said “Although this State, California, at an early date adopted the lien theory of mortgages, it adopted the title theory in reference to deeds of trust.” 
    In the early case of Koch against Briggs it was held that the mortgages and deeds of trust were fundamentally different in that, in a mortgage, only a lien was created while in a deed of trust, the title actually passed to the trustee. 
    This distinction although frequently attacked by counsel and often criticized by the courts has become well settled in our law and cannot now be disturbed.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="729.593" stopTime="731.643">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What's the citation to that case, Mr. Stewart?
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="731.643" stopTime="739.073">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    That is 217 California 644, Your Honor and certiorari was denied in 290 U.S.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="739.073" stopTime="740.714">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    That's in your supplemental brief.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="740.714" stopTime="882.521">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    That is -- that is in our -- our supplemental memorandum, yes, sir. 
    The deed of trust given as here in connection with a bank loan conveys legal title to the trustee for the benefit of the bank. 
    It also contains the power of sale which authorizes the trustee to sell the real-estate in the event of the default. 
    Now the trustor borrower retains certain rights. 
    He retains the right to possession and he retains the right to reacquire the legal title, if he pays his debt when due. 
    And of course this bundle of rights has been called by various names, but I think there is no dispute that whatever you call it. 
    This bundle of rights retained by the trustor is -- is clearly not a free and unencumbered fee title. 
    The trustor-borrower cannot convey to any third party, any greater right than those he retains. 
    And if he has an attempt -- if he attempts to convey to a third party, X let's say, such a conveyance subtracts nothing from the rights of the trustee under the deed of trust and the power of sale. 
    On default by trustee, may sell, free and unencumbered title, fee title and no one claiming under the trustor-borrower may attack that title of the purchaser at such a trustee sale and that's California property law, and there's no dispute about it. 
    It's been reaffirmed in the subsequent Carpenter against Small Claims Committe in the California Supreme Court which is cited in our brief and it was recently restated by the Federal Court in California, in the Northern District of California and the Higley case against the City of Sacramento cited in our brief. 
    One sentence there may be worth repeating. 
    The Federal Court said the “The general rule in California is that a sale by the trustee under the power of sale and the deed of trust has the effect of vesting the purchaser with title as of the date when the trust deed was executed”, which results in the extinguishment, if I may use the word extinguishment, results in the extinguishment of all liens on the property attaching subsequently to the trustee.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="882.521" stopTime="885.117">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There's no equity of redemption thereafter or anything --
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="885.117" stopTime="1264.431">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Not on the sale pursuant to a trust deed Mr. Justice. 
    Now, yesterday inquiries were made in the course of the Brosnan argument as to state procedures which were available and how the Government might protect itself and I'm anticipating Your Honors' interest in similar questions as to California, I'd like to take a few moments just to outline those. 
    There are several loan alternatives, some of which maybe initiated by the Government and some by the holder of the deed of trust. 
    The first step as I said a moment ago is that the Government files notice of its tax lien. 
    Then exercising reasonable prudence presumably it investigates the taxpayer's assets. 
    I -- it's a matter of public record of which I assume this Court can take judicial notice that the Internal Revenue Service has a budget of $128,000,000 a year for tax audits and $18,000,000 a year for investigation of tax frauds and do special services and if this isn't enough to cover it they can get a title report for $25 which will show them the entire status of the -- of the property. 
    So having determined this, if the taxpayer is shown to be trustor as this one was of a real-estate deed of trust, the Government records a simple request or notice of default and notice of sale in the event that there is one. 
    This may happen before default. 
    It will thereafter receive notice and be able to protect its interest by bidding it to public auction or by a suit if one should be indicated to enjoin any sale under of the power of sale, this is if the Government questions the validity of the deed of trust which of course it does not do in this case. 
    Now, alternative, the Government may sue under section 7403 of Title 26 U.S. code which was mentioned yesterday to foreclose its lien. 
    That is to subject the taxpayer's property whatever it may be, whatever he's interest in property maybe to the payment of the tax. 
    It doesn't have to wait for action by the holder of the deed of trust; it can take this action itself or a third alternative, if it does not choose to follow either of those two, the Government may levy and (Inaudible) for taxes under Section 6331 in following of Title 26. 
    This is an administrative procedure which results in a sale of public auction at the instance of the Government. 
    So there are at least three methods which the Government may pursue to protect its rights or if it chooses not to do that, it may wait as it did here, for a prior action by the prior lienholder and in that event the holder of the deed of trust has at least three alternatives. 
    In the first place, he may request an administrative partial discharge of the Government lien from the property in question. 
    And this is normally accompanied by appraisals of value of the property showing the amount of the equity, if any, and offering to pay to the extent that any equity is shown, tells the -- this excess and then go through the normal procedures. 
    And this I might say, it's not in the record but if Your Honors are interested in the practical procedures that are followed, this is what's normally done. 
    This is one reason we don't have any more of these cases. 
    At least it's -- it's what the Bank of America normally does -- it does and I'm sure a great many others do the same thing and that this results in the -- in the disposition of a good many of the cases where this problem arises. 
    However, where this doesn't work, if there's a disagreement about values and or for some other reasons the Government doesn't choose to give it's administrative consent and of course it's free to do this, if there is no way of compelling it then the holder of the prior lien has two more alternatives. 
    He may sue to foreclose the deed of trust as a mortgage. 
    This is effective, it's cumbersome, it's expensive. 
    It normally takes two to three years to clear a title when this procedure is followed. 
    It is not warranted in a practical business world unless there is a need and desire for a deficiency judgment. 
    Under state law you -- you have to go through this procedure if you seek a deficiency of judgment against the -- the borrower, but you don't have to do it if you don't care about the deficiency of judgment and this brings us to the third alternative which is the one followed in this case. 
    The holder the deed of trust may sell under the power of sale. 
    A sale of public auction which there is a 90-day notice filed of default followed by 21 days of publication in the legal newspapers of the county where the -- where the property is situated and normally the whole procedure is finished in 120 days. 
    It is simple, it is inexpensive, it makes possible prompt liquidation which is for the benefit of all concerned because you don't run up a lot of costs to depreciation the value. 
    If there is likely to be any excess, it -- it develops better this way and it leads to results in a discharge of the obligation without the possible deficiency of judgment which might lead them to further assets of the borrower. 
    Then if the Government still after this procedure has gone through, if the Government still is stubborn about its lien, still stubbornly asserts its lien as it did here, having it ignored its numerous other means of protecting itself which I've outlined the purchaser of the deed of trust sale may sue as this purchaser, the bank did here to quiet title.

    Yes, sir, yes, sir, indeed. 
    This -- this is the real issue in this case whether this remedy is an appropriate one and although it has come up for adjudication in the lower courts, this is the first time I believe that it has reached this Court. 
    And this is the main reason we're here, to determine the effectiveness of -- of this remedy, this simple inexpensive remedy as against Government tax liens.

    How could --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1294.745" stopTime="1296.474">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And you've got 2410?
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="1296.474" stopTime="1511.586">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    That is correct, sir. 
    Now one thing I noticed in yesterday's argument, I think I might turn you to right now. 
    I planned to bring it up later but this is probably as good a time as any. 
    The 2410 was spoken off yesterday as if it offered a single procedure for obtaining a clear title against Government tax liens. 
    This is not correct. 
    Section 2410 offers two alternative procedures. 
    The first is by a suit to quiet title. 
    The second is by a suit to foreclose the mortgage. 
    Now many procedural details to be followed in such suits are spelled out in Subdivision (d) and (c) of that section, but there is nothing in the language of that section to indicate that a suit to foreclose is essential or whether the suit to foreclose is a prerequisite to a suit to quiet title or that a quiet-title action is dependent in any way upon the prior completion of a foreclosure action and the legislative history of this amendment is quite interesting. 
    It is totally inconsistent in my judgment with any notion that a foreclosure is necessary if the quiet-title procedure is followed. 
    It is -- it seems to me that it shows quite clearly that the purpose of the amendment was to provide an expedient procedure for clearing the title (Inaudible) Government's claim in respect the property of which no valid lien is attached in lieu of the complex, expensive, dilatory procedure by action to foreclose. 
    And I would like to direct the Court's specific attention to the most important element of that legislative history. 
    It is set out on page 10 of petitioner's main brief. 
    This amendment was adopted in response to a request made by the then Attorney General Jackson in a letter which the relevant part of which I've quoted at the bottom of page 10 and I think that's worth reading. 
    Attorney General Jackson said, “It should be observed in this connection that under existing law”, this is back 1942, “Under existing law there is no provision whereby the owner of real-estate may clear his titles in such real-estate of the cloud of a Government mortgage or lien. 
    In many instances persons acting in good faith have purchased real-estate without knowledge of the Government lien or in the belief that the lien had been extinguished and then this important language, in other instances mortgagees have foreclosed on property and have failed to join the United States. 
    It appears that justice and fair dealing would require that a method would be provided to clear real-estate titles of questionable or worthless Government liens. 
    Accordingly I suggest that the bill be amended by inserting the phrase “to quiet title or” between the words matter, “and for the foreclosure of” in line 4 in phase II of the bill and the Congress did it. 
    And it is our view, that that set up a completely independent alternative procedure in which the Congress specifically intended to approve the procedure which has been followed in this case. 
    It is here of Your Honors' interpretation for the first time. 
    Now this brings me to --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, no, but that -- leave that out for the moment. 
    Go for the foreclosure of the mortgage, that is not the present in your case, does that commission not have to be satisfied?
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="1561.654" stopTime="1583.143">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    That is my view, sir. 
    My view is that the title effectively passed by the power of sale which is a foreclosure sale but a different procedure for it than a foreclosure suit and that therefore no further foreclosure is necessary but all that is now necessary is a decree quieting the title and the purchaser.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1583.143" stopTime="1599.592">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if that is to be regarded as a foreclosure of the mortgage, then they would have the same problem we have in the prior case namely you noticed that the Government and it's present in the procedure, what other proceeding may be?
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="1599.592" stopTime="1636.915">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Well you have the same problem to those extents Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    If you read that 2410 as providing only one procedure instead of two alternative procedures, then obviously we would have to comply with all of the conditions that set forth in 2410 with respect to a foreclosure suit. 
    But it is our view that if that were the interpretation, the 1942 amendment would be utterly meaningless. 
    There would have been no point in putting it in because if you go through all that complicated foreclosure proceeding you have clear title anyhow and there is -- but with no quiet-title action is needed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1636.915" stopTime="1673.078">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, but you have to get in to the -- the protection to the Government which was sought to be accomplished I don't know what it is by the -- for the foreclosure of the mortgage, the consideration which require the Government's earliest participation in any aspect of the proceeding which is a foreclosure of a mortgage would be equally applicable to whatever the proceedings maybe, to whatever steps there may be to what eventually is a quiet quieting the title proceeding. 
    In other --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In order words -- in order words, a state provision for the change of property interest can't make a difference so far as the protection of the Government is concerned in being in, in the proceeding from the very beginning, whatever the nature of the proceeding maybe?
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="1696.751" stopTime="1705.718">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Well it seems to me sir that it may make a difference if the Congress has specifically said that it does make a difference and it seems to me that that is the effect of the 1942 amendment.

    “To a quiet title or.”

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No I'm not suggesting that you have to go through the same old procedure, but I am suggesting that the Government might have to be a participant in the alternative procedure in each of them --

    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Oh, oh well then to that extent Your Honor, I -- I would agree with you that the Government is entitled to be a participant in the alternative procedures to be -- the same -- same extent as any other junior lienholder entitled to be and I've outlined the various --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1739.077" stopTime="1766.579">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May -- maybe not. 
    It was the same as any other junior title -- junior lienholder, maybe not and there maybe a different view of the Government. 
    In other words if the Government is out of it, the State has large powers of cutting off interest or deeming it unnecessary to give even notice of the cutting of interest if the consideration that satisfied you cut through if you cut them off as to caps later --

    But the question is -- the question is whether the State has the same power with reference to -- if junior lienholder, who is the lienholder, decided you are a lienholder that is held in against the Government in the -- in light of that statute depending upon its construction of course.

    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    I would make this observation on -- on that comment by Your Honor. 
    If the Government knew that -- the Federal Government has adequate power through the Congress to protect its tax -- its tax liens. 
    The sole purpose of putting in this procedure for quieting title was a recognition by the Federal Congress that this was an alternative means which would provide adequate protection for the Government and I think I have indicated by the various proceedings which are available that there is more than adequate means of protection for the Government.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well if that's it -- might it not be construed as required -- if notice was required for you to extinguish the lien whether you do it by attempted foreclosure or by an action to quiet title?

    I confess I haven't been able to get from the legislative history that the -- you find that in that part.

    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    May I just call Your Honors' attention again to the italicized language on page 10 in Attorney General Jackson's letter which requested this amendment. 
    In which he referred to other instances in which mortgagees have foreclosed on property and have failed to join the United States. 
    It appeared --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1888.250" stopTime="1893.830">

    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    That would be the only purpose sir of joining.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why does it -- I -- I don't quite get why you have to -- go, quite go that far in inference. 
    Why did they give opportunity here to bring a suit against the Government if not in order that there might be someway the Government can get notice whatever title proceeding there was.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="1923.372" stopTime="1960.111">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Now the only rationalization of course -- I -- I have to speculate about this because this is all the records shows Your Honor, the only rationalization I can give you is that it was a matter of common knowledge that this simple inexpensive procedures for quieting of title by a prior lienholders are available in many states of the United States and a feeling that -- this procedure should be recognized by the Federal Government that it had adequate means to protect itself in these procedures and that it would be advantaged by the adoption of a simple procedure as well as what others subsequent liensholders.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You are -- you're inferring from the fact that the Congress saw fit to give the right to sue the Government, make them a party of this case, means that Congress intended to leave open to this day the procedures whereby they could extinguish the lien without or at least on that company, without notice.

    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    I see my time is running short. 
    I think we can charge any help that -- just clarify the situation. 
    As I see we have four successive -- five postures here. 
    In the first situation the taxpayer holds unencumbered legal title to his (Inaudible). 
    Then the taxpayer borrows money from the bank and executes a (Inaudible) which is duly recorded. 
    This creates situation number two which the trustee under the deed of trust holds legal title and a power of sale. 
    The taxpayer has a right to reacquire if he pays his obligation when due, but that right is subject to dissolution by the trustee if exercised of the power sale. 
    Then we have situation number three, this being chronologically indicated in which the Government acquires a tax lien on the taxpayer's right to reacquire but no lien on the legal title if the taxpayer does not default. 
    But if the taxpayer defaults on his deed of trust obligation, the trustee (Inaudible) his legal title then you have the contract right to do under a state law and this preempts our fourth and final situation in which the buyer of the deed of trust sale has unencumbered legal title to the real-estate, the taxpayer's right to reacquire had expired by the term and no property right exists to which the Government lien can attach. 
    And then to summarize the whole thing in a few words as I can put it in, in the first place the taxpayer is entitled to a house. 
    Then the trustees they're entitled to a house for the benefit of the bank. 
    The taxpayer has the right to reacquire. 
    The Government acquires a lien on the taxpayer's right to reaquire but the Government has no liens against the trustee or the bank. 
    If the taxpayer defaults, the trustee sells, the bank buys the trustee's title, the taxpayer's right to reacquire dissolves, is gone forever, and the Government lien remains firmly attached in that.

   Argument of Daniel M. Friedman
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2745.651" stopTime="2746.702">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Friedman.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="2746.702" stopTime="2900.767">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    At the outset I would like to advert to a question which the Chief Justice asked yesterday and which was reiterated today which is the extent to which Section 2410 has been used in situations where the Government claims a lien on the property. 
    And I've gotten some statistics together, they -- I cannot vouch completely for their accuracy, they're obtaining in a hurry, but I think they will demonstrate quite clearly that the general practice appears to be to use Section 2410 in situations where in fact the Government does claim a lien or an interest upon property. 
    Now the cases are broken down into two categories because of the fact that 2410 is not limited to tax liens. 
    It also covers other Government liens and the tax lien figures are available from the tax division and the other lien figures from the other divisions and they're both civil divisions. 
    They're broken down some what. 
    Now in the fiscal year 1959, our statistics show that the Government was named as a defendant in proceedings under Section 2410 in tax cases, in 2939 cases. 
    In other words there are almost 3,000 cases during the last fiscal year in which in one form or another a suit was brought against the Government under Section 2410 either for foreclosure of a mortgage or to quiet title in which the Government claimed a tax lien against the property and a number of those cases has been ascending back in 19 fiscal, 1956 was 1808. 
    Now I also have some figures from the civil division. 
    Of course as I indicated in the civil division cases, they entail not only tax liens but a wide variety of other Government liens and those figures show that during fiscal year 1958, there were 737 cases in which the United States was named as a party defendant in a proceeding under Section 2410 either to quiet title, or their foreclosure and mortgage. 
    Now the majority of those cases were cases which were determined in the state courts. 
    I want to emphasize this that these proceedings do not flood the federal courts because the United States has the right to removal and then the majority of cases, the right to removal is not exercised.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2900.767" stopTime="2903.875">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well do you have the figure showing how many have been removed?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="2903.875" stopTime="2905.647">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No I'm afraid I don't have that Mr. --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2905.647" stopTime="2907.137">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Can you give us any idea of the percentage?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="2907.137" stopTime="2949.565">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    I don't, except to say that's a very small percentage, I will endeavor to obtain those figures. 
    I'm not sure if they are available. 
    So that we think this indicates clearly the large number of this cases -- one -- one further figure that -- in the civil field, the non-tax field, since this statute was first passed in 1931, I have a slight breakdown as to some judicial districts. 
    For example Mr. Justice Brennan, in the District of New Jersey, in the civil field there have been 2758 cases in which suits were brought against the United States.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2949.565" stopTime="2951.517">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And those should be in the New Jersey State Court?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="2951.517" stopTime="2981.214">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Those would be in the New Jersey State Court. 
    There may have been a few that were tried initially in the District Court. 
    The vast majority have been in the state courts. 
    And we think this wide-spread practice indicates quite clearly the understanding both by now is that the bar and by the real-estate community that if there is a situation where the Government has a tax lien on the property or claims a tax lien, the procedure generally followed is to proceed under 2410.

    As a matter of curiosity --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2985.035" stopTime="3000.461">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well I don't follow that at all because -- that is I don't follow your conclusion at all because this very suit was brought under 2410 in a suit of quiet title and the Government was given notice and yet you opposed this all the way, this is what your -- there's no community of understanding here.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3000.461" stopTime="3056.927">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well we -- we have previously below (Inaudible) but we now do not question the right of the bank to maintain the quiet title acts and we do not question if this is an appropriate way for the bank to have determined whether or not the Government's lien was extinguished from this property as a result to the state court proceedings. 
    Our position is basically, and if we think this is what the Court of Appeals held here that the bank's title was not quieted. 
    The bank couldn't quiet its title because the theory on which the bank filed was a complaint, why that the previous state nonjudicial sale had the effect of wiping out the Government's lien on this property. 
    That was the theory and they came in and said, “Quiet the title because the Government's lien is out” and as we understand and it's our position, the Court of Appeals said, "No your title is not quiet because the Government's lien is has not been wiped out."
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3056.927" stopTime="3086.985">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you would have taken the same position if the state Court -- if the court had found that -- that under California law this was a good action to the quiet title and title was quieted, wouldn't you? 
    Suppose -- suppose there had been a controlling state court decision, Mr. Stewart says there is, and suppose the federal court had followed the state court's decision, you would have taken that you would still be here, wouldn't you?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3086.985" stopTime="3095.550">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes we would Mr. Justice because we don't think that the State even though it may quiet title with respect to private entities and quiet title as to the Government.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3095.550" stopTime="3110.689">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Those are the facts that a particular decision says the title wasn't quieted. 
    It doesn't deal with the problem. 
    There may be other reasons why state courts are interpreting the state law, you may not allow an action for quiet title.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3110.689" stopTime="3111.569">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes, but I would --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3111.569" stopTime="3117.123">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But the real grievance is the one that you've stated back. 
    It couldn't quiet title.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That's precisely --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3118.079" stopTime="3127.064">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And so when it comes into the Court to quiet title that is merely to formalize something as to which you have no say

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Precisely.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3128.075" stopTime="3128.978">

speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3128.978" stopTime="3141.574">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That -- that is our position that the -- the proceedings which were followed in the California -- under the California law, the sale of the property under the deed of trust --

    Lock the barn door, and (Inaudible) rest of the horses, though.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3143.664" stopTime="3162.862">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That's precisely, and therefore, while they can maintain this action to have ascertained whether or not the Government lien had been wiped out the fact is that the Government lien had not been wiped because California cannot through those procedures eliminate the federal lien.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3162.862" stopTime="3170.702">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You don't differ with Mr. Stewart, do ask to what the California law is with respect to private junior lienholders?

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No, but we -- we do differ with -- with respect to Mr. Stewart on one point which is on this question of notice. 
    We don't think that the state can say to the federal government, if -- if you want to protect your lien you have to come in and file a notice in the state court. 
    And indeed the federal statute was recent, was specifically amended to make it clear that the most that the federal state court could do would be to provide under section 2410 the place where a lien maybe filed in order that the state could not impose conditions but not state what information is required to be included in the lien that the Government filed.

    Yes to the statute, Section 6323 of the code which provides that in the event it has not been recorded, it's not valid as against mortgagees, pledgees, purchasers and judgment credit.

speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3408.626" stopTime="3439.245">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    The American Bar Association urged that legislation should be passed to permit the elimination of these federal liens. 
    But it was always in the context of eliminating a federal lien that was worthless. 
    The very quotation from Attorney General Jackson that has been read to this Court, spoke in terms of eliminating worthless liens. 
    This means the situation where the Government has a lien but for one reason or other the lien is not worth anything.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3439.245" stopTime="3441.337">

speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3447.449" stopTime="3511.146">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well it maybe more than dollars and cents. 
    It may be that the tax is no longer collectible. 
    The period of the tax has been voided. 
    There are variety of situations but the critical case in all of those situations is that it was unfair that the people having the real interest in the property that even though the Government's lien was valued there was no way they could get rid of it. 
    It was a cloud on title would hang over the property, they couldn't sell it. 
    Now this is a different situation. 
    This is not a situation were the lien is worthless in the sense of a tax can't be collected. 
    This is a situation in which the claim is that the lien has been wiped out, it has been wiped out because of the state proceeding and in that situation, we don't think they can come in and say, "Quiet our title, quiet our title merely because we've going through this previous state proceeding." 
    It seems to us the quiet title action is a method for testing the effect of the state sale but it is not a means of itself wiping out the lien.

    Correct.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3759.646" stopTime="3770.217">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    And that means that the bank though it's foreclosed at the first lien and that as a matter of fact, assumed and bound itself to pay the second one, is that right?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3770.217" stopTime="3807.616">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That is correct Mr. Justice because at the time of the foreclosure the interest which the bank had has already with the bank received was already encumbered by this federal lien, junior admittedly to the bank claim, but nonetheless a valid lien. 
    And that I'd like to repeat what I said yesterday emphasizing this situation, all we're contending for is that we want an opportunity to protect our rights so that if -- if in fact this property is worth more than the amount of the mortgage we will have the right to apply the excess to our lien.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3807.616" stopTime="3824.655">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    But don't you realize that what that means is that the bank's act in foreclosing is admittedly first mortgaged is simply to release it so far as the Government's tax lien is concerned, wouldn't it be?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3824.655" stopTime="3826.656">

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    If what is the first lien by foreclosure of it makes the second tax lien of the government a first one, the effect is to satisfy the bank's first lien, isn't it?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3839.959" stopTime="3847.538">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes, the bank's first lien would be satisfied, but that would not eliminate, we don't think the federal lien on the property.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3847.538" stopTime="3851.832">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Where did the bank get for its first lien which is foreclosed in this way?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3851.832" stopTime="3902.810">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    But it would get whatever the property is worth over the first or second lien in the -- in the same way that in any situation I think if there is a first lien which is foreclosed and it's subject to a prior lien. 
    In other words as far as the bank is concerned what it received at the time of this foreclosure, it took subject to the Government's lien because the State while it may create the interest in the bank when it creates the junior lien and it says how they can be eliminated, we don't think the State has the power to say that a federal lien created by an act of Congress can be eliminated from real property merely because you follow certain state procedure. 
    In other words Congress has decided the way in which federal liens maybe released from real property.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Let's do some figures. 
    Suppose the bank had loaned $25,000.00 and the government junior lien was for $5,000.00. 
    They've gone through this proceeding and the property has never been worth more than $15,000.00. 
    Do I now understand you to say that because the bank's gone through this, it now has a first lien on the property which means that the bank collect -- or the government collects its $5,000.00 out of the property?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3935.133" stopTime="3941.266">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Oh no if there -- if there were another foreclosure and the property is worth only $15,000.00 that would wipe our lien out.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    And furthermore, if the property were worth only $15,000.00 and owes the $25,000.00 debt, I'd feel certain that in that situation there would be an administrative relief.

    Not -- not in this case either. 
    If this case now goes back, if you prevail and this goes back but as you said this bank's title encumbered with the Government's lien nevertheless accept as the property would you bring more than the bank's original loan with the expense and everything else without it -- the Government gets nothing.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    On the other hand you mustn't -- you mustn't belittle their claim because they don't lose anything. 
    The point is that they have certain interest which they think they have acquired under state law on which they stand and the right to the property is also -- maybe allowed by state law and that maybe a right which is what they are asserting here.

    Surely.

    It has nothing to do with your claim.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No I -- I -- all I was suggesting is that there is no -- in -- unfairness to the bank.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that's it. 
    This all depends what their rights were on -- what their rights were when (Inaudible)
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="4464.632" stopTime="4484.716">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    I was going to suggest there is no unfairness to the bank in holding that the federal lien is not eliminated by exercise of the power of sale since the bank -- since the United States cannot realize any of the proceeds until the bank's prior claim has been paid in full.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4484.716" stopTime="4511.809">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I suppose that practically speaking from the Government standpoint or any other there are many instances in which foreclosure sails ahead rather just bring totally and completely inadequate amount and that if it's sold for what they were worth they would pay off the mortgage and pay off the other liens and you are claiming that the federal statute provides that you should be given notice in order to protect your right that you may have.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="4511.809" stopTime="4515.122">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes in any of the -- any access over and above the value.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4515.122" stopTime="4526.527">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Could I ask you a question at this point? 
    Supposing the conclusion has come to the federal statutes do not prohibit what was done here, what is your position at that point?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="4526.527" stopTime="4530.037">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    You mean that the federal statute permits --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4530.037" stopTime="4556.430">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    That this federal statute does not make this as an exclusive procedure which is the basis of your argument. 
    Have you got a constitutional first to your argument then that if the state law governs and if the state law purports to take away the Government's lien hereby extinguish them and then whatever words you want to call it, that -- that violates due process or --
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="4556.430" stopTime="4557.706">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No, we are not making a constitution --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4557.706" stopTime="4558.610">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    You are not making a constitutional argument.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="4558.610" stopTime="4599.784">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No, because if -- if this Court concludes that Congress determined that the validity to continued existence of federal liens is to be determined by state court procedures that's the end of our position. 
    And indeed Mr. Justice I want to repeat once again that Congress specifically so decided in one provision of 2410 where it said, that in the event there is a judicial sale, a foreclosure at a judicial sale then the effect of all liens will be determined as they are under local law, but for that to happen there must be a -- the United States must be made a party to a foreclosure suit and there must be a judicial foreclosure.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4599.784" stopTime="4611.023">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    So your -- your whole position as it stands on the – stems from your argument that the federal statutes are the exclusive means of destroying a Government lien.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Its -- it's exclusiveness in the sense that Congress has determined the procedures for the discharge of federal liens and has not permitted the States by the exercise of their own procedures affecting State interest also to wipe out federal --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4641.570" stopTime="4650.230">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I could sense that answer of yours and not answer your problem at all because you have to go on to the next step what is it that Congress has provided?

    What Congress has provided --

    Because how big your argument -- I know what it is. 
    All I'm saying is you're speaking -- maybe answered yes I believe by Mr. Stewart and come out just the opposite.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="4661.688" stopTime="4663.588">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well I think the -- the answer in the following --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4663.588" stopTime="4682.805">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In other words it means that the question of what 2410 means and what it is saying is it's quite within the statute is whether to choose to quiet title etcetera, etcetera and you say that a suit to quiet title can -- can start with the answer which Congress only to have answered by the litigation.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="4682.805" stopTime="4697.286">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    The suit if I may suggest Mr. Justice, the suit to quiet title cannot prevail because the title isn't quieted that the Congress had said that you cannot use these state procedures to eliminate the federal lien.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4697.286" stopTime="4706.940">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

    I gather and may I use the example I did yesterday the foreclosure of the suit so you've got my own state policy to know what I'm really familiar with I gather is in a New Jersey foreclosure procedure the government is given notice and is made a party in circumstances like this.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    They may well be and I think that for that -- that as I've indicated the statistics show that this is a usual form in which that is done. 
    That's right, that the -- the prior lienholder cannot hope to eliminate the federal lien merely by going through the state procedure.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well this bank for example could not under this kind of contract arrangement any longer protect its rights under the trust deed by the existing procedures for that it would have to bring the -- a litigation either in the California court or in the federal court to accomplish it, would they not?

speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="5114.764" stopTime="5157.797">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well that it could too, the one thing the bank could do is to bring a proceeding under 7424, which will be to have a validity of the Government's lien determined or on this proceeding I suppose, although the Court granted summary judgment, they might go back to the District Court and ask the District Court itself in accordance with alternative prayer for relief to decree a sale of the property, sale under the authorization of the Marshal. 
    Now if at that sale, if at that sale the property brings no more than the amount of their debt we're out. 
    We have no claim to anything more.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5157.797" stopTime="5168.587">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Or should the federal court go through a procedure -- same procedure between the central and local authorities even though the Government has an interest.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="5168.587" stopTime="5173.910">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5173.910" stopTime="5194.895">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But did it -- alright --
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="5194.895" stopTime="5318.380">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Now I just like to very briefly in closing point out that what we had here was the trust deed conveyed title to the trustee, but the California courts have said that this is a security title that's all they said and it's -- as a case it was developed in California. 
    Now the courts have treated it as a practical matter a mortgage and a deed of trust is very similar and what we really had here analytically I think is what we had yesterday in the Brosnan case that is, the indebtedness was created and in order to secure the payment of this indebtedness the debtor, the mortgagor gave to the mortgagee or the trustee or the beneficiary the power to apply the property, to sell the property and to apply the proceeds to the proceeds towards the discharge of his indebtedness, but they're attached to this property prior to the time of sale, this federal lien and this attached basically to the mortgagor or the taxpayer's interest in the property. 
    And under well established principles once the lien attaches to property when the property is sold and transferred it passes with the lien unless the act of sale itself operates to discharge the lien from the property. 
    As I've indicated we think it is clear that Congress has said that except when you -- or comply with the strict requirements of 2410, the State nonjudicial sales to which the United States is a party do not operate to eliminate and wipe out the federal liens on this real property and we therefore believe the judgment should be affirmed. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Samuel B. Stewart
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5318.380" stopTime="5320.517">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Stewart.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="5320.517" stopTime="5481.733">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Mr. Chief Justice I thank you for the additional five minutes. 
    I should like to direct your attention to one reference which it seems to me demonstrates the utter inconsistency of the Government's position here and then I'll devote the rest of the five minutes to an effort to answer some of the questions that that were asked of my friend on the other side. 
    The reference is to a revenue ruling which is quoted on page 6 of the petitioner's main brief which is rather short and it seems to me feels directly with the question involved here. 
    It says, "Federal tax liens attach to property only to the extent of the delinquent taxpayer's interest therein where a taxpayer has only an option to purchase real estate" and this deals with an option now but it seems to me closely analogous to our situation here, “where the taxpayer has only an option to purchase real property at the time the federal tax lien arises, the lien attaches to the option, that is, to the interest of the taxpayer not to the real estate. 
    Where his rights under the option are terminable the Government's right by virtue of its lien upon the taxpayer's interest, are likewise terminable, being no greater than those of the taxpayer.” 
    Accordingly, when the taxpayer's rights under an option terminate after the federal tax lien has arisen the rights of the United States in the option also terminates since there is no longer any property in the option to which a lien may attach. 
    It seems to me sir you can apply that word for word, syllable for syllable to the situation here, the Government's lien attaches to the taxpayer's interest, a defeasible interest, something less than a total, free, and unencumbered fee title of the property and when that title is gone so is the Government's tax lien gone with it. 
    And now to go to the question that was asked of Mr. Friedman I believe by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, what could you do before 1924? 
    You couldn't do anything except buy the Government off because there was no procedure that was authorized. 
    Then came 2410, originally in a form, that authorized only a foreclosure suit. 
    Then we could get rid of them if we wanted to go three years, through three years of trouble and expense to do it. 
    Then came the amendment in 1942 to 2410 which if Your Honors agree with my contention here has simplified the procedure which was the only excuse for having that amendment, to permit another method not this complicated three-year proceeding but a simple method of going through the simple procedure recognized by most of the States. 
    Yes sir?

    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Well 2410 is the same thing sir. 
    All 2410 does is prescribe certain standards of state foreclosure proceedings. 
    In other words, your state foreclosure proceeding must meet these tests of notice, right to redeem, and all the other things that that --

    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    I can't tell you why sir except that it does, that this is our experience. 
    It has been a two years minimum, three years more normal.

    No sir it's the -- it's the -- well this is part of it, yes sir court congestion plus the year of right of redemption on the end of it.

    Of course we have no right to go to the federal court.

    No I know you have to -- to move.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="5548.956" stopTime="5555.201">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    We have to start on the state court. 
    It is only when the -- when the Government removes us to the federal court that we get into the federal court.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5555.201" stopTime="5572.018">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why did you say you have to foreclose the statute which specifically authorizes you to file a bill to quiet title? 
    You don't have to wait until you have sold it without notice. 
    You can file a bill to quiet title and give -- give a notice to the Government and test out its lien.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="5572.018" stopTime="5572.164">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    But if you'll get --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5572.164" stopTime="5595.287">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And if you're saying that they didn't have any remedy and then they give them a remedy to foreclose then they gave them foreclose, but they had to have the title (Inaudible) then they give him a remedy by quieting title and now you say that despite those things although they never had any before you can take the third remedy and let the state foreclose without notice, under the state law. 
    That's the same --
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="5595.287" stopTime="5616.934">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    No Mr. Justice Black I -- I have to think I've not made my self clear, let me try. 
    The remedy to quiet title is not a procedure for settling liens and for determining who has what rights one against another. 
    It is a proceeding for determining what has been done heretofore.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5616.934" stopTime="5642.664">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why isn't that they have given you here in this statute where you did have a right to proceed by foreclosing, if they wanted to add to that so that you'd have another remedy, it's a federally created remedy to quiet title that this is in fact attacking this lien. 
    I -- I've had those kind of cases. 
    I don't see why you say that's not a legitimate kind of a lawsuit.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="5642.664" stopTime="5691.149">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    Well, Mr. Justice Black perhaps -- perhaps I'm wrong, perhaps -- perhaps the Court can straighten me off, but my interpretation of that is this that the approval of a quiet title procedure was necessarily an approval of quiet title procedure which exists under state law. 
    This is the only procedure to which we have access. 
    We could not get jurisdiction in the federal court on the ground that this involved a federal statute or -- or suit against the Government. 
    We have to sue in the state court we have a quiet title procedure in the State as most States do and our quiet title procedure in the State of California is a procedure to determine that title should be quieted because no rights exist. 
    Now, this we have followed --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What about 7024?
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="5695.800" stopTime="5732.782">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    This again sir is -- is a -- a different proceeding. 
    It is not a proceeding to quiet title. 
    It's -- it's a -- an equally complex proceeding with the foreclosure procedure. 
    The -- you see the issue here is not one of whether we could do something else. 
    We could do several other things. 
    The issue here is whether the Congress by adopting this amendment intended to expedite proceedings, intended to make it possible to follow a simple remedy that save the cumbersomeness and the expense and do things in the way that business is ordinarily transacted in spite of the fact that the Government is a party. 
    That's -- that's our purpose.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5732.782" stopTime="5756.127">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    As I read -- as l read the statute your issues here I thought (Inaudible) a very simple one as Mr. Justice Franckfruter suggests that this statute to provide that the Government liens are not be destroyed without making it a party, it means some kind of litigation. 
    It is not the only issue under the construction of the statute and maybe you're right.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="5756.127" stopTime="5756.288">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    If it is --

    I'm -- I'm not saying if you're not right.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="5758.621" stopTime="5766.103">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    I -- I think sir that that is the issue except there's a question of interpretation on what kind of litigation. 
    Now we say the kind we brought here --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5766.103" stopTime="5766.352">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well the --

    -- is the only kind that will --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5768.312" stopTime="5773.291">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You say the kind of litigation that doesn't require notice to the Government to make them a party.
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="5773.291" stopTime="5775.249">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    But not the quiet title, sir. 
    The quiet title --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I'm not -- I'm talking about the -- the -- if the statute means that the Government's lien shall not be destroyed without making it a party, then you have violated the statute, haven't you?
speaker="samuel_b_stewart" startTime="5787.519" stopTime="5788.492">
    Mr. Samuel B. Stewart 
    That's right sir.
