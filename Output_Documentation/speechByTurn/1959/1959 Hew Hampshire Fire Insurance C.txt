speaker="jack_hart" startTime="14.320" stopTime="394.898">
    Mr. Jack Hart 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case comes here by way of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    The question presented involves the construction of a statute. 
    The statute is a short one, consisting of five lines and is printed on page one of petitioner's brief. 
    It's Section 2463 of the Judicial Code which reads as follows, “All property taken or detained under any revenue law of the United States shall not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the law and subject only to the orders and decrees of the Courts of the United States having jurisdiction thereof." 
    The question presented is whether under that statute, statute the District Courts had jurisdiction in a summary proceeding instituted by petitioner in order to show cause to determine the claim of a non-taxpayer that his property has been seized and satisfied the tax obligation of a nun. 
    The District Court for the Southern District of New York, expressly declining to follow the Third Circuit, held that the District Courts had no such jurisdiction and dismissed the petition. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in one sentence upon the opinion below. 
    In this Court, the respondent suggests that the case might be remanded to the Southern District without prejudice to the petitioners requesting that the Court treat the petition as a complaint and that the action then proceed in accordance for the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures. 
    That suggestion of course is no concession at all because in the current posture of this case, the major issue is whether we are required to proceed in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but whether we have a right would obtain the article quarters of the Court with respect to the time for answer, the time for pretrial proceedings, the time for trial. 
    The facts in the instant case maybe briefly stated. 
    The petitioner, New Hampshire Fire Insurance Company, among other things, is engaged in the business of issuing surety bonds. 
    In 1956, the petitioner issued a surety bond on behalf of a contractor, Acme Cassa Incorporated which had entered into a contract of the City of New York for the construction of a playground. 
    During the course of the work which involved a contract to delinquent taxpayer of $356,000, Acme Cassa became financially unable to continue with the work. 
    The City of New York as obligee, thereupon called upon the petitioner here to complete the work and pay the unpaid bills of Acme Cassa. 
    This, the petitioner did. 
    In the meantime, Acme Cassa had become a delinquent taxpayer and the United States filed notices of tax levies with the City of New York. 
    There came a time then when the City of New York had available for payment some $68,000 and this money was in the form of a warrant to the order of this petitioner. 
    At that time, the petitioner had expanded some $83,000 in completing the work and in paying unpaid bills. 
    The Government had a tax lien in the amount of some $35,000. 
    In New York State, the law is the very well established than in these circumstances. 
    The surety is obligated to the position of the obligee, in this case the city, and that therefore, the money is payable directly to the surety and accordingly the Government's tax lien, which applied only to the property of the anointed taxpayer has no applicability of law at all. 
    Plainly, we don't deal with the question of priority because the property never goes to Acme Cassa, the delinquent taxpayer. 
    In the District Court, the judge said that we were required to bring a plenary procedure. 
    Nobody has said against to whom we are supposed to bring a plenary proceeding and it is submitted to this Court that we are not dealing with the ordinary types of case where you have a plaintiff and defendant. 
    The party difficult to pinpoint in this case is the defendant. 
    The history of the statute, its express language, its evident purpose all make it clear that this property when improperly seized by a person who happens to be a tax collector, but who of course is merely an individual tortfeasor when he seizes the property of a non-taxpayer. 
    That tax as we say very clearly put the property in the custody of the Court subject to the orders and decrees of that Court. 
    And for that reason, what we are engaged in doing here is making an application to the Court to return the property.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I ask Mr. Hart, as of what date in reference to the filing of the federal tax lien did the surety as you put it, definitely (Inaudible) of the contract?
speaker="jack_hart" startTime="407.100" stopTime="450.208">
    Mr. Jack Hart 
    The surety came in I think after the filing of the tax lien. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan, I would say that the -- in our view, the date of the filing of the Government's tax lien is of no significance. 
    It is of no significance because we are not concerned to the question of priority. 
    The contention is and the law in New York is so well established as not to be in doubt that in these circumstances, the delinquent taxpayer never gets the property right to any of the contract balances and the money goes directly from the City of New York to the surety. 
    We therefore don't fight for money which belongs to the delinquent taxpayer in any sense.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="450.208" stopTime="467.208">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, if the -- if that time of the filing of the federal tax liens that you had not yet stepped in use of a contract, to whom did the city at the time of the filing of tax liens owed them?
speaker="jack_hart" startTime="467.208" stopTime="512.020">
    Mr. Jack Hart 
    Well, if there are no money would be loaned. 
    We are talking here about progress payments of the -- in the usual way. 
    There will be a lump sum contract price with prohibitions or payments during the progress of the work as per requisitions made by the contractor in accordance with the terms of a contract. 
    If he fails to perform, then obviously he would not be entitled to get paid. 
    Essentially, that would be the reasoning behind which -- on the basis of which came the conclusion that the surety becomes subrogated to the position of the owner cutting out the contractor altogether. 
    He had no right to get the money because he failed to perform.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="512.020" stopTime="516.809">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, did (Inaudible) also arise after the filing of the tax liens?
speaker="jack_hart" startTime="516.809" stopTime="556.726">
    Mr. Jack Hart 
    In this case, I believe it did. 
    I repeat that the -- the term of the filing I think everybody would recognize, in this case had recognized would be insignificant. 
    The -- there has been no issue raised about the merits of this controversy. 
    Nobody has been required to take a position about the right of the surety, but the law in New York is so well established that I don't think anybody would raise any question about the law being what I have stated it would be and namely the very reason that subrogated for the position of the owner.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="556.726" stopTime="567.656">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, then you mean this case comes to us, virtually you and the Government and the other side in agreement that the property did belong to the surety at the time that --
speaker="jack_hart" startTime="567.656" stopTime="604.512">
    Mr. Jack Hart 
    Yes, well, the -- the surety thing subrogated for the position of the owner and its right of subrogation depending on whether it has in fact expanded the money. 
    There are perhaps in some cases whether the city under the circumstances would have had the right to whip all the money from the contractor, and then there's no doubt about that when the contractor has failed to perform. 
    There could be questions of fact. 
    For example, if the surety had expended only $20,000 and the amount payable was $40,000, its right to subrogation would extend to the extent of $20,000 and not 40.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="604.512" stopTime="606.061">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, is there right such issue here?

    Mr. Jack Hart 
    No, sir.

speaker="jack_hart" startTime="659.749" stopTime="682.378">
    Mr. Jack Hart 
    Well, I must say with respect to that that the respondent has not been required to take a position in the posture of this case as to whether it concedes, he concedes or denies that the money belong to the surety because he had attacked the jurisdiction of the Court and has not been required to respond to the factual allegations of the petitioner.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Isn't that really the point that the questions, the issues that the subjects of Mr. Justice Brennan's questions have not yet been reached, is it, and then you don't know if there any -- if there --
speaker="jack_hart" startTime="692.824" stopTime="1013.111">
    Mr. Jack Hart 
    It's actually so, Mr. Justice Stewart, yes. 
    We've been dismissed. 
    Now, 2463 has an interesting history which I can briefly allude to. 
    It was first passed in 1833 in response to South Carolina Ordinance of Nullification. 
    The South Carolina didn't like the Tariff Act which had been passed and -- passed some state laws, Duty of Tariff Act is -- Tariff Act fact should not apply in South Carolina. 
    Congress then passed a rather lengthy statute making numerous provisions to deal with that situation in South Carolina and 2463 and almost the exact words it has today was incorporated in that statute. 
    Many of the sections of that statute and we think on this point as perhaps with some moneys, the respondent in its brief has begged the question here referred to what would be the case if tax collector acting properly under the Tariff Act did what he did. 
    We think it's plain that 2463 the section with which we are here dealing must be read by including after the second word back in the statute the additional word improper. 
    Section 2463 specifically deals only with cases where a person who happens to be a District Director seizes or detains the property of a non-taxpayer justifying his conduct on the ground that he is a District Director, but the revenues laws do not apply to non-taxpayers and we are dealing here I might say in all of you with the case we would have if the district director so seized the automobile of Mr. A to satisfy the tax obligations of Mr. B and we are dealing now with the question of who gets possession of the automobile when this dispute arises and whatever has been decided and what are the rights of Mr. A with respect to retrieving his property? 
    It seems evident from that point of view that the District Director is not defending that in the case because unless we had 2463, we have difficulty in saying on what basis we could get him into a federal court. 
    Normally, there would be no diversity present and there was not in present case. 
    And since the charge against him is merely that he is an individual tortfeasee, the case against him, whatever it happened to be, would not arise under any federal law. 
    Further, it seems clear that the District Director does not claim that the property is his. 
    That's the very last thing he would claim and it seems perfectly plain that he would not even in his personal capacity contend that he had a right to the possession of the property. 
    For example, suppose that in this case which has now been pending a year, Mr. Scanlon had resigned from his office as District Director. 
    What would have happened to the automobile? 
    Certainly, he would have not kept it. 
    Now South Carolina, in 1833, provided that way a property was seized by federal officials, the federal officials would be guilty of a crime under South Carolina law and in reacting to that, Congress passed statute protecting its revenue and prevent -- protecting its officials by providing there questions which arose should be tried in the federal courts. 
    That was where the seizures were made under the Revenue order. 
    2463 deals with the case of what happens with property seized when there is no authority for seizing. 
    Where do you put it? 
    It seems evident and we'd have no question, I say in all humility, whether if all we did was read the language at 2463, it says clearly, “That property is to be deemed to be in the custody of the law.” 
    It seems to be plainly that place to put. 
    Now, if that is so, then we don't have a cause of action where a plaintiff and defendant proceeding under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but to accept the suggestion made by the respondent's brief, we are in fact applying to the Court. 
    They say we are really making a motion rather than proceeding by petition and we have no objection to that. 
    If an application to a court is a motion that is what we are doing. 
    We are applying through the Court which has the custody of this property to return it to us.

    Mr. Jack Hart 
    -- by taking it – I am sorry, sir. 
    Taking it as being ambiguous and looking for its meaning, the property would have to be in some place. 
    We insist here that we are not dealing with a Director of Internal Revenue or a tax collector or with the United States. 
    If we have as an adversary either the United States or a collector of Internal Revenue, then we have conceded we must loose. 
    Our entire case is based on the contention that being an non taxpayer, we do not come within the coverage of the tax laws and that therefore, if somebody takes my property and I'm non taxpayer, it is interesting what should move from his -- first thing into my house in the middle of the night burglarizing the same and then defending on the ground that he also happens to be a District Director. 
    We don't have that problem because District Director is an honest man and proceeds with honest intentions.

    Mr. Jack Hart 
    The Court does not get jurisdiction over the person of the defendant by our filing a petition. 
    Due process requires simply be notified just as it requires in this case the City of New York and the contractor to be notified. 
    And in one of the interested parties, quite take a different position on the substance of our complaint. 
    But as a non-taxpayer, if we are right and if this posture of the case, the allegations of our petition must assumed to be, right, then it is our property which has been seized without any warrant, without any judicial sanction which normally would permit us to bring the tortfeasor who happens to be a District Director into a state court. 
    As a matter of fact, there wouldn't seem to be any basis for suing him in a federal court. 
    It doesn't seem to be a basis for the federal jurisdiction to sue a tortfeasor who happens to be the District Director but who has not acted as an agent of the United States.

    Mr. Jack Hart

    I don't understand.
speaker="jack_hart" startTime="1273.133" stopTime="1638.510">
    Mr. Jack Hart 
    Well, if I may take your very illustration, suppose that Mr. Scanlon the District Director in this case having seized our property then resigned, and was no longer the District Director, who would be the defendant in our suit. 
    Whom do we sue? 
    We have no issue with the Untied States of America because we now know there are many taxes and they don't claim that we are delinquent taxpayer. 
    We therefore have no issue with the District Director because to the extent that he is the District Director, he is acting within the scope of his authority. 
    If he is, and then we would concede that this proceeding could not be sustained. 
    We don't have a lawsuit against anybody, but dealing with the situation reflected in the statute passed for the protection of the United States in order to balance out or on the one hand, the extraordinary power of the tax authorities to collect administratively and the right of a decree non taxpayer to get his property back, this statute says in such a case we'll put the property into the custody of the law. 
    Any privilege that the Court has and say you have now cut this property because the statute puts it there and we ask you to return it to us. 
    Who is entitled to notice then? 
    Those people who the due process tells us who are entitled the notice. 
    In this case, the District Director, the City of New York and the contractor, nobody else could seem to have any -- the District Director as a fact of the matter of cause appears by the attorneys for the United States America because if he in fact was a District Director or to put it in other way, if indeed he was acting within the authority of the tax laws, then of course the property goes to the United States of America. 
    But if he was not so doing, then the United States has no interest in this proceeding, the District Director is not involved and an individual will happens to be a District Director is given notice because he is the one who purported to act under the authority of a Revenue Law. 
    The point we submit is made clearer by considering what we have been relegated to do. 
    We are told to institute a plenary proceeding. 
    We don't know what the kind of judgment the Court – courts entered since we take it a verdict that Mr. Scanlon in this case would not claim that the custody of this property is in him except as a custodian for the Court. 
    The respondent suggests that custody of the law, Mr. Justice Whittaker means that the custody of the collector is being protected against process from other courts. 
    Protected to be sure as long as he is the custodian for the District Court where the property is located. 
    For example, suppose that the District Director was concededly a dishonest person, and suppose then that he had seized negotiable securities depending -- warning to non taxpayer and suppose then that he were directed to turn them over by the District Court but said no Section 2463 says that my custody has been protected. 
    Undoubtedly, the Court does not have physical custody of the property, but we think that it has constructive custody of the property. 
    We say squarely that from the 2463, we do indeed make a motion to the Court in whose custody the property was placed to return it and to return it in summary fashion, meaning by that at the time limitation is set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures do not apply. 
    And frankly, we are at great difficulty to understand why the Government which is the real party and interest on the other side should have the slightest detection to this. 
    We deal with the question of power and not of discretion. 
    If coming-in in this motion procedure, it is a term that the Government needs time to ascertain the facts to present its own no position, on our theory and on what we submit here there is noting to prevent the District Judge from saying in my discretion, I (Inaudible) that this, the respondent shall have 20 days in which no answer or two months in which to conduct these oral depositions. 
    There's nothing to prevent that, but if the money belongs to the treasury, then one would think, it ought to be covered in (Inaudible) and that the Government should be happy to have the opportunity to accomplish that. 
    If not, then as often happens, delays occur which sometimes result in a denial of justice.

    Well, the District Director has a pretty powerful weapon in being able to proceed administratively to seize property. 
    He is entitled to have it, but it is fraught with these and if he seizes property which a citizen claims was improperly seized because I am not a taxpayer, then it hardly seem to depend --

   Argument of Richard M. Roberts
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1856.206" stopTime="1857.730">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Roberts.
speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="1857.730" stopTime="2213.997">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    This case is essentially a case presenting the question of a procedure to be followed where a District Director has allegedly seized property (Inaudible) to a non taxpayer, that is non taxpayer foreign to the assessment that he is trying to collect. 
    Rule one of Federal Rules of Civil Procedures provides that these rules govern the procedure in the United States District Courts in all suits of a civil nature where the cognizance is always cases at law or in equity with the exception stated in Rule 81. 
    As I understand it, there's no allegation here that the exceptions of Rule 81 are applicable. 
    Rule 2 provides that there shall be one form of action to be known as a civil action. 
    Now, if a party believes that the civil action that he has brought is too slow to give him an adequate remedy, he has other proceedings under the rules that he may take. 
    He may under rule 65 of the same injunctive relief that the case should more consider that facts that were presented to the Court warrant and show that relief. 
    If he feels that there's honestly no issue of fact as the petitioner feels here, then after the expiration of 20 days from the filing of his compliant, he may move for summary judgment. 
    Now, as the Court well knows, prior to the formulation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures, the procedures that were followed in the District Court were to say the least un-uniform. 
    A litigant might be thrown out because he did not complied with certain rules of procedure adopted in that particular State in which the District Court happens to be sitting. 
    Now, we submit that there's no reason to favor under the rules a person in the position of this petition who is in effect getting his day in the Court advanced over another litigant who is claiming possibly in a conversion case that someone has this money illegal and by making that litigant take his normal day in the Court by allowing this litigant come in and move ahead by a show cause order is disrupting what we feel to be the purpose of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which was to provide a uniform procedure of the Federal District Courts. 
    Now, Section 2463 is almost a verbatim reenactment of the parts of Section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1833 which as petitioner's counsel pointed out was an Act to -- to get around the nullification ordinance that South Carolina had enacted. 
    Now petitioner's counsel would have the Court read into the provisions of that Section as well as the Section as it now stands properly -- property illegally seized. 
    I don't believe there's any warrant reading into the present -- the predecessor for the present statute that turns the very purpose of the Act of 1883 or 1833, rather of 1833, was to retain in the District Director custody of property that he had legally seized for duties that were attachable to property being imported into the United States. 
    The State of South Carolina by its nullification ordinance, a decree that such duties were illegal, yes, but they were not illegal and they were legally seized properties that were seized to pay those duties. 
    The State of South Carolina didn't like that and it passed this nullification ordinance which would allow certain acts to be done. 
    One, it allowed for replugging to be applicable. 
    It would take the possession of his property that had been seized by the collector out of his hands. 
    It made him subject to a penalty of twice the value of whatever property he had taken. 
    Now, we submit that there's no reason to read into that section, the phrase that he now requests to be read in there that it only applicable to the property that was illegally seized. 
    We feel that it is applicable to all property. 
    Now, even though this property by that section is made subject to the orders of the District Court and decrees to the District Court, it provided that the property shall be very irreparable. 
    Now, the writ of replevin would only test possessions. 
    It wouldn't test owner -- ownership to property, but now instead of the writ of replevin being applicable, petitioner would have you hold that you can go in on a summary proceeding and determine title to property whereas Congress had said the District Courts could not entertain a writ of replevin.

    No, I do not mean that, Your Honor. 
    I mean that it's not in the custody of the Court for this reason. 
    If it were, then the District Director could do nothing with that property without going to the Court and getting a court order where he had legally seized the property. 
    If this section puts it in the custody of the Court, then he cannot take that property and apply it to the taxpayer's taxes or sell it in the pry of the closed proceeds to the taxpayer's taxes because if it's in the custody of the Court by the very nature of the term, the Court is the only power that can dispose of that property and deal with that property.

    Well then your answer means that if the -- if property were in the custody of the Court and that restricted and technical and intelligible sense, then the Court couldn't make summary disposition.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Roberts, is there some particular reason why the Government's is insistent on a plenary suit --
speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="2940.148" stopTime="3053.375">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    Your Honor, yes. 
    While we admit for the purposes of this argument that the New York law is well settled, that the property that is being levied upon or at least that the city says we've levied upon is the property of this taxpayer. 
    We also want to get the facts of just what like when did the breach of the contract occur? 
    What payments were there made before or after the filing the notice of leave? 
    Now, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure recognized that when you're dealing with the Government that the Government does not and cannot act as fast as the normal litigant. 
    The federal rules gives the Government 60 days to answer whereas the normal litigant gets 20 and I'd like to point out that this defendant here would get 60 days rather than 20 days to act because a provision of the Rules of Civil Procedure makes -- one of the rules makes a district director, former district director a officer of the Court within the term of that phrase in the rules giving the not also court of the -- also the United States within the rules giving that person 60 days to answer. 
    It also recognizes upon appeal. 
    The Government has 60 days to know note appeal whereas the time could try litigants was less. 
    We say we are entitled to the time that the rules give us in the case of this sort. 
    To get the facts together, if a summary proceeding could be handled on 24 hours notice, there would be no rules applicable whatsoever.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3053.375" stopTime="3064.755">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Richard M. Roberts

    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    You could at his discretion but if I understand the petitioner's position is, he doesn't have to make any of them applicable and that he can disregard the Rules of Civil Procedure in a case like this.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Roberts, I'm not quite clear as to what time of the lawsuit you suggest the petitioner should bring. 
    This is -- this is the time of the suit that you -- that I understand that's been (Inaudible). 
    This isn't an injunction against the sale of property would be appropriate here at all, would it, of the properties.
speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="3134.745" stopTime="3190.886">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    The injunct -- is not against the sale. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    But injunction suits have been issued to border the return of money. 
    Now as to the appropriate proceeding that he should bring, the different courts vary on what they recognize. 
    The Ninth Circuit has recognized that you could bring a 2410 proceeding in this type instance, in the case you've just had whether claiming the lead. 
    Almost in fact went barely before a levy has served, a notice of lien is filed so that the Government would be claiming the liens. 
    The Ninth Circuit has also upheld the use of a civil proceeding against the District Director for a money judgment in the tight situation where the money has been paid over already covered into the treasury.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3190.886" stopTime="3198.854">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, the fact here is, the money -- not money but the obligation has not yet been paid by the City of New York, anyway. 
    That's -- that --
speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="3198.854" stopTime="3200.334">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts

    Actually the collector has nothing except a notice of lien filed with the City of New York, I guess.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, I gather that you -- that you would conclude that if this suit had been brought, if a suit had been brought in (Inaudible) with the Rules of Civil Procedure then a motion for summary judgment might be entertained.
speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="3286.412" stopTime="3309.746">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    If he feels there is no issue of fact as he does from his statement of New York law that he is entitled to this money he could file a motion for summary judgment. 
    But then 20 days after the commencement of his action although bit inconsistent, the rules are there giving a 60 days answer with allowing motion for summary judgment within 20 days but he could do it.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3309.746" stopTime="3321.460">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But why if the Government came in with the kind of story you've just given us is the reason you want under the summary judgment section itself, there is authority in the Court to allow the recovery even.

speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="3337.696" stopTime="3341.058">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    That is correct. 
    And I think we're entitled to find out whether there are facts and --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3341.058" stopTime="3368.746">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I suggest you could do that under the provision dealing with summary judgment now. 
    It would get very far if you were to make a kind of representation to the trial judge that you make us but you've got to find out what the respected dates are on the lien that was filed in relation to when the surety stepped in the shoes, the contact and all those things. 
    There is a provision on the summary judgment procedures I understand it, the discovery and those kind of things.
speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="3368.746" stopTime="3387.812">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    That is correct. 
    We would be entitled to this discovery there too. 
    But if I understand correctly, the District Court would have the discretion even in the summary proceedings to allow us discovery, but it will only be discretion with the District Court. 
    Now, I would like to point out --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3387.812" stopTime="3403.349">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just before we leave this, I'm little (Inaudible) but I don't quite understand the kind of action that you're suggesting the petitioner should have brought. 
    Am I right in thinking that the declaratory judgment action would not be available here if it involves taxation, is that correct?
speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="3403.349" stopTime="3404.127">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    Would not be, yes.

    Would not be available. 
    What would -- what kind of an injunction here -- who are you trying to enjoin? 
    This -- this man doesn't have any money, the defendant, the collector, does he?
speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="3413.994" stopTime="3472.686">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    No, they are mandatory injunctions, they lift the notice of levy. 
    If that's proper, I would be alarmed about it as to what we have done here actually. 
    The notice of levy doesn't ask that the property of the New Hampshire Fire Insurance Company be paid to the United States. 
    The notice of levy is a simple piece of paper. 
    It sets out the name of the taxpayer the amount of taxes that are owed and the cause of tension to the party who is served upon the fund and we're demanding from them all property of the taxpayer and any rights to property that the taxpayer may have. 
    It was the conservativeness of the City of New York that caused the petitioner here not to get his money. 
    It wasn't really the action of the District Director in filing the notice of levy.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3472.686" stopTime="3475.820">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You can't blame the City of New York.
speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="3475.820" stopTime="3476.086">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    Well, of course.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3476.086" stopTime="3482.504">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible) the same fund. 
    No -- no suggestion on the part of the city I take it to bring little (Inaudible)
speaker="richard_m_roberts" startTime="3482.504" stopTime="3531.191">
    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    They could do that and our procedure is to move to dismiss because there has been no grant of jurisdiction, no waiver of sovereign immunity can intervene in a case in which the District Director feels that there is any title or property of the taxpayer involved. 
    Now here from the opinion of Judge Cashing in the record, there is more money owed to this taxpayer than the petitioner claims. 
    So the levy is valid. 
    That's one reason why we don't -- would not want the levy quashed. 
    The levy is valid to a certain amount, to whatever the city has, it belongs to this taxpayer, our notice of levy is valid.

    Mr. Richard M. Roberts 
    We say it's an ancillary and dependent matter, Your Honor and that it held by the Third Circuit in Raffaele that this section gave the District Courts jurisdiction to summarily determine rights of the property that the courts inconsistently in the cases cited, has consistently found that the action was a dependent action, it wasn't a independent action. 
    It was an auxiliary and dependent action for the return of property. 
    And it wasn't until the Third Circuit in Raffaele saying that -- they said any court said should the Court could summarily determine property rights and rights to property under this section of the code.
