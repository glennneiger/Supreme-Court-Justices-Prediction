Flemming v. Nestor
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="0.000" stopTime="218.525">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    This case involves no issue of fact -- fraction but only a naked question of constitutional law. 
    The issue is simply whether Congress has power to cut off aliens' Social Security benefits when they are deported on the basis of membership in the Communist Party. 
    The case comes here on direct appeal from the District Court for the District of Columbia which held that Mr. Nestor's Social Security rights had become vested and could not be terminated. 
    Although this Court postponed the question of jurisdiction until argument, the appeal appears to fall squarely within the word and the spirit of the jurisdictional statute which authorizes direct appeals from a District Court decision holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in a case in which the United States is a party. 
    The only apparent question on jurisdiction is whether or not the suit below should have been before a three-judge court rather than below -- before a single judge. 
    But this suit was instituted by Mr. Nestor pursuant to the specific provisions of the Social Security Act which provides a remedy for review of administrative decisions by a District Court and makes no provision for a three-judge court in that case. 
    The three-judge court provision of course comes into effect when someone attempts to enjoin the operation or execution of an Act of Congress. 
    It does not control where the action is under a specific review provision such as this and where there is no injunction against the operation of the Security Act -- Social Security Act involved. 
    Therefore, it seems clear to us that the District Court is a single judge, did have jurisdiction. 
    And since his action was specifically based upon unconstitutionality of an Act of Congress, this Court in turn appears to have jurisdiction. 
    Ephram Nestor came to this country from Bulgaria as a young man in 1913.For some reason, he never was naturalized. 
    But in 1933, he joined the Communist Party and he remained a member of that party at least until 1939. 
    On the basis of this Communist Party membership -- preceding this were commenced against him in 1953 to deport him to Bulgaria which was the country from which he had come. 
    And he was, in fact, deported in July of 1956. 
    Meanwhile, he had qualified for Social Security benefits and in fact, for several months had received Social Security benefits amounting to $55.60 a month.

    That was between 1953 and 1956 that he qualified for the benefits?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="223.059" stopTime="243.130">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, he actually qualified as of November of 1955 and the first -- it was the -- the order came in 1956 just before he was deported. 
    So he received the payments for November of 1955, December and end of 1956 until he was deported. 
    As a specific --

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    He -- he has started an employment which was subject to social security in about 1936, I believe, it was early. 
    He was -- he was a painter by profession and some of his earlier employment came soon after the Act was enacted. 
    As was specifically provided by a 1954 amendment to the immigration law, the Attorney General notified the Social Security Administration when Nestor was deported. 
    And this is also specifically required by the law. 
    The payments for Social Security payments were then terminated. 
    Neither of these actions is subject to discretion. 
    It's automatically under the statutes that when a man is deported for this reason that his payment should -- shall be terminated. 
    Mr. Nestor appealed the termination of his -- of his -- of these benefits. 
    He was granted a hearing before a referee in the Social Security Administration. 
    The -- the decision was upheld by the referee and after having exhausted his administrative remedies, he then went to the District Court and asked for review of this decision. 
    And as I mentioned, the District Court held that the statutory provision cutting off the benefits was unconstitutional and it is from that out -- the Government has appealed directly to this Court.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, I don't -- we don't know the number -- the years that he actually was a member but presumably not. 
    At least no -- there's no basis of illegality, no allegation of illegality back in 1936. 
    We don't have any termination date on -- on his membership. 
    He was a member at least until 1939 and as of that date, there would be no change in the laws. 
    The basic questions are, first, whether Congress has the power to reduce or eliminate benefits once stranded. 
    And the second question, if so, were the cutting off benefits to deported aliens under these circumstances is a proper exercise of that power.

    Does the statute provide for any refunds to him of what he's paid in?

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    No, there is no refund given and -- in -- in this connection. 
    I address myself first to the question of whether -- generally, without regard to the specific grounds for termination whether generally, Congress has the power to reduce or eliminate payments once they've been included in an act and once taxes have been paid under the Act. 
    Now, Congress in so many words has provided that it retains the power to amend or appeal any provision of the Act. 
    And in fact, the provisions of the Act have been repeatedly amended since it was first passed in 1935.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="525.499" stopTime="527.906">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Where is that in the brief?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="527.906" stopTime="681.345">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That's at page 92 and 93 of my brief that begins with the paragraph numbered 4 at the very bottom of page 92. 
    It's a short section, the right to alter, amend or appeal any provision of this Act of Congress. 
    Most of the amendments to be sure have been amendments to increase payments, increase benefits under the Social Security Act. 
    But in -- as an incident of this, there have been many cases where -- as to individuals, their benefits have been reduced or eliminated because of readjustments in the Act. 
    And in the lower courts wherever this has been litigated, the power to change the Act has been -- has been upheld. 
    And indeed it seems essential that Congress should have this power since otherwise the -- the Act would be frozen in its original form from the way it was passed. 
    And Congress certainly never had had intended any such result. 
    The only reason that there's any -- any question about it is that this is a contributory system and the individual pays -- has made contributions before the changes. 
    And it's in -- it's important in this respect to know that these contributions are specifically in the nature of taxes. 
    The -- they have made as a part of the tax law and the payments which a man receives are not in any manner conditioned upon his having paid taxes and his having paid taxes in no way gives him a right to -- by itself, to qualify for payments under the system. 
    In other words, the system is financed through a -- through taxing the -- the labor force for the idea that they will support the Social Security System as a whole. 
    But there is no direct relationship in the law between the taxes which any individual pay -- pays and the benefits which he receives. 
    Congress purposely tied the -- the financing of the program onto taxes of the labor force because they wanted it felt that Social Security benefits were not charity, that they were not in the nature of -- of relief that labor was paying for its own -- its -- its own way in this thing.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="681.345" stopTime="685.758">

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, not -- not -- there -- there is a trust fund that covers the whole Social Security System but there is no fund for an individual.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Not before this. 
    Since this Act -- since this section has been passed, there have been two other sections which deal with -- generally, with cutting off groups. 
    One of them is with respect to aliens who voluntarily go abroad and stay for more than six months. 
    And if they haven't been in this country for 10 years, then their rights are cut off. 
    And the second section provides for cutting off the Social Security benefits of individuals who are convicted of espionage, sabotage in -- in the Smith Act cases. 
    Those are the specific --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1481.776" stopTime="1482.986">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Three. 
    There are three --

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Those are the --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1483.350" stopTime="1484.138">

    -- sections.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1484.138" stopTime="1597.581">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    -- present provisions in the Act. 
    The -- these last two haven't been passed upon by -- by the support applied. 
    There have, however, been -- as I say, been incidence where other adjustments in the Act have resulted in individuals losing their rights. 
    Let me give you an example. 
    For a long time, self-insure -- self-employed people were not subject to the tax and their self-employment wasn't counted in, in determining whether they were retired. 
    It's the so-called “work test”. 
    And in order to qualify for payments, why, you have to be retired. 
    But when -- when self-employment wasn't covered, you could be retired and -- and practice law, for example, on your own. 
    Then the law was changed to bring self-employed people within the scope of the Act. 
    And as a result, some people who had had benefits and at -- from employment and had retired and then supplementing that with their own income, were now -- were now cut off from their benefits because they were self-employed and these earnings were now considered as -- as part of the -- the work test. 
    This was -- this was litigated and the Court -- and never got beyond the District Court but the District Court held that this was an appropriate amendment by -- by Congress and that rights could be cut off in this nature, in this manner. 
    I may say there's been some experience too with the state retirement systems and there is a case, Pennie against Reis, an -- an old case, 132 United States in which it was held that -- I think that was the California retirement systems holding that they could cut off benefits even though they had once been received within general statutory power to amend.

    It's long been recognized that if an alien comes here and does not undertake the duties of citizenship that he remains a guest here and that he doesn't have the full rights, privileges of -- of citizens.

    Well, if that's the reason though, Mr. Davis, namely, that Americans, resident home earning -- they're living here and paying these taxes if that's what they are, whatnot have to pay them to contribute to support someone abroad. 
    Why doesn't -- why would they exclude the four classes they have to exclude as deportees?

    Well, there's -- there are many people abroad who are entitled to -- to receive Social Security benefits and it's -- that is a much broader statement than -- than Congress is -- it's gone much -- your -- your statement of -- it is much -- gone much further in Congress so far has gone. 
    They -- I think it's a matter of congressional policy of how far they go. 
    In 1939, there were some part of Social Security benefits, shouldn't be paid to aliens at all. 
    Social Security should be only for -- for the citizens.

    But that was abandoned and aliens have until 1946 been treated as anybody else whether they -- and residents abroad has had nothing to do with the -- with the payments until this amendment in 1954. 
    And it seems to me that Congress cannot be said to have -- enacting unreasonably or -- or punitively when they determined that when a man is actually found to be an unfit person to live in this country and he's told that he must go back home, that nevertheless, he's going to be sort of a remittance man and he's going to receive his -- his check from the United States Government for himself so that he can live abroad in -- in the style of which he has become accustomed here.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    No.

    I'm suggesting that even though this is a privilege and can be given or withheld that the Government may not do this for a non sensible, for a -- arbitrary reasons. 
    Maybe, I can draw a comparison between this privilege and the privilege of employment.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, due -- it's -- it'd be lack of due process if you are arbitrary, if you are arbitrary and unreasonable. 
    It might be lack of due process if you're arbitrary and unreasonable in giving Social Security benefits to -- well, suppose that you should give them to -- to everybody except red-headed, take them away from all red-headed men of all people have gone on odd days of the months -- month. 
    This is arbitrary and unreasonable and unreasonable and -- and might be considered, therefore, to be lack of due process because if you're going to give citizens -- if you're going to give people rights, you should do it on a -- on a basis of equality and not pick and choose on an arbitrary basis. 
    I think an argument could be made that there's no constitutional reason why you shouldn't give the privileges to whom you want to and take them away from whomever you want to.

    Well, at least specifically under the statute, there isn't any money that he has gotten. 
    This is to be distinguished, for example, from the several service retirement system where there is also a provision for forfeitures in certain cases. 
    And in that case, it isn't a tax or -- or at least a man builds up a credit to his account while he's working for the Government. 
    And on that case, if they take it away, the -- his money is -- is given back to him, if it's forfeited for the reasons that the statute provides for profit.

    They give him a certificate of qualification or something at that time showing how much he is entitled to on the basis of his -- of their records of his employment, the number of quarters and the -- and the amount he's been paid as wages.

    It seems to me not difficult more -- not different from this situation. 
    If the Social Security System should say, “Self-employed people who are gamblers keep very bad records and we are having a great deal of difficulty finding out what the Social Security benefits of gamblers shall be.” 
    And therefore, we're going to change our law and we're going to say that gamblers get no Social Security benefits. 
    Anyone who's -- who's self-employed income comes from gambling.

    The Government agrees, and it's basically our position that if this statute is anyway a penalty and if it doesn't constitute a reasonable regulation of Social Security rights within the ambit of the Social Security program, then the statute is unconstitutional.

    The Government, however, is not here given any further explanation for the passage of the statute by Congress at all. 
    As a matter of fact, the only explanation it has given is only consistent with punishment. 
    It is said, and Mr. Davis said that the only thing he could believe the statute would have is the view of Congress that certain people being deported were unfit and therefore should not receive benefits. 
    Now, to my view, that would clearly indicate that Congress thought that these people should be punished because they were unfit. 
    But we need not rely simply on Mr. Davis' statement. 
    I think it would be helpful to see exactly what it was that Congress did here.

speaker="david_rein" startTime="3881.707" stopTime="4050.924">
    Mr. David Rein 
    -- the cases and I don't think Lynch applies. 
    But Section 202 (n) was enacted in 1954. 
    It grew out of the bill which was H.R. 9366 which was reported to the 83rd Congress by the House Ways and Means Committee. 
    That particular bill had three provisions which I think are relevant here. 
    One provision attempted to do something along the lines, which Mr. Davis has indicated here, might be reasonable. 
    That is -- or keep benefits away from aliens who are not within the United States. 
    That was a bill which would deny benefits, not to the primary beneficiaries themselves, not to the workers themselves, but to certain dependents or survivors of beneficiaries who reside outside the United States if they do not meet certain residence requirements. 
    Now, in proposing that bill, Congress said, and this was not Congress but the House which proposed that bill. 
    Under a heading in its report, and we set forth and quoted at page 19 to 20, “Under present law, old-age insurance benefits had been paid to an insured worker regardless of his country of residence. 
    Benefits are also payable to otherwise eligible dependents and survivors of insured individuals regardless of country of residence even though such dependents and survivors may never have lived in the United States and may have had no personal contact with the insured worker over a long period of years other than receiving contributions to their support.” 
    And then the Committee went on to say, “Your Committee believes that the insured person himself, who has earned his right to benefits on the basis of his work in American Industry and his contribution to the national economy should be able to have those benefits regardless of his place of residence.” 
    In other words, the only suggestion made here that I have heard, and Mr. Davis didn't make it as strong as the Government did in his brief, was that 202 (n) was part of a policy of Congress to deprive aliens, nonresident in this country, of benefits. 
    And yet here, we find the same Congress, House which proposed 202 (n) saying that it never had such intention. 
    And as a matter of fact, any such provision would be unwise and unjust.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Where are you reading from now?
speaker="david_rein" startTime="4052.733" stopTime="4537.493">
    Mr. David Rein 
    I was reading from my brief 19 to 20, quoting from House Report Number 1698, which accompany or the bill, H.R. 9366, which became -- later became the 202 (n). 
    The same bill, however, contain a provision which later became 202 (n). 
    And in discussing that provision, Congress did not put it under a heading, “Payment of benefits to persons residing abroad.” 
    On the contrary, they discussed it in its report under a heading “Termination of benefits on deportation.” 
    And, and I'm reading now from page 21 as to what the House said with regard to that, the House said that the bill provides that all benefits payable on the earnings record of an individual who was deported from the United States because of illegal entry, conviction of a crime or subversive activity shall be terminated. 
    Termination of the benefit would be effective upon receipt of a notice from the Attorney General that the individual is under notice of deportation. 
    Now, when this bill got to the Senate, the Senate rejected this provision and also another provision which contained a penalty provision by denying benefits for earnings for aliens who might have been in the country unlawfully. 
    The Senate rejected all three of those provisions but it, like the House, considered only the first provision, the one that will take away benefits from dependents and survivors abroad to have anything to do with the policy of making payments to people who are out of the country. 
    And it said with regard to that in the Senate Report and it's quoted at page 22, “That the House approved bill would have prohibited the payment of dependents and survivors' benefits to individuals residing outside the United States unless such individuals met certain requirements as to prior residence in the United States or a less special insured status requirements were met by the worker on whose records the benefits are payable. 
    Your Committee does not believe the place of residence of the dependents or survivors of an insured worker should result in their losing protection to which they are otherwise entitled as a result of contributions paid by the insured worker.” 
    That was the Senate's view with regard to the question of paying benefits to people abroad and outside the country. 
    Turning to this provision, which later became 202 (n), the Senate said, “The House approved bill would have required that no monthly benefits be paid on the basis of wages and self-employment income of an individual who has been deported for specified causes. 
    Your Committee has not had an opportunity to give sufficient study to all the possible implications of this provision which involves termination of benefit rights under the contributory program of Old-age &amp; Survivors Insurance and has therefore deleted this provision from the bill. 
    Now, I think these conclusions appear from this short sketch of the legislative history, and I'll -- our finding, I should say, that in conference, the House receded with regard to the provision depriving dependents and survivors abroad of benefits. 
    The Senate receded in their objection to the provision which later became 202 (n). 
    Though with certain modifications, the provision in the house bill was then passed. 
    Now, I think that these conclusions appear from this short sketch. 
    In the first place, Section 202 (n) was not considered by either House of Congress to be -- have any bearing with regard to a congressional policy of withholding the payment of benefits to aliens residing abroad. 
    On the contrary, the House Committee that first suggested 202 (n) explicitly stated that it rejected such a policy. 
    The Senate rejected even a partial application of such a policy. 
    The House agreed and we have no such policy at all adopted in this provision. 
    Both Houses, however, considered that Section 202 (n) were penal in character, and they said so in so many words because -- and Mr. Davis has had a great deal of difficultly distinguishing perhaps between the four provisions of the deportation statute which were omitted from those who were deprived benefits and those provisions which were included. 
    But the House made its distinction. 
    We don't have to go any further. 
    It said that -- the House of the Senate said that, “Benefits are terminated of -- for those individuals who have been deported for unlawful entry, conviction of a crime or subversive activities.” 
    They thought that that group included all those and clearly, these have moral connotations and the distinction was made on the basis of congressional view of moral guilt. 
    Now, as a matter of fact, the original defendant in this case, Secretary Folsom, the predecessor of the -- for the present defendant, also considered this provision to be a penalty in so many words. 
    He was asked to testify with respect to a subsequent provision, which, I think, Mr. Davis has mentioned which was being considered by Congress in 1955 which would make a penalty of deprivation of Social Security benefits, an additional penalty to be added on to criminal penalties to those who are punished under the Smith Act and other crimes which Congress considered in that category. 
    Testifying on that provision, Secretary Folsom opposing the provision, and he opposed it on this ground. 
    He says, “Because the deprivation of benefits, as provided in the amendment, is in the nature of a penalty and based on the considerations foreign to the objectives and provisions of the old-age and survivors insurance program, the amendment may well serve as a precedent for extension of similar provisions to other public programs and to other crimes.” 
    And then he went on to say, “The present law recognizes only three narrowly limited exceptions to the basic principle, the benefits are paid without regard to the attitudes, opinions, behavior or personal characteristics of the individual.” 
    And he included in those three narrowly limited exceptions this provision 202 (n) which Congress had passed. 
    The other two he mentioned which he said considered to be of a light category, were not a statute of Congress but a regulation of the Social Security Administration itself which denied dependents benefit payments to any individual who have been found guilty of the felonious homicide of the insured worker. 
    And also said other provisions are not of the Social Security Act but of Title 5, that is the provision giving government employee pensions, the so-called Act which was passed -- the Act so-called Hiss Act which was passed by Congress relating to government employees, denying pensions to government employees who, among other things, have pleaded their privilege against self-incrimination. 
    A portion of the statute which was held unconstitutional in the Court of Claims was not taken to this Court.

    Mr. David Rein 
    He did not appear and testified at that time with respect to it, no. 
    But he described it as a penalty in his testimony a few years later. 
    Now, the Government in arguing that the statute here is not a penalty, in arguing in its brief, makes the point that it's not the question and some emphasis has been made here by Mr. Davis that the point is that the alien is no longer in the United States. 
    He's abroad, and why should we make payments to him while he's abroad? 
    However, the important thing is that if this same alien had left the country, had gone abroad on his own volition, exactly where he was, he would receive Social Security benefits under the present law. 
    So the factor here is not that he's abroad but the factor is that he has been deported. 
    That is the significant difference.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4694.660" stopTime="4703.252">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Would there be, Mr. Rein, a limitation on the period of his receipt of such social security if he had voluntarily departed?
speaker="david_rein" startTime="4703.252" stopTime="4703.946">
    Mr. David Rein 
    None at all.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4703.946" stopTime="4705.207">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    No period of limitation.
speaker="david_rein" startTime="4705.207" stopTime="5055.615">
    Mr. David Rein 
    No period, he would retain it forever. 
    There is -- was a subsequent statute which was passed in 1956 which has never been construed by any court, which did take away benefits from certain aliens who departed -- left the country and been away for more than six months. 
    But only to those aliens who had not been in the United States with an aggregate of 10 years in the first place, or who did not have full coverage under the Social Security Act. 
    In other words, there is a present provision which is 202 (t) which does take away benefits from certain aliens. 
    The particular petitioner here would not fall on that category because he had been in the United States for more than 10 years and he had the necessary coverage under the Social Security Act. 
    So -- and for this category of people, such as the aliens, the significant factor is deportation. 
    And the law -- and under the laws that presently stands, if he were abroad, under -- on his own volition without deportation, he would continue to draw Social Security benefits until his death. 
    So, we argue, therefore, from this that there isn't any policy here of keeping the money in the country and not sending it abroad because Congress has enacted such a policy. 
    And in fact, the money would be sent abroad to aliens in the same category as the petitioner here except for the fact of deportation. 
    I think too, and the Government concedes that -- that the statute would be invalid if the deprivation of benefits were based upon or the fact of antecedent factors and the Governments were criminal or other socially undesirable conduct because the Government concedes that under the same scheme of Social Security or the conduct of an individual and his behavior in the language, which was used by Secretary Folsom in testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, has no legitimate bearing upon receipt of benefits. 
    Yet, under 202 (n), one cannot escape the conclusion that that is precisely -- are the basis upon which benefits are being deprived to certain class of deportees. 
    I have already quoted to the Court the language used by the House and the Senate Committee. 
    Illegal that the -- of -- deprivation of benefits are based upon deportation where the deportation is in turn based upon illegal entry, conviction of a crime or subversive activity. 
    Now, the Government in its original opposition that its original jurisdictional statement which was filed in this Court at -- when it was first looking at the statute, I believe, without the problems being presented as to how it could defend it, didn't have the difficulty Mr. Davis had here of distinguishing between the different characteristics of deportation. 
    And I think and I like to quote from the provision of the jurisdictional statement because I think it's obvious. 
    And the Government there suggested that the four excluded provisions do not fall into that category. 
    That is the category of unlawful entry, conviction of a crime or subversive activity and may have been excluded because Congress thought they did not involve serious derelictions. 
    I think that it is perfectly clear both from the language of the reports of the Senate and the House in describing the position and also on the basis of analysis of the provisions themselves that the distinction Congress was making between certain grounds for deportation and certain other grounds of deportation were distinctions relating to moral conduct, and ideas which have definitely, a punitive aspect. 
    In that sense, the Section clearly specifies or offenses for which a person is then being guilty and for which retribution is exacted. 
    I think one must clearly look at 202 (n) and one cannot without it in any other way. 
    And it sets forth the certain categories or grounds for deportation listed in the Immigration Nationality Act. 
    And it says that, “Individuals who have been found guilty not by any criminal case but in an administrative proceeding of those offenses for which they are deported, they shall then suffer the penalty and the punishment of being deprived of their Social Security benefits.” 
    I think finally, we must consider the statute to be a penalty and punitive in character under the analysis which was made by this Court in the Trop case. 
    That whenever a statute comes before this Court, and it -- and it has consequences which appear to deprive one of a privilege or ceratin other benefits, and then if the Court cannot find any legitimate legislative purpose for that deprivation of benefits, the only conclusion that the Court can come to is that -- or the statute is being imposed as a penalty and his punishment. 
    And in the language of the Trop case, the Court there said that that statute was punishment because there is no other legitimate purpose the statute can search.

    Do you think --
speaker="david_rein" startTime="5141.759" stopTime="5241.794">
    Mr. David Rein 
    I think that that would have to be analyzed. 
    It certainly is not consistent with the general purposes of the Social Security program which is being administered here without regard to -- no one who is in the United States gets deprived or accepted as other statute, gets deprived of Social Security for conviction of crime. 
    Once you get to the point, the way you were taking away a privilege and you were doing it in a form where it involves an imposition of punishment, which, I think, you must say, that this statute does and I think that Your Honor's statute would do because again, to say that you take away something from somebody because of his conduct, you are saying that you are punishing him. 
    I can't see any other way around, unless one would say that there is certain -- the only distinction would be, you might say that a person and the distinction which have been made in the case of his -- that he might not be entitled to hold certain public office, let us say, because of that because he is not fit for that. 
    But you can't say he's not fit to receive money. 
    We don't have any sense of -- his conduct incapacitated him from acquiring some function or job so it must be considered punishment. 
    And if it is punishment, we need go no further in this case as to whether it's a desirable punishment or a policy punishment because if it is punishment, it cannot be inflicted without a judicial trial. 
    I think that's the -- the main constitutional problem we have in this case. 
    And in that respect, this case is no different than the Wong Wing case which --

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well, I did not contest that and perhaps I'd better put it this way. 
    I think the question of whether or not, as it's sometimes discussed in cases of this kind, as to whether or not this is a vested right or a gratuity is not a worthwhile issue to get into. 
    I think he has a right which the Government concedes and we both concede that his right is sufficiently valuable that it cannot be taken away from him in violation of certain other constitutional provisions.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="5301.666" stopTime="5318.769">

    Mr. David Rein 
    It has no -- well, there are two grounds, I would say, with that. 
    It has no rational relationship to the general purposes of Social Security. 
    And this particular statute was not passed although it's labeled an amendment to the Social Security Act. 
    It was not passed within the framework of Social Security legislation. 
    It was passed for an entirely different reason for the purposes of punishment. 
    And therefore, we get into certain other factors. 
    Just as, for example, Congress also laid in to get an amendment to the Social Security Act, there's another provision saying people convicted of certain crimes can, in addition to getting a prison sentence, be deprived of their Social Security benefits.

    In other words -- first place, I don't say Congress has the power to make this particular change but the fact that Congress may take away certain benefits. 
    For example, Congress may punish, that is true, provided it does it in the constitutional fashion. 
    Of course, Congress may punish if that's what it intends to do. 
    Congress may also take away benefits if it is done --

    Mr. David Rein

    Now, I don't think it matters if you're going to say that it's a right, it's a privilege. 
    I think that it's a semantic use of language that advances us not at all because I know that Congress took away from this man his $60 a month which he was getting. 
    Now, I don't want to concede that by saying that it is not a vested right in a sense that by conceding that he did not have a formal contract with Congress, which could not be amended that, therefore, when Congress took away the $60 a month, they did not take something away from him. 
    They took away $60 a month. 
    There's any question about that. 
    And I think that that's substantial enough in interest, if I may put it that way, substantial enough in interest to bring into play these constitutional questions that follow from the imposition of a penalty.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well, if I may submit to Your Honor, the case that I think is controlling on this statute is the case of Wong Wing against the United States. 
    That is the case in which a statute passed by Congress provided that an alien -- an alien who is being deported on the ground of having been illegally here as a Chinese could, prior to deportation, be imprisoned on the ground of having been unlawful resident in the United States. 
    The whole process was done administratively. 
    This case came up after the case of Fong Yue Ting in which the Court had sustained the portion of the statute providing for the deportation of the alien by the administrative process. 
    But the Court said that the added feature of the Wong Wing statute that is the imprisonment of the alien made it unconstitutional. 
    And the Court there said, I think it will be useful to quote, page 35 to 36, it's quoted in my brief. 
    “We regard it as settled by our previous decisions that the United States can, as a matter of public policy by congressional enactment, forbid aliens or classes of aliens from coming within their borders and expel aliens or classes of aliens from their territory. 
    And can in order to make effectual such decree of exclusion or expulsion to devolve the power and duty of identifying and arresting the persons included in such decree and causing their deportation upon executive or subordinate officials. 
    But when Congress sees fit to further promote such a policy by subjecting the persons of such aliens to infamous punishment of hard labor or by confiscating their property, we think such legislation to be valid. 
    It must provide for a judicial trial to establish the guilt of the accused.

    Mr. David Rein 
    I would contend that it is, yes. 
    And I do not want to say that I think that Congress can amend the statute to be a concession in that respect, it certainly is property.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well, I don't think that that's the answer.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well, Congress might give someone a house and lot on the provisions which had said they could take it away on a certain other -- other circumstances and not under others. 
    Perhaps this may -- may help, Your Honor, to have my view on it.

    Yes.

    Suppose Congress gave someone a house and lot under a statute which said, “Congress can take this away for reason A and B but not for reason C and D.”

    Yes.

    Now, the fact that Congress can take that property away from him for reason A and B, doesn't make it any less property. 
    It still can't take it away from him for reason C and D. 
    And if Congress attempts to take it away from him for reasons C and D, he is protected against Congress in that respect. 
    However, he is not protected against Congress if Congress takes it away for reasons A and B, which Congress provided well reasons it could take it away.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Yes, if it was so provided and if it was so understood in advance, it probably would not be, but -- but I'm just saying the house and lot is still property regardless of whether Congress can take it away or not. 
    It can validly take it away. 
    That would be my view.

    Mr. Rein, your argument is you say that Congress in speaking of its constitutional power, the United States (Inaudible) unconstitutional, and you're invoking constitutional provisions. 
    And I think when you're dealing with constitutional provisions to invalidate the power upon Congress (Inaudible) the words of the Constitution. 
    And I should like to read you what Article III, Section 2, which you invoke. 
    Clearly, it doesn't say anything about punishment. 
    (Inaudible) It says the trial of all crimes, of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall by jury, and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crime shall have been committed (Inaudible) in these provisions that said punishment, and that provision said the trial of all crimes when (Inaudible) learned lawyers, very able lawyers have (Inaudible)

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well, may I say -- I can only say in response that the Wong Wing case which sees to be indistinguishable here relied on that under Sixth Amendment to invalidate to statute there. 
    Now, there, to there was no crime but there was a punishment. 
    Now, I don't see how you get around the problem of saying, for example, because Congress doesn't label something a crime --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6203.971" stopTime="6226.347">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You put question of labeling a crime in a legal document means prosecution which has to be begun by indictment and proceeded with before a jury in this loose way of talking about the Constitution as though we are really construing a newspaper article instead of the great documents by which this country was applauded and by which it -- it is going up.
speaker="david_rein" startTime="6226.347" stopTime="6236.392">
    Mr. David Rein 
    I think the purposes of those constitutional provisions are to provide that you can't reach the end result without going through that procedure.

    And if Congress goes ahead and reaches the end result of imprisonment or a fine without having a prosecution for a crime, it then violates the Constitution.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Invoked to you to construe the word but you are to quote the (Inaudible)
speaker="david_rein" startTime="6256.985" stopTime="6454.524">
    Mr. David Rein 
    On the assumption, if I may have just a moment, that an ex post facto law does cover penalties of this character, this statute is an ex post facto law. 
    Now, the Government makes some contention in its brief that it's not an ex post facto law because in fact the statute was passed in 1954. 
    The alien did not actually become -- receive his benefits until 1955. 
    But I think what is important here for ex post facto considerations is the date of the conduct on the basis of which the penalty was imposed. 
    And that conduct terminated in 1939. 
    I think it's indicated earlier by Mr. Davis. 
    He said there was no clear termination date. 
    What is significant here is that the Board of Immigration Appeals, which was the body which decided that the alien was deportable and set forth the grounds, said that his membership in the Communist Party had lasted or terminated in 1939 or at least that was the last date on which they found membership. 
    So that we therefore find that -- or the conduct which terminated in 1939 was the basis of the later penalty which was inflicted upon and first by the 1950 statute of deportation and now, by the 1954 statute. 
    And I think it comes within the language used to describe the ex post facto clause in the American Communications Association against Douds case in which it said that what is controlling is whether the conduct to which the individuals are being punished has been completed, so that “nothing that those persons proscribed by its terms could ever do or change the result.” 
    And that was the situation here. 
    After 1939, there was nothing that the petitioner here could do that would change the result which led to the depravation -- first is deportation, the deprivation -- laid the deprivation of benefits. 
    Now, the fact that he could be deported on that ground is really not relevant here because this Court has held that deportation is not punishment. 
    And therefore, they said that the ex post facto clause does not apply to deportation on that ground. 
    I think finally, and on the view that this is a penalty and that is being penalized for the conduct which was their membership in the Communist Party it is clear under the cases in this Court that the conduct here which the petitioner engaged in was protected by the First Amendment, is shown both the Yates case and by the De Jonge case. 
    And for any loss of privilege or punishment to be inflicted on the basis of conduct protected by the First Amendment, would be a violation of that provision of the Constitution. 
    Thank you.

    -- that -- that for what it -- for any importance there is. 
    The proceeding is first, the denaturalization proceeding on the ground of some fraud which I do not know in connection with his actually obtaining citizenship. 
    Then if he is denaturalized -- when he is denaturalized, then he would be subject to deportation presumably because of commission of crimes involving moral servitude or that might be the procedure but there are two separate things, one, question of whether he described in his naturalization, and the second question, the question of deportation. 
    Now, with respect to whether property was taken away from -- from Mr. Nestor, I think it's important that we not treat this as though a right to $55.60 which had accrued to him was taken away at the time he was awarded this benefit of $55.60. 
    The law was then on the books stating that if he was deported on the basis of being -- having been a member of the Communist Party that this would terminate so he took this money at that time subject to that deficients. 
    The question is whether his right which existed in 1954 because of the reason that he had paid taxes under this system, whether that is a right at which the deprivation of which is -- deprives him of due process of law.
