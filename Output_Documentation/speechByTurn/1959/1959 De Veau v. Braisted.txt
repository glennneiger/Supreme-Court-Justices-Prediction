    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, what I want to know is this. 
    I can understand that you're saying that what is past is past and if New York was entitled to disqualify him -- when did it first disqualify him, 1950?
speaker="thomas_r_sullivan" startTime="283.971" stopTime="286.377">
    Mr. Thomas R. Sullivan 
    In 1956 -- 1957, early part of 1957.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="286.377" stopTime="315.122">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    1957. 
    That nothing that Congress did in 1959 can undo what the purposes of argument as the legal power of New York in 1957, I understand that. 
    But if you go beyond that and say -- that the Court must decide that. 
    And the Court -- all that the Court has to decide, would you say is whether he -- he should be declared to have been properly disqualified in 1957?
speaker="thomas_r_sullivan" startTime="315.122" stopTime="328.845">
    Mr. Thomas R. Sullivan 
    That would seem to be the case, sir, whether or not, Section 8 was a valid -- whether or not, it was a valid exercise of the police powers or whether or not, it had been pre-empted by Congress at the time the litigation was put.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="328.845" stopTime="370.309">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let me give to you another aspect of this, suppose the Court rejects your moot argument on the ground that -- while (Inaudible) is gone, he is the new manifestation of 1346 and there's an election up in the 1960, and (Inaudible) says that he would beat him despite of that -- the suspension continues, according to his affidavits. 
    And therefore, it's not moot because of the issue is whether he can qualify for candidate in 1960, assume -- assume that state of fact. 
    On -- on that assumption, is the 1959 Act pertinent?
speaker="thomas_r_sullivan" startTime="370.309" stopTime="380.469">
    Mr. Thomas R. Sullivan 
    Well, assuming sir that the kind of the question before the Court is whether or not we are deciding his eligibility to run for office in 1960.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="380.469" stopTime="383.342">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm assuming that in order to answer your moot argument.
speaker="thomas_r_sullivan" startTime="383.342" stopTime="405.475">
    Mr. Thomas R. Sullivan 
    I would say sir that again, I must go -- I can only go back to what this Court has said in the past. 
    That in deciding state courts and in deciding the validity of state statutes which is what we're concerned with here, the Court will not consider an intervening event.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="405.475" stopTime="414.018">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, if -- if the election of 1960 becomes pertinent and the intervening event isn't an intervening event as the past but it looks to the future.
speaker="thomas_r_sullivan" startTime="414.018" stopTime="476.081">
    Mr. Thomas R. Sullivan 
    The -- the point, sir, is that if that is his aim, if that is the appellant's aim here, he is not without recourse. 
    There is no -- he can institute the action now in light of the 1959 Amendment, or the 1959 Act. 
    But we are dealing here with an action that was commenced under a certain set of facts and circumstances and if you will, to ground rules through the fault of no one between the time the Court of Appeals decided this case and the time it is presented before Your Honors. 
    Congress has changed or has modified in some respect, the law. 
    We are now here as I envision it to determine the propriety of the decision of the Court of Appeals of New York as of the time they'd decided it and that the question of the 1959 Act never having been raised at that point, we -- we feel is not properly in view of the -- the past decisions of this Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="476.081" stopTime="518.392">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I've put to you the relevance of the consideration of mootness to this litigation. 
    This Court has held into cases in connection with the -- didn't you say Commerce Commission or the Federal Trades Commission that an order may expend its force and the case would be moot but for the fact that another order like the one in controversy in the charge next week, saving the case for mootness. 
    And so I'm suggesting that somebody moot, maybe sympathetically, your point view on mootness might not go all the way with you because you would feel that the same controversy arises as -- right in front of you, and therefore the case is not moot.
speaker="thomas_r_sullivan" startTime="518.392" stopTime="518.885">
    Mr. Thomas R. Sullivan 
    The same --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="518.885" stopTime="525.440">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In that aspect, what happened in 1959 may bear on what should be done with the reference to 1960?
speaker="thomas_r_sullivan" startTime="525.440" stopTime="563.549">
    Mr. Thomas R. Sullivan 
    The 1959 Act when taken in -- in connection with the question of mootness sir, certainly shows the complex situation that has been created not only by the abolition or of -- of 1346 but also the enactment of the Labor Management Disclosure Act of 1959. 
    The situation is that the parties to this action would probably be entirely different, at least insofar as the appellee is concerned that there would no longer be the controversy, even under the 1959 Act.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="563.549" stopTime="584.318">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I follow your -- I follow your argument on mootness. 
    Would you care to express an opinion, I would understand you would -- but it's not here. 
    Would you care to and express an opinion, whether in your view, the 1959 legislation of Congress, the plan, Section 8.
speaker="thomas_r_sullivan" startTime="584.318" stopTime="659.608">
    Mr. Thomas R. Sullivan 
    Sir, we do not feel that it does, and we have so stated both in the brief of the appellee and in the brief of the Waterfront Commission amicus curiae. 
    The Waterfront Commission has filed amicus throughout this since -- although they are not the parties to the -- party to the action, they are most vitally concerned with it since they are the administrators of the compact. 
    I think you will find that the question fully gone into in the briefs and why we say we do not feel that there is a conflict between the 1959 Act and the Labor Management Disclosure Act -- Section 8 in the Labor Management Disclosure Act of 1959 because there are certain saving clauses in the 1959 Act which provide that in addition to the remedies supplied therein, that any employee of a labor union is saved, any existing right he had or any protection he had under any state act. 
    That is expressly contained in section 103.

    Mr. Sullivan, may I ask? 
    I take it though you have to argue also, looking again at 603, that the provisions of the 1959 Disclosure Act, establishing the standards for disqualification for union office, do not satisfy the definition of -- except as exquisitely provided for the contrary.
speaker="thomas_r_sullivan" startTime="1112.851" stopTime="1158.004">
    Mr. Thomas R. Sullivan 
    Yes, sir. 
    Because throughout the Act, the Labor Management Disclosure Act, where the Congress wanted their procedures to be explicit, they so stated and the Waterfront Commission points it out in its brief. 
    In many instances they said, “Compliance with our -- with our law shall be sufficient for any State.” 
    There are certain reports that are required under the Labor Management Disclosure Act and they specifically state, “No state shall require anything further than a copy of this.” 
    But on 103, I believe it is -- it's not 103 but the section creating the qualification requirements, no such reservation is included at all. 
    In summary --

    Mr. Thomas R. Sullivan 
    No, sir. 
    But I do say that where in a scheme of things, they specifically say in A and B and Court, “This is all that is required and no state may require more and that they don't say it insofar as D is concerned. 
    It is some indicia that they did not intend to pre-empt as to D.

   Argument of Thomas W. Gleason
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1192.304" stopTime="1194.859">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gleason.
speaker="thomas_w_gleason" startTime="1194.859" stopTime="1336.869">
    Mr. Thomas W. Gleason 
    I just like to bring out a couple of points here Your Honor. 
    First of all, De Veau is not automatically disbarred from holding a checker's license. 
    The law of the Waterfront Commission specifically spells out that he has a right to a hearing and they placed a five-year probation period in there and a five-year disqualification of the felony. 
    So he is entitled to a hearing and in their discretion, they can't grant him a license to be a checker. 
    It is to be noted that in all the -- all the occupations spelled out under the findings and the declarations namely longshoremen, hiring agents, watchmen and stevedores they're all provisions for hearings and provisions for notice. 
    They have a right to appeal to the courts if they're not satisfied with the determination of the Waterfront Commission. 
    Section 8 goes much further. 
    It gives them no right of hearing, no right to bring in witnesses, no right to show that he has over the years became -- become a citizen of good character. 
    It's not based on character. 
    It's based mainly for the purpose of punishment and for the purpose to be (Inaudible) 
    There's no other reason for this Section 8. 
    I'd like to point out also that we still maintain that Congress has given no -- had given no consideration of Section 8, the only place that it was brought up was in a committee hearing. 
    Congress wasn't aware of Section 8, and the only -- even -- even in the state hearings and the recommendations before the state legislature, there was no recommendation that they should take any action against unions.In fact they took the opposite view. 
    They took the position that Congress should be consulted and that there were revisions coming up before the Tart-Hartley -- under Tart-Hartley law, and that therefore they should present these changes to Congress. 
    And they specifically spell out the conflict. 
    And that can be found in the 4th Report of New York, the State Crime Commission and there is nowhere at all where Congress have --
