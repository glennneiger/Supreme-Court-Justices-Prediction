Schilling v. Rogers
speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="0.000" stopTime="73.688">
    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    -- section 32 of the Trading with the Enemy Act is silent about the question of judicial review and makes no provision for it and in addition, it contains language giving extremely wide discretionary powers and authority dealing with the return of property. 
    The Government, however, wants to make it clear that it does not rest its case, dealing with the proposition that there is no judicial review here, on the language of Section 32, which is simply silent on the matter of judicial review. 
    Section 32 is simply one of some 40 odd sections of the Trading with the Enemy Act. 
    It must be considered with the other sections of the Act. 
    Turning to other sections of the Act, we find at least two such sections which on their face would seem in sweeping language to bar judicial review under Section 32. 
    The first of those sections is the one mentioned by petitioner's counsel yesterday Section 7 (c) found in petitioner's brief at page 41.

speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="138.125" stopTime="174.031">
    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    No, that is right. 
    The question -- the language of Section 7 (c) is very broad. 
    It reads in part the sole relief and remedy of any person having any claim to any money or other property heretofore or hereafter conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered or paid over to the Custodian shall be that provided by the terms of this Act.

    Well – (Inaudible)
speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="198.970" stopTime="258.315">
    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    That is correct, yes. 
    Now in addition to that, there is a significant section which is found in our brief on page 33, Section 9 (f) of the Trading with the Enemy Act. 
    Section 9 (f) in part reads as follows “Except as herein provided the money or other property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, paid to the Custodian shall not be subject to any order or decree of any court. 
    Now I think Section 9 (f) is particularly significant because Section 9 is the key section of the Trading with the Enemy Act insofar as a judicial review is concerned. 
    Section 9 (a) --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="258.315" stopTime="261.250">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Only with respect to 9 (a)?
speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="261.250" stopTime="310.548">
    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    Not -- well not -- today that is true. 
    That is today Section 9 (a) allows judicial review in the case of either citizens or non-enemy aliens. 
    However, I'd like to point out that after World War I, Congress also enacted Sections 9 (b) and 9 (c) which allowed judicial review for enemy aliens. 
    Now contrast to what Congress did after World War I when it specifically allowed judicial review in 9 (b) and 9 (c) with what Congress did after World War II when they enacted Section 32 and said nothing at all about judicial review.

    Am I right in thinking that the Second World War legislation dealing with enemy aliens mitigated some of the provisions not existing but mitigated some of the provisions of the -- of the Alien Enemy Act of the (Inaudible)
speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="329.430" stopTime="494.269">
    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    That is right. 
    As the legislative -- to go into the legislative history, the legislative history indicates that the pattern that was envisaged for relief after World War II, so to speak, was a two-fold one. 
    First, under Section 9 (a), there was to be judicial review and so to speak a mandatory return for all non-enemy aliens. 
    Section 9 (a) gave an absolute right of judicial review for them, but then as the -- as the Alien Property Custodian pointed out to the congressional committee, Section 32 was to provide, so to speak, another remedy. 
    It was a remedy that might be utilized, if they so wish, by even by not enemy alien but it could also be utilized by enemy aliens, but because it could be utilized by enemy aliens, it was envisaged as one that was purely administrative. 
    It gave wide discretion to the administrator and there was to be no judicial review under it. 
    Now it's significant that Congress considered Section 32 for almost two years from 1944 to 1946. 
    This was not something that was rushed through Congress under great war of pressure. 
    Congress took plenty of time. 
    Furthermore, the original of Section 32 (a) was legislation drafted by the Alien Property Custodian and the Attorney General. 
    They sent a joint letter which is found in our brief on pages 12 and 13 in which they state that the purpose of Section 32 (a) was to provide administrative remedy with wide discretion and that there was not to be any judicial review under Section 32 (a). 
    This was not only their understanding, it was the understanding of witnesses who appeared before the congressional committee and who criticized, they then draft the 32 (a). 
    For instance the testimony of Mr. Carroll which is found in our brief on pages 13 and 14. 
    In other words it was the general consensus of opinion that there was not to be a judicial review under 32 (a). 
    Judicial review was to be under Section 9, not under 32, not under 32 (a).

    This Court has intimated that if it were not for the judicial remedy given by Section 9 (a) constitutional issues would be raised in the type of case you put.

    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    Well I should think one constitutional provision would be that it would be taking property without due compensation if this was the property of an American citizen.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What about the Due Process Clause?

    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    That might well be that to -- the taking would be a violation of due process, if it were of an American citizen though.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="612.743" stopTime="624.126">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes, I suppose the difference is if an alien enemy is not entitled to this due process that's under the Due Process Clause or the just compensation clause.
speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="624.126" stopTime="634.369">
    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    And that has been the indication in the decisions of this Court. 
    And I might add that the petitioner has not raised any constitutional issue anytime in this case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="634.369" stopTime="642.816">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I suppose the old case would allow him to assure his American citizenship under the doctrine of refuge.
speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="642.816" stopTime="946.521">
    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    Very likely, yes. 
    That is quite true. 
    Now there's also significance that Section 32 (a) when it was enacted by Congress was part of Public Law 322 and that law contained other amendments to the Trading with the Enemy Act. 
    One of those amendments related to Section 22 which deals with consulting and that amendment enacted at the same time Section 32 (a), that amendment is Section 20 expressly provided for judicial review under Section 20. 
    In other words that's a pretty clear indication that whenever Congress has wanted a judicial review under the Trading with the Enemy Act they had said so. 
    And the reason they had said so is because undoubtedly they realized that they didn't say so. 
    Then the provisions of 7 (c) and 9 (f) would operate to bar a review. 
    Now you find the same pattern again when a few months later in August, 1946, Congress amended Section 32 (a) and enacted the proviso herein question dealing with discrimination against groups for political reasons. 
    First of all you discover as we point out in our brief on pages 16 and 17 that the Alien Property Custodian wrote a letter to determine in the House Judiciary Committee which the Chairman read with his approval to the House in which the Alien Property Custodian pointed out that he wanted to make it clear that certain amendments and changes that the Senate had made in Section 33 which deal with the statute of limitations that none of those amendments and changes in his judgment operated to give any judicial review under Section 32 (a). 
    The amendments as a matter of fact of Section 32 (a) said again did not deal with judicial review. 
    Furthermore, these August amendments again were part of Public Law Number 671. 
    Public Law 671 made other changes to the Trading with the Enemy Act. 
    One of those changes was that it added Section 34 to the Act. 
    Now Section 34 deals with the so-called death claim, that is the claims of American citizens against the properties that have been -- have been seized by the Alien Property Custodian and again it is significant that Section 34, as added here in 1946 of August, specifically provides for judicial review. 
    The matter's not left up in the air. 
    In other words, every time Congress has wanted judicial review under the Trading with the Enemy Act it has said so expressly. 
    It said so in Section 9, it said so in Section 20, it said so Section 34 as we point out in our brief. 
    Since 1946 on at least two occasions bills have been introduced in Congress to amend Section 32 (a) to provide expressly for judicial review, none of those bills have ever been enacted. 
    Now turning to for a moment from the legislative history and from the wording of the Trading with the Enemy Act, it also seems to the Government that there were very sound policy reasons that undoubtedly influenced Congress here not to desire to have judicial review. 
    Congress probably realized that they were not dealing here with a statute which would involve the liberty of any person. 
    There was no question here of imprisonment, no question here of deportation, no question here of putting anyone in the armed forces against his will of drafting anybody for service. 
    There's no question here as I made plain of citizenship. 
    There is no question here of any administrative body blackening anybody's reputation. 
    There is no question here of depriving anyone of the right to vote or the right of free speech. 
    Congress undoubtedly viewed this proposition simply as an act of grace.

    Congress consciously and deliberately withheld it and as I started to say I think there are -- are some reasons why Congress did if you stop and think about it, take the factual situation in this case. 
    The petitioner admittedly is a German national. 
    During the entire period of the war, he was in Germany. 
    Now in order to classify these claims, one must ascertain facts that occurred in Germany. 
    One must deal with questions of German law of what the Nazi Government did or did not do.

    The Director says -- the Director said, “Well now I -- I just decided he's not entitled to relief.

    Now are the courts foreclosed from going into that question?
speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="1358.370" stopTime="1391.992">
    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    Well of course that is not our case but to take up your hypothetical case, I think that it is a fair interpretation of the statute here whether or not this Court will ultimately agree in the extreme you case put. 
    It's fair interpretation of this statute. 
    That Congress here considered this matter and they meant generally speaking for the decision of the Director to be final. 
    Now they recognize the fact that anyone to whom you give the power to make a final decision, the judge here, or the Attorney General or even the President can make a mistake.

    But the Chief Justice's case isn't a mistake. 
    It's a willful refusal to apply the statute wherein the Director as I understand the Chief Justice's hypothetical case, the Director says, “Yes this man is within the statute but I willfully refuse to apply the statute.”
speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="1412.405" stopTime="1419.147">

    I willfully refuse to violate the law. 
    He merely says on these facts which we -- we say in the hypothetical case are clearly placed this man within a -- within one of those groups. 
    On these facts, I determine that he is not entitled to relief. 
    Not eligible for relief. 
    I just like to know what the position of the Government is as to a situation of that kind. 
    Does the man have judicial review or does he not?

    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    I would say there -- that's it's simply a question of mistake no matter, so to speak, how bad a mistake it is nevertheless if he -- if he's acted in good faith and exercises discretion that there is no judicial review.

    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    That is correct. 
    I -- I presume that if the Alien Property Custodian acted in any of these horrible ways we're talking about that either the Attorney General or the President after all to whom the power is directly delegated would be first person to correct.

    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    That is correct. 
    As I -- as I said it seems -- it seems to the Government that you have a -- an unusual area here an area where you are dealing in -- in a sense in the field of foreign relations in foreign affairs. 
    As we -- we point out -- out in our brief again, actually the Alien Property Custodian of the Government have found that it desirable to handle many of these claims under Section 32 (a) simply by direct agreement with a foreign government, France or Italy, rather than go -- going through the ordinary process of a hearing. 
    This -- this area comes very close to the area of foreign relation and treaty questions. 
    In fact the -- the scheme, the general scheme in having on the Trading with the Enemy Act is shown by Section 39 of the Act which is in the appendix to our brief is that Congress has said that in general enemy aliens are to look to their own government for relief for this type of seizure.

    We certainly you do not believe that that is what Congress intended.

    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    Well the only “shall” is -- is involved is that “he shall make a determination.”

    I won't even pass upon it. 
    I will give you a decision. 
    You filed your claim well the claim could not gather dust in my file box.” 
    Well then the Act says he shall determine but when it comes to the question of what his determination shall be, there the Act simply says, “He may return. 
    He may return,” it's discretionary and he gives them very broad discretions. 
    It says he may return it and then it lists several conditions, one of which is if he finds that the return is in the interest of the United States --

    That is what I think of standard discriminated against that he must be a member of -- that he was a citizen of subject to discriminating against political, racial, religious groups, he must come within those -- one of those three groups and nothing is more difficult for admiring the technology that goes with the German situation and to determine that fact. 
    That's another reason why it should be left to the administrator and not to the courts because it's very difficult to ascertain whether you do or do not come within one of these outlawed groups.

    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    Well here it is -- let me explain to you briefly the way the situation now operates. 
    The initial hearing is before the trial examiner who makes his recommended decision. 
    It then goes to the Director of Alien Property. 
    He makes his decision. 
    His decision is final except where as in this case more $50,000 is involved or maybe involved, or except where a novel or unusual question of law or policy is involved in those accepted cases so speak, the Attorney General is given an opportunity to review the case and the decision does not become final until the Attorney General has reviewed the case as was the situation here. 
    Ordinarily reviewing the case, unless the Attorney General disagrees with the decision of the Director, he does not write another opinion. 
    He simply says that he has reviewed it and he adopts the decision of the Director as his own. 
    That is the procedure followed.

    Well as I read this, it appears on page 44 of the petitioner's brief. 
    The President or certain law officers he may designate may return the property or the proceeds thereof whenever the President or such officer or agency shall determine, then follows one and then follows two that such owner and legal representative or it's just an interest of any are not, then follows (d) and then (d) says, “provided that notwithstanding provisions of sub -- Subdivision (d) return may be made to an individual who as a consequence of such rule. 
    Now I fail to see the basis upon which you feel there is any mandatory language because the word, “shall” relates only to “if he shall find.”
speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="2448.915" stopTime="2468.803">
    Mr. Robert Kramer 
    I think the basis in the argument is that the language indicates that Congress intended him to make a determination. 
    It intended however for his determination to be within his discretion. 
    Congress did not intend him simply to receive the claim and do nothing about it.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes you may have -- you may have a few minutes to sum up your argument there. 
    It takes amount of time with the other side you may answer if you wish for a few minutes.
speaker="henry_i_fillman" startTime="2494.545" stopTime="3019.732">
    Mr. Henry I. Fillman 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I will just confine my rebuttal to the statements made by Mr. Kramer on the point that the legislative history and particularly the fact that Section 34 was added to the Trading with the Enemy Act at the time they added the first proviso from Section 32 (a) (2) (D) has really nothing to do with the question before the Court because the purpose of incorporating the right to sue in Section 34, the debt claim provision review by the Court of a debt claim determination was clearly pointed out in the hearings before -- it's not on my brief, in the hearings before the Subcommittee No. 1 and Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, 79th Congress on House Bill 5089, a Bill to amend the First War Powers Act, Serial No. 20. 
    And it is there stated by Mr. Markham, who was then the Custodian, that in view of this Court's decision in Markham v. Cabell which had held that one could sue the Custodian under Section 9 (a) to recover from the vested property a debt owing to the plaintiff. 
    There would be a first-come, first-serve situation as far as payment of the debt claims were concerned, so the Custodian asked legislation to take away from Section 9 (a), and it's in 9 (a) there is the provision that any person not an enemy or ally of an enemies, it's on page 42, claiming or to whom any debt may be owing from an enemy or ally of an enemy whose property or any part thereof shall have been conveyed to the Custodian may sue the Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States to recover on his debt out of the vested property. 
    They took that away in enacting Section 34 and allowed the creditor to come-in in an administrative proceeding and if he was dissatisfied with the administrative proceeding there could then be an equitable distribution of the vested assets owing by the former property owner to his creditors who are not enemies or allies of enemies and Section 34 is based on the National Bankruptcy Act. 
    There's a system of equitable distribution and review by the courts of the mere fact that they did that in the same Act which incorporated the first proviso is no indication and no proof that Congress did not intend that there should be no judicial review of any determination by the Custodian which was without supporting evidence or arbitrary or capricious or void. 
    That is to that. 
    Now as to the real point here on Section 32, when it says “may return” in the first part, the word “may” relates solely to the return of the property. 
    The word “may” does not relate to a determination of the status or the condition. 
    He is not given a permissive right to determine whether the man comes within the conditions laid down for return. 
    “May” in that sense must be read as “shall” or mandatory because the word “may” has been construed in a statute. 
    It has been construed by this Court and other courts. 
    The word “may” is to be read as mandatory. 
    It means shall or must whenever it is necessary to carry out the intent of the legislature that has enacted the particular statute in which the word is found and to carry out the sense of the policy of the legislation. 
    Now Congress in our brief quotes Congress on the sense and purpose of the first proviso of Section 32 (a) (2) (D). 
    Congress considered these people who were persecuted as non-hostile enemies. 
    Congress said we call them the enemies of our enemies. 
    They, in fact, wanted to have the allied course succeed they should have their property back. 
    That's the exact language of Congress in the reports. 
    Since that is the sense and the purpose and intent of the legislature to give these people back their property if they come within this class, then I suggest to the Court that the word “may” which only relates to return if it has any application or consideration with respect to the determination of status or condition, I say it should then be read as mandatory. 
    And my last point, if the Court please, is, that the issue here is not the expertise of the administrator. 
    He is not an expert on what were considered political, religious, or racial groups no more than I have. 
    He must determine that on the facts adduced on the record. 
    There were facts adduced here on the record before the hearing examiner. 
    The hearing examiner said though evidence was documentary and only one witness was called by the petitioner. 
    He names that witness in his recommendation and findings. 
    That witness is named M. Magdalena Shack. 
    Although it does not appear here, I doubt whether the Government will deny that M. Magdalena Shack is an employee and attorney in the Office of Alien Property. 
    So if there is any expertise in the office of Alien Property to determine this question, M. Magdalena Shack, an employee of that office, a former lawyer in Germany, arium, and who had taught one semester at Harvard law school, who was the witness here before the hearing examiner and who testified to the conditions in Germany and as to what the political groups and knew who the bar examiners were and the chief of the bar examiners then I say we have in the records the expert in the office of Alien Property that supported the case of the petitioner which evidence was disregarded by the Director when he made his decision and we say that was arbitrary, capricious, and void and if it's void, the District Court has jurisdiction. 
    It has jurisdiction to control not to decide, but to control void acts of an agency.
