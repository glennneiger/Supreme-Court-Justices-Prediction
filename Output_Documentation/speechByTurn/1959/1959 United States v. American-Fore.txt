    Now, I believe that the --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is that the only instance you've ever -- you've been able to find that it was ever done?
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="66.561" stopTime="144.419">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    Well, then sir, of a judge assigned from another circuit. 
    Yes, but we have found several cases precisely like this one in three circuits -- three other circuits where a judge who an active judge who was assigned to a Court of Appeals en banc and thereafter retired after the case was submitted, participated in the decision of the court. 
    Now, we found that that practice to be followed in the Third Circuit and we have two cases in our briefs on that in addition to the two cases we have, are (Inaudible) and (Inaudible) against the Auto Racing Association. 
    Now, they referred to in the Government's reply brief on page 4 and in our supplemental brief on page 2. 
    In both of those cases, Judge Maris, the situation is exactly the same. 
    They were heard exactly the same time by a court en banc of which Judge Maris is an active Judge of the Third Circuit participated. 
    Thereafter, Judge Maris retired. 
    Thereafter, he participated in the decision of both of those cases on the same day. 
    It's precisely the same as the case now before the Court.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="144.419" stopTime="147.920">

speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="147.920" stopTime="151.187">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    They -- no -- no, this was not a grant of rehearing. 
    Judge Maris --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="151.187" stopTime="152.876">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    When they acted en banc did they have --
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="152.876" stopTime="158.069">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    Yes, sir. 
    There had been a grant of a rehearing. 
    It's like this case. 
    It's not like this supposititious case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="158.069" stopTime="159.001">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I see.
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="159.001" stopTime="383.266">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    And he was on the court en banc on the rehearing or on the hearing or rehearing. 
    He was a member of the court en banc just like Judge Medina was. 
    Thereafter, he retired. 
    Thereafter, the case was decided and he participated in the court's decision. 
    We have also found in addition to that, two -- three cases in the Ninth Circuit which we have called to the Court's attention. 
    Those three cases are Herzog against the United States. 
    In those cases, Judges Bauman and Orr heard the case en banc, thereafter, retired and thereafter, participated in the court's opinion. 
    The other case was United States against Price. 
    In that case, Judge Healey who was a member of the court en banc that heard the case thereafter retired and thereafter, participated in the court's decision. 
    Now, there is another case, In re Sawyer, in which Judge Denman had participated in the case but withdrew, he did withdraw. 
    Judge Hamlin who had been appointed between the time it was submitted and the time it was heard, did not participate. 
    And I think a fair reading of that case is that this was an individual determination of Judge Denman. 
    Now, the court pointedly said, the only reason he didn't -- didn't participate was that he didn't want to in every implication particularly since it's bracketed between the two other cases where they did permit the retired judges to participate. 
    Every implication is, the court said, “Well, if you don't want to, you don't have to.” 
    But the court did not deny him that right. 
    And in addition to that, there are two cases in the Fifth Circuit where the court sat on a rehearing, sat to determine whether a rehearing en banc should be granted. 
    Now, in those cases the point was specifically raised by dissenting judges like it was here as to whether Judge Sibley, who had sat with the court en bank could participate in the decision en bank denying a petition for rehearing. 
    He did vote, it was denied 3-to-2 with his vote and the other two judges dissented and said, “He had no right to participate and thereto, there were two other judges who had been appointed in the meantime, one to take Judge Sibley's place and one to take Judge Lee's place who had died but had not participated in the original decision because he was ill in the original case. 
    And the court did not permit these two new judges to participate in the question of whether a rehearing en banc should be granted but did permit Judge Sibley to participate and it was denied 3-to-2 with his vote being decided. 
    So we have three other circuits. 
    I think that case is the same in principle as this case. 
    We have two circuits in which the same question has arisen and be decide this way, a Third Circuit in which a question identical in principle has arisen and to decide it this way. 
    And then also in the Third Circuit, you have the case of the judges -- of the active judge from one circuit sitting by assignment and that leads to the same result. 
    So, every case, now, it's very difficult to say we have every case Your Honor because they're not -- they're not normally classified. 
    We found them by leafing through the books but I had two people doing that for six months and done it myself. 
    My colleagues had done the same thing and the Government has with every case any of us have found all went that way in every single circuit.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    In re what?
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="422.403" stopTime="530.064">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    In re Sawyer, S-A-W-Y-E-R, In re Sawyer and they are referred to on pages 21 and 22 of my main brief. 
    And the Third case with the Ninth circuit is United States against Price and that is referred to on page 4 of the Government's reply brief and on page 2 of my supplemental brief. 
    Those are the three Ninth Circuit cases. 
    The Third Circuit cases and I want to emphasize this because I have always disagreed with -- with the Government's interpretation of Judge Maris' views. 
    They say Judge Maris would have denied that, he never said that. 
    He spoke of active judges participating generally but he never -- he never spoke of this situation where the judge was designated and assigned to the court before he retired. 
    Now, therefore I want to particularly stress the two cases that arose in the Third Circuit because there, (Inaudible), appear on page 4 of the Government's reply brief and C-O-R-E-B-I, Corebi against the Auto Racing Company which is also on page 4 the Government's reply brief. 
    And they are on page 2 of my supplemental brief. 
    Now, and though both of those cases the judge retired after participating in the -- after hearing the case en banc was Judge Maris. 
    And he himself thereafter, voted with the court and participated in its decision just like Judge Medina did in this case. 
    So I do think that our interpretation of his views is correct rather than the Government's interpretation of his use of some general statements he made.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="530.064" stopTime="534.072">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Was there any attack upon that action?
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="534.072" stopTime="735.119">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    No, sir, there was not. 
    The question -- the -- the only case in which I know of in which the action of the judge was ever attacked in participating was in this case and also in the two Fifth Circuit cases where Judge Sibley participated in denying where his vote was decisive, after he retired in denying a petition for rehearing en banc. 
    And that was the case where the court sat en banc to deny the petition for a rehearing en banc. 
    And in that case the dissenting judges in both of those cases attacked his right to sit on the court. 
    Those are the only cases that I know of or I think the Government has made a similar statement in its brief that they know of in which the -- in which the question was actually discussed. 
    Now I'd also like to make one other point. 
    I think it is very clear that the Western Pacific Railroad Case, that in Western Pacific Railroad case, this Court held that the majority of the active judges of the circuit could delegate authority to a panel either to deny or to grant a petition for rehearing en banc and that was specifically before them that the panel in that case consisted of two district judges and one circuit judge. 
    As a matter of fact, the majority of the opinion noted that fact and said that's why this -- now, if I might go into the Western Pacific Railroad case a little more because I think it's terribly important to this problem. 
    What happened there was, the majority of the courts -- the Court Of Appeals said, “We will not pass on a petition for -- for a rehearing en banc.” 
    This is a question for the panel. 
    The panel said or -- or this Court interpreted the panel as saying, “We think we're without authority in law to determine whether a petition for rehearing en banc should be granted.” 
    Judge Vinson who wrote the majority opinion said, “This panel consisted of one circuit court judge and two district judges.” 
    He said that specifically but it was the Court of Appeals, nevertheless. 
    And we -- we hold that the -- that the majority of the active judges could determine to abide by the decision of this panel by entrusting the question of whether a rehearing en banc should be granted to them. 
    And we know that two of the judges are in this panel were district judges and perhaps that's why they thought they had no authority to act so we're sending the case back because we think they could have acted or they said, “The court if it liked, the active judges could themselves have decided the petition.” 
    But in any procedure, the majority of the active judges decide this perfectly call of right. 
    They can either delegate their whole authority to this panel with two -- two district judges and one circuit judge or they themselves can adopt the procedure whereby they will decide whether a rehearing en banc should be granted. 
    And I --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="735.119" stopTime="741.237">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But does it follow that -- that they can have -- sit with them en banc anyone they want?
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="741.237" stopTime="830.250">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    Well. 
    I don't know, Your Honor but I'm -- I'm rather inclined to think it does because the broad rationale of the -- of the Western Pacific Railroad Case was, that it's a grant of power to the Court of Appeals to decide -- devise any acceptable procedure. 
    Now, I don't think there's any difference between the active judges who the statute says can determine whether a petition for rehearing en banc should be granted and the active judges who may sit with the court. 
    And I think the one follows with the other and it's a logical -- there's also many other reasons why I believe that's true but there's a logical compactness with it. 
    Certainly, the judges who can vote, grant a rehearing or designate as judges in active service are precisely the same category of judges who can preside on it. 
    Now, I think the Western Pacific Railroad case said, as I interpret it, “The active judges of a circuit are primarily members of the Court of Appeals. 
    They must be consulted. 
    They must be members of a court en banc and the legislative history shows us. 
    That's why it said all active judges of the circuit shall constitute or a court en banc shall consist of all active judges of the circuit. 
    If they wish to call someone else in or they wish to delegate part of their authority, they can do so and I think that avoids the reductio ad absurdum that Mr. Elman spoke up. 
    In other words --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="830.250" stopTime="831.692">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Or if they're going -- excuse me.

    -- or for the District Court to --
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="905.895" stopTime="912.238">

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The what?
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="912.819" stopTime="1044.900">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    The time that the court en banc is constituted not to a subsequent time. 
    This is a section -- the entire Section 46 refers to the -- gives authority to the Court of Appeals to assign its work and distributed among its member and to constitute itself into divisions or into a court en banc. 
    Now, if the court is lawfully constituted at that time, a subsequent change in status of one of its members does not render him incompetent to sit. 
    Now, Your Honor this is not a new question. 
    This has come up in literally dozens of cases where a jurisdictional statute in addition to those I've cited, the precise cases, en banc cases I've cited. 
    There were literally dozens of cases where a jurisdictional statute says, “A judge may sit with the court while a vacancy exists.” 
    The vacancy is filled and under the literal language of the statute, he has no authority. 
    In every single one of those cases and there I do believe, we've read every single one of them. 
    The courts have held that the statute should be interpreted to refer to the constitution of a court at the time it's convened. 
    And they said if a judge no longer has authority that refers to new cases, not to cases which have been committed to the consideration of a court while he was a member of a court. 
    That rule of statutory construction, the cases were collected in -- the cases were collected in District of Columbia case of all these various jurisdictional statutes (Inaudible) which we've cited here. 
    They quote the language of the statute. 
    It's always peremptory in form that says he has authority up to this point and in every case state and federal, the courts have said, “This does not stop a judge who is lawfully a member of a court for completing a case which he heard as a member of the court."

    The Chief Justice's questions was whether the principle that -- what you said was the prevailing body of judicial authority that when a man is a new member of -- has jurisdiction to sit in a case which is terminable on some condition to be fulfilling a vacancy and so on. 
    He may continue to sit after the condition of his temporary appointment has come to an end, is that right?

    The Chief Justice, as I understood him, then asked, does that apply to the -- this Court, the Supreme Court of the United States so that a member of this Court having heard the argument, participated at conference and as has been the case even drafted an opinion in which the court joined. 
    If thereafter, if he retires before there's an actual announcement of the decision of a Monday, he can no longer participate in it. 
    I think there is certainly one or two cases in which this Court has said this is substantially the opinion which was written by Brother Jones and the Court now adopts it.

    It says, “In this connection, it should be noted that Section 120 of the Judicial Code makes the Chief Justice and associate justices of a Supreme Court assigned to each Circuit competent to sit as judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals within their respective circuits.” 
    That's why the Circuit Court of Appeals is composed primarily of circuit judges, the circuit justice is made a “component part” of that Court.

    Yes.
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="1473.330" stopTime="1532.348">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    -- what they tried to enact. 
    In the Textile Mills case, you utterly recall, the question was of course whether the Court could sit en banc. 
    And in reaching the conclusion that it could sit en banc, this Court said it's obvious that the three-judge limitation cannot be applied liter -- applied literally because some circuits have more than three judges. 
    It also said and that's a remark I was just reading from. 
    In this connection, it should be noted that the Chief Justice and associate justices are also competent to sit as members of the Court. 
    They're component parts of the Court and in its decision, it equated competency to sit on the Court with competency to perform its most important function, to decide cases and therefore said, all judges competent to sit on the Court are competent to sit en banc and decide a case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1532.348" stopTime="1559.062">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And do you believe that there are -- are three or four retired members of the Court of Appeals in a large circuit and the chief judge also brings in -- in two or three outsiders to sit in certain litigation that all of them can sit with the active members of the court en banc?
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="1559.062" stopTime="1573.808">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    If the active members of the Court decide that they want him to because the authority to assign judges to the Court in its divisions resides in the active judges of a court under Section 46.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1573.808" stopTime="1592.610">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In other words, it's -- is it your opinion that -- that whenever a judge is assigned to -- to perform duties in the Court, that for all purposes, he becomes an active member of the Court?
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="1592.610" stopTime="1599.617">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    No sir. 
    He becomes competent to sit as a judge of the Court not an active member of it and I say -- what I'm saying is --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1599.617" stopTime="1602.542">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then how do you read out the active members?

    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    Well -- well, I'm not quoting it out.

    (Voice Overlap)
speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="1604.815" stopTime="1754.311">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    The active members of the Court of -- on -- I'm adopting the same view this Court did in the Textile Mills case. 
    The active members of the Court are primarily the Court. 
    They're defined as such. 
    They have the authority of assigning to the Court and its divisions any judge or justice who is competent to sit as a member of the Court. 
    And I say that the active judges of the Court have the power if they desire to call in -- to take any judge who's competent under Section 43 (b) and permit him to sit on a court or its divisions or with the -- with the active judges en banc. 
    I think that's the plain meaning of the statute. 
    And I think also, it's what -- it's what was intended. 
    I'd like to point this out, Your Honor that there is -- there is considerable legislative history on this which indicates that was intended. 
    Now, as I pointed out before in answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question, Section 120 made only the chief justice and the associate justice -- justices of the Supreme Court assigned to each circuit competent to sit as judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    Then the district judges could sit to fill out a three-judge court. 
    That -- that obviously was not involved here. 
    Now, when 43 (b) was revised, the revisers in their notes -- the revisers in their note provided that the provision of Section 212 of Title 28 U.S.C. for a three-judge Court of Appeals was permissive and did not limit the power of the Court to sit en banc. 
    Thus, Subsection (b), and that's the section I'm talking about. 
    Thus, Subsection (b) reflects the present status of the law, namely that the Court is composed of not only circuit judges of the circuit in active service or whom there more -- be more than three. 
    But the circuit justice or justices and judges who maybe assigned or designated to the Court, see Textile Mills Security Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 
    And all the revisers did when they revised 43 (b) was include the new class of judges who could be designated and assigned to the Court and gave them the same competency, and intended to give them the same competency to sit with the Court en bank that this Court held the circuit justice had under the former Section 120.

    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    Yes sir. 
    It's quoted on Section 35 and 36. 
    Now, the Reviser's Note is at the bottom of 35 of my main brief. 
    And now -- now, Your Honor, I would like to call your attention to this case of (Inaudible). 
    I think it's very important because it correlates all the cases in which there were mandatory jurisdictional statutes. 
    And in that case, the Court pointed out and that's on page 27 of my brief. 
    I have that. 
    The Court pointed out, this was the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. 
    “That it was authorized to call in a justice of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to sit with the Court while a vacancy exists.” 
    Then it says, that's on page 27, “Between the submission of a case and its final disposition, weeks may intervene.” 
    And it goes on and says --all right, yes. 
    “And if during that period, the justice whose place the additional justice had taken must remain -- remain away from the Court although ready to act, it would greatly impede, the dispatch of the public business here.” 
    Ever since the organization of the Court, it has been the practice for the additional justice to participate in the opinions and judgments in cases argued before the Court while he was on the bench although the regular justice whose place he had been appointed to fill had returned to his duties before the judgments ran out. 
    The right of the additional justice to do so has never been questioned by anyone so far as we know. 
    Now, they point out --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1872.972" stopTime="1875.204">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    Well, if (Voice Overlap) the statute isn't clear and unambiguous terms said or otherwise, I assume it would not be true but the Courts have been always refused to interpret a statute that way unless it was very clear that the legislature had so intended. 
    As a matter of fact, I only -- though I've said that I know of no case in which they actually have so held and I think I've read all. 
    They've always said the language is not clear enough so as to lead us to believe that the legislature intended so capricious a result, a result which would so -- as to badly interfere with the administration of justice as to take a judge who heard a case off the court. 
    Now, they -- they have said that the legislature's intention was unmistakable. 
    We hold the other way. 
    But in the most mandatory statute, they said, “We don't believe it.” 
    And they've even said, “We don't believe it even when the language literally says that. 
    We don't believe that's what Congress intended.

speaker="arthur_m_becker" startTime="2223.518" stopTime="2343.145">
    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    Your Honor, that's precisely -- that was precisely the point of Judge Hincks' opinion and I agree with it thoroughly. 
    For almost a hundred years, this Court starting with the case in the United States against Kirby which I've cited has said that statutes which lead to an absurd and unreasonable result should not be literally read so as to read to that -- lead to that result. 
    They said, “We are not to interpret such statutes. 
    We want to make exceptions. 
    We need exceptions into them.” 
    Now, even the dissenting judges in this case who felt that they were compelled by a -- what I consider a pseudo literal reading of Section 46 (c) to object that Judge Medina is sitting on a court said, “They regarded judges in his position, their --their participation in such cases as desirable and beneficial but they doubted the wisdom of excluding a judge who had sat on the court from -- from participating in its decision.” 
    And I think under those circumstances, following the traditional way in which this Court has interpreted the legislation, this sort of an exception or this sort of a policy should be read into it. 
    We ought not to say that if in other cases, it would lead to a bad result, we can cross those bridges when we come to it but we are not to say now that where it would lead to an obviously good result, we should bar the judge from sitting. 
    And I think that's what every court has done in four circuits. 
    They've always done that. 
    They have never let the new judge come in because that would obviously require a rehearing. 
    How can he come in as a sort of second class member of a court? 
    He has to know what went on to intelligently decide the case and they won't bar the old judge from participating in the case. 
    Every single case has said that. 
    Now, I -- I don't want to take all the time because --

    Mr. Arthur M. Becker 
    No, sir, I think it's exactly the same because I want to point out and I want to point out that in this connection, there's another statute which says that no retired judge shall perform any judicial duties without being designated or stand assigned. 
    And we pointed out that Judge Median decided 36 cases, three-judge cases without a designation of assignment. 
    Judge Magruder decided 25.

    Mr. Fort.
speaker="j_franklin_fort" startTime="2649.969" stopTime="2692.649">
    Mr. J. Franklin Fort 
    Your Honors please. 
    My argument will have to be cut down some but what I would like to deal with primarily is the question of what is the practical solution to this problem. 
    In both the Textile Mills case and the Western Pacific case, this Court has held that there is considerable liberality in the constitution of en -- en banc courts and that -- that any interpretation of the statute which will aid in the smoother administration of justice should be adopted. 
    Now, we think that taking the date of the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2692.649" stopTime="2705.176">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's a rather broad statement, Mr. Fort.

    Mr. J. Franklin Fort 
    Well, Your Honor, it --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2705.893" stopTime="2708.565">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It might be highly desirable for that to -- it will --
speaker="j_franklin_fort" startTime="2708.565" stopTime="2722.711">
    Mr. J. Franklin Fort 
    It was a broad statement but -- but in -- in Textile Mills, it was stated that if there is any ambiguity or doubt about the statute that the interpretation which reaches a practical result is the interpretation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2722.711" stopTime="2727.740">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Or you could create an ambiguity that reaches a very undesirable result.
speaker="j_franklin_fort" startTime="2727.740" stopTime="2832.157">
    Mr. J. Franklin Fort 
    Your Honor, in picking the date on which the en banc court is constituted, we think that there will result certainty insofar as the judges themselves are concerned and as well as the litigants in the course of the completion of the case. 
    Any judge who becomes a member of the en banc court will know that the work that he does on the case and will be accepted or considered that whatever -- whatever his views are, they will be considered by the other judges and that his -- his views will be considered in the final decision whether it be as a part of the dissent or a part of the majority. 
    The rule in respect to district judges and in respect to panel judges clearly is that they shall be permitted to continue with the consideration of any case which is given to them to decide irrespective of whether they retire or not and that they can finish the judicial business and we feel that this rule which seems to be of universal acceptance should be accepted from the point of view of the en banc courts. 
    Again, from the point of view of the litigants, as the court below pointed out, if the Court must be reconstituted every time there is a change in the constitution of the group of judges in the circuit, then questions will arise concerning re-argument, resubmission of briefs and it will no doubt delay the completion of the en banc consideration of the case.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2832.157" stopTime="2843.858">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    This is not a very powerful argument really because if the rule went as the Government would have it, it's not a very serious matter to a judge sitting on a case to accommodate his retirement to the finishing of the (Voice Overlap).
speaker="j_franklin_fort" startTime="2843.858" stopTime="2914.197">
    Mr. J. Franklin Fort 
    Well, Your Honor, I don't accept that argument. 
    I -- I don't think that a judge can feasibly accommodate his retirement to the completion of a case which is uncertain and I think this case is an excellent example of that because the en banc consideration began in December 1957 and wasn't completed until February 1959. 
    And there was a 15-month lag there during which -- presumably on the Government's theory, Judge Medina should have postponed his retirement. 
    In addition to which if he remains an active judge as I read the statutes, he would have to take a full case load until the en banc case was -- was decided and it would clearly interfere and impede retirements by the circuit judges which are encouraged. 
    Now, the retirements on our theory would permit the judge to retire, to participate in the decision, a new judge to be appointed who in turn could take on new duties in the Court.

    Intra-circuit conflicts.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2931.881" stopTime="2940.336">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, if that is one of the reasons, does that cut against your argument in there?
speaker="j_franklin_fort" startTime="2940.336" stopTime="3006.963">
    Mr. J. Franklin Fort 
    You Honor, no, I don't -- well, it will depend upon what the constitution of the en banc court was but on the Government's rule, a judge can be dropped only but cannot be added. 
    Whereas in the rule that we have vacating, we taking the date on which the Court has convened, you will have a -- a court which presumably can take the case to a final decision with a recourse only to this Court after the decision is rendered. 
    Now, we have -- in the Second Circuit, we have had three changes.During the course of these en banc proceedings, Judge Medina retired, Judge Hincks has retired and Judge Friendly has been appointed. 
    There is a vacancy, there has not been a substitute appointed for Judge Hincks. 
    There is legislation pending which might result in two new justices being -- judges being appointed to that circuit and if the case is remanded, the -- the status of all of those judges perhaps will come into question.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3006.963" stopTime="3030.312">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But what I'm asking for was, if that's one of the reasons that I should think probably or I'm not sure that we have the points decided by the judges who are to remain there after that time would come nearer, stabilizing the law so far as the intra-circuit situation is concerned.
speaker="j_franklin_fort" startTime="3030.312" stopTime="3085.289">
    Mr. J. Franklin Fort 
    Well, that -- I think that it is -- is questionably, Your Honor, although it -- as I say, it depends upon the way the votes of the judges are cast. 
    Now, here we had a five-judge court below which was properly convened under the en banc statute and they were able to resolve the intra-circuit conflict. 
    On the Government's rule, Judge Medina would have been ineligible to sit on the decision and the conflict would not have been resolved. 
    I don't think that we can say that our rule is full proof but we think that it is -- creates much more certainty and will avoid delays in the functioning of the en banc court. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Philip Elman
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3085.289" stopTime="3086.049">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Elman.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="3086.049" stopTime="3392.995">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Section 1 of Title 28, United States Code provides -- the Supreme Court of the United States shall consist of a Chief Justice of the United States and eight Associate Justices, any six of whom shall constitute a quorum. 
    That language exactly parallels 46 (c), “a court en banc shall insist.” 
    If 46 (c) is to be interpreted as meaning a court en bank shall include, but shall not be limited to all active circuit judges of the circuit, it would be very difficult not to read Section 1 of Title 28 as meaning the Supreme Court of the United States shall include, but not be limited to the chief justice and eight associate justices. 
    On the question of the disqualification of retired members of this Court to participate in cases which they heard before retirement, there's no provision of the statute which says that they may not do so but there is a provision of the statute which provides affirmatively what duties -- what judicial duties may be performed by members of this Court. 
    That's Section 294 (a) of the Code which provides that any retired chief justice of the United States or associate justice of the Supreme Court may be designated and assigned by the Chief Justice of the United States to perform such judicial duties in any circuit including those of a circuit justice as he is willing to undertake by implication since the statute does not authorize the retired justice to be designated and assigned to sit in this Court, he may not do so. 
    The same argument we submit, same line of statutory construction should apply to Section 46 (c). 
    We do not think that this Court, unless it gives the words different meanings and different provisions can say that a court en -- en banc shall consist of -- of active circuit judges of the circuit who sit when the case is heard. 
    Mr. Justice Burton as I recall retired at a time when there were cases that he had participated in it remained undecided. 
    Now, that was true of Mr. Justice Minton and other justices who -- who retired from this Court. 
    You cannot say and it has never been suggested by anyone so far as we know that because he was -- the retired justice was a member of the Supreme Court consisting of a chief justice and eight associate justices of whom he was one and therefore, could participate in the decision and cast a vote after he was retired. 
    Retired judges of the Circuit -- of the -- of the Courts of Appeals maybe assigned judicial duties as they are willing to undertake. 
    Section 28 U.S.C. 294 says that any retired circuit or district judge may be designated and assigned to perform such judicial duties in any circuit as he is willing to undertake. 
    But that doesn't permit him to be assigned to judicial duties in any circuit that the statute says he is incompetent to undertake, anymore than that -- that would be true in the case of this Court. 
    In respect to en banc proceedings, a retired justice -- a retired judge is no different from a resigned judge. 
    Now, there have been some citations given to Your Honors. 
    We've discussed them in our brief and I'll -- and I -- I think perhaps there's been an indiscriminate proof of those cases and I will repeat. 
    There is no case in which any judge, retired circuit judge has sat in an en banc proceeding after his retirement, no case. 
    If he has retired before the en banc court was convened, there is no case in which the retired judge has sat. 
    There is no case in which a retired judge has voted to grant rehearing en banc. 
    There is a different problem as to denying rehearings en banc, they are participating in the deliberations. 
    There is no case in any circuit in which a retired judge or an assigned judge has cast an effective vote to grant rehearing en banc. 
    There is the related problem as to three-judge courts, the problem imposed by the Goldfine case numbered 36 -- 396 pending our petition for certiorari. 
    As I said, Section 46 (c) deals only with en banc proceedings and has nothing to do with three-judge decisions. 
    The only question -- the only possible question in those cases is whether -- where a judge has retired after the hearing but before the decision, whether it is necessary that there'd be an additional formal written designation and assignment. 
    There isn't a question of his competency to sit. 
    Of course a retired circuit judge may continue to sit if he is assigned. 
    The only question is the -- the formal one and no --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that assumes that designation is formal and Congress may have made -- may have made the requirement as a piece of paper, the essential things. 
    I don't see that the argument is advanced by calling that formal and this power.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="3426.917" stopTime="3440.811">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    I withdraw the word formal. 
    All I -- all I'm suggest -- all I'm saying is that as to three-judge panel, participation by a retired judge, there is no question or -- as to his power, his right, his competency --

    None.

speaker="philip_elman" startTime="3445.370" stopTime="3460.323">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    That's right. 
    And the question is whether the statute requires a chief judge who -- who sits alongside judge -- whether chief -- putting it concretely, whether Chief Judge Woodbury had to give Judge Magruder sitting in the very same case --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3460.323" stopTime="3460.437">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="3460.437" stopTime="3469.527">
    Mr. Philip Elman

    But -- but you answered Justice Black earlier that you don't have to bother by policy considerations if the statute commands.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="3478.135" stopTime="3481.331">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Precisely -- of course and -- and the question is what does a statute command in a three-judge --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3481.331" stopTime="3491.036">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It says it should be designated. 
    I don't have to go beyond if Congress wants to make a red tape or a blue ribbon of requirement, I must vow to it.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="3491.036" stopTime="3497.025">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    But the statute doesn't say that a designation shall consist of a piece of paper and to sit in that situation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3497.025" stopTime="3515.617">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if you say that definition is satisfied because the -- and presumably, he did that to him, that's a different story again. 
    But I don't like to have cases of this technicality disposed of. 
    And by technicality, I don't need to use an invidious adjective. 
    I simply say confining word. 
    That's what I mean by a technicality.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="3515.617" stopTime="3526.671">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    That problem is not presented in this case. 
    I mentioned it only because counsel has -- has referred to that situation which when I -- I am hoping only to make the point that it's distinguishable and raised it that way.

    I don't think I have to shut off while considering the whole nature of these problems or what to do with this conventional fact that retired judges are as a matter of fact, as a matter of practice, as a matter of design, fulfilling upon through of those who are really active judges.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="3549.495" stopTime="3573.396">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Yes, in all situations except en banc situations that it's the same. 
    The only question is one of the designation and assignment. 
    As to en banc, we repeat, even the -- even the -- in a certified designation and assignment signed by all of the members of this Court and the -- and the judicial conference and all the judicial counsels couldn't possibly give judgment, namely the right to participate in this case en banc.

    Mr. Philip Elman
