Huron Portland Cement Company v. City of Detroit

    Mr. Alfred E. Lindbloom 
    -- claiming that the license in and of itself was (Inaudible) although it is -- it is some evidence of -- of preemption. 
    Congress, in respect to steamships and in respect to vessels on navigable waters, it passed very elaborate regulations as this Court said in Kelly versus Washington --

    Mr. Alfred E. Lindbloom 
    -- the steam vessels are extremely detailed. 
    And they are. 
    They provide for the inspection of the hull, the lifeboats, the equipment on the vessels not only the boilers, but all the other equipment and specify the number of crew and so many seamen, so many pilots and so many mates and so on. 
    They're extremely detailed and it is my claim that by those acts, Congress has preempted the field that is that the control, the inspection and approval of steamships. 
    Therefore, the city --

    From what point of view?

    I beg your pardon?

    Safety.
speaker="alfred_e_lindbloom" startTime="76.376" stopTime="170.779">
    Mr. Alfred E. Lindbloom 
    But I don't think that the point of view makes any difference if they preempted -- if they preempted the entire field of -- of inspecting and approving vessels whether -- whether -- I don't think it makes any difference what point of view you referred to as this Court said in Napier versus Atlantic Coast Guards, they say hoarding because the standard set by -- by the Commission, that's the ICC, must prevail. 
    Requirements of the State are precluded however commendable or however different their purpose. 
    So, it's my contention that Congress has preempted the field and therefore, the city cannot come along and say, “Here, you got -- your -- your equipment is subject to inspection and approval by us,” when it's already been inspected and approved by the Coast Guard. 
    And as to the penalty provisions, I claim that inasmuch as the penalty provisions can only be -- can only be complied with by changing your equipment, therefore, they are specifying the kind of equipment that we may -- we must use. 
    In other words, we can only use that equipment which complies with the Detroit ordinance. 
    And keep -- bearing in mind that Congress has already preempted the field of the control of -- of vessels and their equipment.

speaker="alfred_e_lindbloom" startTime="221.404" stopTime="283.770">
    Mr. Alfred E. Lindbloom 
    That's right. 
    And it is my contention that the inspection provisions, in respect to vessels, are as broad as the boiler inspection for the railroads. 
    And this Court in Napier versus Atlantic Coast Guard -- Atlantic Coast Line there, two States came along and wanted some additional equipment put on, put on the -- the locomotives. 
    This automatic door and a cabin curtain, not changing the equipment, they're putting on something addition, something which the Interstate Commerce Commission had not ordered. 
    And this Court said that the Congress by the Boiler Inspection Act had preempted the field. 
    I claim that same reasoning is true here. 
    And therefore, those two state statutes were invalid.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="283.770" stopTime="301.975">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Your preemption -- your preemption argument goes to the extent of saying that every time that the Coast Guard licenses a vessel to operate in navigable waters, that means the State is removed from any kind of local police control.

    No. 
    No, it doesn't. 
    No, no, Your Honor. 
    The point I'm trying to make -- again, making myself clear yet. 
    If -- if you can comply with the local police regulations with the vessel as licensed, obviously, they'd have to comply with it.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    For example, what you -- what you point -- I suppose, your real point of emphasis is on page 41 of the record where the Coast Guard officer specifies the type of boilers that you have for use and the type of fuel that you have for use.

    How about -- how about the -- the diesel -- big diesel trucks? 
    Certainly, the -- the local communities and the States can have something to say about the smoke they emit and what's the difference between that and -- and the situation that Justice Frankfurter has just spoken to you about?
speaker="alfred_e_lindbloom" startTime="382.844" stopTime="412.949">
    Mr. Alfred E. Lindbloom 
    Well, I think there's this distinction as a -- as a point -- I mean, I think, there's this distinction. 
    This Court has -- has granted the States much greater leeway in the control of the speed and the safety on highways and you -- you frankly, just about made an exception as to -- to highways and Railway Express versus New York.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="412.949" stopTime="473.938">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No, but I -- I don't think that's -- that isn't the point that I'm trying to make. 
    This -- this big diesel trucks, if they don't have something on the -- on their exhaust, emit this -- this smoke as they go along in the highway to -- to the -- the detriment of traffic and to create smog conditions and other -- other things of that kind. 
    And -- and probably they can't operate without doing that, unless they put some attachment on their -- on their truck. 
    But if they do put in -- an attachment on there, they can diffuse that smoke, so that it doesn't create those hazardous conditions. 
    Now, what is the difference between -- if -- if I'm correct in that, what is the difference between compelling him to put something -- some equipment on their automobile to control that -- that smoke on the one hand then on the other hand, requiring you to do somewhat similar thing with your boilers --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, it's a question -- maybe a question of degree, but we're going here to power -- to the question of whether the Federal Government has preempted this field and whether the State has any power at all.

    Mr. Alfred E. Lindbloom 
    I think -- I think there's another answer to Your Honor's question that has slipped me for a moment. 
    I think this Court has found under the -- under the Motor Carrier Act that Congress has not preempted the field as to, you know, size, roads and -- and control of the highway. 
    I think they've expressly left that to the State. 
    I think that's your distinction.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="517.568" stopTime="541.700">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But there is nothing in -- nothing in this Act as you have said -- you have told us that specifically shows that they've covered this situation either. 
    And there's nothing in their inspection practices or in their regulations that show that they -- they have any concern with this. 
    And why doesn't that bear on the question of preemption in the same way as -- as that you have described?
speaker="alfred_e_lindbloom" startTime="541.700" stopTime="563.641">
    Mr. Alfred E. Lindbloom 
    Well, no.

    Do I make myself clear?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They're not two steps, if I may say so. 
    It's because the license -- your argument is, is because the license came out the federal statute and the license has particularity as to what you're authorized to do, that therefore, there is preemption. 
    It isn't that you have a license and preemption.

    Mr. Alfred E. Lindbloom 
    That's the way I understand it. 
    Now, getting to this license business for just a minute, as I said earlier, in this -- in this Service Storage and Transfer case, there -- there the storage company was charged with just carrying 3% of its freight in intrastate and they were fined $3500, and this Court held that to have sustained, that fine would be tantamount to a partial cancelation of the license. 
    It seems to me that language is very applicable here and in the Castle versus Hayes Freight Line case, there -- there, the freight line had been overloading in violation of the state law and there was no doubt that the State had the right to pass such a law and they barred -- the State barred the -- the carrier from use of the highway. 
    And this Court said, “You couldn't do that because they have a federal license certificate and they have the right to use the highway even though they have violated the state law.” 
    And in both of those cases, the carrier could comply with the state law with the equipment of which he has had. 
    One case, it wouldn't have to carry freight from Virginia to Virginia and the other one, it didn't have to overload. 
    But here, we have -- here we have a different thing and it seems to me that a little bit of language from Hill versus Florida is -- is rather applicable to our situation here. 
    There you -- there, this Court said that “But here, the agent has been enjoined and if the Florida law is valid, he could be found guilty of a contempt of doing that which the act of Congress permits him to do. 
    Here, we could be found guilty of violating the -- violating the smoke ordinance when Congress has permitted us to do so.

    Mr. Alfred E. Lindbloom

    That's my argument.

    Mr. Alfred E. Lindbloom 
    That's right. 
    And my second argument is that the Commerce Clause in and of itself, preempts the fields where uniformity is necessary. 
    I claim, I'm talking about uniformity of equipment. 
    The city and I differ as to what should be uniformed. 
    They talk about uniformity of smoke control. 
    I -- I grant you that that doesn't require a uniform treatment. 
    But it seems to me that the equipment on the vessels must be uniformed and I point to Morgan versus Virginia and Southern Pacific versus Arizona, Kelly versus Washington and Friedman versus New York. 
    And it seems to me that those cases all hold that where -- where your equipment is necessary, in the constitutional sense, that is useful, for the purpose for which it is intended that requires uniformity and therefore, the city is precluded from passing an ordinance which would make us use something different -- or -- or precludes the city from passing an ordinance governing that -- the equipment. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John F. Hathaway
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1161.722" stopTime="1164.893">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Hathaway, you may proceed.
speaker="john_f_hathaway" startTime="1164.893" stopTime="1353.640">
    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    The City of Detroit adopted the smoke ordinance in question about 13 years ago and approximately a little of four years ago, issued the violation that is in question in here and pursuant to the provisions of the ordinance in question here. 
    The violation that we issued was a violation that stated that the appellant, in this case, issued smoke in violation in Section 2. 2A, which limits the emission of smoke in -- to a certain density. 
    The provision is governed pursuant to a Ringelmann Chart which provides that you cannot issue -- smoke cannot be emitted to any greater density than would be showing at a No. 2 Ringelmann chart. 
    This is a standard form of rate of measuring smoke for the purposes of a Smoke Abatement Code and it's probably in effect in all 48 States and probably on every industrial community in the country. 
    Now, after we issued the violation, the plaintiff went into the Circuit Court. 
    Plaintiff or appellant here, went into the Circuit Court of the County of Wayne and asked for an injunction to restrain us from enforcing the ordinances as to him, claiming that he was engaged in interstate commerce. 
    That is ship had been approved by Coast Guard pursuant to the federal regulations and that he could be prosecuted, but only for the negligent operation of that equipment, combustion equipment, which is -- the smoke the issue is from. 
    Now Circuit Court of the County of Wayne determined only one question. 
    They determined that the ordinance was a reasonable regulation and that the city had the right to issue that violation, in question, and prohibit the emission of dense smoke. 
    And this was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State of Michigan. 
    Now, the appellant is before this Court arguing that question of preemption. 
    I think that the general -- when you consider the general rules of preemption, this Court has determined that when there's an actual conflict shown or there is a repugnancy, or if Congress has manifested the clear intent to regulate the field that you're talking about, then the cities or states do have the right to adopt the regulation. 
    Now, first of all, when you consider the regulation in question and the federal regulation, I don't think Congress concerned themselves in any way with the emission of smoke and that would be -- I mean, there's no provision within that regulation. 
    The original regulation, in answer to a question here, was adopted in 1871. 
    In this regulation, from checking the various sections of that code, only goes to the question of the equipment of that ship. 
    They make a thorough inspection of that ship from the hull to the combustion equipment, to the lifeboats and every other boat, only for the purpose to determine that that boat can leave the dock and travel in safety. 
    And for no other purpose, this was the intent of Congress.

    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    Well -- I mean, a smoke ordinance is not there. 
    We don't just issue tickets. 
    I mean, primarily, what you do is issue notices of violation first. 
    I mean, because there are many problems and being a local regulation with our own people, I mean, you're forcing people to spend a million dollars in the City of Detroit to change some of their equipment. 
    And, I think in this County of Los Angeles, the oil industry has spent probably $40 million changing certain equipment.

    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    Well, that could be -- certainly, this notices of violation, we then try to arrange conferences between the people that own the various equipment --

    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    -- and just ask them, if they would be able to do anything. 
    Well, and we start out from that point and they start changing their equipment or doing whatever is necessary to try to bring the smoke down to where it could comply with our ordinance. 
    And then --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1877.886" stopTime="1880.639">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    And in the most instances, do you work it out?
speaker="john_f_hathaway" startTime="1880.639" stopTime="1993.700">
    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    In most cases, yes. 
    Now, as to the regulation of vessels, it's very difficult for the City of Detroit to enforce this ordinance for the simple reason. 
    When a vessel is on the Detroit River, you can never tell without a range finder or unless it's in a specific location whether or not the -- the ship is on the American side or the Canadian side. 
    Now, we do not have any jurisdiction on the Canadian side of the river and it would be up to the Canadian Government to enforce their regulations as to air pollution on that side. 
    There's only a certain specific location in the Detroit River although a ship might proceed the whole length of the river, emitting this smoke. 
    If they are emitting smoke at this one specific location, when we know for sure that they are on the Detroit side of the river, and we know this because the water in the Canadian side at this point is so shallow that they could not proceed through there. 
    We then give them a ticket. 
    And we don't always prosecute on those tickets. 
    If they would come into our bureau and put themselves to that bureau before, to discuss the matter to see what could be done if directed -- this -- this matter by continuing violations. 
    Because we know that they do have a problem and we do give them time and that we like the railroads in changing over from steam to diesel and I'm speaking specifically of the railroads that do the switching within the City of Detroit, we give them a period of approximately eight years we agreed that they would take eight years to change their equipment. 
    Because I mean, you just can't win it. 
    Have railroad pull 40 to 50 switch engines out of business and leave them with nothing to operate with, so, I mean that's it's -- it's -- make -- have to make adaptation of the ordinance.

    Well, this example, Pittsburgh Steamship Company has approximately 20 ships and about 10 of them comply -- when I talk -- when you talk about comply -- I mean, by -- by that we mean, able to comply with our emission standards and our code. 
    They say they -- they will change the other ships. 
    The rest of the fleet will change. 
    I mean, we're having this problem. 
    Many will change, if the others would change, but nobody wants to spend their money unless the other ships in the same classification will spend the money.

    Well, I know that the City of New York has, the City of New Orleans, the County and City of Los Angeles, and then they have in San Francisco, they have what they call a Bay Area ordinance. 
    It's an application of probably six counties which was adopted pursuant to a state regulation out there. 
    Now, these, l know, for sure because we worked with these people and the City of New Orleans, I know, from the opinion of the Attorney General of the State of Michigan where he contacted the district legal officer of the United States Coast Guard where he stated about the -- the problems in the City of New Orleans in enforcing their ordinances to ships.

    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    This is true. 
    You -- any equipment can smoke. 
    You can take the finest oil burning equipment and if you don't operate it right, in other words you have to have a mixture of oxygen and the fluid that you're burning of just the proper mixture. 
    I mean, the United States Navy could take their whole fleet from -- I think, from San Diego to the harbors of Japan and never allow any smoke to be seen on the horizon. 
    I mean, this is not an impossible situation. 
    But, if you come in and something goes wrong with the equipment, then they're liable to smoke or if it's operated carelessly, it would smoke.

    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    As this one. 
    Now, in that case, what happened there, they point out that it -- at least the Supreme Court of New York did that this steamship was not immune from prosecution. 
    They could be prosecuted, but the lower court did not allow this -- the Queen Mary to -- to interject a defense that at the time that the smoke was emitted, some equipment had been broken down or a situation existed where they could do nothing but smoke. 
    I mean, that seems to be reasonable.

speaker="john_f_hathaway" startTime="2266.531" stopTime="2412.897">
    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    Yes. 
    But my explanation for that is, let's assume for the sake of argument that an -- a city adopted a more stringent regulation that could not be complied with, we'll say, with an underfeed stoker. 
    If it could not be complied with an underfeed stoker, I don't think it can be applied within the boiler either. 
    I don't think. 
    This I'm not too sure. 
    However, if that ordinance that was reasonable, as to that community, for the necessary -- and necessary for the health of those citizens, I think that that type of regulation should be more stringent. 
    Maybe you would have to change this equipment again. 
    In the City of Los Angeles, they have developed an ordinance which goes beyond almost anything. 
    They still provide for this No. 2 Ringelmann. 
    It's the same type of density. 
    But what they have done, they have provided for what they call an alert system where they -- as that smog in that area continues to get thicker, they will then notify certain people and they will the announcements on radios and other types of publications to request that people will quit driving. 
    After they go through so many alert systems and when they reach the final system, they provide for a notice to the governor and then the governor -- this is what it says, but in effect, it amounts to like martial law. 
    Or they're going to trucks off the street and the automobiles and people will be refused permission to drive until that smog has either raised (Inaudible) that he's presented here -- the steamships could go into the harbors at Los Angeles and while they were carrying people to the hospital, he would be able to say, “We're awfully sorry about -- we're going to have to continue the smoke.” 
    No, I don't think that the Commerce Clause was intended to be anything more than that there would be for the general welfare of all the people of the country. 
    In other words, the Commerce Clause, I think, should be interpreted that it benefits all of us and that it would -- and there should be no barriers put up to stop the free flow of commerce. 
    But I don't think it should be turned around and say, “Well, while it's benefiting certain people, the others must all suffer a detriment to their health.” 
    I don't think that the Commerce Clause has provided that we can protect the concrete on -- on our streets. 
    We can't protect their lungs in this type of contamination and air pollution.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2412.897" stopTime="2474.357">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Mr. Hathaway, last -- in our last term, we had a highway case where we struck down a law of the State of -- of Illinois under the Commerce Clause and in that case, the State of Illinois required certain equipment on trucks that flaps on them for rainy weather, for bad weather. 
    Now, the -- the contention was -- contention was made on the part of those who were attacking the ordinance that if they complied with this Illinois law as soon as they got over into -- into Arkansas, that that equipment would be illegal and that because of that, it was -- it would be a burden on commerce. 
    Now, do you have anything of that kind in this -- in this case?

    Almost every -- they couldn't -- if he lessens his -- the output of the smoke, he could not then be in violation of another community, because, I mean, that would be their purpose, too. 
    The only purpose of any regulation is to limit the emission of smoke. 
    And I mean, if you -- if I -- if the City of Detroit is instrumental in making the instrument then our state commerce emit less smoke, it could not necessarily be in violation of another community.

    Well, then, how -- how are you to protect yourself when smoke from a Canadian -- on the Canadian side, to just a detriment of Detroit and ask if the ship were over on the Detroit side, which is a narrow river?

    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    The problem has been this. 
    10 years ago, the City of Detroit and the State of Michigan asked the International Joint Commission to make the study to see if there would a federal regulation and the Canadian regulations.

    Maybe what I asked you involved so -- it is just a curiosity.

    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    There was just one more point that I wish to bring to this Court's attention. 
    The plaintiff argues that we are demanding inspection and licensing. 
    I would like to point out that we have never demanded an annual inspection. 
    We have never demanded that they obtain a license. 
    There's no provision exactly for licenses, what they call a certificate of compliance. 
    Being a local regulation, when the matter was adopted, when the ordinance was adopted, we wanted anybody to put in new furnaces, new equipment to obtain permits in the City of Detroit, the building department. 
    And subsequent to that, they would make an inspection as to their proper installation and also to the smoke characteristics. 
    At least the Smoke Abatement Bureau would do this. 
    Now, it's our contention that we also adopted a severability clause within our own ordinance. 
    And the purpose of that natural indefinite severability clause is so that if there are any provisions within the ordinance which would be unconstitutional or be in contravention of the -- of the Constitution of the United States or the State of Michigan, that this section could be eliminated and not considered. 
    Now, the inspection and licensing of steamship has never been contemplated by the City of Detroit. 
    13 years, we've never demanded it or in any other instrument of --

speaker="john_f_hathaway" startTime="3946.752" stopTime="3966.507">
    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    Now, that section also was adopted which provides that -- we don't say that -- seizure of ships. 
    All it says is that equipment, if in -- used in the City of Detroit, violates our ordinance three times, we then can seal the equipment. 
    Is this the section you're referring to?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3966.507" stopTime="3967.072">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes. 
    Well in --

    Now --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    We're in the same results.
speaker="john_f_hathaway" startTime="3969.737" stopTime="4029.617">
    Mr. John F. Hathaway 
    Now, we have never done that. 
    That section also provides that if we can't obtain service on the owner of our process, that we will post a notice on the premises at the place of violation which would require us to post a notice somewhere in the middle of the Detroit River. 
    I mean this in -- this section of the ordinance was clearly intended as a local regulation from there. 
    We've never applied it to any instrument in -- engaged in interstate commerce. 
    And if the Court is to be concerned with that section, we argue that our ordinance is severable. 
    These sections have no application and no necessity except in aids in enforcing the purpose of the ordinance which is the control of what comes out of the stack and not a regulation of the combustion and equipment, except that I suppose in -- by inference.
