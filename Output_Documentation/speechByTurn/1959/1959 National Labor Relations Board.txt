    And some of these cases are pending in the various Courts of Appeals and some of them of course, the Court of Appeals has enforced the Board's order. 
    We have the Sullivan case from the Fourth Circuit is (Inaudible) and in others like this one here or the Second Circuit case that I referred to the Court of Appeals has set aside, has set aside those orders.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now, you have the statutes -- the statute now that covers it. 
    What I was interested in is what is the very importance of keeping those orders, it -- it may be very important keeping those orders out, when you have a statute with that law is the same to that?
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="96.195" stopTime="116.461">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Well, Your Honor, I think it is important to determine the reach of the Board's power under 8 (b) (1) (A) because the Board believes that -- that the -- the new -- the new statute -- the new amendments do not displace its powers under 8 (b) (1) (A) to reach picketing of this kind.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="116.461" stopTime="121.740">

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    In this particular case, it would have made not, but there are cases where it can make a considerable difference. 
    In the first place --

speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="132.666" stopTime="171.779">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Yes, let me explain if I may. 
    The -- this question here is part of a broader play and that is whether the union may use coercive economic weapons for the purpose of obtaining recognition, of obtaining recognition when it's a minority or a stranger union. 
    Now, though these other coercive devices maybe such things as the blacklisting of the employer appeals to consumers to boycott him. 
    Now, the Board has held in the cases pending before this Court on petition for certiorari, the Board has held that 8 (b) (1) (A) reaches that kind of course.

speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="230.957" stopTime="239.975">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Or would -- either that 8 (b) (7) would not be practical to apply to a situation where it wouldn't be practical to apply to it or situations where it didn't apply at all. 
    Let me explain that.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="239.975" stopTime="240.874">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, that doesn't necessary.
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="240.874" stopTime="315.678">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Let me explain that if I may, Your Honor. 
    Now, as I've said, Section 8 (b) (7) makes it illegal to picket, to force or require recognition of the employers to join in three situations. 
    One, where the employer is lawfully recognizing another union, there of course, the picketing would be bad from its inception. 
    It would be legal. 
    We could move in with an injunction against that sort of picketing. 
    The second situation is where the -- within 12 months of the Board election if there is a picketing or recognition or you get the employers to join within 12 months, there too we can move in. 
    But if the last section, Section 8 (b) (7) (C) I believe it is, which says that a -- when --where either of these two situations that I've just described obtains -- obtains, that the union may not picket for a period to exceed 30 days unless within those 30 days, there is a representation petition has been filed. 
    Now, con -- it -- it is possible that under that section, picketing may go on for 30 days or more whether it's there's a representation petition has been filed, but there maybe situations where the special circumstances of the situation may make it desirable and appropriate for the purpose of effectuating the statutory policies to move against picketing --

    Now, the -- I have said that -- Mr. Justice Stewart I think suggested that at the time that these amendments were passed, there was no -- the Court -- I have suggested that there was no intention on the part of Congress to judge the Board's power under 8 (b) (1) (A). 
    And the situation was this that two Courts of Appeals, the Fourth Circuit, and the Court of Appeals below -- Court of Appeals below have reached in 50 answers on this and as Mr. Justice Stewart stated, he's wrong with the very words of one of the dissenters. 
    The law was uncertain. 
    This Court had granted certiorari in -- in this case and Congress did not attempt -- was not attempting to determine this issue but is simply wanted to make sure that whatever the outcome of this litigation, the Board would have some power to deal with both organization and recognition picketing. 
    Now, further, the Board believes that Section 8 (b) (7) does not displace whatever authority -- the authority which we claim that we have under 8 (b) (1) (A), but that its supplements and adds to it because 8 (b) (1) (A) as we read it, reaches only minority picketing.

    Now, and the Board believes, the Board believes that this statute sought to preserve the Board's power under 8 (b) (1) (A) to reach this kind of minority picketing and that this purpose is evidenced by the -- by the Savings Clause of 8 (b) (7). 
    And the Savings Clause provides that this is on page 67 of our brief at the very bottom, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to permit any act which would otherwise be an unfair labor practice under this Section 8 (b). 
    Now, the Board reads that certain sentence as ordered to mean that -- that whatever power the Board have, under 8 (b) (1) (A), to deal with minority picketing is not displaced by this statute. 
    Now, finally, I want to turn to a statement that appears in the conference report on the 1959 amendments.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    No, there isn't and I'm coming to the conference report Your Honor which is perhaps the only bit of history that we've got on this and that is the conference report on these amendments -- this is as quoted at page 59 of our brief at the bottom. 
    The conference report had this sentence. 
    Section 8 (b) (7) overruled the Curtis and Alloy cases to the extent that those decisions are inconsistent with Section 8 (b) (7). 
    But if the Court please, the statute has itself as many ambiguities and I'm afraid this sentence is as much if not more ambiguous in the state -- in the statute itself. 
    But, as we read this -- this sentence and I'm not so sure if there is any other legislative history that you -- that (Inaudible) or reading of it. 
    I will finish in just one moment Your Honor, as we read this -- this statement, Congress -- the conference report or Congress was simply saying the credit -- the force of the -- the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in accordance to the Ninth Circuit in the Alloy case have indicated the Board doesn't have the power to deal with minority picketing under 8 (b) (1) (A) for purposes of recognition. 
    We are overruling those cases and I am now -- and they're supplying and they're supplying whatever deficiencies they may have been but we're not determining, we're not determining whether or not the Board did or did not have the power to deal with this kind of picketing under Section 8 (b) (1) (A).

    In the first place, it doesn't indicate whether they mean the Board's position and the Board's position is being overruled or the Court's decision in those cases which is contrary to the Board's position which is overruled. 
    What I think they've meant is that, regardless of what it --the Board have held -- what the Court have held, those decisions were overruled and this is now the law that Curtis and Alloy are now things of the past and that we now have before us 8 (b) (7) and that is determinative, that's our position here.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Okay.
speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="1537.796" stopTime="1756.456">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    Proceeding, just to restate now the Board's position, so the real extent to which it does go that notwithstanding Section 8 (b) (4) (C) of the Act which deals specifically with recognition picketing, but in a very limited way and notwithstanding, 10 solid years of legislative effort every year in Congress to enlarge 8 (b) (4) (C) to include the type of picketing we have in this case and notwithstanding the fact that in 1959 after discussing the same up and down and back and forth for months in Congress last summer, last Spring, Congress did finally draw the line that seems -- thought should be drawn, the Board states not that it had this authority all along. 
    In fact, all of these that it had, this authority but it had even broader authority. 
    I think the error of the Board's position is implicit in its own very statement and can be shown within the four corners of the Act itself about resorting to much legislative history. 
    First, Section 13 had to be paid a great deal of attention to. 
    This State strikes and picketing which is equated with strikes by this Court in the Rice Milling case and specifically by other circuits under 13. 
    It states that picketing or strikes can be proscribed only if it specifically provided for another sections of the Act. 
    Section 8 (b) (1) (A) certainly does not by its terms specifically proscribe any concerted activity such as those for instance Section 8 (b) (4) which can be said to be a specific prohibition of picketing or striking, because it deals specifically with striking and picketing as such. 
    The Section merely states in a general way that it's an unfair practice to restrain or coerce -- restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of rights set forth in Section 7. 
    Now, for nine solid years, the Board held that the reach and the scope of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was not to interdict or -- or condemn within the phrase coerce any aspects of peaceful striking or picketing. 
    Perry-Norville, the NMUK decided before Perry-Norville and six cases decided after that time between the time of that first decision and now, all held specifically that regardless of how illegal the object might be, the object of union's activities to get a closed shop for instance although a closed shop was proscribed by the Act or other directly admittedly illegal objectives, nevertheless, picketing to secure those objectives could not be indicted or proscribed under Section 8 (b) (1) (A) because peaceful picketing could not be deemed and was never thought to be included within the term coercion. 
    Now, for the first time, the Board argues -- argues flatly that because picketing has -- which we all admit, picketing has the effect of attempting to reach an employer economically and the Board then says that that may reach the employees indirectly in their economic position that the employer loses business. 
    They might suffer -- in their employment conditions that by that indirect means, there has been a accomplished a coercion within the meaning of the term coerce as set forth in Section 8 (b) (1) (A). 
    Well, that was --

speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="1771.370" stopTime="1885.406">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    I'll dwell on that at -- at a little more length later. 
    I'll answer you very briefly now though Your Honor. 
    A readymade and a very traditional objective of union -- unions generally is reached by attempt by minority unions to achieve recognition and indeed, a contract with unorganized employers namely, extending the scope of organization beyond the single shop or extending the scope of organizations -- of organizations and try to bargaining to reach all the shops within an industry or within an area as a means of eliminating the competition from the -- the wage -- capital -- wage competition from the unorganized shops. 
    Since the beginning of trade union history, that's been an objective, there has been picketing carried on to that end by minority unions since the beginning of trade union history, this Court has protected it, the Norris-LaGuardia Act has protected it, the Wagner Act protected it, this Act protects it as I will show later and that is the objective and the -- the matter which unions seek to achieve when they engage in this minority picketing. 
    That is -- is what -- that is the portion of the Section 7 rights. 
    Section 7 goes both to union people and nonunion people. 
    That is of course in the Section 7 rights which is we think protected or preserved in the Act for unions. 
    There maybe other matters in the -- in Section 7 of -- of -- for the nonunion employers such as the right to engage in strike making such activities, but they are certainly at least are correlative rights and we think if Congress wanted to outlaw that traditional right, they would've not done so by a vague, ambiguous, broad sweep of an 8 (b) (1) (A), they would've gone after it directly as they finally have an 8 (b) (7).

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In addition to the general objective that I just stated which I think is an extremely important one, there was this further objective. 
    The union had won an election in that plant and it wanted rather substantially to engage in bargaining. 
    Bargaining collapsed on certain issues. 
    A strike was engaged in. 
    The strikers were replaced by nonstrikers. 
    The nonstrikers or the employer, not that the nonstrikers, the employer at that time called for an election when the people rather on strike as it had the right to do on a much criticized section of this Act. 
    That election obviously was lost. 
    Does the union thereby lose its right to protest or to seek to achieve what it thinks necessary to preserve conditions in the city? 
    We think not.

    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    Now, as Mr. Manoli indicated the legislative history of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) is the -- you can point the statements either way, we think the later legislative history following the statements by Mr. -- by Senator Taft has reported here which occurred prior to the time that the words interfere with were taken out of 8 (b) (1) (A). 
    8 (b) (1) (A) is originally proposed and it was only in the Senate that it was debated and prepared in the House. 
    8 (b) (1) (A) as it originally arose said that there is an awful interfere with restrain or coerce. 
    And Senator Taft was speaking about this -- what he was speaking there at that time then interfered with -- the word “interfere” was taken out and after that, you'll find the debates much more limited and the fact that Senator Taft itself speaks about people can now -- can patrol carrying signs and it can now seek to organize by any peaceful means. 
    He makes that by statement too. 
    But, the legislative history as set forth at length in our brief and I don't think any thing that will be gained by discussing it here further. 
    I -- I think so that we take 8 (b) (A) -- 8 (b) (1) (A) read with the prohibition in Section 13 that the Act can't -- that broad phases in the Act can't be read to proscribe picketing that proscriptions have to be flatly stated or specifically set forth in the Act. 
    If you read those two together, I think there alone, we have an answer to the Board's entire argument here but --

    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    That is right, Your Honor, but this Court had a case at length to consider Section 13 on its application in the Rice Milling case, that's set forth in our brief here. 
    That case involved a -- a situation were picketing alone was involved, picketing of a plant which was not organized or where -- where none of the employees were on strike, not a single one was on strike and this Court protected that picketing within using Section 13 as the means of protecting that picketing. 
    There are other Circuit Court decisions set forth in our brief here, in which the Courts have held one is the Campbell (Inaudible) in the Court of Appeals law here in which the Court have held that picketing as such is directly embraced within Section 13 of the Act. 
    The Board was held so within the term “striking” in Section 13 of the Act.

    They never stop picketing pursuant to that strike. 
    We have the strike here at all times. 
    Even if we have only one -- one man still left, there's still a strike and they still were seeking to -- to get their contracts which they never did get following the certification. 
    So we have a strike, but it's -- it's clear that picketing is -- can be equated with striking under Section 13 and the Board doesn't controvert that here.

    In 8 (b) (4) (C), Congress have before it the specific subject of picketing by minorities or by unions for recognition. 
    And at -- at the first proposal broadly prohibited all picketing for recognition unless the union had a certification and the debate from the proposal ran the whole gamut up and down from the most extreme and finally, after much debate, Congress came out with 8 (b) (4) (C) which restricted recognition picketing only in a very narrow area.

    I don't care about legislative history, I'm interested to know if that's the Act.
speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="2385.603" stopTime="2618.681">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    That's the Act. 
    The Landrum-Griffin Bill was the Bill in the House and there were various versions in this Senate starting with the Kennedy-Erwin Bill and then we finally came up with 8 (b) (7), there. 
    As I indicated earlier, there were, after 8 (b) (C) was enacted, there were nine solid years, each year of which there were attempts in Congress to expand 8 (b) (4) (C) to include all types of minority picketing, each time these proposals were rejected. 
    We have a joint Committee Report a portion of which -- in which Senator Taft was a member of that Committee. 
    Senator Ball, other Senators who took leading part in the debates were members of that Joint Committee and that Joint Committee flatly stated that that is in addition to what Mr. Manoli read, finally stated this the Taft-Hartley laws, I reading at page 36 of my brief, the Taft-Hartley law's only limitation upon minority of such strikes, minority strikes they were talking about is that provided by Section 8 (b) (4) (C). 
    The right to strike of recognition is only foreclosed when another union has been certified. 
    And it goes on to say that the union can strike recognition the day after it loses an election. 
    That's the Joint Committee that Senator Taft, that Senator Ball's view, the people that proposed and got passed Section 8 (b) (1) (A). 
    And they didn't put it on the basis of Board's decision. 
    That is what they regarded the law as standing for it. 
    There is no doubt about that. 
    Then -- then we come now -- then in 1958, there was a -- an even more strenuous effort to get the legislation and appeal of recognition picketing and we set that forth at some length in our brief, but all of those proposals were rejected finally in 1958, including the very 8 (b) -- the Section 8 (b) (7) which finally was enacted in 1959 and efforts were continued to 1959 and again, the proposals run a whole gamut of prohibition and after a long debate, much controversy, and much discussion, Congress finally came out with Section 8 (b) (4) with -- with Section 8 (b) (7) which -- that means, anything that needed the Congress to take in the matter in hand after much study as set what it thinks are the proper boundaries. 
    It thinks now that after there has been an election, union should not take a bet now to the law. 
    But Congress did so by direct language of proscription. 
    It regarded Section 13, it -- it took a counter Section 13 and in proscribing recognition picketing did so by very precise language and it did so in the very areas that are involved in this case. 
    We think that's determinative of this litigation. 
    There is a very recent -- there is only one decision since the passage of the 1959 law which takes up -- which discusses the effect of the 1959 law on the Board's position in this case namely that 8 (b) (1) (A) also can be used to -- to enjoin minority picketing. 
    And the Second Circuit's, it's the Board versus Teamsters Local 182, case is decided November 27, not reported yet except in L.R.R.M. and we've got the citation in our brief, the Court unanimously rejected the Board's reasoning here and said, of course, Congress has taken this matter in hand and -- but it -- it is now enacted and this is the law and 8 (b) (1) (A) cannot be used to permit the Board to have a (Inaudible) commission to -- to deal with other unregulated areas of recognition picketing.

    45 L.R.R.M. 2205, set forth on page 54 in filing of our brief. 
    Now -- now, coming out of the answer to some of the Board's contentions here on the policy -- in the policy area namely that we're seeking to interfere with employees' rights not to join unions and we're seeking to reply our employers to commit unfair practices. 
    But to answer that, we've got to go back a little -- a little -- to earlier decisions of this Court and to other enactments in the field of federal legislation in the field of labor relations, bearing in mind the administrative court in U.S. versus Hutchinson. 
    Perhaps, we have to consider all of these federal laws in the labor field of the comprehensive code to see this what -- how the Congress considers and regards the various rights that are asserted from time to time. 
    As I indicated in an answer to a question from Mr. Justice Whittaker, it is traditionally since the beginning of trade union history than the customer practice of unions to seek to extend organization beyond the single shot. 
    To seek to get all within an all industries, all trades, all shops, within an area organized to prevent the – the wage competition from the nonunion shop, the wage competition for the nonunion shop. 
    That principle has been upheld by this Court in the American Steel Foundries case Chief Justice when Mr. Taft was Chief Justice. 
    In the Apex case, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice Roberts both dealing with Antitrust, Sherman Act and Clayton Act attempts to -- to prevent unions from picketing by -- in -- in -- the minority situations that we have here and the Court -- this Court expressed its understanding of the principle of attempting to spread organization by minority picketing. 
    In a Swing case, this Court expressed similar views in connection by the free speech considerations. 
    The Norris-LaGuardia Act, Section 104 and Section 113 (e) specifically protects minority picketing for recognition from the injunction process at least. 
    And in this connection, we refer the Court to the Fur Workers case, we have it cited in our brief, affirmed here where there was minority picketing and on that premise alone, an injunction was sought and no minority picketing for recognition and the Court denied it. 
    And then in these same Sections to the Norris-LaGuardia Act which protected as against injunctions, the past picketing we had -- we had here before the 1959 amendments were carried on to the both the Wagner Act and to the Taft-Hartley Act.

    That depends on whether coercion, the term coercion as used in 8 (b) (1) (A) can be said or read to include peaceful picketing. 
    Up to this case, it never has been -- Congress never -- up until 1959, never considered peaceful picketing as being coercive or admittedly has -- it brings economic pressure on employer and then maybe on employees and the Board for nine solid years specifically held that picketing cannot -- peaceful picketing cannot be held to the coercion. 
    That all of it was embraced within the term “coercion” was physical violence, mass picketing, beating, things like that.

    Peaceful picketing has never in the long history of litigation on this subject and been considered per se coercive and that in the intimidatory sense. 
    It has been recognized as having consequences, economic consequences in bringing pressures, yes.

    That is right. 
    But if -- again, 8 (b) (1) (A) was not concerned with purposes. 
    It was concerned with means, not purposes. 
    It was concern primarily with - -with means of interference and purposes of strikes and so on were directly on 8 (b) (4) where objectives were spelled out as being unlawful and where striking was spelled out. 
    Picketing was spelled out as being dealt with unlike the situation on Section 8 (b) (1) (A). 
    Now, the -- the only reason I am reciting all this Norris-LaGuardia Act in the history and to carry on of those protection during the Wagner Act and Taft-Hartley is to show that Congress did consider minority picketing a protected activity and certainly, at the very least, if it up until that time, up to the time of Taft-Hartley, the very least it would've done if it didn't want to consider protected anymore would be to out -- outlaw it specifically and that it did not do. 
    And it did not do that until 1959 when it did it at great length in Section 8 (b) (7). 
    There are two other factors in conclusion which would acquire any court to go slow and broadly extending 8 (b) (1) (A). 
    In addition to Section 13, we had Section 8 (C) of the Act which protects the right of peaceful picketing under the Act unless specifically proscribed. 
    Again picketing which is an aspect to free speech is not specifically proscribed under Section 8 (b) (1) (A) and finally, we have the overall considerations stressed so strongly by this Court in the Hot Cargo case that the (Inaudible) American Iron cases which is that since Taft-Hartley is the product of better compromise, better argument in which strongly contending forces were pressing for their various positions, the Court should go extremely slow and should be extremely reluctant to extend the scope of the Act merely by construction and were not clearly commanded by expressed language. 
    We have no such express language in Section 8 (b) (1) (A). 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
