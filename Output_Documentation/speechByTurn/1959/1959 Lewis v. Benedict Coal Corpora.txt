Lewis v. Benedict Coal Corporation

    Mr. Winston, you may proceed.
speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="14.938" stopTime="208.971">
    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    As stated by Mr. Kramer, there are two questions before the Court. 
    The first question involves the controversy between the trustees and Benedict and the second question involves the controversy between Benedict and the union. 
    As noted, if we are in error on the second question, we are wrong, then the first question would become moot. 
    But we think our position is sound in this case so we don't think that the first question will become moot. 
    But in neither event, I agree with Mr. Kramer that it is a question of importance and that this Court should determine it. 
    The first question involves the trustees' claim against Benedict for royalties that the trustees claim are due and owing and for royalties which the trustees claim they had a vested right to. 
    Before discussing that, we come back to the initial contract, that is the contract of 1950 between Benedict and other operators and the union, the National Coal Contract. 
    This contract is an integrated contract. 
    Its provisions are interdependent. 
    A portion of the contract provides for this trust fund. 
    This contract in that portion also sets out Benedict's obligations of payment to the trustees and sets out the method of computation when the obligation accrues and so forth. 
    This contract also contains the settlement of Local Dispute Section, which the Court has considered in the first argument and it is a section that sets out the various steps for the settling of these local disputes and troubles. 
    The key part of this first contract, for our consideration, is Section 3 of the Miscellaneous Clause, which is already been pointed out to the Court. 
    The pertinent part of -- of this clause, rather this clause itself reads as follows, Section 3, “The contracting parties agree that, as a part of the consideration of this contract, any and all disputes, stoppages, suspensions of work and any and all claims, demands or actions growing therefrom or involved therein, shall, by the contracting parties, be settled and determined exclusively by the machinery provided in the settlement of "Local and District Disputes Section of this Agreement, or, if national in character, by the full use of free collective bargaining as heretofore known and practiced in industry.” 
    This contract also hung as a clause which we think is the key to the whole issue and that is the interdependent clause. 
    It reads as follows, “This Agreement is an integrated instrument and its respective provisions are interdependent and shall be effective --

    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    I was reading from page 2 of my brief, sir, in the record. 
    It would be page 107A, page 2 of my brief, page 107A of the record. 
    Now, our position in this case is simple. 
    Well, it is that the trust is the creature of this contract. 
    The trustees' rights are derivative from this contract. 
    Whatever you may call the trustees or whatever position they may claim that they are occupying in this lawsuit, they are still in the position of beneficiaries of this contract when we consider their rights. 
    Since they are the beneficiaries of this contract, they would then be subject to the same defenses and in regards to their claims for royalties that Benedict might assert against the other contracting party, the union. 
    This defense would include offset or failure of consideration or non-performance which we are concerned with here. 
    Now, in the case at bar, the union breached the very provision, that is Section 3 of the Miscellaneous Clause, that was stated to be a part of the consideration of the contract. 
    Now, the trustees, on the other hand, insist that they are merely trustees seeking to recall a trust property, title to which has vested in them. 
    And that brings up the other key question and that is has title to this money sought vested so as to preclude the defenses that Benedict might assert against the union. 
    We state that as to this $76,000, title has not vested. 
    Our reasons are these. 
    In the first place, the money before title can vest in -- in the trustees must be due and owing. 
    Now, to be due and owing, the union, at the time that it is alleged to be due and owing, what the law at the time of the production of the coal upon which the amount is computed, must be in performance of its interdependent obligations to bid in this case, the union was not. 
    In the first strike activity that was a violation of the contract started in the early part of April 1950. 
    To be due and owing, the amount computed from the production of coal must also be free from claims or rights of settle. 
    In this case, it was not.

    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    No, sir, that's my argument, sir. 
    The contract [Laughs] merely says, title vest in money in two situations --

    Yes.

    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    -- that is money paid, one, which is not in issue at this time, and two, money due and owing. 
    Therefore, our position is the key is whether at the time the money is due and owing. 
    We say at the time it is not due and owing or the right of the trustees to assert that it is due and owing is limited because at that time, the union was not in compliance with an interdependent obligation. 
    That is our position, sir.

    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    Yes means it could be offset because if the note had been given because -- because the union had violated another provision of the contract, then we're getting back to the contract. 
    It will be a little different as to whether a note was given or whether a court determines that an amount is due. 
    We get back to the same result.

    I say they owe that to the trustees if at the time of the production of coal, the union is in compliance with its obligations under the contract, which obligations were given as a part of the consideration for Benedict's promise to pay to the trustees.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Your argument finally is there that the trust fund can be made to pay damages on account of the union's conduct even though it's not in the negative with the particular amount due or to the fund.

    It may affect the satisfaction of the claim. 
    But it would not in the end enforcement of the claim. 
    Now, the way we have it here, the District Court said that the union must pay the damage into court and this damage money will first be used to satisfy the claims of the trustees.

    This was a continuing account and of necessity it began in March of 1950, because that's when the contract started, and it continued up until July of 1953. 
    The strikes were also a continuing pattern of activity. 
    The first damaging strike occurred in April. 
    I think --

    The money would be due and owing if, at that time, the union was in compliance and if, at that time, there was no claim to offset. 
    And therefore, title would vest at that time. 
    My position is that at the time the production of these coal occurred, the union was not in compliance and there were rights to offset and therefore, the money was not due and owing and there was not any vesting of trustees' rights at the time of computation of production of coal.

    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    Your Honor, to be fair, that matter was not gone into at the lower courts.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you.
speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="1231.185" stopTime="1460.733">
    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    Between March the 5th, 1950 and September 30, 1952, production 459,000 plus, between October 1st 1952 and July 31st 1953, production was 103,000 plus. 
    Page 151 of the record also shows the stipulation that indicates that, sir. 
    150A or 151A, that shows the stipulation of the man of the coal mine doing the first period, March 5th 1950 to September 30th 1952 was 467,000 tons plus and the second period was 94,000 tons plus, that is October 1st, 1952 through July 1953. 
    Getting back to the points and issues, the trustees also claim that the effect of this offset is to revoke a vested trust. 
    We state that it is not because unpaid royalties have not vested, if not due and owing, because of failure of consideration, non-performance or right of settle. 
    We also state that the trustees' interpretation of the term “interdependent” is rather strange. 
    They insist in their briefs that term means that all operators sign similar contracts, and that this is an entire contract for all operators. 
    We think that term is the key to the case and merely means that all of the terms and all of the obligations are interdependent and the obligation, of course, of Benedict to have money due and owing the trustees is dependent upon the union being in compliance. 
    The -- nor do I see this as a matter of shifting responsibility for union acts to the trustees. 
    The trustees are not responsible for union acts. 
    However, the trustees' rights to this money is limited by whether or not the union complies with its promises under the contract. 
    Simply, our position is the trustee is the beneficiary of the contract and his claim that he has a vested interest. 
    He is subject to defenses that Benedict may have against the union. 
    I think Mr. Frankfurter in his question to Mr. Kramer very directly asked to both key to the case although this portion of the case when Mr. Frankfurter asked is the creation of the trust to be severed from the rest of the contract. 
    The trustees' position in this case is that it is to be severed from the rest of the contract. 
    Our position is most emphatically that the creation of the trust is not to be severed -- severed from the rest of the contract for the very reason that the contract itself says that it is an integrated instrument, its provisions are interdependent and Miscellaneous Clause 3 specifically says, that as a part of the consideration of the contract or stoppages and so forth will be settled by the contract machinery.

    (Voice Overlap) that is contemplated in your contract.

speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="1587.259" stopTime="1601.514">
    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice, my position is that the contract may contemplate that there will be stoppages, but it doesn't have to say that stoppages are permitted under the contract. 
    You can contemplate that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1601.514" stopTime="1601.980">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    (Voice Overlap) but you've got --

    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    Sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1602.542" stopTime="1618.260">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- you've got one clause in there that's very definite which says that the -- the previous non-strike provision of the old contract is cancelled and annulled, vacate it and whatever other language they -- they use.
speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="1618.260" stopTime="1619.482">

    So, so far as that is concern, they do have the right to -- to strike. 
    And unless your other provisions of the contract restrict them to do this procedure that you have set out and I take they would have the right, do they not, to -- to strike and have the grievance -- grievance settled under that procedure?
speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="1642.538" stopTime="1720.686">
    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    Your Honor, my answer to that is this, the effect of the cancellation clause first is to put the parties in the same position as though they had been no cancellation clause and second it restores the right to strike as to matters that are not cognizable under the Dispute Section. 
    The key matter is this, sir. 
    I do not say that a mere strike is a breach of the contract. 
    That is not my position. 
    The key is the purpose of the strike. 
    I do say that a strike for the purpose of settling a dispute is a breach of this contract. 
    It is a breach of Section 3 of the Miscellaneous Clause which says that all disputes, stoppages, suspensions, claims, demands will be settled and determined exclusively by the machinery provided from the settlement of Local And District Dispute Section. 
    I see the reason for your honest question. 
    I say there is a distinction between a strike for a dispute settling purpose and a strike which has its -- has its purpose something else or the strikes which are for dispute settling purposes. 
    Of course, at this time, we -- we are getting on to the -- the second question that we have, sir.

    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    And I have proven my answer. 
    That's also based upon the premise that you have satisfaction by withholding trustee payments. 
    That's based on a further premise that the man that you -- the third point is that you have the judgment against, isn't solved. 
    Now, there's no intimation of that in this record. 
    I don't think it's solved. 
    Furthermore, Section 301 (b) doesn't use the word, “satisfaction”. 
    They used the word, “enforce” or “enforceability”. 
    Now, there is a difference between enforcing a judgment and satisfying a judgment. 
    Enforcing is a positive action to go -- collect money from somebody.

    But my suggestion may -- may not come out or stay away, but it makes a lot of difference how you put a question.
speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="2285.498" stopTime="2445.441">
    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    As the real question in this case, we state that a -- use of strikes for dispute-settling purposes is a breach of Section 3 of the Miscellaneous Clause. 
    Now, as to -- to our -- noted an argument by Mr. Boiarsky, when he said that strikes don't settle disputes.And I take issue with that argument. 
    I say, in this case at bar strikes did settle disputes, that the evidence was that the men would strike and the company would cave in. 
    And in at least part of the strikes, the company got their way as evidence in this case that our committeeman was advised by a representative that he couldn't tell him to go -- to strike, “But if you don't get what you want, you know what to do,” and the strikes were suggested as a method of which the committee could get what they wanted, and that's this case. 
    That fits the facts of this case. 
    And that's why I say in this case strikes were used for dispute-settling purposes. 
    Now, the question is that a breach of the contract. 
    A correct interpretation of it would indicate that it is. 
    We're going to basic matters. 
    We first look to the purpose of an intent of the contract and the conditions around 1950. 
    The contract itself says that its purpose is to promote and improve the industrial and economic relationship in the coal industry. 
    Now, to settle local matters and disputes by grievance machinery is a promotion of the economic relationship. 
    But to use strikes to settle these little disputes would certain not be a promotion of the economic relationship. 
    We must also bear in mind that the parties to this contract, the people that had it -- the leaders of this union. 
    They are enlightened and progressive labor leaders. 
    Now, the leaders of the coal industry at that time were enlightened and progressive leaders, they had to be. 
    They were looking for a progressive method of settling disputes. 
    And therefore, when they wrote Clause 3, they meant to the operators to have a continuity of production so that they can meet the other competitive views to give the -- calls the construction that the union contends for or would not be a promotion, it would be a step backward.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    In the second -- in the first place, they did not completely restore in Section 3 what they deleted. 
    They just wiped out all previous clauses and Section 3 was substituted therefore, and Section 3 would restrict strike activity only as to matters cognizable under the grievance machinery.

    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    To my knowledge he is, sir. 
    Now, coming back, sir, Your Honors wished me to go ahead to the interpretation not only do we consider the purpose and intent of the contract, it's fundamental also that effect must be given to all the language of the contract. 
    Now, I am not unmindful of Section 1 in the Miscellaneous Clause which says that all previous no-strike clause has been cancelled, but I am mindful of the positive provisions in Section 3 of the Miscellaneous Clause and I say we must give meaning to Section 3 if we can and if we can do so without derogating from other sections or conflicting from other sections. 
    We can do that. 
    We can also give meaning to Section 1, as I have already explained. 
    To cancel a right to strike is not to state the opposite. 
    To cancel a no-strike clause is not to state the opposite, it's merely to put them in the position as though there had been no former clauses or, as I stated, the right to strike is retained as to other matters that are not cognizable under this settlement of dispute section. 
    A cancellation of a previous clause is not a positive assertion that you can strike for any matter, whatsoever. 
    Or that you can strike for any matter that must be taken up as provided in Section 3. 
    I refer so to the interpretation by the parties. 
    The brief filed by the union disagrees with me, but I still insist that the letter is contained on page 12 of my brief. 
    It was set in 1951 by the union officers to all of the locals and members of the United Mine Workers, indicate that at that time, the union officers considered that an unauthorized strike was a breach because in that letter it said, "Unauthorized strikes reflect discredit upon our organization 60-year record of honoring contractual provisions and result unstrained labor relations between the parties signatory to the joint agreements.

    Mr. Winston, Judge Madden would say to that, I think, in light of what he does -- the Section 3, the gentlemen's agreement and as gentlemen they're not (Inaudible) for us, but it has no legal significance, what do you say to that?
speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="2839.523" stopTime="2952.063">
    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I'd say to that, I believe in gentlemen's agreements, let's put that first, but I'd still think it -- well, a gentlemen's agreement should be enforced as well as anything else, but the question is whether it's enforceable. 
    I think Section 3 answers that because Section 3 expressly says the contracting parties agree that as a part of the consideration of this contract, any and all disputes, stoppages, suspensions of work and claims and so forth shall be by the contracting parties settled and determined exclusively by the machinery provided. 
    I say that when Judge Madden calls that a mere gentlemen's agreement, he is, in effect, giving no effect to that clause and the fundamental principles require that effect be given if he can't. 
    I am aware of that decision NLRB versus UMW of Justice Madden's opinion. 
    That case and this case, are probably the reasons that we are here today, that is we've got two Circuit Courts of Appeals that came to different conclusions. 
    I realize that this Court is not bound about the decisions of the two Circuit Courts of Appeal but, of course, their reasons and the collective thought of all those justices are persuasive. 
    And I'd like to remind the Court this. 
    That that was a split decision that only two justices came to that conclusion and the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    In this case, of course, all three justices came to the conclusion, which I am insisting upon, and in addition to that, the National Labor Relations Board came to the same conclusion that we insist upon on this point.

speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="3125.761" stopTime="3129.695">
    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    The striking is a breach if it's for the purpose of settling.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3129.695" stopTime="3129.957">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes.
speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="3129.957" stopTime="3200.471">
    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    If it becomes a method of settling other than the agreed on exclusive method, we must give that word, “exclusive” its proper meaning too, sir. 
    During my remaining time, sir, I -- I'd like to cover a couple other points that Mr. Boiarsky brought up. 
    Mr. Boiarsky stated that the parties could not have expressed their right to strike in more definite language and he was referring to the cancellation clause in the parties in the 1947 agreement. 
    In other words, when you cancel an abrogate, previous no-strike clause, Mr. Boiarsky says you could have not have express the right to strike in more -- in more definite language. 
    I say you could have. 
    You could have come out and say it that all disputes will be settled by the machinery in the contract exclusively. 
    However, you still you have your right to strike over disputes. 
    If that has been what they meant and if that had been what they wanted, they could have used more definitive language to retain the right to strike for dispute-settling purposes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3200.471" stopTime="3223.955">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Converse to that, it might be argued (Inaudible) would be no effect. 
    It could be argued when they said this, they could have said also, all that -- although they have taken out the part of the strike, they were going to include in here that that is a breach of contract, if they did strike for these reasons. 
    You -- if you could obey the language more definite one piece on either side.
speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="3223.955" stopTime="3226.664">
    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    Yes, sir, he could. 
    We said it could've, sir.

    But we have to make (Inaudible)
speaker="robert_t_winston_jr" startTime="3231.778" stopTime="3454.023">
    Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr. 
    Your Honors, I think it isn't -- it is very definite [Laughs]. 
    I hope Your Honors will construe it the way it is. 
    I mean the way we insist that -- what -- the way we insist, it contains the intended parties. 
    Now, Mr. Boiarsky stated that the purpose of the union in 1947 and of course in 1950 was to avoid the impact of damage actions brought under 301, when that cancellation followed the Court. 
    Well, at the same time, Clause 3 was put, which said, “You will settle disputes exclusively by the said machinery.” 
    In considering the purpose of the contracting parties, you should consider not only the purpose of the union when they want to get out of -- avoid damage actions, but we must also consider the purpose of the operators. 
    It is certain that the operators, when they put in Clause 3, but wanting some clause that would give them a continuity of operation pending this little local matters. 
    And Mr. Boiarsky also cited the Lion Oil Company case versus -- NLRB versus the Lion Oil Company case to the effect that where there has been no expressed waiver of the right to strike, the waiver of the right doing such a period is not to be inferred. 
    This case is good as far as it goes, but it does not fit this situation. 
    In the Lion case, we had a dispute over the modification of the very terms of the contract -- correction, we had a strike over the modification of the very terms of the contract. 
    And as the Court stated on page 340 of one Lawyers' Edition 2d, here, the strike occurred at a time when the parties were bargaining over modifications after notice and in accordance with the terms of the contract where there has been no expressed waiver of the right to strike, a waiver of the right doing such a period is not to be inferred. 
    We do not believe that the two-phased provision for determine -- for terminating this contract means that it was not within the contemplation of the parties that economic weapons might be used to support demands for modification before the notice to terminate was given. 
    Now, that is a key distinction, as I see it, sir. 
    We do not say there is no right to strike during the negotiating process for the contract itself. 
    And that's what the Lion case covers, the negotiating process for the modification of the contract itself. 
    And the Court was careful to use that a waiver of the right doing such a period is not to be inferred. 
    That is doing the negotiation period for a modification. 
    We say that during the process of bargaining for a collective contract, labor should not give up his right to strike because it -- it is its best economic weapon. 
    But when you come down to the case where after you have gotten your contract and going to work on it and then you have a dispute because some man is discharged for absenteeism. 
    We say that the union has limited its right to strike over that little local matter, and that was their intent.
