Jones v. United States

    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    The District Court didn't consider this case in terms of the various standards which we quoted from some of the other cases. 
    They didn't discuss whether he was an occupant or whether he was a licensee or what he had dominion. 
    They called him a guest and that seemed to settle that. 
    Of the guest rule --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="19.861" stopTime="21.059">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That was on the original motion?
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="21.059" stopTime="57.134">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    On the original motion, sir. 
    The guest rule of -- seems to have been invoked more often in the District Court. 
    It is not unanimously involved. 
    In any event, we suggest that it's a rule which really deserves some examination. 
    There are guests and guests. 
    If someone lends me his house for a year and I'm living there as a guest, I'm sure no one would challenge for that -- my status as regard to the Fourth Amendment and under -- in that house, is quite different from perhaps a man in somebody else's house of 20 other people there and he's there as a guest, too.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="57.134" stopTime="58.859">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You have the man who came to dinner.
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="58.859" stopTime="191.197">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    The man came to dinner -- what is clear is that no -- no guest case cited by the district judge below, no case cited by the Government deals with the kind of guest you had in this case. 
    A fellow who is in the apartment without the owner there, so that he's a guest of some conceptual sense, of course, but he's not there by sufferance of someone else who has the right and the power to assert his responsibility for the apartment. 
    In this case, and this is the only case, we submit, this -- in this case, he was in charge of the apartment whether you call him guest or not. 
    If Arthur Evans had been there, that might be a different question, that's not the course. 
    But none of the cases cited involved a case, where the man was there not in the presence of the owner and was in charge of the apartment. 
    The guest rule has been suggested in this Court before, it has never been decided. 
    In the McDonald case, so the Court will recall, the majority said even if we assume that a guest in the apartment of another -- in the presence of another in that case, has no standing under the Fourth Amendment, we will still exclude the evidence because it had to be excluded from McDonald, therefore, we would exclude it for Washington. 
    On the notion that if it had been returned to McDonald, as McDonald has originally requested, it wouldn't be available for Washington. 
    Three of the justices in that Court suggested that there's no reason why a guest should not enjoy the privacy of -- the right to privacy under the rooftree of a friend anymore than anybody else. 
    What basically we have here is a man who borrows an apartment. 
    And a man who borrows an apartment should have the same rights of privacy in that apartment as anyone else, as anybody who owns the apartment. 
    Interestingly enough, a man who borrows a car is not his, just borrows it for an afternoon, no one has ever denied his right to object to the seizure of that car. 
    In fact, in the Henry case decided just a few weeks ago here, the Court will recall that Henry objected to the seizure of materials in the automobile because his arrest went unlawful.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="191.197" stopTime="206.847">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I suppose if you have occasion had given a car on a trailer, which I take it's one that is wrong personally, I'd suppose anybody who do this (Inaudible)
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="206.847" stopTime="367.498">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    Perhaps, sir. 
    In the Henry case, interestingly enough, no one claimed -- no one claimed that Henry didn't have the right to object to the seizure of the materials on the car simply because it wasn't his car. 
    In fact, he was not only a guest in the car. 
    He was a guest of a guest. 
    The driver borrowed the car from someone else, as the record shows, and he was invited to ride in it and yet, no one suggested that in that case because the automobile was borrowed rather than owned or because the owner wasn't there or because, for some reason or other, the relation to the automobile is only temporary that therefore he should have no standing and of course, the automobile would generally doesn't have anyone near the kind of protection that -- that the dwelling has. 
    There is one case before this Court, which we refer in our brief on page 29, the Kremen case. 
    The Court decided that per curiam. 
    It's -- it appears that in that case, the crime involved was harboring fugitives from justice. 
    Someone had hired a cabin under an assumed name and the other three persons were found in the cabin with them and they searched and -- and seized lots of materials. 
    And the Government argued in that case and the lower court held none of the four had standing and yet, the Supreme Court just reversed per curiam without -- just asserting the fact they clearly had standing in effect. 
    The -- one can deal with these issues in terms of the niceties of property law. 
    But in the question really, what are the -- what is the right of privacy a man has under the Fourth Amendment? 
    One of the District Court cases we cite, case from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia suggests that the question is whether it's unreasonable, if it's unreasonable to take these materials from this person, then that person should have a right to stand. 
    Now, it's a circular test obviously and yet, it maybe a perfectly proper way of handling questions of -- which are often merely questions of degree. 
    It seems to us quite clear that in the circumstances of this case, Jones had a right of privacy. 
    In this apartment, he had a right to keep out trespassers. 
    He had a right to keep out police without a warrant. 
    He should clearly have standing to object to the unlawfulness of the warrant. 
    But the case really is considerably stronger than that. 
    What happened after the motion was denied was that it was repeated at the beginning at the trial and Judge Holtzoff said, “I am bound by what the previous judge had done on motion.”

    May I ask you very frankly, not merely the renewal of the pleading filed in the defendant motion?

    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Thank you.
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="375.698" stopTime="456.514">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    And the Court said, "I am bound by that motion and didn't consider it." 
    Well, as we shall saw -- as we shall see -- we question whether that decision was correct, but we don't think it's important enough to stop on it. 
    After the Government's evidence was in, counsel asked again, and it appears in -- in the record on page 56, counsel asked again to note that we object to the inclusion of this Government's testimony. 
    And it was noted for the record and the Court didn't -- didn't affirm -- didn't grant the motion. 
    Well, by this time, lots -- more evidence was before the Court. 
    By this time, the Government had introduced its whole case. 
    It introduced evidence which said that he had been living in this apartment. 
    It introduced evidence which said that he was in possession of narcotics. 
    And not only introduced this evidence, but it must have proved it beyond a reasonable doubt, because these were the evidence in which this man was later convicted of possession, so that at least as to his relation to the narcotic seized, the evidence was “beyond a reasonable doubt that these were his”. 
    Well, the Government -- the Government doesn't deny any of this, but it seems to take the position that it came too late that once a motion is denied at the beginning of the trial, now, then, the Court needn't to stop in the course of the trial to reexamine this question.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="456.514" stopTime="477.021">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="477.021" stopTime="551.001">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    Yes, sir. 
    Yes. 
    We believe the Government is mistaken in its position as to what the trial judge should have done at this time and the answer seems clear on the basis of the Gouled case, which is cited in our brief on page 40 and 41. 
    And in fact, the entire portion of the Gouled case which is relevant to this point is quoted in that -- in that brief at that point. 
    What happened -- this was -- came up on a certified question. 
    And the Court, in effect, said if there'd been a motion to deny, which was to suppress earlier, which had been denied, but it appeared in the course of the trial that the evidence was unconstitutionally seized should the trial court have stopped and examined it. 
    And the Court said quite clearly, “Sure, we don't want the trials interrupted, but that's only as -- rule of procedure and should not stand on the way of constitutional right.” 
    The -- the duty of the trial judge at that moment was as soon as it appeared probable, it don't have to appear certain, so it's appeared probable that it had been an unconstitutional seizure just to stop and see whether there had been an unconstitutional seizure.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="551.001" stopTime="553.157">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    That was before the rule.
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="553.157" stopTime="809.306">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    Yes, sir. 
    And no one had suggested that the rules had been changed on any of these points, sir. 
    In fact, the -- the question which the District Court had to decide at this moment, we believe, is one that could have take -- it didn't have to go to the jury. 
    It didn't have to do anymore than spend 15 minutes looking at the affidavit and deciding whether to do what he had never done before which is look at that affidavit and decide, is it adequate for the warrant. 
    The Court didn't do that and the Gouled case and the Amos case decided the same day, seemed fairly clear to show that the Court -- if it -- if it exercised any discretion, which doesn't seem to be clear, abused him. 
    The Government cites one case in opposition and that is Segurola, cited in the government brief on page 33. 
    That's a very different case. 
    In Segurola, there was no motion to suppress the evidence before. 
    No objection before the trial at all. 
    And at the trial, the objection is made to the -- to the admission of the liquor had nothing to do with -- with search and seizure or -- or unlawful arrest. 
    Afterwards, the man said -- the counsel said, “Well, in any event, we believe it should be suppressed.” 
    The Court said, “It's quite clearly, this motion is an afterthought and you come too late.” 
    That didn't happen in our case. 
    Jones made his motion. 
    And the facts in support of that motion and they didn't appear at the time appeared during the course of the trial under Gouled names and we believe that the trial judge should have stopped and looked at the affidavit. 
    The Government says in effect, “Yes, but it's different. 
    In Gouled, what appeared in the course of the trial was the unconstitutionality of the seizure. 
    Here, what appears in the course of the trial is the standing to raise the unconstitutionality." 
    We don't see why that should make any difference. 
    But in any event, the reason it didn't appear in the course of the trial that was unconstitutional is because we had never been allowed to prove that the warrant was bad. 
    If we assume, as we may assume for this probable case that the warrant was bad, there must be standing, appears all the elements necessary to prove unconstitutionality of either case. 
    There's still one further and perhaps the crucial issue in cases of this kind is the one to which Mr. Justice Harlan was referring before the lunch and recess. 
    These crimes are what we might call possession crimes. 
    All the Government has to prove is possession. 
    The Government admits that possession, and it doesn't claim it's a different kind of possession, Government admits that possession of the narcotics is enough to constitute standing, so that the whole government case is based on the assumption that the Government -- that the defendant has that relation to these narcotics which justifies him in objecting to their introduction if they were unlawfully seized. 
    Again, there was -- by this time, not only the warrant and the affidavit of the complaint and the indictment and all the evidence, all charged possession under -- under the Jeffers case to be quite clear that possession is all you have to prove. 
    But they say it's not enough because Jones must claim possession. 
    And what is cited as an old opinion of Judge Learned Hand, for whom I have the highest respect. 
    In Connolly v. Medalie in which he said in effect the motion to suppress is a pleading and the petitioner has to assert the facts which justify his standing under it. 
    He said in effect, “The right to object is -- to evidence is remedial. 
    It's -- it only amount with the constitutional -- with the constitutional privilege which is being infringed has a right to object and therefore, he must show this constitutional privilege." 
    He also went out to say that of course, a man may hesitate to admit possession of contraband but that's -- that's tough. 
    That's one of the difficult things in life. 
    If he wants -- if he wants the benefits of possession, then he ought to have bare the burden of possession. 
    Well, with all due respect, there are number of things to be said about Judge Hand's opinion, but even if it -- even assuming it -- we could not distinguish it which we believe we can, we believe it's erroneous.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="809.306" stopTime="826.414">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you -- do you claim that the standing rule ought to be done away with entirely in the sense that if a man is on trial and evidence is introduced against him, is that in and of itself enough to give him standing to make the motion?
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="826.414" stopTime="832.869">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    We believe -- we're not claiming that, sir. 
    That is one of the points we argue in our brief. 
    But we've -- at this point, we're arguing --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="832.869" stopTime="833.718">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You don't have to go that --

    -- far in this case.(Voice Overlap) --
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="835.211" stopTime="942.441">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    We don't have to go that far. 
    And we're now concern with the fact that this was a -- this was a case where possession i.e. the same fact which constitutes standing is the crux of the crime is what the Government claims from the beginning and is what the Government proved. 
    Well, they insist however that's not enough. 
    Jones has to file that motion, and Jones has to say, “I possess it.” 
    One might ask perhaps, “Well, why doesn't he?” 
    And of course, Mr. Justice Harlan gave the answer before because he find himself on a whipsaw. 
    It's interesting to read the records. 
    If you read on the motion to suppress where the objection to the motion was lack of standing that Jones is minimizing his relation to the apartment, although it's in his interest on that motion to maximize it, the Government is trying to prove he had more relation to that apartment although on the motion, it was in its interest to minimize it. 
    And the reason -- the reason is, as the Government said quite clearly, “The cases show that if he makes this motion, either the motion or the affidavit can be introduced against him.” 
    What does this mean? 
    It means that in order to -- that in these possession cases, in these possession cases, in order to assert as rights under the Fourth Amendment, a man must -- must incriminate himself. 
    He must give up his rights under the Fifth. 
    And it isn't really only, if this is accurate, it isn't really only a choice between the two amendments. 
    They tend to nullify each other because the man is in a dilemma. 
    And the dilemma is Judge Hand's word. 
    If he claims possession, then they will introduce us admission and that's it. 
    If he doesn't claim possession, then they introduce the evidence and that's it. 
    So, he -- the two things nullify each other.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="942.441" stopTime="965.287">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    I wonder if he has to make any statement at all about the matter of ownership or is he not entitled in such case to make this claim to sustain this motion unless he affirms that we disclaim it.
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="965.287" stopTime="1114.245">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    We -- we claim that, sir. 
    We claim that he doesn't have to do anything in these possession cases because -- because the element of possession is supplied for him by the Government. 
    We also submit, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that even if he disclaims it in the first instance, it shouldn't matter if in fact the Government has -- the Government shows possession. 
    That the -- the result of all this is certain that the Government succeeds in these cases in convicting a man on unlawfully seized evidence. 
    This is the result of these cases because if the man for any reason and -- and these cases, the reasons are fair and confusion and the fact that the cases are not clear and the map for any reason refrains from objecting to the evidence although he's -- this isn't case where he's waiving his rights. 
    This isn't the case where he -- where there's any doubt about his possession. 
    The Government insisted his possession. 
    But in -- in all these cases, the result of this is that this man is convicted on unlawfully seized evidence. 
    Not all -- not all the -- the cases below have followed Judge Hand. 
    We cite in our brief the Dean case which says just the other way. 
    It says the -- it's the Government who has to prove possession, even if he denied that in the first instance. 
    When the Government later claims possession, they shouldn't be in a position to deny it. 
    In the Williams case, also cited in our brief, in the District of Columbia where the man had -- again, earlier this claimed possession, the Court said, “When the Government later brings in evidence, it shows that it -- he did have possession, that order give him standing.” 
    The point is that a man should not be able to be convicted on evidence unlawfully seized. 
    The same point has been made by the Court of Appeals for Illinois -- the Supreme Court of Illinois in the Grau case where they say, “At least to regard to a dwelling," and that's all that we have here. 
    We don't have to decide what we would do in another case. 
    "At least to regard to a dwelling the -- the person should not be forced to incriminate himself in order to assert his rights under the Fourth Amendment." 
    The Government says in its brief that the Supreme Court has never held that the -- that he makes this motion, it could be used against him. 
    That is true. 
    The Supreme Court has never held it. 
    Some lower courts have held it, as we say in our brief. 
    We -- we believe that those lower courts maybe erroneous but the result has been that counsel after counsel and defendant after defendant has been afraid to assert his rights under the Fourth Amendment.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1114.245" stopTime="1128.265">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Under your view, I take it, if this man had never -- not been in the premises at the time, it would have been sufficient form to simply go in, in view of the nature of this charge, and said this evidence had been illegally seized period, and that would be enough.
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="1128.265" stopTime="1198.802">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    That's right, sir. 
    And -- and, Mr. Justice Harlan, if I may, this is not -- this is sometimes referred to as who shall have the dilemma, whether the individual shall have the dilemma or the Government shall have the dilemma. 
    If it came to a choice of that, we suggest that it should be the Government which has the dilemma, but that -- we don't really think that that's choice because the -- if we exclude evidence where the Government claims that he had possession and in fact, the man didn't have possession, so that the exclusion was erroneous, it doesn't do him, the Government, any harm because he hadn't committed the crime anyhow, the crime as possession. 
    Whereas in his case, in his case, if you force him to make this choice, the result, I repeat, the result is to convict this man an unlawfully seized evidence. 
    In the Kremen case, which I referred to a little while ago, the government brief in this Court objected that nobody had claimed possession or ownership of any of the material seized, it's cited in our brief, the reference is on page 22 of the government brief in the Kremen case and it's cited in our brief.

speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="1310.152" stopTime="1437.434">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    Well, since either relations of the premises, sir, or relation to the materials were enough, we wouldn't have to do that. 
    But we have been arguing this case at -- to this point on the assumption that the rule which the federal -- lower federal court developed that a man must have standing to challenge this is sound. 
    Having said what we've said maybe we have no standing to object to the standing rule because we have standing. 
    Nevertheless, as our brief argues, we aren't disposed unless it were necessary to argue that the Supreme Court should throw out what all the lower federal courts have held with the virtue of the unanimity. 
    But the Court can't decide this question against Jones unless without at the same time finding that the standing rule is necessary. 
    If you find we have standing, that's fine. 
    But if you should find we have no standing, then the Court must face whether standing is necessary. 
    And on this -- as our brief argues, the standing notion is based on the -- as based on the idea that the whole purpose of the exclusionary rule is remedial, that is to make it up to the fellow whose rights had been deprived. 
    In fact, the Government admits that "a -- a major purpose," I'm quoting, "a major purpose of this exclusionary rule is deterrence". 
    Obviously, it will deter more if you also exclude not only in the case where a man has standing but also in the case where a man hasn't standing. 
    The time when -- when this rule of exclusion was what Mr. Wigmore called a terrible exception is long gone. 
    I suggest then -- and since the time when this rule is developed, another doctrine of this Court, the doctrine of McNabb and the cases which followed it, both notions of deterrence and discipline of the police and perhaps the notion that (Inaudible) which is we don't want our court soiled with dirty evidence. 
    That the evidence is dirty no matter whose rights were violated. 
    And if it should be necessary to reach that question, there is much to be said for Mr. Justice Traynor's opinion of the Court of Appeal -- for the Supreme Court of California in which he tries -- he -- he attempts to show that the whole motion of standing is based on a misinterpretation of the cases of this Court.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In other words, what support is there to the lower court opinion that they think that your view on this record satisfies the relationship with being your view in the premises and supported by lower court opinion?
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="1495.001" stopTime="1530.213">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    In regard to Jones and the premises, sir, we cite the opinions of lower courts in our brief in which they speak of the standards. 
    One court says everyone but a trespasser. 
    This is the standard they suggest. 
    Well, Jones clearly wasn't a trespasser. 
    Some of them speak of occupant. 
    Some speak of dominion. 
    We suggest that Jones satisfies -- satisfies those. 
    This is all in relation to the premises which are an independent ground from across the relationship which we try to show to -- which we say the Government has shown for his relationship to the materials. 
    In the time that it left --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1530.213" stopTime="1546.587">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that -- so that's -- assume that the Court adopts your most extreme position on the application of the standing rule, what body of opinion of lower court that has to be overruled by such a decision of this Court?
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="1546.587" stopTime="1550.824">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    Our most extreme position, Your Honor, is that no standing is necessary.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1550.824" stopTime="1550.954">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="1550.954" stopTime="1553.150">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    If you went that far, you've had to overrule them all.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1553.150" stopTime="1553.996">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Certainly.
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="1553.996" stopTime="1609.809">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    On the possession case -- on the possession cases, the -- the large majority makes no distinction between possession cases and non-possession crimes. 
    But the number of cases which consider this question is -- is -- maybe there -- I think almost all the cases which really consider this problem of the possession crime and we cite the -- the Dean case and the Williams case seems to be in that category. 
    Commonly, a modality the -- the Hand opinion in 1932 considers it but not very fully. 
    It doesn't deal with it in terms of Fourth and Fifth Amendment. 
    It just says man is in dilemma. 
    So, in fact, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, one can decide this case on the very narrowest ground, and I'm not sure which is narrower, either of this that this is a possession crime and the Government clearly proved our standing or on this relation to the premises, his fellow was in charged of the apartment and he's an occupant and to do that, it'd be very little overruling on -- on that last point at all.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1609.809" stopTime="1613.979">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Would there be any on the possession point alone?
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="1613.979" stopTime="1661.547">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    Any cases which should have to be overruled? 
    Yes, sir. 
    They didn't consider this very carefully but the Court of Appeals in this case and the Government's brief in effect says courts have never distinguished. 
    I'm not sure they've been asked to distinguish but they never distinguished between the possession crimes and the others. 
    If the petitioner has a standing, then the Government and we are agreed that this Court ought to consider the validity of the warrant. 
    And obviously, if he has standing invalid and the warrant is invalid that disposes of the case. 
    There's a third issue in the case which I won't have time to reach but I would like to take a moment on the probable cause. 
    What do we --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1661.547" stopTime="1666.657">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, but the point you won't be able to reach is the point in which the Court will overrule, is that right?
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="1666.657" stopTime="1768.346">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    Yes, it did. 
    It raised in the court below for the first time, they'll not raise in the lower court. 
    The Court of Appeals -- this is the question of whether the warrant is properly executed under Section 3109. 
    One doesn't have to get to that question if you find for Jones on standing plus probable cause. 
    And unless the Court wants to ask some questions about that last point, we are prepared to stand on our brief in relation to that point. 
    But in regard to probable cause, we think, and I should not like to use these words carelessly, we think that this is the most shocking and flimsiest case. 
    The flimsiest case of any reported case we have found of the issuance of a warrant for a search of a dwelling. 
    In fact, I don't know if any flimsier one even for the search of an automobile and this Court has repeatedly said the defense. 
    What do we have here? 
    We have a tip from an informer plus the affidavit says, the affidavit is contained on page 3 of the record, if the Court will, "Received information that Cecil Jones and Earline Richardson were involved in the illicit narcotic traffic etcetera and kept a ready supply. 
    The same information regarding narcotics had been given to the undersigned and other officers from other sources of information. 
    If I may stop for a moment just on the nature of this tip, the informer is not named. 
    There is no affidavit from the informer either given to the police or given to the Commissioner.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1768.346" stopTime="1780.851">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    When you say it's not named, you mean his -- the absence of the name but is there an indication as to -- that he was a police officer or (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="1780.851" stopTime="1863.734">
    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    No indication that he's a police officer, sir. 
    No, no -- neither name nor identity in -- in terms which are meaningful except, and the words are very important to note because it seems that the man who drafted this seem to weigh them very carefully. 
    He said all that about this man -- this first source of information has given information to the undersigned on previous occasion, on previous occasion. 
    To us, that sounds like a nice way of trying to say one previous occasion, at least, it doesn't say more than one previous occasion and which was correct, so we know that there wasn't a tip from this informer once before that it was correct. 
    We do not know whether there were any other tips. 
    We do not know how many tips he may have given which were incurred. 
    And this -- this is what is given to the Commissioner. 
    This is what is given to the Commissioner and it supposed to produce not cause, not some cause, not the, as this Court said in Henry case, not reasons to suspect the probable cause. 
    This is what is given to the Commissioner under an affidavit when the constitution requires oath and affirmation but the old test should be meaningful. 
    You -- if you want to say something under oath, it -- the oath is the -- is the safe guard. 
    The man has to be able to testify to something under oath so that if he's lying about it would mean something.

    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    We're not claiming that, sir. 
    This Court said in the Brinegar case that it doesn't. 
    Of course, that was not a dwelling case, and the Brinegar case clearly said that dwelling cases are different, but we're not claiming that all hearsay as such is -- is inadequate. 
    We're saying -- we are saying that there is no case where hearsay alone from an unidentified informer without anything about him with -- the -- the Government didn't even do what it does in all these cases. 
    It calls the man reliable, but the Government doesn't call him unreliable. 
    The magistrate or the Commissioner here has no assumption to assume he's reliable. 
    They didn't even give him that label of reliability which maybe a judgment to which -- to which either they find, he could testify or maybe the Court -- the Commissioner might have cross-examined.

    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    Yes, sir. 
    The only other -- the only other question -- the only other point mentioned is that these persons were addicts. 
    All about it is we say two things. 
    The notion that an addict is probably a pusher, if I may use it, is, I think, not one about which one would -- could make a claim of probability. 
    There were -- people in this room, all of them were set to be addicts. 
    Only of them were charged with this crime, so it would guess that the law of probability seemed to work 2-to-1 against the notion that -- in this context that an addict is a pusher. 
    But in addition to this, it isn't even very clear, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that that this statement was made as of his own knowledge. 
    It was ambiguous here, sir. 
    But if you look at the record, it shows that at least as to Earline Richardson, at least as to Earline Richardson, his statement that she was a narcotics addict came to him from others.

    And if he -- and if he's going to make statements about the apartment not under oath, he can make them -- he -- he can fill it all that he tells he wants to. 
    If one is going to fabricate a story, well, he can fabricate it. 
    But if -- if you please, Mr. Justice Whittaker, there's another point in this thing. 
    It isn't only the lack of reliability that we're concerned with. 
    When you have just a tip, think of the dangers of mistake. 
    The man said apartment 36, maybe he said 63.

    And on the basis of this alone, you go to a particular apartment and in this case the police go. 
    They don't even identify themselves, as we show in our brief. 
    They go into this apartment, knock on the door and break in just on the basis that this man is not only reliable after his tip but perfectly accurate in the information he gave us. 
    If the police had done in this case what they do normally, sir, which is -- there are cases all the time, there's the Murphy case under the District of Columbia this past summer. 
    What they do all the time is to -- to send somebody out there with marked money, get an agent as a purchaser. 
    There was no indication of urgency in this case, sir. 
    The fellow had said it's been going on for a long time.

    Mr. Louis Henkin 
    But our objection on the Section 3109 in our third -- up -- third part of our case applies even if the warrant is out. 
    If -- in order to execute a valid warrant, you have to give warning, give notice of your presence before you break in. 
    And we submit that what the police did in this case did not give a notice required by the statute and that even if you take their version of it, that is the truth, that is the truth. 
    And in any event, there's a -- an obvious mistake by the Court of Appeals, which the Government admits and which the dissenting judge admits as to whether the facts were found in favor of the police on circumstances where it's not entirely clear that the fact should be found in favor of the police because after all, the police know the rule and had an interest in saying they have complied with it. 
    No indication that Jones even knew about Section 3109. 
    He had no reason to falsify the execution. 
    No -- no indication that his counsel even knew it because it wasn't raised until we got to the Court of Appeals by a different counsel.

   Argument of James W. Knapp
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2616.334" stopTime="2618.158">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Knapp, you may proceed.
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="2618.158" stopTime="2922.583">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    At the outset, I understood counsel to remark that the Government had treated this case as though the prosecution admitted the warrant was unlawful. 
    If he did say that -- in that -- in my understanding of it, I'm sure that it is not correct. 
    That has never been the Government's position. 
    The Government's position in the trial court was simply this that the defendant did not have any standing to raise the question of the illegality of the warrant. 
    And that since the trial -- motion's trial judge held that no -- there was no standing, he never reached the question as to whether or not the warrant was valid. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals, we think, must have at least considered that the warrant was valid because it went on to discuss the execution point, and that's the only basis, and I think you'll find it in our brief at page 35 of our belief that perhaps the -- the Court of Appeals did consider the validity of the warrant and consider it valid. 
    However, they made no mentioned of it and it isn't explicit in that Court's opinion. 
    I would like at the outset to try to get this case, the perspective of this case back to the way the case was tried at the trial level. 
    It seems to me that the position was consistent to the parties. 
    The Government -- the defendant first filed his pro se motion to dismiss in which it was discussed here before in which if the defendant did not deny possession of the narcotics and if he did not deny having made such use of the premises as to charge him with notice and knowledge of what the premises contain, he certainly did his best to convey that. 
    And certainly, any prosecutor reading it would understand that this man is saying, “You haven't proved possession and I'm not admitting it.” 
    Now, he comes forth with his motion to suppress filed by counsel, the counsel who was argued the Jeffers case here, a very able attorney. 
    And he made no mention of any standing. 
    His motion was based on the face of the warrant. 
    Find it was invalid because it had, in effect, been obtained through hearsay. 
    At the hearing on that motion, the Government raised the point with the motion's judge, Judge Laws and said, “The defendant has not shown that he has standing here to raise the question as to the illegality of the search.” 
    At that point, without anything further, the defense lawyer didn't say, "Well, I don't have to prove standing” or “I can rely on the Government's allegations in its indictment or in its -- in its warrant or in its application for a warrant.” 
    He said, “I asked leave to a man to show that the defendant was present at the time on the premises at the time in question as an invitee or guest," so he immediately came up. 
    His -- his permission to a man was allowed. 
    He is the attorney endorsed on the motion. 
    And then he proceeded to put the defendant on the stand, and he was very particular that he did not want the defendant question by the Government as to innocence or guilt. 
    Then he went right to the question of what right he had to be in the premises. 
    And I believe that the defendant testified. 
    He said, “Whose place was it? 
    Did you rent it? 
    Did you pay rent or own it or anything?” 
    He said, “He was Evans, Arthur's place.”

    All right.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    I'm sorry. 
    But he said, "Was he a friend of yours?" 
    "Yes, sir." 
    Did he give you the use of that apartment in any manner?" 
    "He did." 
    "Did he give you a key?" 
    "He let me have a key." 
    Now, that was the extent of his direct testimony in -- on cross-examination. 
    Now, the Government is asking, “Is it not a fact, sir, that you had your clothing and your personal property in these premises on the date that you are arrested there?” 
    "I had a suit there." 
    "One suit?" 
    "And your shirt?" 
    "A suit and a shirt." 
    "And other clothing that you have there?" 
    "Shoes and stocking that I had on. 
    I didn't have anything on." 
    I understand this to mean certainly taking in the context of his testimony at the trial where he testified on page 60. 
    "Isn't it a fact that you had your clothes in this apartment on August 21?" 
    This is on cross-examination. 
    Answer, "That I had to put on." 
    I understand that what he meant is that he had a clothes he had their in the apartment was the clothes that he physically had on his body and that he had nothing else there. 
    Then on cross-examination, the Government went on and developed that he lived with his parents at 811 9th Street Northeast and that he read it from them and that was his home. 
    Now, that's consistent with what he said in his motion to dismiss. 
    And this defendant at the trial when he came to testify on his own behalf didn't change his testimony any. 
    It was still the same thing. 
    As a matter of fact, he was asked, “Now, isn't a fact you tell the police officer that the apartment belonged to Mr. Evans who had gone to Philadelphia and he was allowing you to stay in his apartment?” 
    Answer, “He didn't allow me to stay in the apartment, sir.” 
    “He had a key?” 
    “Yes, sir.”

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    I'm on page 60 and 61. 
    That he -- that he had not spent there the night before, that he arrived around 4:30 or maybe 5 o' clock. 
    And that he came there to get Earline Richardson. 
    "Where there -- where," in -- at the bottom of the page, he asked, “Where all these other people already there?” 
    “Yes, sir, they were there.” 
    “You knew all these other people, didn't you?” 
    “No, not personally, sir.” 
    I believe that somewhere else he testified over on the top of page 60 that they were in the apartment when he came there, that the only one he knew personally was a man named Cicero Martin. 
    So you had Earline Richardson and Cicero Martin and about three or four others that he didn't even know that were in this apartment. 
    So -- and he testified too on his own behalf, on record page 59 and over on page -- that he did not possess the narcotic pill which was found. 
    He was very definite that he didn't put the pill in the awning or in the bird's nest, that the paraphernalia was not his, that he knew nothing about it. 
    So thus, you have here a defendant who has consistently taken the position that he did not possess the narcotics --

    He can sit here and say, “One thing, I -- the -- the search is illegal.”

    He had two defenses.

    He couldn't say, “These are my narcotics,” and then come onto trial and say they are.

    That point is not here. 
    It's not in this case because it was not done and on his theory of defense, it was not necessary for him to do it and -- and nothing that he did here was used against him.

    Well, all I can say is that this is a special motion that we're deciding in preliminary in a -- in a corollary matter. 
    And that the -- it isn't until all the -- the case is finally tried before a jury that you -- the jury decides the ultimate question here of whether the Government has proved it perhaps. 
    I don't understand this, sir.

    It's up to him to show it, not the Government to show that he didn't have it. 
    I think it's up for him to show that he did, that he brings himself within the ambit of the constitutional protection.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    I have looked and read the cases cited in our brief and -- except for the -- I believe it is the Dean case which is a District Court case which was cited as being against us. 
    The general proposition in the circuit courts is -- does not make any distinction as to whether this is a possessory case or not. 
    And as a matter of fact, there are a number cases that I ran across, perhaps six or eight of them in which they find that the man had no standing but nevertheless find it from the evidence at the trial that he had possession and they convict him on it and so, it's not unusual.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3968.220" stopTime="3977.509">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    I realized that this has not made (Inaudible) of this distinction but we argue that they ought to, I mean urge us to do so. 
    Now, should we?
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="3977.509" stopTime="4065.721">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    No, sir, we should not make that distinction because as I say again it's -- the constitutional privilege is a personal right, a personal privilege and it's up to the defendant to bring himself within it. 
    If he brings himself within it, then he has the standing required and the question goes on. 
    Now, if you're going to allow then to -- to go look at where this thing will finally lined up, let's see where we're going to get to eventually. 
    And eventually, we'll come to a position and some will come here and say, “We don't need any standing at all.” 
    And then, you're going to have cases where the Government may -- I can imagine one readily where the police learn of a shooting or a holdup and they hear that the gun is in a certain house and they get a warrant and they go there and so -- we'll say it's A's house. 
    They come in A and B there and there's the gun. 
    And he says, “Yes, it's my gun. 
    Sure it's my gun. 
    But I love it to be, he's just returned it. 
    Well, wait a minute. 
    I didn't commit this crime. 
    I can prove that I was in another place." 
    He is not in quite out but -- and as a result, A is a witness. 
    It's A's home. 
    It's A's gun. 
    Would you let B claim that the search and seizure of A's home for A's gun was illegal?

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Yes, and I would like to turn to that at this point if -- if we've exhausted the other subject. 
    Question of whether or not on the fact shown by him that he had the right to use the apartment and the key to it, on that question as counsel points out the cases go different ways. 
    They -- Second Circuit cases seem to make it depend upon whether the person who was the guest was dwelling in the premises. 
    They have the employees who are rightfully on the premises even though they might have some custody of the premises generally held it's not having standing to object to -- to searches of the premises. 
    It seems to me that the cases generally hold that he has to have some possessory or proprietary interest and these are the premises or the things seized in order to have standing, although it doesn't -- you -- you'll find cases where he certainly had less than -- than that. 
    There are some cases such as the automobile case that he ment. 
    But it seems to me that the thing we're after, the thing we have to look at is what are we trying to protect? 
    What right is the man's right to privacy? 
    It's his right to have a place, a home where he's free from invasion by others. 
    And if so, it seems to me that it's the use to which he puts that place. 
    And this man made no such use of these premises. 
    He didn't live in them. 
    He didn't sleep there except maybe a night as he testified. 
    He didn't have his --

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Of course, the Fourth Amendment is -- is put there for the protection of the people and we're not trying to -- to whittle it down. 
    As a matter of fact, the -- the circuit courts seem to be even stronger. 
    They seem to hold that he has to have some proprietary of possessory interest in the property. 
    And there was one case, I recall -- I don't recall the name but it's in our brief where -- where the man owned a house, he had leased our house back of it, but he lives with his father. 
    And they held that in that case, the liquor that was found in the premises which he said he leased that he had no standing even though he was in fact owner of them. 
    And there had been case after case where the man owned it and leased it to someone else and they said he has no standing because he doesn't -- he doesn't use it. 
    I would like to say this that we claimed that he may not stand on the Government's proof because of the position that he took and consistently maintained at the trial here. 
    We claimed that he must show some right was violated since the privilege of the Amendment is personal. 
    We assert that the interest he has shown is not sufficient because he was not using the places, the place of abode or a place to keep his private effects. 
    But, even if it should be held that he had standing here, under the circumstances, we do not believe that it avails him of anything because it is our position that the warrant was good.

    He says you have no business to take them.
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="4995.112" stopTime="5166.378">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    He says, “You have no business to take them," but he makes that standing dependent upon his use of the premises, not upon his ownership as a narcotics. 
    He always said, he's never -- he always said, “I -- I don't know any of these narcotics.” 
    But if you get to the point relative to the warrant, we contend that the warrant was a valid warrant. 
    The information was received from a source which had given information to the affiant on previous occasions in which was correct. 
    I'll agree that the word "previous occasion" is susceptible of two meanings. 
    It could mean one occasion. 
    It could mean more than one. 
    But at least, it -- the -- on its face, the warrant showed that the information came from someone who had previously given information which was correct. 
    Now, he said, “Why didn't the officer use word reliability or previous reliable?” 
    Well, of course, he might then turn around and say, “Well, he's just stating a conclusion." 
    Here, he's stating a fact whether or not a person has previously found to be reliable might be considered a conclusion. 
    And I have no doubt if someone opposite circumstance could so argue. 
    But -- then let's see what the information was. 
    The information was detailed. 
    It was detailed that the petitioner and Earline Richardson were involved in illicit narcotic traffic, that they kept a ready supply of heroin in what they had at that apartment. 
    The apartment was designated by street number and by apartment number. 
    It said, "Where the narcotics were kept? 
    Under a pillow, on the person, on a dresser or on a window ledge?” 
    That's pretty specific information. 
    He said that the search that the source of information had made purchases at the apartment on many occasions the last time was August 20, which was the day before the warrant was obtained. 
    It's pretty specific information. 
    It's a lot more than a tip. 
    The tip might be that Jones is engaged in a narcotic traffic. 
    That might be a tip or maybe that Jones and Richardson are selling narcotics but never really were in part. 
    That's a tip. 
    But here, he's got specific information.

    In addition to this specific character of the information, we have a knowledge on the affiant's part that these people are narcotic addicts, that they displayed needle marks and that the statement that these people are familiar to him, I think that has to be taken into context that perhaps it's not spelled out as much as -- as a lawyer might or a prosecuting attorney might put this man as a police officer. 
    He's not a trained prosecutor.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5269.391" stopTime="5271.128">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, to be exact.
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="5271.128" stopTime="5790.992">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, I think that the Commissioner must have been satisfied that that was a meaning of that paragraph. 
    Besides that, the -- the warrant -- the application -- the affidavit shows on its face that there's some verification for this, that other sources of information, they'd received information from other sources the same as they had received from -- as he had received in the narcotics people and this Court had received from this particular source. 
    So, you have -- and he said, "The same information regarding the illicit narcotic traffic conducted by Cecil Jones and Earline Richardson has been given to the undersigned and other officers of the narcotics brought by other sources of information." 
    So you have a specific, long specific detailed source of information. 
    You have other -- his sources of information, all of which confirm it. 
    The question is, Is there a probable cause? 
    Does he have a reasonable ground to believe that the narcotics are up there? 
    Does he have a reasonable ground as a reasonable person to think that there's an offense against the laws of the United States?” 
    If there's narcotics there, very well. 
    He has specific information. 
    His information from the source has previously been -- been correct. 
    He has it confirmed by other sources, other sources. 
    Any of his knowledge that these people are addicts or they've been using narcotics. 
    That put it all together in looking at it in the policeman's knowledge, reasonable for him to -- to believe that the story that he's received is correct. 
    And I think under those circumstances, any reasonable man would -- would have a basis for believing them the offense was committed, for believing that the narcotics were in that place. 
    And the -- the judicial officer who scrutinized this document also was of the same opinion, had two men that thought that, reasonable man who came to that conclusion. 
    I would like to -- I don't think the question is so much as to whether it was received, the warrant was issued on information, it might be hearsay. 
    But what kind of hearsay? 
    How reliable? 
    How reasonable was the officer in relying on it? 
    And I think in that case, that here, there are certainly -- certain indicia of truthfulness, a veracity enough to justify a man to rely upon that information and to act upon it. 
    And I think that is all that probable cause requires. 
    Now, the counsel did not reach the third part of this argument concerning the execution of the warrant. 
    Our brief does not raise the question of standing here. 
    Although, it might well had been raised as to whether he had standing. 
    But I would like to point out first that at no time did he specifically raise this question below. 
    Although, he asked the necessary questions of his defendant and cross-examined the police officers. 
    But he never raised the objection as the execution of this warrant was faulty. 
    And therefore, the Government never had notice of that objection, never had an opportunity to put other police officers on the stand who have accompanied Officer Didone. 
    I believe there were three of them at least there. 
    And so the -- the Government has no chance to corroborate what he had said about it. 
    And I think that under those circumstances, the least in this Court would do is to consider the evidence of the Government witness, Didone, as to what he said about it. 
    They considered whether or not testimony, the execution was valid. 
    And it's submitted that -- on that testimony, the -- there was a compliance with 18 U.S.C. 3109 which provides as an officer may break into a home to execute a warrant if after notice of his authority and purpose, he has refused to admittance. 
    Now, what these officers did was in effect get the defendant to open the door without having first disclosed their identity. 
    Regarding they opened the door, they first knocked several times and he asked, “Who's there?” 
    They didn't answer. 
    He finally called out downstairs someone to get the janitor. 
    There are people at his door. 
    One of the officers went downstairs. 
    He got the janitor. 
    They knocked again. 
    And when he called, “Who's there?” 
    The janitor answered, “Janitor”. 
    Therefore, the door was opened. 
    And the -- you'll find the testimony of the officer on record page 37, "The door was opened three or four inches and he had a knife chain attached on the inside." 
    The officer said, “I had my wallet opened with identification exposed and I've placed this inside the door saying I had a search warrant for the premise.” 
    They defend who had opened the door and was standing directly behind the partially opened door there, torn and went straight back to the bathroom. 
    Then seeing he was refusing the entrance, I placed my hand on the chain and pulled the knife -- pulled the knife chains that loosed.” 
    So there, we have the announcement of this purpose obvious refusal of the defendant to grant him immediate entrance and thereafter of pulling of the chain and affecting a forcible entrance. 
    We contend that the statute was complied. 
    It did give notice of his authority in purpose. 
    Again, you'll find that on cross-examination, his testimony on page 45 which he -- he said, “I identified myself as a police officer and said I have a search warrant." 
    He recognized the defendant and he immediately turned and went back across the foyer to the bathroom. 
    Well, the opinion of the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals seems to feel that the government officer should have announced their presence when they first -- in their identity when they first wrapped on the door. 
    The Government thinks and believes that police officers and the cases where they're searching for evidence or things which are not evidence but things which have been used in the commission of the crime or contraband, he has a right to at least get the door open by means of some strategy. 
    There was no -- to deliver and no lying here. 
    They just knock, they didn't answer, unless say, of course, the petitioner's statement of what transpired various greatly and from that of the government witnesses.

    We say that the defendant's version is not true, we say that he never gave us the chance to -- to contest it any further then he never asked for a finding by the court below, the trial court on this point and that therefore, we -- I feel that he completely raised the point that it should not be here but the Circuit Court didn't take it. 
    But in any event, the -- the Court should desire to decide this point on the record before it. 
    We contend that the fact that they didn't announce their presence when they first -- that -- their identity and the purpose when they first wrap on the door, it was perfectly all right that officers have a right to use a strategy to get people inside to open the door. 
    And that's obviously because if you knocked on the door and say you're a narcotic agent with a search warrant, the evidence and the contraband is going down the drain before you ever get inside the door.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    -- the announcement was made, the announcement was made before he broke the door, before he pulled the latch door, the string -- the chain there, before he pulled the chain. 
    As soon as that door was opened, he told him who he was and why he was there. 
    The man ran back. 
    He was refused to admit and so he went in, so the statute was complied with. 
    Government Justice -- Judge Bazelon's only complaint was that you didn't comply within earlier, and my answer to that is that's utterly impractical because if you come across to that extent, you might not never need to worry about search warrant because you're never going to find any narcotics because it's going down the drain in normal reaction. 
    And secondly, there's another reason in the cases of more serious nature. 
    If you're going over, this has been applied in the Woods case to arrest, you're going to arrest around a desperate character and you tell him who you are you'll able to find some fellow shooting at you. 
    And so, you have a right to try to get that door open for your own protection. 
    I think officers have that right. 
    Otherwise, you can announce. 
    An officer announces who he is before the -- he gets and then to open the door. 
    He's likely to get killed. 
    And it's a real serious thing. 
    I'm not saying every case, but there certainly are some cases. 
    We had one example of it here in the district. 
    For example, where an officer was killed, he never know. 
    So, they have a right to take precautions to prevent the destruction of contraband and the materials used in the crime and to protect their own lives.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, perhaps, we ought to clear that point. 
    When the officers knock, apparently, the defendant went into the bathroom, and he -- he leaned outside and he called down to the man downstairs who was a detective to tell him that someone was at his door and please get the janitor. 
    But at the same time, he reached around and so he went to -- into an awning that was partially closed, apparently, had falls and there was a bird's nest in the awning. 
    And he placed his hand in there, and it was in the bird's nest that they found the narcotics and the adequate paraphernalia. 
    In other words, he was using a bird's nest which the birds had used to -- that constructed in a partially closes, partially opened and closed awning. 
    They find the narcotics. 
    In effect, the --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6363.454" stopTime="6365.508">

    Was known that they went to that?
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="6365.508" stopTime="6399.919">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, as the officer testified, I believe that the bird's nest where they've got the paraphernalia and the other one looked out. 
    And the bird's nest fell out and fell down on the window ledge and that's the time that they found the capsule. 
    [Laughs] So, actually much as I don't have the narcotics if I'll not even be considered as being on the premises, it might -- but of course they want to break that argument because [Laughs] the -- the awning, the awning was attached over the window.
