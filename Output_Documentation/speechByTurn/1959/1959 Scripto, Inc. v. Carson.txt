Scripto, Inc. v. Carson

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 80, Scripto, Incorporated, etcetera, Appellant, versus Dale Carson, as Sheriff of Duval County, Florida, et al. 
    Mr. Haley, you may proceed.

    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Florida which so interpreted the Florida Sales and Use Tax Act as to require Scripto Incorporated, the appellant here, to act as a dealer and collect the use tax of that State on sales of its Adgif products, which is its advertising specialty line, to consumers in the State of Florida. 
    Having so held, the Supreme Court of Florida, then held that the statute as thus construed and applied did not violate either the Commerce Clause or the Due Process Clause of the Constitution of the United States. 
    Scripto Incorporated is a Georgia corporation which has its principal office and place of business in the City of Atlanta, where its manufacturing plant is located also. 
    Scripto has not qualified to do business in the State of Florida. 
    It has in the State of Florida, no office, warehouse, distributing room or other place of business. 
    It owns no property, no inventory, no stock of goods and no bank account in the State of Florida. 
    Adgif Company is not a separate corporation, but is a division of Scripto Incorporated and Adgif likewise has its office in Atlanta. 
    Adgif devotes its activity to the sale and distribution of mechanical writing instruments with advertising material imprinted thereon. 
    There are no employees of Scripto and no activity of Scripto in the State of Florida which has any relation, whatever, to the distribution or sale of the Adgif line of merchandise. 
    The sole activity in Florida which generates orders resulting in Adgif sales is the activity of independent commission brokers who represent not only the Adgif division of Scripto, but other manufacturers as well.

speaker="george_b_haley_jr" startTime="161.560" stopTime="387.602">
    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    That's right, sir. 
    Those advertising specialty brokers have a brief form of written contract with Adgif Company and that contract is -- is in the record in this case at page 19 of the record. 
    By the terms of that contract, Adgif Company exercises no control whatever over these advertising specialty brokers. 
    The contract merely provides for the rate of commission to be paid, the brokers, the conditions under which the commission is to be paid, is -- does not require that they devote any particular amount of their time to the solicitation of orders to Adgif sales or that they not represent others as well as Adgif. 
    It provides expressly that the intention of the parties is that the broker shall not represent or hold himself out as a representative of Adgif Company, that he has no authority to make any collections or deliveries or to incur any debts for Adgif, that his sole authority is to solicit orders subject always to the right of Scripto, Adgif Company in Atlanta, to either accept or reject those orders when they are received. 
    The contract expressly states that no relationship of employer and employee is intended that the salesman is an independent contractor. 
    When this advertising specialty broker receives an order and forwards -- forwards it to Adgif in Atlanta, if Adgif, in its discretion, sees fit to accept that order, the order is consummated by delivery of the merchandise to an interstate carrier in Atlanta and delivery is completed at that time, therefore, be Atlanta that has expressly provided in the order forms which is the next exhibit following that contract. 
    That title shall pass in the City of Atlanta when property is delivered to the carrier. 
    Shipment is made directly to the customer in Florida. 
    The advertising specialty broker has nothing to do with any deliveries. 
    Payment for the merchandise is made directly to Adgif in Atlanta. 
    The broker is not permitted and does not make collections. 
    Now, Scripto in addition to its Adgif sales, sells its regular line of merchandise through wholesalers throughout the country for resale. 
    That is the line of merchandise which you see at the -- at the corner drugstore. 
    Now, those -- the distribution and sale of Scripto's regular lines which I would like to refer to it here, is completely separate and distinct from the distribution and sale of its Adgif line. 
    Scripto does employ one employee salesman who resides in the City of Jacksonville, Florida and whose sole authority and function is to solicit orders and promote business by these wholesale jobbers for the regular Scripto line. 
    It is a stipulated fact in this case that Adgif sales do not arise by reason of any activity of this employee salesman and that those sales arise solely by reason of the solicitation activity of the independent brokers who solicit the Adgif orders. 
    That is a -- a stipulated fact and I might mention that there are no disputed facts actually in this case. 
    The case was tried on -- on a stipulated -- stipulated facts.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is that issue on the case as the one you've been describing?
speaker="george_b_haley_jr" startTime="392.178" stopTime="566.553">
    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    I -- I think not, Your Honor. 
    I think that -- and the Supreme Court of Florida in deciding that Scripto was a co-dealer, within the meaning of Section 212.06 (g) of the Florida statute, said that, “It is so only because of this solicitation activity of these independent brokers and not by reason of this completely unrelated and unconnected activity of the Scripto employee salesman.” 
    It is our position that -- that amounts to a construction of the Florida statute to that effect by the Supreme Court of that State and that it is binding on this Court. 
    And that the only question before this Court is whether a state may constitutionally require an interstate seller who has no place of business, no employees within a state, whose interstate sales arise solely by reason of solicitation activity of independent brokers who represents other sellers as well, whether such a state under those circumstances may constitutionally require this out-of-state seller to act a tax collector for the use tax arising out of those sales to Florida consumers. 
    It is appellant's further contentions that this statute as construed and applied in this case, imposes a direct burden on interstate commerce. 
    Now, we concede that it is a use tax which we're dealing with here, rather than a sales tax. 
    In other words, that the incidence of the -- of the tax imposition is on the Florida residents who uses or consumes the product. 
    We concede that the State of Florida has the constitutional right to tax used by its citizens of tangible personal property. 
    This Court has long ago decided that, but what we challenge is the direct imposition upon Scripto of the duty of acting as a tax collector and we submit that from the Florida statute, it is abundantly clear that this is a burden which is imposed for the privilege of engaging in business in the State of Florida. 
    And I would like to direct the Court's attention in that connection to Section 212.12 of the statute -- on page 29 of the statute which is in the appendix of our brief. 
    The pages of the appendix are separately numbered from the brief.

    If you can compare it, you -- you do. 
    But let me point out this -- what this Section 212.12 provides and -- and because it bears directly on this question. 
    It says, “Taxes imposed by this chapter upon the privilege of the use, consumption or storage for consumption or sale of tangible personal property shall be collected upon the basis of an addition of 3% to the total price, total sale price of such article or articles that are purchased, sold or leased at any one time to a customer or buyer.” 
    And then this was the part that I want to call particular attention of the Court to. 
    “And the dealer or person in charge herein, is required to pay a privilege tax of 3% on the total of his gross sales of tangible personal property and such personal or dealer shall add 3% to the price, rental or admissions and collect the total sum from the purchaser (Inaudible) lessee or consumer.” 
    In other words, the tax -- the imposition imposed on the dealer is expressly stated to be a privilege tax of 3% of the total of his gross sales in this Section 212.12.

    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    -- but that is not the only ground for the burden. 
    I mean this Court has stricken down impositions or exactions imposed by a state rather than tax exactions. 
    I mean a state regulatory measure maybe invalid because it imposes a direct imposition on interstate commerce. 
    But --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="877.293" stopTime="885.887">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you arguing that the Constitution places the power to regulate commerce in Congress and not in the State?
speaker="george_b_haley_jr" startTime="885.887" stopTime="889.016">
    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    Primarily, until the Congress has --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="889.016" stopTime="894.527">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It says, “Congress shall have power to regulate.” 
    It doesn't say the States had that power.
speaker="george_b_haley_jr" startTime="894.527" stopTime="1199.255">
    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    No, that's exactly the point I'm making. 
    That -- that the states here -- that this State is by this construction of its statute regulating and impeding interstate commerce. 
    Even if the Court, however, should consider that this is not a direct imposition on interstate commerce, we would like to point out that the burden imposed by this from tax collection duty here is unreasonable and that it bares no relationship whatever to any privilege or benefit derived by Scripto from the State of Florida. 
    There is no need for relationship whatever to any need of the State of Florida to collect its taxes in this manner and that the imposition on the appellant, Scripto, is beyond all proportion to any benefit derived by the State of Florida from collecting its taxes in this manner. 
    This Court has recognized that there must be some local incident, some local activity however minute, from which the obligation which the State seeks to impose arises. 
    And as a result of which the out-of-state corporation derives some benefit from the State before that State has the power to burden the interstate transaction. 
    For example, in General Trading Company and in the International Shoe Case, this Court found that solicitation of orders by employee salesman even though a very minimum connection with the State imposing the obligation, was nevertheless, a sufficient nexus or connection to permit the State to impose an obligation arising directly out of that specific activity which the Court clearly pointed out in the International Shoe Case or as the basis for that decision. 
    But here, there is no activity of Scripto in the State of Florida in relation to its Adgif sales. 
    It is not there. 
    The only activity there in relation to those sales is the activity of independent brokers who are themselves, Florida business, who are themselves protected by and derived benefit from the laws of the State of Florida and who maybe and presumably, are required to discharge certain obligations in return for those benefits. 
    I would like to point out that this statute expressly conflicts that a broker who represents an out-of-state merchant who refuses to register and collect this tax, is himself made the dealer and required to collect the tax. 
    Therefore, the State of Florida here under the terms of its own statute has a means of collecting this tax from the 10 independent advertising specialty brokers who solicit the Adgif orders. 
    They are by the terms of the statute, required to register as dealers and collect the tax and Scripto does not do so, so far has not lost anything by the interstate -- by reason of the interstate immunity of Scripto. 
    I would also like to point out that the danger and in fact the existence of possibility of discrimination against interstate commerce is inherent in this statute. 
    The various section of the Florida act which defines the term dealer and which was the definition which the Florida court held to apply here, which appears -- appears at page 15 of the appendix to our brief, “At the defining dealer to mean and include every person who solicits business by representatives or by the distribution of catalogs or other advertising matter and by a reason thereof, receives and accept orders from consumers.” 
    And this -- as it goes on to say. 
    “And such dealers shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter from the purchaser and no action either in law or in equity on a sale or transaction as provided by the terms of this chapter maybe held in the State by any such dealer, unless it would be affirmatively shown that the provisions of this chapter had been fully complied with.” 
    And that is the only class of dealer against whom the Florida statute imposes this penalty of denial of access to the Florida courts, is the dealer defined in that section which is obviously out-of-state dealers, because it as a dealer who gets business by reason of solicitation of orders by representatives, catalogs and so forth.

    I don't think the term that this case need turn on whether they are -- the term agent or representative should be applied to these brokers. 
    I think the -- the crucial question is the extent of their authority, the extent to which they are authorized to and do represent this out-of-state seller. 
    I don't think the label is of any consequence. 
    For example -- for example, in the case of -- in the case of Felt &amp; Tarrant, which the California case, there we had an agent, true. 
    But it bore -- that agent bore no resemblance to their agent involved in this case, if this be an agent because there was a general agent who devoted his entire term to the out-of-state seller who is required to do so, who is required to make periodic reports, who's expenses were reimbursed by his principal, who made local deliveries. 
    He was the alter ego of the out of state -- possible leave to a greater extent than the employee salesman in General Trading.

    I cited it and quoted only that section which dealt with the definition of independent contractor because it is our contention that that definition is merely declaratory of existing law. 
    That this Court, in several cases involving jurisdiction for purposes of service of process and bringing of suits has held that the doing of business by an independent contractor on behalf of an out-of-state concern does not constitute the doing of business by the out-of-state concern. 
    And this Court has held that that is true even though the -- the local business be a wholly owned subsidiary, even of the out-of-state business.

   Argument of Joseph C. Jacobs

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You -- you may, Mr. Haley.

    Mr. Joseph C. Jacobs 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The appellant has fairly stated the facts in this case. 
    I think as they were stipulated to -- in the court below. 
    We would like to challenge certain conclusions of law which were reached as a result of some of those facts. 
    The case which is present and before the Court comes somewhere between the Miller Bros. case and the General Trading case, both of which were subject to extensive study in both of the briefs and which the appellant has referred to in his argument. 
    The Court well recalls that the -- the distinction between the Miller Bros. case and the General Trading case. 
    Now, the only distinction between the case which is presently before the Court and the General Trading case is the fact that the agents, the solicitors, the salesmen in Florida in the case presently before the Court are not the employees of the -- of the merchant, the Georgia merchant who is selling his products in Florida. 
    The question necessarily comes as to whether or not the contact is -- is completed which would give Florida jurisdiction to require this person to collect the tax and to remit. 
    This is the only material fact which is before the Court in this case which was not before the Court in the General Trading case.

    Mr. Joseph C. Jacobs 
    [Laughs] Thank you, sir. 
    The -- there was no contact in the Miller Bros. case, as I recall the facts in the Miller Bros. case, the -- there -- let me see, the States were Delaware and Maryland. 
    There was a Delaware corporation as I recall it, in which did business in Delaware and who sold to certain Maryland citizens. 
    The only contact with the Maryland citizens were -- was as a result of certain advertisement in newspapers and radio and (Inaudible) direct mail advertising. 
    The persons then came across the state line, purchased the product and the product was presumably, ultimately consumed or used in the state of residence of the purchaser. 
    Now, in the case that we have before us today, we have 10 jobbers who admittedly are employed by other people or who are -- who are out presumably selling. 
    And we call the Court's attention likewise to the contract of agreement, the memorandum of agreement between these jobbers and the Scripto Inc. operating through its Adgif division. 
    And what does provide? 
    It provides that these people have a -- area in which they are the exclusive salesmen for Scripto Inc. or Adgif, whatever you want to call them, it's -- it is the alter ego, one or the other. 
    These are not separate corporations as it had been pointed out. 
    As long as he places one order every six -- every 60 days, he -- he remains an active salesman of the Scripto Inc.

    [Laughter] 
    May it please the Court, we would desire to go further in this distinction which we want to take issue with the appellant as to this one general salesman which Scripto has in Jacksonville, Florida. 
    Now, the Florida Supreme Court held that these 10 jobbers, independent commissioners or commissioned merchants were sufficient to make contacts which would be sufficient to meet the requirement of the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. 
    However, we certainly say and we do -- we do not say to this Court that -- that it should ignore the fact that they had a one man who was stationed in Jacksonville who was working for Scripto Inc., which is the corporation of which Adgif is nothing more than a department. 
    And this man was -- although he was not and we stipulated that this man did not make -- can't make a -- accept orders for the advertisement specialties which are -- which are handled by Adgif. 
    He did accept orders and -- and made sales for Scripto Inc. 
    And we take the position that if the Florida court had jurisdiction, it must have jurisdiction of Scripto Inc., the cooperate -- the Corporation, not over any department or any part or any individual, because the jurisdiction is of the corporation. 
    The jurisdiction is certainly not of the individual transaction or any part of the transaction.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2100.350" stopTime="2105.904">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    And now, that -- you address that argument, as I understand it, to the due process features.
speaker="joseph_c_jacobs" startTime="2105.904" stopTime="2107.362">
    Mr. Joseph C. Jacobs 
    Yes, sir. 
    I do.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2107.362" stopTime="2133.386">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    But does that have to do with Mr. Haley's argument of undue burden on commerce in imposing a liability on Scripto for use taxes on goods sold in Georgia and that are delivered through as orders or in filling orders obtained in for or by independent contractors?
speaker="joseph_c_jacobs" startTime="2133.386" stopTime="2273.737">
    Mr. Joseph C. Jacobs 
    No, sir. 
    Our response to that argument is that there is no undue -- there is no direct burden, there is no -- no direct burden at all, because the -- the Florida sales tax is a 1949 act. 
    It's a sales and use tax. 
    The Court is well acquainted with the history of the use tax, how that -- the sales tax was -- was initially passed and it became obvious immediately that a burden was placed upon the merchant in the -- in the State that had a tax in competing with the merchant across the state line in the State that had no tax, because here is the merchant in the taxing state who -- who sells a -- the -- the gentleman the product and he charges him with 3% sales tax for the product. 
    But, by the independent jobber who can walk right by -- right -- right behind this salesman and sell the same product to the same person for the same use and say, “No, I don't have to collect the tax, because I am across the state line.” 
    Obviously, that -- that was the purpose that -- that brought into existence, the use tax. 
    The use tax is a complement to the -- to the sales tax. 
    It is to protect the -- the merchant in the State that has the tax against the merchant across the state line where there is no tax and that is the very basis. 
    This case puts in crystal clear the very basis for the use tax. 
    Let's -- let's presume the appellant to be correct.Let's presume that he is -- he is entirely correct. 
    Scripto Inc. through Adgif division or department goes to a Florida citizen and he sells him 100 pens with his name on them to give to the public. 
    He charges him a price for it. 
    He says, “What do I have to -- what about the sales tax? 
    No. 
    There is no sale or use tax on this product because I am an independent jobber for a Georgia concern.” 
    Now, the Florida citizen walks right behind him, makes the same sale to the same person, the same transaction exactly and we tell them -- him that it is a crime unless he collects 3% and remits that 3% to the State of Florida, excluding what he receives for the service.

    Mr. Joseph C. Jacobs 
    Oh, no, sir. 
    That is collected in Georgia and -- and the jobbers' commission comes from Georgia. 
    Now, we say again, another point here, how crystal clear and how easy it would be if we say that because he's an independent jobber, he can now -- he -- he is now free of the tax. 
    Look how simple it would be to draw a contract, just exactly and I'm glad Mr. Justice Brennan brought up the question of this statute which was passed recently relating to that subject. 
    As the Court is well familiar, that statute relates purely to income taxes and we, in Florida, do not have any income tax. 
    I'd like that clearly indirect, but this -- and that's all that the statute related to, was to income taxes. 
    It did as pointed out. 
    And the appellant's argument defined certain terms. 
    But I'd like to direct your attention to the -- and I'm a little bit concerned because Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggested at the case just prior to this one that they would not take judicial notice, but I refer to --

    Well, in Senate Report Number 658, relating to this bill on the income tax, the Committee admitted that the bill rose as a result of this Court's decision in the Northwestern States Portland Cement Company versus State of Minnesota and Williams versus Stockham, 1959 cases.

    Mr. Joseph C. Jacobs 
    Thank you, sir. 
    I can't read them right. 
    The Committee specifically referred to this language of the Court, “We conclude that net income from the interstate -- intrastate operation of -- intrastate operation of a foreign corporation maybe subjected to state taxation providing the levy is not discriminatory and properly apportional -- apportionable to local activities within the taxing state, forming sufficient nexus to support the same.” 
    Then, the -- the Committee Report went on to say that there was some confusion as to what this language meant and the statute came from that confusion. 
    We take the position that the Court varies -- very fairly and very -- very clearly stated the law in those two cases. 
    And that the statute was written with the obvious intent of -- of changing that -- those decisions. 
    So, we now say that the general law is exactly as it was, except as it relates to the income taxes and this -- and the Congress, the United States took it upon itself to --

    We stipulated that he made no sales of Adgif products, but we do say that he was a representative of Scripto that he makes sale, that -- that if -- that the jurisdictional contact is of the corporation, Scripto Inc. and not of the individual nor of the individual transaction.

   Rebuttal of George B. Haley, Jr.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3443.476" stopTime="3444.674">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If I must --
speaker="george_b_haley_jr" startTime="3444.674" stopTime="3568.573">
    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    If I could comment just on the procedural questions as how -- as to how this case came up. 
    They were threatening to attach or garnish some of our account receivable and we came into Court and asked for an injunction against that Act as to how they get the information or the figures on which to base an assessment the statute provides. 
    You either furnish them in the books, so they make an assessment from the best information available to them and that that assessment is presumptively correct. 
    I would like to point out that this statute does require that we apply to the control of it for a permit as a dealer in the State that we pay this minimum dollar registration fee that we appoint an agent for service or process upon us in the State at least as to liabilities arising under this Act that we maybe required in the discretion of the Comptroller to put up a cash or a collateral bond to secure the performance of our obligations under this contract, under the statute which is certainly a provision which is more likely to be administered by the Comptroller to require the State concerns to put up such deposit. 
    And I'd like to point out that in Miller Bros., there was far more involved than mere advertising. 
    The furniture store, in that case, delivered 67% of its -- its sales to Mount -- Maryland residence in its own trust. 
    21% of its total sales were consummated by delivery by interstate carrier. 
    Both of those cases then, he would know the destination of the sale, the -- that the purchaser was a resident of Maryland. 
    12% only of its total sales were consummated by delivery to the purchaser in the store. 
    And even in those cases, if the purchaser bought on credit which the -- under the stipulation of facts was commonly done, the seller would know the destination ultimately of the sale.

    What do you make of this drummer or salesman in -- in your case?

    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    You mean Nippert -- such as the Nippert case?

    No, no, Scripto salesman --

    Oh.

    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    Oh. 
    In this case, it is a stipulated fact that he has no connection whatever with the Adgif sales. 
    I say that under Norton Company against Department of Revenue, since we have satisfied the burden of separating his activity from the activity in question -- from the sales in question, the Commerce Clause would forbid the imposition of this duty with respect to Adgif sales by virtue of the activity of that salesman --

    Mr. Jacobs --

    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    -- which is unconnected.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3644.300" stopTime="3653.918">

    But, Mr. Jacobs' argument is that the corporation is there, figuratively speaking, because they've got a salesman there.

    This --

    And Scripto has seen fit not to differentiate by way of corporations this business for which their job. 
    What do you say to that?

    Mr. George B. Haley, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter, this Court has never held that mere solicitation of orders subjects a corporation to the jurisdiction of a state for all purposes. 
    In International Shoe, this Court was careful to point out that the liability imposed, that is the State unemployment tax, arose out of that very limited activity, namely the employment of employees in the State (Inaudible). 
    And that the cause of action in -- in that suit arose out of that same activity. 
    And therefore, that the State -- State have the jurisdiction to tax and the Court had jurisdiction over the corporation. 
    But this Court has not gone further than that under the Due Process Clause.
