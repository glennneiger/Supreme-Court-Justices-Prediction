    Mr. Solomon J. Bischoff 
    -- may it please the Court. 
    The -- this case presents for consideration of the Court, two issues. 
    One involves the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment under the facts in this case and the other involves the application of the Statute of Limitations in criminal conspiracy cases. 
    The -- briefly the -- with respect to the first issue, the record's facts are that the petitioner was indicted with another one named Seijas for conspiracy to violate the Section 145 of the Internal Revenue Code, that is that conspiracy to attempt to evade the tax. 
    The precise method of attempted evasion was described in two -- four subsections; one, merely alleges that they conspired to evade without designating or describing any means by which they would attempt to do so and the second subdivision (d) describes a sort of a hybrid violation. 
    It's – it alleges that they conspired to evade -- to violate Section 145 (b), the tax evasion statute and 1001 of the Criminal Code, the false statement statute, conjunctively. 
    And -- but they conspired to do so by making false statements and presenting false records to revenue officials. 
    Now, the -- the defendant was tried alone on this conspiracy charge and was found guilty and sentenced. 
    He appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where the conviction was reversed with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal. 
    And that was predicated upon the defense which the petitioner urged throughout the case that the case was barred -- prosecution was barred by the Statute of Limitations. 
    The -- the determination of that question as the case developed and I will describe it a little more in detail later, briefly it turned upon the question whether there existed in the case evidence of the subsidiary conspiracy to -- to -- which would prolong the operation of the Statute of Limitations of the character that had been described in the Krulewitch and Grunewald cases. 
    And the Court of Appeals determined that there was no evidence of the character and type of agreement that was found necessary to prolong the Statute of Limitations in those two cases and consequently the -- directed the judgment of acquittal, said that the -- that the -- it was error to submit the case to the jury. 
    Now, after that decision was rendered, the Government filed what it denominated a petition for a rehearing, but which we, the petitioner contends, was not a petition for a rehearing in legal contemplation, although so denominated that it presented to the Court a -- new issues for determination upon which it thought they should have another trial. 
    It presented a -- an issue which they called an alternative theory which it said could have been submitted to the jury and the case would have been tried upon that alternative theory. 
    And they did not challenge the correctness of the one conclusion or the one issue which the Court of Appeals decided, namely that there was no evidence to sustain the conviction on the theory upon which the case was tried and submitted to the jury. 
    They didn't ask that the reversal shall be set aside. 
    It only asked that instead of directing the judgment of acquittal, that the opinion should be modified to direct a new trial. 
    And the Court of Appeals, in its modifying opinion, merely determined that there was evidence on the record which would have sustained this so-called alternative theory and the case might have been tried on that alternative theory. 
    That was the language of the modification opinion. 
    Your Honor will find it at -- in the record at page 1936 to 1937. 
    The Court concluded and said, “It now appears to us that the case might have been tried upon this alternative theory, namely, that the conspiracy continued past the filing of the returns for the purpose of protecting the tax -- taxpayers from tax prosecution.” 
    Now, it -- the Court did not say that it was at the -- that they found that it had -- was an error in his formal conclusion that there was lack of evidence. 
    It didn't -- that they had -- no contention was made on that respect and it didn't make such a finding. 
    And this new theory was one that was presented to the Court of Appeals for the first time in this petition which they call the petition for a new trial, but which -- before a rehearing, but which we say is an original petition for a new trial.

    Mr. Solomon J. Bischoff 
    Yes, we say in legal effect it was a -- an original proceeding in the Court of Appeals and I say it was a legal effect of that as such an original proceeding, because the case was not tried on this so-called alternative theory. 
    The Government took no exceptions to the theory upon which the case was submitted to the jury, didn't object to those -- to that theory. 
    It did not request submission to the jury of any instructions predicated on this alternative theory. 
    And so, there was nothing for the court -- the District Court to pass upon in connection with this question of the availability or nonavailability of an alternative theory.

    The Government can't move for a new trial under trial of court, denied that right.

speaker="solomon_j_bischoff" startTime="2659.649" stopTime="2957.270">
    Mr. Solomon J. Bischoff 
    We say -- but we say that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain that new phase either in its original opinion or under the petition for rehearing, because it was not, in legal effect, a petition for rehearing. 
    Our view is and -- that if whenever you in -- present to the appellate court entirely new issue, which was not ruled upon in the court below, it's no longer – it's not a court of review, being asked to try a case de novo. 
    That is what it -- what it amounts to and that particularly (Inaudible) in criminal cases. 
    Now -- now, the -- they're -- in the further exemplifications that I did that we call attention to the fact that the federal rules of criminal procedure expressly prohibit the reexamination of the giving of instructions or the failure to give instructions unless they are brought to the attention of the Court and exception taken and if in the case of failure to give instructions, there is an absence of request for submission, that rule precludes review. 
    The District Court could not have reviewed its instructions, its failure to give instructions involving the alternative theory and the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction under this rule to review the -- the failure to give instructions embodying theory even though there'd be evidence to sustain it. 
    Now, we submit -- of the -- here correct rule of what is laid down on the -- on the only case that directly passed upon this subject was a case in the Ninth Circuit, the Corn case as to what power the Court of Appeals has upon reversal, whether to direct an acquittal or to -- or to direct a new trial. 
    Whether there's that discretionary power in that respect. 
    Now, that Court held squarely that there was no discretion in that situation. 
    That if the defendant was entitled at the close of the Government's -- of the entire case to a judgment of acquittal, that became vested right, an accrued right that it had and it can't -- couldn't be taken away from unconstitutionally. 
    And therefore, when the Court of Appeals reverses on the ground that there was no evidence warranting submission of the case to the jury, if that -- it could do noting else, but to give him the same relief and the same kind of judgment that he was entitled to receive at the hands of the District Court in the first instance. 
    That was his accrued right as the courts put it. 
    Now, the court in that case, gave a good deal of consideration to the question that examines the authorities at length and came to that conclusion. 
    And I haven't found any case in which the force of the reasoning employed has ever been has offset -- the value that court as -- as precedent. 
    We think that the philosophy of that case ought to be adopted by this Court.

    If they were in -- in legal -- if in legal contemplation, they were asking the case that tried -- the court to try the case de novo then it had no jurisdiction to examine the case or to entertain that petition. 
    And I say they have no jurisdiction to do that because that question was never presented to the trial court and wasn't presented to the courts in the first instance and that's kind of a petition, despite the fact they call it a petition for rehearing, must be considered for what it is in a legal effect, a petition asking the Court of Appeals for a new trial on -- so that he could be tried on the theory that the man was never tried on before.

   Argument of Abbott M. Sellers
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3066.975" stopTime="3073.156">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may, Mr. Bischoff. 
    Mr. Sellers.
speaker="abbott_m_sellers" startTime="3073.156" stopTime="3531.562">
    Mr. Abbott M. Sellers 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I should like to take a few minutes to settle once and for all, the chronology here of this case and to demonstrate, without any doubt, that from the very beginning, from the indictment all the way through the case, the Government took the position in line with the so-called alternative theory upheld by this Court in Grunewald, namely, a continuing conspiracy on what this Court called in adopting the Second Circuit that is a dissent in the Second Circuit's characterization, namely, the installment theory of conspiracy. 
    The Government did not submit this case that is the indictment was not drawn. 
    The case was not argued to the jury. 
    The evidence was not so framed on the subsidiary conspiracy theory that this Court struck down in -- in Grunewald. 
    Now, to pursue that further, the indictment charged these two individuals with conspiring first to the attempt to evade the taxes of one of the conspirators. 
    Second, it charged a violation of the evasion statute 145 (b) and the false statement statute, by means of making false statements in order to cover up the income of Seijas, one of the conspirators. 
    It then alleged 33 overt acts pursuant to the conspiracy, seven of which occurred within six years of the returning of the indictment. 
    So that's the first point. 
    The indictment did not depend upon a subsidiary conspiracy theory. 
    Now the evidence; just briefly to review the overt acts that were established here within the six-year period before indictment. 
    The Government -- that is the indictment alleges four acts 24, 26, 29 and 30, which consists in a revenue agent visiting both of these conspirators who had a joint office and who ran these pinball machine out of partnerships and that agent during the period 1948, made numerous visits to that office, talked to both conspirators, discussed various phases of the -- the taxes and the taxes or rather, and the income of the four pinball partnerships operated by the -- this business and submitted two reports which resulted in minor deficiencies. 
    In the course of that investigation, they were -- the agent asked for and was given books which were false that namely, they did not disclose the true income of the four pinball partnerships and the evidence is uncontradicted in that respect. 
    Again, in 1931, I mean in -- I beg your pardon, overt act 31, in 1951, at the request of the agent's Seijas had prepared and that was given to Seijas and he in time, turned it over to the revenue agents, a net worth statement, which showed no additional income for the period, 1942 through 1945. 
    That is no unreported income, whereas in truth and in fact, the evidence later established that there was at least $86,000 that was not included in those books, neither was it included in the returns of Seijas, that's overt act 31. 
    Overt act 32 and 33, maybe looked together, consisting of statements made by Seijas in the year 1952, January, the lower year before this indictment was returned. 
    Those statements, one of them in effect, was that Seijas believed that he had reported all of his income from the year of 19 -- the year of 1942 through 1945. 
    The other statement was that in relation to $165,000 shown on this net worth statement, that he, Seijas, had no knowledge where that money came from, but notwithstanding the fact that in the early 1953, which as we say, was the time when this conspiracy was abandoned. 
    Seijas came to the agents and said that $165,000 belongs in 1942 through 1945. 
    So, the evidence was not submitted on the theory of a -- of a subsidiary conspiracy namely a conspiracy to conceal a conspiracy.

    Mr. Justice Whittaker, may I correct a statement I made? 
    The chronology -- chronology of the situation was this with respect to the Grunewald case. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit handed down its decision April 1956. 
    And that decision recognized in affect, two theories, the so-called subsidiary conspiracy theory, although Judge Frank dissented. 
    And also, the continuing conspiracy theory, the trial followed that by a few weeks, so that at the time the instructions were given to the jury on the authority of the Second Circuit's opinion, it -- it appeared that there was no error in the -- in the instruction with respect to subsidiary conspiracy, because this Court had not spoken and the Second Circuit had endorsed it. 
    Then, the trial ended on August 9th -- August 15, 1956 and the following May, nine months later, this Court handed down the Grunewald decision and, of course, struck down the implied subsidiary conspiracy theory.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Sellers, I would just like to clear one last thing up for in the sequence of opinions of the Court of Appeals. 
    You've now, pointed out to us and you're continuing with the other evidences of it, that in fact, there was a charge on the continuing conspiracy theory and also a charge that submitted by the defendant on the subsidiary conspiracy here. 
    And yet, the last opinion, do I correctly read it of the Court of Appeals, says this. 
    “We held that the case was submitted to the jury on an impermissible theory. 
    The jury was simply not properly instructed. 
    As we noted in our modifying opinion, the indictment was sufficient here to present -- and the indictment was sufficient to present an alternative theory. 
    Furthermore, the record contains evidence which would tend dissent -- sustain proof of overt acts and so forth in that theory.” 
    Do I correctly read this that at least the Court of Appeals had no impression that the case had been submitted to the jury on both theories?

speaker="abbott_m_sellers" startTime="4910.174" stopTime="5208.290">
    Mr. Abbott M. Sellers 
    They're contained, sir, on page -- on our -- in our brief, pages 4 and 5, in Footnote 3. 
    Particularly as I pointed out a while ago on bottom of page 5, the next to the last paragraph that is in the footnote says, “Third and goes on to point out that the jury must find that one -- one or more the conspirators committed an act, an overt act or action within a period of six years prior to the following indictment herein, in furtherance of the conspiracy and during its continuance to accomplish the object, namely, attempted evasion of the tax liability of Seijas.” 
    Now, that clearly is charging a continuing conspiracy to accomplish the original objective of the conspiracy, not a conspiracy to conceal a conspiracy. 
    I should also like to say a few words on the point that we emphatically disagree with the petitioner's statement that the Court of Appeals, when it granted the petitioner's original request and remanded the case for judgment of acquittal, that the Court of Appeals based that decision on the evidence. 
    Your Honors please, on page 1934 and 1935 of the record, the Court of Appeals after a lengthy discussion of the two theories in Grunewald and pointing out that -- that the subsidiary conspiracy to conceal a conspiracy is invalid, ends up by saying, “Upon the authority of this decision, namely, Grunewald of the Supreme Court, we hold that it was error to permit the case to go to the jury.” 
    Furthermore on its -- in its -- among other places, in its third opinion on record 1940, the Court emphatically says, “Denies that it had taken that initial action on the basis of insufficiency of evidence.” 
    It pointed out that it took that action because it didn't understand originally that the Government was relying on the continuing conspiracy theory. 
    It's the Government's position that -- that -- but for this single item, namely, the instruction to the jury on the theory that there was a -- there had to be a conspiracy to conceal a conspiracy, had that instruction not have been injected into the record by this petitioner, that this case would come to this Court with a flawless record that would support the conviction and we see no distinction otherwise, between this case and Grunewald. 
    And there's no reason, it's apparent that this petitioner should be given any different treatment than was given to Grunewald, because there was a -- it's the same confusion as to -- that may have been created in the minds of the jury as to which theory was the proper one.

    Did it end at some particular time or was there also an agreement between Mr. Seijas and Mr. Forman to continue concealment after 1945 of their activities relating to the amusement company earnings during the years 1941 and 40 -- through 1945?

    Mr. Solomon J. Bischoff 
    Now, as Your Honor, it was also -- it was also asserted here that at least, I may have been mistaken, but I understood counsel to say that the Court of Appeals considered and decided some issue other than the question whether their was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury. 
    Now, here this is the concluding statement of the Court in its first opinion. 
    And it reversed, after analyzing Krulewitch and Grunewald cases and the kind of evidence that must be presented to establish the subsidiary conspiracy and the elements of such a conspiracy which included that first that the evidence must be direct, that it must be an expressed original agreement. 
    That it must be an agreement to continue to act in concert to conceal and so on. 
    After discussing all that, the Court concludes by saying, “The policy that blocked the theories stated in Krulewitch, blocks this one also.” 
    In other words, if this was the conclusion that the evidence was insufficient, it was the only issue decided. 
    On the authority of this decision of the Court, we hold that it was error to submit the case to the jury. 
    Now, it's been -- the counsel asserted that the -- that because of a new trial was directed in the Grunewald case, the same should be done here, I saw no difference. 
    Well, there's a marked difference, a very important difference. 
    In Grunewald, they were not confronted with the constitutional protection against double jeopardy. 
    In the Grunewald, it wasn't the Government that was seeking a new trial. 
    In Grunewald, the defendant appealed and the defendant sought the new trial. 
    In the criminal case, the defendant -- the -- the Government has no right to a new trial and we -- in that respect, we call attention of the Court to Justice -- to Justice Cardozo's statement in the Palko case. 
    We cited at page 23 of our brief. 
    He said the, “It, referring to the Fifth Amendment, forbade jeopardy in the same case, if the new trial was at the instance of the Government and not upon the defendant's motion.” 
    That's the problem we have here.

    Mr. Solomon J. Bischoff 
    Well, may it please the Court. 
    We make distinct request for relief in the appeal. 
    Your Honor was referring to the relief sought in the Court of Appeals. 
    We distinctly and carefully segregated the kind of relief we sought. 
    We said in the conclusion, I'm reading from page 109 and when Your Honors will see the brief with counsel, but just you'll see it there any conclusion that judgment should be reversed and directed to enter judgment of acquittal, if reversal is based on any of classifications that they're numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. 
    Now, 1 and 3 presented the questions that we've been discussing here, the absence of evidence. 
    The insufficiency of the evidence and we were now to say, if reversal is based on specifications of error numbered 6, 7, 9 and 10, a new trial should be ordered. 
    Now, those presented assignments of error relating to errors in -- in admission of evidence and so on, which would warrant the reversal with a new trial. 
    We carefully segregated, so we would not be construed as having waived our demand for a judgment of acquittal, if we are sustained in our contention that the evidence was insufficient. 
    We took our precaution and in the cases that we cite in our brief governing this question of waiver, we call attention to the Green case in which the Court has said and rejected the contention that the taking of an appeal in and off itself is a waiver of the constitutional protection and throws the case open at large. 
    That called -- this Court called attention to Justice Holmes' statement in which he said that a waiver must be knowingly and intentionally made that can't be inferred, that there's a strong presumption against waiver of a constitutional right. 
    It called attention to Justice McKenna's statement to say in effect, so, we can see no reason of why we should be deemed to have the waived a -- the constitutional protection because we exercise the perfectly lawful right to appeal. 
    After (Inaudible) of the question of the discretionary power to remand on reversal with direction for judgment by acquittal or a new trial, we'd like to call attention to the Copacus case decided by this Court. 
    We cite it at page 15 of our reply brief on which the Court construed what was formally 206 Section 269 of the Judicial Code, which is roughly called the harmless error statute. 
    It's a discretionary statute which gives the courts power to disregard harmless error and coming to an ultimate conclusion. 
    And it's a -- in that respect, it's similar in its operation to Section 2106 of the Judicial Code which is relied on here by the Government as to the kind of relief that the appellate court can give. 
    The Court -- this Court said that in construing that statute while it confers discretion, there must be no departure from a constitutional norm. 
    Well, you're confronted with that constitutional norm in a criminal case. 
    If you're going to say that you have discretion to direct a new trial even though the defendant in the criminal case was entitled as a matter of law, as a matter of right to a judgment of acquittal in -- in the trial court, then you (Inaudible) of the constitutional protection against double jeopardy.
