Nelson v. Los Angeles County

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 152, Thomas W. Nelson and Arthur Globe, Petitioners, versus County of Los Angeles et al. 
    Mr. Wirin.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="23.420" stopTime="322.288">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    May it please the Court. 
    The petition here involves the validity of a discharge by Los Angeles County of two of its employees and initially very broadly stated the question as whether or not the discharge was that these employees were so arbitrary as to violate the due process guarantee in the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    I think perhaps it maybe helpful if I would state to Your Honors in capsule form and very summarily the factual situation or the basis upon which the discharges were made. 
    It is our position that the discharge -- the discharge of both petitioners by the County was solely because of their appearance under subpoena before a committee of Congress, the House Committee on Un-American Activities upon which appearance both defendants refused to answer certain questions pertaining to affiliation, pertaining to a communist affiliation upon -- based upon the Fifth Amendment as well as the First. 
    It is our further contention that the inquiry conducted by the federal agency, House Committee on Un-American Activities was wholly unrelated to fitness for employment to loyalty in connection with fitness for employment by the County. 
    And our further contention that both the petitioners showed the utmost candor and cooperation so far as their employer was concerned by answering all questions pertaining to their opinion and affiliation when propounded to them by the employer. 
    And that therefore, the rationale if not the decision in Slochower against the Board accompanied by the gloss in Beilan against the Board and in Lerner versus Casey. 
    Results in a conclusion, this is our plain that the discharges here were arbitrary. 
    Let me put the problem a little bit differently. 
    In terms of a statute of California, the validity of which as applied we are challenging here. 
    That statute appears in the petitioners -- in the brief of petitioners, the white brief, on pages 2 and 3. 
    These petitioners were discharged by the County under this statute. 
    And as I say, as enforced against these petitioners, it is our contention that the statute violates due process. 
    The statute appears, as I see on pages 2 and 3. 
    I shall, in a moment, refer particular to page 3 of the last paragraph of the statute about the middle of the page. 
    But let me tell Your Honors what the statute provides. 
    It is a -- it is divisible in two parts, and I make the distinction and the division because we think it’s important to our case. 
    This statute imposes an obligation upon all public employees in California to answer certain questions pertaining to affiliation and requires their dismissal if they do not comply with that mandate. 
    It requires such employees to answer such questions when asked by the governing agency, governing body that appears on page 2. 
    That portion of the statute is not an issue here because as I have already said, these petitioners answered all questions asked by the governing agency and fulfilled every requirement of any kind imposed upon them by the governing agency. 
    But the statute goes one step further and it is in that regard that we are here. 
    The statute additionally imposes an obligation upon all public employees in -- by any governmental agency in California. 
    When appearing was subpoenaed before a committee -- a committee or subcommittee of Congress that appears, Your Honors, at page 2 where the Government Code is being quoted at about the sixth to seventh line of the quotation in the middle of the page.

    And then and -- and after that, I should be done with the stays of it.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="442.457" stopTime="443.709">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    -- Your Honor understand me correctly --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="443.709" stopTime="444.093">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="444.093" stopTime="507.598">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    -- completely. 
    I am attacking the statute only as applied to these petitioners and what I want to say now, I'm -- think -- I must say now is that this statute provides that refusal to answer questions before a committee of the Congress on any ground whatsoever and that -- that's in -- now on page 3 in the middle paragraph shall constitute ground toward dismissal. 
    Now, of course, the California courts and -- and the respondent read the phrase on any ground whatsoever as we also are compelled to read it, it includes refusal to answer before a Congressional Committee based upon the Fifth Amendment, that's a ground. 
    And -- and therefore, the courts below have held that the refusal of the petitioners to answer questions falls within the statute even though there isn't any question of what the refusal of the petitioners to answer questions was based upon their invocation of the Fifth Amendment before the Committee. 
    Now, let me turn to some of the facts.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="507.598" stopTime="522.472">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    And the difference between the statute and the Slochower statute, as I understand it, is that the Slochower statute in terms referred to the Fifth Amendment and this one doesn't on its face.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="522.472" stopTime="522.922">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    That's --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="522.922" stopTime="523.666">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is that substantial --
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="523.666" stopTime="532.630">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    That's substantially correct. 
    Of course, the Slochower statute, if I may recall your -- didn't talk about the Fifth Amendment, it was a state statute. 
    And it talked about the invocation of the privilege --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="532.630" stopTime="533.360">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Correct.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="533.360" stopTime="620.149">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    -- but Your Honors substantially correct. 
    But what we're saying is that our statute, I was going to say, is worst in a way than the statute of Slochower because of the comprehensive basis upon which an employee must be dismissed on any ground whatsoever, but in any event that we're mistaken about that. 
    We say that as applied in this case, this statute has the same effect as the application of the statute in Slochower because it's applied in this case. 
    The sole reason for the dismissal of these employees is the fact of their invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination when appearing before a federal agency invoking a federal privilege before such federal agency in an inquiry by that agency totally unrelated to fitness for employment by the County of Los Angeles. 
    Now, then, it is conceded and there is no dispute but what these petitioners upon their appearance before this Committee properly invoked the Fifth Amendment. 
    The Committee finally acknowledged that the Amendment was property invoked and the County here concedes that the Amendment was properly invoked by these petitioners.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Would it be legally (Inaudible)
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="624.683" stopTime="780.291">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Yes. 
    I will accept that settling. 
    I think properly it goes a little -- includes legally and goes a step further, suggest kind of a moral propriety but this case doesn't involve moral so I'll -- I'll talk about this case and not the formal one that my partner's argued. 
    Now, a brief word as to the course of these cases through the California courts and then I must go down to discussing the factual showing made by the petitioners from which we ask this Court to draw a conclusion of that, the action of the County was arbitrary. 
    Petitions for writ of mandate were filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court in behalf of the petitioners except for petitions. 
    The Los Angeles Superior Court ordered the writ of mandate to issue in behalf of one of the petitioner, the petitioner Globe. 
    The petitioner Globe under the classified system in California and by the County was a probationary employee. 
    He was summarily dismissed because of his having refused to answer questions on the grounds I've indicated by the County. 
    He was afforded no hearing of any kind. 
    And the Superior Court took the position that that violated the -- the mandate of the rule in the Slochower case to summarily discharge a person for having invoked a privilege before a federal agency and ordered the writ of mandate to issue. 
    And after the petitioner Nelson, the petitioner was a -- is a permanent employee in the classified system of the County and he was entitled to a hearing and he received it. 
    In a moment, I shall tell Your Honors about that hearing but the Superior Court ruled adversely to him. 
    And then at each losing side, petitioner Nelson on the one hand, the County of Los Angeles in the Globe case took appeals and the District Court of Appeal upheld the discharges as to both petitioners. 
    We then filed a petition for hearing in the Supreme Court of California, the highest court of the State. 
    It precedes somewhat analogous to the -- to certiorari proceedings here, the Supreme Court of California granting a review in its discretion. 
    The California Supreme Court divided narrowly the seven-judge court, four justices voted against the hearing, three justices, Chief Justice Gibson and Justice Traynor and Carter voted in favor of a hearing but it wasn't enough and so a hearing was denied and now we're here.

    Justice Jesse Carter and Justice -- Justice Traynor and the Chief Justice, Chief Justice Gibson voted for hearing. 
    Now, I think also we will not be questioned but that the sole reason given by the employer that the County of Los Angeles for the discharge was the appearance of the petitioners before the House Committee. 
    I think it can -- it will not be disputed but what the Civil Service Commission of Los Angeles County which accorded a hearing to Mr. Nelson in its findings ultimately against him made a finding that he was discharged because of his having invoked the privilege of the Fifth Amendment before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.

    The Mass case came down after Slochower and it came down after this client of yours who was discharged under this procedure. 
    And as I read the hearing that he was given before the Civil Service Commission, it was not the kind of a hearing that the Mass case with its gloss on the statute would have required. 
    And my question is whether in light of that later procedure required by the Mass case why this case shouldn't go back for a further hearing in light of the requirements of the Mass case.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin

    And the District Court of Appeal in our case refused to read the Mass case. 
    As -- as Your Honor has just -- just suggested and has refused to consider the Mass case as even requiring any kind of a hearing for -- for Globe.

    Now, we disagreed with that and expressed our disagreement to the Supreme Court of California. 
    And all we could get out of the Supreme Court of California on that issue was -- was three votes. 
    So that we do have a situation where the California courts, first, the District Court of Appeal and then the Supreme Court itself by a majority vote seems to take the view that the requirements which the Supreme Court of California suggest that are imposed in Mass have been met here. 
    And therefore, I think, were properly here and I think that this matter should be resolved having -- having exhausted all of our avenues and courts in California should now be resolved by this Court.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin

    -- before the Court.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    -- other ground for the -- their distinction in the Mass case.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="1179.311" stopTime="1494.152">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Yes. 
    And therefore, let me then come to the factual showing which was made by the petitioner Nelson at the hearing which he was accorded under California law, a showing which we say discloses complete condor to the employer. 
    Submitting full information concerning his opinions and his associations to the employer followed by the acceptance of his -- of that information by the employer, and we think a recognition by the employer that Nelson was a fit employee. 
    And when I say fit, I mean fitness including loyalty in any -- in any meaning that that word passed or has been given by this Court. 
    Now, here is what happened before the Commission and here is the evidence that he offered to the Civil Service Commission urging that his discharge should not be made final. 
    He became a temporary employee according to the record in 1949. 
    The moment he became an employee of the County, it was necessary for him to begin to comply with an elaborate investigatory and check loyalty system which the County of Los Angeles had been in effect a system which this Court passed upon in the opinion written by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Parker against the County of Los Angeles, a system which this Court upheld. 
    And he took then a -- what I would call colloquially because it's a shorthand phrase, a -- a loyalty ought but a particular kind of loyalty oath imposed and acquired by the County of Los Angeles. 
    That loyalty oath was not only an -- the conventional oath of support of the Constitution. 
    It had affidavits and it contained an affidavit to the effect that he did not advocate the destruction or govern by violence and that he had not done so, that he did not belong to any organization that so advocates, and that he had not done so, and he was required to list such organizations as he belong to the did and this -- this of course he did not do because he was not a member of any such organization. 
    In addition to that, that list and Mr. Justice Frankfurter had the entire oath attached as an appendix to the opinion of this Court in the Parker case which we referred to in our brief. 
    In addition to that, he was required to state whether or not he was a member of or had directly or indirectly supported any of the following organizations. 
    And then there -- there was a list of 142 organizations consisting of some of the organizations that had appeared on the Attorney General's list of the interstates and a large number about this that a special committee set up by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors had considered sufficiently suspect so as to make inquiry as to membership. 
    And he signed that oath and that affidavit and in -- and checked one of those 142 organizations indicating that he was -- had been a member of it, namely, the United Public -- the United Federal Workers. 
    Now, upon his employment, he was expressly questioned pertaining to his loyalty, pertaining to his affiliation, pertaining to his membership in this organization. 
    And Your Honors will find if Your Honors would look at -- for instance, page 58 of the record. 
    It isn't the most -- it -- it is a long -- it is a statement in longhand made by Dorothy E.White as you will see on page 58 if you'll turn the page around. 
    Well, it is an interview by a representative of the County of Los Angeles with the petitioner Nelson. 
    In the course of which he asked him about his membership in the United Public -- United Federal Workers and he, with complete candor, stated he had been a member for two years from 1942 to 1944. 
    And Your Honors will note particularly the less legible portions of this document on page 59 in which he concludes with the statement in -- and this is in her handwriting and her statement that Nelson had said that he was definitely democratic and uphold and against all communistic principles the inter lineation of is by the representative of the County not by the petitioner. 
    And so having -- having told the County about that affiliation and satisfied the County with respect to his loyalty, he was employed.

    Well -- he -- he first was hired in 1949. 
    And that appears in the record 44 -- at -- at 40 -- 44 and 45. 
    But, Your Honor, he then resigned for personal reasons without any relationship to loyalty and reapplied again in April 1952. 
    And when he reapplied, and I think I -- I -- it wasn't clear in my explanation. 
    When he reapplied, he then had to take another loyalty oath, the same one. 
    And he then indicated again that he would have been a member of this organization and he was at that time in 1952 that he was interviewed and questioned and he made an explanation. 
    And this statement by Ms. or Mrs. White indicates that he had made the same statement about membership in this organization in 1949 when he was first employed. 
    And so, he was employed in 1952 after having passed this test. 
    And the record shows that at or about the time, he -- he filled out a questionnaire, an elaborate questionnaire in the course of which he was asked with respect to former employments. 
    And he indicated, for instance -- pardon me. 
    For instance in the record at 57, he indicated that he had been employed in a civilian capacity by the United States Army and he indicated on -- at 57 concerning that employment. 
    And at 63, page 63 at the same time in April 1952, perhaps this is a little better than the former one.

    He had to indicate who all his employers were or whether he was dismissed or resigned and the reasons for dismissal. 
    And Your Honors will find, for instance, in the -- towards the bottom right hand column with respect to the Army that he was dismissed. 
    And then in the extreme bottom left hand, he indicates that he was dismissed from United States Army giving -- giving the date. 
    And a little bit later, in a questionnaire which he had filled out, he indicated that he had been dismissed from the United States Army because, as he put it, this appears in the record at 74, at the very bottom of the page of 74 towards the left -- left side of the page, he indicates that he was dismissed by the United States Army for alleged -- as the alleged violation of Public Law 808. 
    And later on, he was asked about that and he indicated that it was Public Law 808 of the 77th Congress. 
    And that's the statute which provides for discharge of persons in the employee of -- the agencies of the Government for security reasons and -- and provides for -- for summary dismissal. 
    So he told these things to the County, the County knew these things, and the County thereafter gave him promotions, gave him increase in compensation, gave him ratings, for instance, of -- of excellent.

    We, in order to determine your fitness, now want to ask you some questions.” 
    And had the County asked the same questions which the employees had refused to answer before the Congressional Committee and had the employees refused to answer those questions to the county.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, if they could.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="2772.306" stopTime="2890.779">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Well, I -- I think -- I think perhaps so for the following reason, may I state the reason? 
    This leads me to my -- to my next argument. 
    It seems to us that where a discharge of a county employee would demonstrate this fitness is based because of his refusal to answer for federal agency upon invoking the Fifth Amendment. 
    But certain constitutional considerations and broad policy considerations come into play which might not come into play if the refusal was merely obstinate and adamant and without the use of the privilege for these reasons. 
    In the first place, the use of the privilege before a federal agency is, of course, a right guaranteed by the Constitution. 
    This Court has said recently and for many years, it's one of the great privileges and treasures of our -- in our constitutional system. 
    It is said that no inference of guilt shall -- shall fall as a result of the use of the privilege. 
    And it is said it is available to the innocent as well as the guilty. 
    Now, then, had these petitioners merely stubbornly refused to answer a Congressional Committee? 
    You would not have come into play the -- what we think is an important and ultimately over balancing consideration in favor of these petitioners that all they did is what the Constitution of the United States told them they could do at a place where they had a full right to do it. 
    And that therefore a discharge under such circumstances, whether intended by the County or not, has the inevitable respect of diluting or negating or seriously abridging the force and effect of this great constitutional privilege. 
    And of course, I could have answered your question by saying we needn't come to that because that's not this case. 
    But I do say --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2890.779" stopTime="2907.712">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Wait a minute. 
    Is there anything in this record that indicates that they were drawing an inference of Communist activities, inference of guilt from his claim of privilege before the House American -- Un-American Activities Committee?
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="2907.712" stopTime="2909.337">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    I -- I think not.

    You think not.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="2909.798" stopTime="2931.103">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    No. 
    I think that the -- the clear absolute unequivocal position which the County was taken was that the refusal to answer questions of the Federal Committee on any ground whatsoever constituted a ground for -- not constituted but made a -- it was a mandatory ground for dismissal under the statute and that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2931.103" stopTime="2943.564">

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    And we think that's the umbrella which -- which covers us. 
    And we think it's the umbrella which covers us for still -- for still another reason. 
    Because in Slochower, this Court took the view that a person subpoenaed before a committee may sometimes find himself in -- in an ambiguous position as a result of which it is appropriate that he -- that he invoked the Fifth Amendment. 
    And Mr. Justice, of course, I'm referring to the language of Mr. Justice Clark in that decision. 
    I'm referring to similar language used by Mr. Justice Harlan in the -- in the Grunewald case as well as I think in -- in Lerner versus Casey. 
    And I'm referring to somewhat similar language, and then I shall sit down by Dean Griswold in his talks on the Fifth Amendment in which he said that often a -- a witness appearing before a -- a Congressional Committee find himself under such circumstances where he may seek the Fifth Amendment as a sanctuary from --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, but you have -- one of your grounds for objection is with respect to the Fifth Amendment in that it bridges its right to be free from being a witness against himself.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="3279.123" stopTime="3279.247">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    That is --

speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="3280.097" stopTime="3331.824">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    That's one of our grounds, yes. 
    And what I'm developing now is that under these circumstances of this case, the petitioners' appearance before this Committee was an appearance which justified him in using the Fifth Amendment because at one point, the Chairman questioned whether he was properly invoking the Fifth Amendment where they hadn't waived it and at another point, remarks completely unflattering to the witness were made while photographers were present. 
    And so we think this is precisely the kind of a case where the use of a Fifth Amendment by a witness before a committee, when that committee was not investigating his fitness for employment cannot be used as the sole reason for discharging him from county employment.

    Mr. Wm. E. Lamoreaux 
    If the Court please.

    Counsel stated and I think inadvertently that he was a probationary employee. 
    He was not -- he was merely a temporary employee.

    These are temporary employees and could be let go at anytime and if they were not entitled to a hearing before the Civil Service Commission. 
    One statement with respect to the hearing which Mr. Nelson had before the Civil Service Commission, we thought we were complying with Slochower in that kind of a hearing and that the purpose of it was for Mr. Nelson if he wished to explain why he had taken the stand he did take before the House Un-American Activities Committee. 
    At the close of the Civil Service hearing, nobody had put on any testimony however it was -- had been these various exhibits which Mr. Wirin has referred to. 
    At the close of the hearing, the Chairman asked Mr. Pillsbury who is Mr. Nelson's attorney whether or not there would be any witnesses. 
    And he said at one place, “Perhaps, Mr. Nelson may wish to testify.” 
    And then at the bottom of page 5 in the record, he said -- Mr. Pillsbury says “There would be no other witnesses.” 
    And again on page 7, Mr. Pillsbury says “The employee does not carried or offered any evidence or testimony at this time. 
    He merely wishes to make a statement through counsel as to his position in regard to his discharge.”

    We say not. 
    And we say we have authority for that in the Wieman case where this Court repeated what it had been said in the Mitchell case that Congress could not pass a law which says that no Jew, Republican or Negro could be employed. 
    Now, Congress can't do that. 
    The County of Los Angeles couldn't do it nor could the County of Los Angeles have discharge a temporary employee for being a Jew, a Republican or Negro.

    Mr. Fred Okrand 
    We think there may be a difference in a case where no reason may be given and a case where it's clearer that the reason that is given is an unconstitutional reason.

    Mr. Fred Okrand 
    Right. 
    If you discharge a person in violation of the Constitution, you can't do that. 
    That's the -- as we read Wieman and that's as we read Slochower. 
    We just -- we think that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the citizen from arbitrary conduct by his government. 
    And it -- to go a little further, it protects an applicant to a job from arbitrary conduct by his government and in this case, it protects an employee from arbitrary discharge by his government.

    Let me just say this, Your Honor. 
    In context, well, Mr. Pillsbury said, the employee does not care to offer any evidence or testimony as this time. 
    What he said was and what he meant was the employee does not care to offer any more evidence at this time. 
    He had already offered evidence showing his fitness for employment.
