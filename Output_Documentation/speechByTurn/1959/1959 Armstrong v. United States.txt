Armstrong v. United States

    -- continue.

    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    It has been suggested -- looking at the relationship between the title that was taken by the United States and the right reserved in other circumstances to have a paramount lien of security for progress payments, it's been suggested that the right to the paramount lien is somehow merged and lost, where the right to take title under Section 11 (d) has been exercised. 
    Now, I think it's basic equity law that while normally, equity will merge the junior and senior estates, it will not permit that merger where there's an intervening threat as there clearly is here. 
    In that case, the estates will remain separate in the joint holder of both for the protection of the joint holder of both. 
    So that even if somehow, less than good title was taken under Section 11, the United States would still in the circumstances of this case, be possessed of a perfectly good, outstanding paramount lien, paramount, that is to the right to liens asserted by these petitioners. 
    In other words, if we looked only to that aspect of the case, the paramount lien aspect, we would now have the Ansonia case, as the Court will recall involved three ships. 
    The Benyuard, as to which title was taken, that one is not really involved here. 
    The Mohawk and the Galveston, as to which the Government asserted liens in a state court proceeding in Virginia as against other lienholders. 
    This Court held and properly, that the liens in that case asserted by the Government were purely the creatures of contract. 
    An opinion had actually been rendered by the Attorney General prior to the time that case arose, that he was afraid that the liens in navies were using -- were in recognition of in deference to state-created and enforceable liens. 
    And this Court held that in that state receivership proceeding, that the Government's liens to secure payments on those two vessels were junior to the Virginia-created and enforceable liens. 
    However, directly after that decision, Congress passed the Act of 1911 which is set forth in our brief at page 2. 
    So that thereafter, the lien enforced to secure progress payments where that was used instead of pro tanto passage of title, would be paramount to any state-created and enforceable liens.

    I -- I'm still not absolutely clear on what your contention is. 
    I'm sure it's my fault. 
    But I'd like to give you an illustration to see if I can make it clear, my question here. 
    Suppose the Government had paid $100,000 to Rice, the value of what had been constructed up to that time was worth $150,000 and this -- these Maine people would supply the labor and material had a $50,000-claim. 
    Is it your contention that when you -- when you have that title transferred, their lien is lost so far as the ship is concerned? 
    I'm not talking about the bank here. 
    I'm talking about the ship.

    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    Well, there's no evidence at all, except that we and the contractor signed an accord that we had paid 80% -- an estimated 80% completion of the contract. 
    Among other things, we've paid for the materials, I presume, that were involved in this case.It went into what we took.

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    That's right.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="273.214" stopTime="278.597">

    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    No, it would become unenforceable.

    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    With this -- with this property -- with other properties, no. 
    Real estate, for example, no, and that might be passed on to a subsequent purchaser and the lien would be fully enforceable again. 
    That's the Alabama case.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="298.573" stopTime="299.919">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The lien would be fully enforceable.

    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    And that's -- and we -- we link that to another connection -- contention which distinguishes the Thibodo case which petitioners find comforting. 
    Here, there's an outstanding right against Rice. 
    Of course, Rice is here a bankrupt, that's true.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="353.507" stopTime="354.542">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, he is bankrupted.

    Yes.

    -- to assume that it's no good.
speaker="samuel_d_slade" startTime="361.044" stopTime="424.312">
    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    But it does -- it does give you a picture of the nature of the lien that we're talking about. 
    What kind of property, if any, this is. 
    In the Thibodo case, and this will point out the difference as we see it. 
    You have one of these western improvement district schemes. 
    Bonds are sold. 
    Under California law, those bonds become a present, recorded, perfect right. 
    As it were, the bond holders become partial owners of the property. 
    Their bonds are to be paid interest and principal out of assessments. 
    The only right is to call in the City Treasurer to foreclose or to do that, themselves. 
    Now, the United States comes along, and in an eminent domain proceeding, takes that property. 
    It only gives notice by publication. 
    It does not serve these people whose rights are recorded. 
    And it contends that the real issue in the Thibodo case was one of notice. 
    The Court of Appeals holds that, where that situation exists, there's no other right in these bond holders, except a right to be treated as partial owners of this land.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="424.312" stopTime="434.877">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But here you have -- I don't quite get it yet. 
    Why do you claim that the Government -- why is it right or correct as authorized by any statute?
speaker="samuel_d_slade" startTime="434.877" stopTime="435.009">
    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    We --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="435.009" stopTime="440.430">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The Government that's -- destroy a lien which is a valid lien, I understand you to say.
speaker="samuel_d_slade" startTime="440.430" stopTime="445.330">
    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    No, I -- I never -- I said they had only a right to get a lien. 
    It's not an enforceable lien in this case.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="445.330" stopTime="454.664">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So, it's not enforceable, you say, because it's on property that the Government has hired somebody to construct but which it has not yet taken over.
speaker="samuel_d_slade" startTime="454.664" stopTime="463.184">
    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    No. 
    I said it was not enforceable because at no time prior to the passage of title had they ever take the steps under Maine law to have an attachment issued. 
    Or --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="463.184" stopTime="466.080">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But then, you are saying that they've lost their lien under Maine law?
speaker="samuel_d_slade" startTime="466.080" stopTime="468.193">
    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    But it's narrowly, yes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="468.193" stopTime="469.730">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I can understand that.
speaker="samuel_d_slade" startTime="469.730" stopTime="489.030">
    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    Why? 
    Because under Maine law, the statute says you will have a lien which shall be enforced by an attachment made up to such and such a point of time. 
    That attachment must be returned 14 days before the return term which it sued in a sum suit against Rice as to be heard.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="489.030" stopTime="489.802">

    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    That was not done. 
    Everybody interested was to have notice. 
    Then there'd be a case in a sum to the judgment, one way or the other, and then --

    No.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="502.164" stopTime="511.317">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker

    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    Anyone could have taken that property at that time, (Inaudible) and Joe Smith, it doesn't make any difference. 
    Once those boats go beyond the reach of Maine process, people in the position of these petitioners can't take the further steps under the Maine law. 
    This is not anything peculiar to the United States and it doesn't give rise to a suit under the Fifth Amendment.

    Now, then after Congress asked (Inaudible) filed in the suit.
speaker="samuel_d_slade" startTime="562.331" stopTime="563.500">
    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    The Act of 1911.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="563.500" stopTime="572.497">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Which gives the Government (Inaudible) but doesn't that still mean that the state liens are valid, but junior?
speaker="samuel_d_slade" startTime="572.497" stopTime="628.163">
    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    No. 
    Only -- only in the circumstance where the proceeding arises for the measurement of relative lien rights. 
    For example, had these boats hardly been completed at all, had it not been worthwhile to take and move them to the North, like in Philadelphia, the Government might very well, under this contract, have decided to let this thing go into a state court, have this proceeding and come in and assert its liens as against the other liens only to the extent of the payments then made. 
    It may not have wanted the vessels and, as I've pointed out, I think, in many kinds of contracts, they would not have wanted to use replacement contractors and complete the work. 
    In that case, they would come into the state proceeding and use the paramount lien, an entirely or alternate form of protection, entirely separate from the decision here to pass the title because, here, they needed the boats completed.

speaker="samuel_d_slade" startTime="775.717" stopTime="881.537">
    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    I -- I think -- I think that Judge Jones, while he may have been a little inartistic, is trying to say a very practical and real thing. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggested before and I might, all the way, I have been trying to say it. 
    When you have a contract entered into like the standard form supply contract, known to all, to all -- suppliers are pretty canny men. 
    These contracts are used in thousands of situations. 
    I think Judge Jones is merely trying to say, given the -- the history crusted relationship between materialmen supplies with government contracts in the Government, they know that whatever happens between the Government and its contractor, under these standard provisions offering various options for various situations is a -- is a paramount thing. 
    And I think Jones is trying to say that, for example, had contract title passed on completion and had it been developed that Rice had never paid any of its supplies and materialmen. 
    He kept them at arm's length. 
    He got extensions of credit. 
    He gets a full $175,000 for the boats and the United States takes them. 
    Certainly, in those circumstances, the materialmen supplies couldn't say to the Government, “you have to pay twice. 
    You've paid for everything that's gone in these boats. 
    This is a contract price. 
    Now, you have to pay us again because Rice didn't pay us.” 
    And, that's about what this case is I believe. 
    We're being asked really to pay, first, $141,000 to Rice which is the agreed and estimated percentage of completion. 
    Actually, it's optimistic. 
    We had to pay a lot more than that to get the boats finished and now, we're being asked to pay these or any other people who dealt with Rice, subsequent to the time we executed the contract and whom Rice didn't pay.

    Well, as I understand it. 
    I'm no expert on the practice but as I understand the logic of contracts, there are always one of two things done. 
    I think no payment bond is required because I think the shipyards, aircraft companies have to put up a fund to the Government's satisfaction to protect these people. 
    I think that in most routine cases, there is a payment bond. 
    That's the purpose of the Miller Act.

    Mr. Samuel D. Slade 
    In 1941, the provisions of the Miller Act, the secretaries of -- of the defense departments were authorized to waive the provisions of the Miller Act in -- to enable the smaller people to get into government procurement. 
    Sureties, inability to get a surety bond, the fact that surety would intervene and pick up the money when it came, prevent refinancing. 
    These things were keeping the smaller people out of this kind of procurement that we have here. 
    And it was felt that waiving the bond might give them the ability to get into government procurement work and begin to build up. 
    And the Act was passed April 1941. 
    But as I suggest, and for legislative history makes it plain that there was no intention of Congress, no circumstances to substitute the answerability of the United States for the traditional Miller Act situation.

    It certainly was. 
    It enabled them to get into procurement, to use incoming payments for refinancing. 
    It took the-- sometimes, the surety wouldn't let them get a new contract while they completed the one in which his bond was outstanding. 
    There are all sorts of things that were inhibiting the smaller man and their supplies in labors from getting into the mainstream of government procurement.

    The point I want to make is that the Government retained 3% of the money which the contractor had earned based upon a percentage of completion. 
    And, this bond, of course, would have been available for the payment of the liens of these people, although, admittedly, in this case, that 3% was not enough to pay the $23,000 which are here an issue.

    Not what it's gained but what it might lose.

    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    Well, I think that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1500.261" stopTime="1500.390">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Are you claiming that by this --
speaker="burton_r_thorman" startTime="1500.390" stopTime="1501.776">
    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    -- our area of the gain is --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1501.776" stopTime="1517.427">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- are you claiming that by this form of lawsuit, although you had a junior lien to the Government, by reason of the fact that the Government had this -- transferred to itself, you can recover the full value of your junior lien? 
    Is that your contention?
speaker="burton_r_thorman" startTime="1517.427" stopTime="1520.675">
    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    That is -- that is correct under just compensation because we have a right --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1520.675" stopTime="1525.191">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How can it be just compensation if it wasn't just, if you were not entitled to it?
speaker="burton_r_thorman" startTime="1525.191" stopTime="1537.222">
    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    Well, we had a right to have the property subjected to the liens which were enforced against the property. 
    Admittedly, the Government has a lien and we have a lien.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1537.222" stopTime="1541.856">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You're not attacking its lien. 
    Are you attacking its superiority to yours?
speaker="burton_r_thorman" startTime="1541.856" stopTime="1543.383">
    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    No. 
    We -- we concede that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1543.383" stopTime="1554.952">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But you do claim that by the reason of the Government taking it over, if you could yet to sue the Government for just compensation, that you can put yours first and get every dime of yours even though if the Government loses?
speaker="burton_r_thorman" startTime="1554.952" stopTime="1559.551">
    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    No, because the Government -- the Government did nothing to enforce its lien. 
    If the Government had taken its part -- taken its lien --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1559.551" stopTime="1570.088">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But it still hasn't done it. 
    The -- the justice of the claim is still there, isn't it? 
    It's between you two, assuming that you're right in your claim that you ought to get what you actually lost.
speaker="burton_r_thorman" startTime="1570.088" stopTime="1614.972">
    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    Well, we -- the contractor put $198,000 into the contract and this was submitted to the Government despite some obscurity on the issue. 
    This was -- this figure was submitted to the Government and appears at page 58 of the record. 
    It was part of the submission to the -- part of the submission to the Government in connection with the progress payment, the last progress payment that was requested from the Government. 
    Now, I think that the record makes it clear that they did -- they did pay that much amount of money. 
    That Rice spent $198,000. 
    This was 40 or -- $57,000 more than the Government had paid and the reason this came about --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, now, you --
speaker="burton_r_thorman" startTime="1615.221" stopTime="1615.459">
    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    -- was --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1615.459" stopTime="1654.293">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- now, you -- I can understand that you're claiming that if the Government didn't have a lien for 100 or was getting more than it should get for its lien, that you're entitled to recover. 
    I can understand that. 
    But I understood you to tell me a while ago, maybe I was wrong, that even if the Government lien is superior to yours and they've taken it over and the Government's lien is for every cent of the value of that property that nevertheless, by the reason of the fact that they've taken it over, you can sue them for just compensation and get the full value of your subordinate lien.
speaker="burton_r_thorman" startTime="1654.293" stopTime="1679.384">
    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    I -- I think we could because the Government has -- has taken and chosen this method. 
    It must be remembered, the Government had two options. 
    They could foreclose on this lien. 
    They had -- they had the choice of -- of what they're going to do, or they could take their title, acquired title subject to this Section 11 (d) of the contract. 
    They chose 11 (d). 
    Now, why they chose it? 
    We don't know. 
    We can only speculate.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1679.384" stopTime="1697.371">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, are you claiming that since they chose the wrong method of procedure, you can take something that had no value at all in the beginning because they had a lien for more than its worth and you can take that nothing and make it recover from the Government the full value of your -- the full non-value of your lien?
speaker="burton_r_thorman" startTime="1697.371" stopTime="1734.891">
    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    Well, I think we had a right to go through a foreclosure proceeding which would then have subjected this whole subject of value to the light of day. 
    Now, I'm aware of the fact that the Government, I don't know whether counsel has mentioned in his argument, claims to have spent considerably more money to complete the contract. 
    But this all arose much later and we're based -- we're stuck with the Government's alleged cost because Rice was in bankruptcy and never contested this amount. 
    But I think that we had a right to have this subjected to the light of day to the foreclosure proceedings.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1734.891" stopTime="1750.858">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why couldn't you get it subjected to the light of day if you are right in saying your lien has been destroyed and the property is -- the Government has taken it? 
    Wouldn't it be exposed to the light of day if the Court of Claims should try out that issue and see whether or not you did have any lien that was worth anything and was taken?
speaker="burton_r_thorman" startTime="1750.858" stopTime="1755.306">
    Mr. Burton R. Thorman 
    Yes, I -- I would agree.
