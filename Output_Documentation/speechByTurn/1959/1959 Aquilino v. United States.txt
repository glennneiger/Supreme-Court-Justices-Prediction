    Mr. Charles S. Friedman 
    -- may it please the Court. 
    For some three days, this Court which have listened to a contest between giants here, that it listened to the United States Government has one contest with five different States over property that amounts -- will eventually amount to billions of dollars. 
    We're engaged in a contest here between that -- one of those giants to wit, the United States and two small subcontractors from the State of New York. 
    The amount of money involved is small. 
    It's only $2200. 
    The Government tax reached that far. 
    It has been awarded to them and they claimed of it's -- and it's been awarded to them upon the basis that it was property of the taxpayer under 3670 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    We claim that the property belongs to these subcontractors under the law of the State of New York. 
    Some brief reference of the facts is essential. 
    In 19 -- in December 1951, and again in March of 1952, the Government filed two assessment liens for small amounts with the collector of Internal Revenue in Albany, New York. 
    That lien may be -- what has been very amply described as the secret pernicious lien of the United States Government to wit, it's one of those liens that nobody, except the United States Government and the collector knows about it.

speaker="charles_s_friedman" startTime="133.815" stopTime="262.664">
    Mr. Charles S. Friedman 
    That may be so, Your Honor. 
    Sometime thereafter, totally unaware of this lien and totally unconnected with the tax -- delinquent taxpayer, a Mrs. Bottone bought some rail property in Westchester County. 
    She bought this property in July of 1942. 
    Some seven months after the Government filed its first lien. 
    She intended to conduct a business thereon and have some remodeling work and intended to have some remodeling work done. 
    She employed the delinquent taxpayer here, Fleetwood Paving Company, to do that work. 
    Prior to that, Fleetwood Paving have no real business relationship with her, nor with the subcontractors, who I represent the petitioners herein. 
    Fleetwood Paving Corporation thereupon, entered into contracts with the two petitioners herein as subcontractors, to wit, Aquilino and Colonial Sand Company. 
    Both these subcontractors very promptly and quickly performed their subcontracts and completed their work. 
    They remain unpaid to this date. 
    Now, I mentioned these dates despite the fact that in our opinion, these dates are unimportant, unimportant for this reason. 
    The question is whether or not this is property of this -- of the delinquent taxpayer, the general contractor. 
    We say that that isn't. 
    And therefore, the time of filing by anybody is unimportant. 
    Now, we say it isn't because whether or not this is property of the taxpayer and therefore, reachable by the Government's lien, is a matter purely of state law. 
    And this Court has so set in the decision last June, United States versus Bess 357 U.S. 51.

    The point is that the Government agrees as they've stated in their brief on pages 13 and 7. 
    Petitioner recognized as indeed they must and then they cite U.S. versus Bess that whether Fleetwood had any property interest in the sum due from Bottone is a question of law. 
    And on page 7, they set forth the same recognition of that being the question. 
    Now, it's regrettable that this Bess case wasn't decided before the Aquilino case, on which we are here now.

    No. 
    I don't agree with that, Your Honor. 
    I think that the New York Court of Appeals did not decide that and that's why the issue is here.We say that the Court of Appeal avoided a determination as to whether or not, this was property of the -- of the delinquent taxpayer, the general contractor herein. 
    And we say -- and we think it's crystal clear that they avoided it for this reason. 
    And I'd like to read you a part of their decision. 
    It's in the record on page 68, “It is by now exceedingly well settled that no state-created rule may defeat the paramount right of the United States to levy and collect taxes, uniformly throughout the land.” 
    With which we agree. 
    Then it goes on to say, “That being so, if powers of the provisions on this State's Lien Law to which the responded points that funds received by a contractor from the owner for the improvement of real property shall be deemed “trust funds” for the payment of the subcontractors, and then here's the key line, “May not be construed to affect the rights of the Government or the priority of its tax lien.” 
    Now, I don't think with that phraseology, there can be any question that they were deferring to the federal -- to federal decisions, which they cite as -- as precluding them from determining under the law of the State of New York, whether or not this was property of the general tax of the --

    Now, we think that its -- that makes it very clear that they did not pass on the question as to whether or not, this was property of the general -- of the general contractor under New York State law.

    Which is then?
speaker="charles_s_friedman" startTime="716.346" stopTime="818.620">
    Mr. Charles S. Friedman 
    This is the reference that the Government makes to the fact that -- they -- they claim that the Government's lien attached to the contractual obligation of the owner to the general contractor and not for the real property. 
    And I think that that's immaterial, but in order to -- let's see how the Government gets away from that -- supports that question. 
    They say -- they say that two decisions of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York to wit, a so-called Raymond case, 288 N.Y. 452 and a Sulphur case, 290 N.Y. 903 held that the contractual obligation of an owner to a general contractor was -- was property of the general contractor was that and could therefore, be reached by judgment creditors or Federal Government lien or whatnot. 
    The fact remains that those decisions may have, despite the fact that I disagree with it, they may have been good law because -- but they were based and founded on a -- upon a construction of the law prior to the 1942 Amendment, which amendment -- which amendment included the contractual obligation as part of the trust. 
    So that -- I -- I'm quite surprised that those two cases have been cited by the Government here, because they have attention withdrawn to them. 
    They were criticized and they were explained in a dissenting opinion in the Gramatan-Koslow case just the year, 1957. 
    And it's very obvious that they don't apply at all.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="818.620" stopTime="834.741">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, we have -- we have your (Inaudible) state law, don't we? 
    That they -- they construe it this way because under the compulsion and reading the federal statute that it would be unconstitutional to construe it any the other way.
speaker="charles_s_friedman" startTime="834.741" stopTime="1080.328">
    Mr. Charles S. Friedman 
    No, I -- I don't see it that way, Your Honor. 
    I don't think that the Court of Appeals of New York appreciated that they had the right to dispose of this on a basis of what the state law was. 
    They were under the impression that they were precluded from determining that. 
    And the -- the strange part of it is that another case in which this Court has just granted cert in a -- the so-called Coblentz case. 
    They decided on the basis of this law of the State of New York that an attorney's lien under the judiciary law of the State of New York did constitute property of Coblentz, the attorney and wasn't -- and was superior to the lien of the Government. 
    So, now, as to whether or not this is property of the -- whose property this is against which the Government has filed the lien or claim the lien? 
    Let's look to the law of the State of New York, both the legislative and judicial history of that law. 
    I happen to have been practicing prior to -- in New York prior to the time that this law was passed in 1929. 
    Prior to that time, there was nothing to stop a general contractor from performing a contract with an owner, collecting all the money that was due and then absconding, leaving the subcontractors and the materialmen high and dry. 
    We finally got pretty fed up with that situation and amend the Lien Law so as to provide that a contractor who collected money from an owner or an owner who collected money from a mortgagee -- from a mortgagee and who did not use the moneys for the purpose of paying subcontractors and materialmen, was guilty of a diversion and guilty of a crime. 
    I'll put a stop to a great deal of it, but then as usual, they found ways and means of avoiding that and so we have continuously amended the law right down to date, so that we believe that under the law of the State of New York, there was a complete valid trust for the benefit of subcontractors, materialmen and the few others mentioned of the statute. 
    Now, with respect to the elements of this trust, first of all, it identifies the trust assets, and I'm reading from the statute now. 
    It says that the funds received by a contractor from an owner, from an owner for the improvement of real property. 
    So we have no question as to the identification of the corpus of the trust. 
    Then it designates a place of beneficiaries and it specifically says subcontractors, laborers, materialmen and it list others. 
    Then it designates the trustee and it says, “That the funds constituting this trust shall -- are hereby declared to be trust funds in the hands of such contractor.” 
    So we now have a trustee. 
    Other sections of the statute which we inadvertently did not have pointed, specifically requires them to keep books and records and as a matter of fact, the statute very elaborately says why he shall keep in the books and records and how he shall keep that. 
    It requires him to furnish an accounting to anyone of the beneficiaries of this trust anytime upon 10 days notice. 
    Now, it has -- it -- it also authorizes any beneficiary to examine the books and records, to examine checkbooks, any of the ledger accounts, specifically set forth in the statute. 
    So that we have every single essential element of a vital trust in this situation.

    Mr. Charles S. Friedman 
    Well, the fact of the matter is that whether it is personal property or not, it's still part of the corpus of this trust for the benefit -- benefit of these beneficiaries and it's therefore, not reachable by the Government, if it isn't the taxpayer's property, if it isn't the delinquent taxpayer's property, whether it's personal property, whether real property, whether it's a hybrid.

    No. 
    But then we come to the 1942 Amendment, Your Honor. 
    And that 1942 Amendment specifically says that for the purposes of any action, “The trust fund shall include the right of action upon an obligation for moneys due or to become due to a contractor, as well as money actually received by him.” 
    So it would seem to me that the so-called contractual obligation referred to in -- in what you have just read, is part and partial of the trust for the benefit of these beneficiaries.

    Mr. Charles S. Friedman 
    That's right. 
    Now -- now, there is one single decision in the State of New York in which this trust has been denied full force and effect as a good and valid trust. 
    There was also -- I also direct your attention to the -- to some of the federal cases involved here, particularly, those in bankruptcy, one case to which Boiler versus Godfrey 121 F. -- F.2d 415 in which this Court 314 U.S. denied cert. 
    The question arose there as to where or not the property of a -- whether or not funds receivable by a bankrupt in connection with work performed under this same Lien Law, whether or not they were reachable by the trustee in bankruptcy for the benefit of general creditors and the Court held that they were not. 
    They were not reachable under -- under the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee had no title to them they had no right to them. 
    So that we have a good and valid trustee here and we have the Court of Appeals not determining what the subcontractors' rights were hereunder. 
    Thus, the legislature of the -- of the State of New York by statute and the judiciary of the State of New York have held by their decisions that -- and are not accepting Aquilino that this is a good and valid trust. 
    And that the only persons that have any right title or interest are the beneficiaries set forth in the statute. 
    Now, this brings us to one unusual situation. 
    The Government, in its brief, accedes to the fact that private individuals can avoid the consequences of this Act. 
    On page 22 in their brief, in commenting upon the decision of (Inaudible) in the Second Circuit which this Court cited with approval in U.S.-Bess, they said that for assuming the correctness of (Inaudible) it is not unusual that parties by contract may change their respective rights. 
    Now, would be anomalous to say the least, that parties to a contract could -- could prevent the United States Government from collecting taxes against to delinquent taxpayer by putting the proper clause in a contract, but that the State of New York with its sovereign power and through his judiciary, cannot protect the subcontractor from the Government coming in and taking its moneys as they have here. 
    I say that this is not property of the delinquent taxpayer. 
    It's solely the property of the subcontractors here not reachable by the Federal Government's lien under 3670 and that there should be either a reversal or that the case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for further consideration on the basis of New York state law.

   Argument of Howard A. Heffron
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1652.182" stopTime="1655.151">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Heffron.
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="1655.151" stopTime="1924.327">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    We have here two creditors of a general contractor. 
    The creditors are competing for something. 
    They're competing for the proceeds of the construction contract. 
    One creditor, the United States, asserts that its tax lien which here arose prior to the proceeds of the construction contract becoming due, gives it prior rights to this fund. 
    The other group of creditors, subcontractors, asserts that the trust fund provisions of New York State law give them a prior right. 
    Now, the chronology, we submit, is important. 
    The tax lien arose first. 
    It was followed by the taxpayer entering into a contract to do some construction work. 
    He proceeded to complete that contract to the satisfaction of the owner. 
    Shows in action arose at that time. 
    This was property of the taxpayer, and it was this shows an action to which the tax lien attached. 
    A New York law provides that the funds which a contractor has due to him on a construction contract shall, to the extent that any subcontractors are unpaid at that time, be held in trust for their benefit. 
    And that is where the basis for the competing claims of the subcontractors derived from. 
    Now, what is it that we're dealing with? 
    The New York State statute provides that the subcontractors have this trust right only to the extent that there is any debt owing from the owner of the property to the general contractor taxpayer. 
    The effect of the decision below in which the owner turned into court the funds which was still owing to the contractor, was to discharge the owner from any further liability to the contractor. 
    The basis for the subcontractors' claims here is that there was money due and owing to the contractor which is held in trust. 
    This is the basis, the foundations with the trust under New York State law. 
    The trust does not arise unless moneys are owing to the contractor. 
    The complaint here, which was filed by each of these subcontractors in the lower court, alleges that as a necessary allegation of their cause of action. 
    Moneys were due to the contractor. 
    The contractor earned these moneys. 
    There is no defense to the contractors claim by the owner. 
    Therefore, under New York law, we have prior rights. 
    Now, we submit that in that context while the subcontractors here may choose to use a verbal variant of the contentions which have presented -- have been presented to this Court in previous cases that this is precisely the same kind of issue which this Court has had before, many times in the past. 
    In essence, the subcontractors are arguing here that because under the provisions of New York law, their rights are impregnable to those of any other creditors of the taxpayer. 
    For that reason, they must also come prior to the reach of the federal tax lien. 
    Now, that is precisely the kind of argument which this Court has rejected in the past. 
    It rejected it through in situations where the security which the subcontractor was asserting with a lien on real estate. 
    Here, the security which the subcontractor asserts is, in essence, a lien on a chose in action. 
    Under New York law, he has the right to reach this chose in action and apply it in satisfaction of his claim. 
    The Government submits that it makes no difference whether the property of the taxpayer be real estate or whether it be a chose in action. 
    The principle which this Court has defined in the past are equally applicable here. 
    Now, this Court has reached the issue of the rights of mechanic's liens as against those of the United States in many situations. 
    It has reached that, for example, in the White Bear case, where the mechanic's lien preceded was antecedent to the federal tax lien and where everything had been done under state law, which would render the mechanics' rights impregnable to attack. 
    Nevertheless, this Court held that the federal tax lien was superior. 
    It had reached --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Heffron, may I ask you this.

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    -- question, sir. 
    That New York cannot adopt a statute which, in effect, is a priority statute and which gives a creditor of the taxpayer a preferred position. 
    And then under the guise of saying, “Well, since no other creditor under New York law can reach this property, the taxpayer has no property. 
    Therefore, the Government can't reach it.” 
    We submit to characterize it in term, what is, in essence, a preference statute in terms of property doesn't -- doesn't solve the question. 
    The realities of the situation would govern here and in terms of the rights and liabilities of the parties, we have here a situation where the subcontractors are seeking to reach a debt owed to the taxpayer. 
    Now, we would say that if New York law characterized the rights of the subcontractors as -- as so concrete and fixed that the taxpayer had no property interest, that that would not bind this Court because, in essence, the New York court would be saying that the security device which we've created to benefit the subcontractors is sufficient to defeat the federal tax lien.

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    The State -- we -- we set in our brief and we intended to say, Mr. Chief Justice, that the State has the right to determine the rights and liabilities of the party. 
    But whether or not to characterize the resulting conglomeration of rights and liabilities as property or not is the federal question which is before this Court. 
    If we examine the trust fund provisions of New York law, we -- we find that what we have here is an animal which is very far from being related to a conventional trust. 
    The trust fund provisions of New York law provide, for example, that the trust shall arise --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2731.225" stopTime="2754.534">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What difference would that make? 
    That's not a conventional trust. 
    I thought you're arguing for is that they can't do this under the name of the lien, although a lien has a very high stakes in the law, mechanic, laborers and so forth. 
    Since they can't do it in the lien rather preference speaks now by the federal statute, if they do it on the name of the trust.
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="2754.534" stopTime="2780.498">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    No. 
    I did not mean to detract from the force of that argument, sir. 
    I was really addressing myself now to an additional position which we have here and that is that even under New York law, the rights of the subcontractors are not fixed within the requirements of the decisions of this Court, so that this is an additional reason why they could not supersede the federal tax lien here. 
    Now, I --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2780.498" stopTime="2786.378">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Your position doesn't involve attributing anything sinister and devious in New York, doesn't it?
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="2786.378" stopTime="2851.586">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    No, it does not. 
    I -- that was inappropriate use of language. 
    I simply meant to suggest that -- that if an argument could prevail here to the effect that a security interest under state law had become so perfected and so fixed that the taxpayer no longer had any property to which the federal lien could reach, whether on the decisions of this Court could be undone in precisely the same situations where this Court has upheld the reach of the federal tax lien. 
    That is essentially what the argument of the petitioners comes down to. 
    This is a security provision of New York law. 
    Some of the courts have said the subcontractors in New York have a double security. 
    They have the lien on the real estate of the owner and they have the trust right to the debt owing to the contractor. 
    But in essence, these are both security methods by which the subcontractors can be assured of payment. 
    And what is he assured of payment from? 
    He is assured of payment from the chose in action which he holds against the owner. 
    The owner is discharged here.

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Well, of course, that is an equitable consideration which is involved. 
    I'd like to point out that we're here dealing with withholding and social security taxes which were withheld from the wages of employees of the taxpayer. 
    And we know in the enforcement of the revenue laws, the great delinquency is over $200 million which now exist in withholding and social security taxes and we know that the pattern in the construction industry is for contractors to take this withheld taxes, which themselves are trust funds under federal law and use them to operate there business. 
    Now, we can't trace these taxes into the hands of any particular subcontractors, but I don't think we're -- we're dealing with a situation were the Federal Government doesn't have some right to pursue tax dollars which the contractor withheld from his employees and to take them.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Heffron, I understand that the Government made this assessment against the taxpayer -- against the contractor before he entered into this contract with Mrs. Bottone. 
    But that -- that fact was not known to anyone, but the Government. 
    And there was no way that materialmen or laborers could -- could determine whether that assessment had been made and that thereafter, this contractor entered into the contract for this improvement and these materialmen and laborers, put there materials and their labor into this job. 
    Now, if the federal assessment against this taxpayer was more than he had coming from the -- from the owner of the property or the judge. 
    Do you say is a practical matter that the State could not protect those workmen and those materialmen to such an extent that they could get that from that transaction, the value of the property and the value of the labor that they put into it that they'd be entirely wiped out?

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    The -- the first case in which the secret lien which we're allegedly dealing with here arose with the Snyder case in 149 U.S., where a bona fide purchaser of the property without notice, was held to have rights inferior to the federal tax lien which was not recorded and which under state law as an unrecorded lien could have no effect. 
    Nevertheless, this Court held that the federal tax lien was superior. 
    Now, this prompted Congress to grant relief and Congress has provided that federal tax liens must be -- must be filed, if they are to be valid against four categories of claimants, judgment creditors, purchasers, mortgagees and pledgees. 
    And this Court has noted in the prior decisions that mechanic's lienors are not within the class of persons protected by the filing requirements of federal law.

speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="3188.977" stopTime="3226.644">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    In the other cases which this Court has passed on. 
    There was much language in the lower state court opinions which said, "Under our law, the mechanic's lien has divested the taxpayer of his interest. 
    Therefore, the federal tax lien can't attach." So, this argument has worked in the record of these cases, and it could've been pulled out at any time as the grounds for invalidating the federal tax lien. 
    It never was. 
    It lurked in the record in the Kings County case in the Second Circuit. 
    And the court there went on to say that although your -- the trust fund provisions of New York law apply first in time here, the trust had arisen first.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3226.644" stopTime="3237.198">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But is that (Inaudible) where we have (Inaudible) tax lien on the state law, the property of the taxpayer?
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="3237.198" stopTime="3322.075">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Well, I think those were the first cases in the lien field which have held that property must be taken to refer to interest created and defined by provisions of state law. 
    Now, of course, the -- the thrust of petitioner's argument here is to place him in a position, theoretically, which is even more favorable than the position which Congress has placed judgment creditors, mortgagees, pledgees and purchasers. 
    Because if his argument should be accepted at anytime that the trust fund may arise even subsequent to the filing of the tax lien, a time when all the cases have assumed that at anytime the Government's rights were set, it was when the tax lien was recorded and filed. 
    If this argument is accepted, even those provisions will not support the reach of the tax lien, because the argument will be -- well, under federal -- under state law, you taxpayer have no property because your -- your creditor who is subsequent to the tax assessment and who is subsequent to the recording of the tax lien, has taken the property. 
    Now, we -- we submit that that result is foreclosed by the provisions of the statute itself, which indicate those classes of persons who are protected from unfiled federal tax lien.

    Well, I'd like to point out, Mr. Justice Black, that the criticism which has been levied against the federal tax lien as usually been -- been brought to bear in a situation where the lien under state law comes first. 
    And then the persons who've developed the expectancy are divested by a -- by a subsequently accruing lien. 
    We have here a case where the federal lien is antecedent to all the interests, which have been created under state law. 
    So that even the -- those --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3414.309" stopTime="3442.488">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If the state law preceded the lien, then the interest is not antecedent. 
    And the lien is not antecedent as the practical proposition. 
    If the State has fabulous statute providing that all these moneys should go to the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company that -- or some other trust company, would you then say it was just like a lien? 
    Actually, there is a difference between creating a lien and creating a trust.

    No, they don't necessarily have to equal the other.
