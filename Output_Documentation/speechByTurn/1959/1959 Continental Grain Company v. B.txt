    Mr. George B. Matthews 
    May it please the Court. 
    With reference to a question which Mr. Justice Stewart asked regarding the consent waiver in this case, there is no consent in so many words, however, we submit that whereas in this case following the falling of the libel not only was a personal appearance entered, but a claim was filed for the vessel and the letter of undertaking was given that the motion is tantamount to a consent since it will carry with it the appearances. 
    Secondly, I might further mention that in the General Electric case decided by Mr. Justice Whittaker, he remarked that in his opinion, there was little question with that, a motion constituted a waiver of venue -- a motion to transfer constitute a consent to transfer our waiver.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Do you think it could be argued that the substitution of a bond or of an undertaking such as is in this case converts an in rem action to an in personam action?
speaker="george_b_matthews" startTime="82.864" stopTime="142.424">
    Mr. George B. Matthews 
    No, sir. 
    I don't think that could be argued. 
    However, I don't know what the difference is or maybe it's a distinction without a difference except in one case that occurs to me. 
    For example, in the Public Vessels Act, there is no provision for in rem seizure of public vessels. 
    However, a libelant may elect to proceed according to principles in rem. 
    As I say, what that amounts to with one exception, frankly, I don't know. 
    The exception being the case of compulsory pilotage where the courts upheld that an owner is not liable in personam for the negligence of a state required or compulsory pilotage but that a vessel is. 
    Now, that is the only distinction that occurs to me between an in rem and an in personam action or liability, if you want.

speaker="george_b_matthews" startTime="238.052" stopTime="317.132">
    Mr. George B. Matthews 
    No, sir. 
    There is an in personam action against Federal Barge Lines seeking a recovery against that individual respondent. 
    Joined to that is a proceeding, it's all one proceeding actually. 
    I'm maybe using words loosely. 
    But, as part of that action, there is a prayer for a recovery in rem against the Barge FBL-585. 
    Those two recoveries sought are part of one action, so that if there is a finding of fault on the respondent's part and/or on the part of the barge, there would be a decree in favor of Continental and against Federal on account of the -- or rather in response to the in personam prayer. 
    There would also be a decree against the barge and her stipulators or her surety if you want in response to the in rem part of the action. 
    However, since the lien on the Barge would have been discharged by the giving of the bond, the decree would be satisfied by the barge's stipulators or surety.

    One further the point I like to mention which I think is quite important and that is that in this case, we are not confounded with any statutory venue requirements. 
    There are none here. 
    Venue in an in personam action is wherever the respondent can be caught to -- so to put it, or whether wherever his property can be attached by a writ of foreign attachment. 
    That maybe in anyone of a number of places, for instance, a New York respondent may have property in Louisiana which we could seized, perform the basis of -- of personal jurisdiction at least to the extent of property. 
    Venue in an in personam action is basically where the vessel is or where the owner or claimant should it be a charge we will agree to appear for the vessel.

   Argument of Eberhard P. Deutsch
speaker="eberhard_p_deutsch" startTime="613.746" stopTime="715.477">
    Mr. Eberhard P. Deutsch 
    Just a -- a few more words. 
    May it please the Court. 
    Whether a question -- with regard to the question as to the nature of the proceeding and the fact that it is not in personam so far as it's postured before this Court is concerned. 
    I direct your attention to pages 16 and 17 of the transcript, so that we will understand this so-called letter of undertaking. 
    It -- it is simply a substitute for a so-called stipulation which an admiralty is a name for a shorty bond. 
    And at the bottom of the page, you will see it is the intent of this undertaking that the rights of the libel and then claimant respondent in this proceeding shall be in full, purposes shall be taken to be precisely the same as they would have been had the vessel in fact been taken into custody by the marshall under said in rem process and released for the filing of claim and release bond. 
    We, as claimant reserving in behalf of the vessel all other objections and defenses otherwise available, except those which might be predicated upon the fact that the vessel was not actually seen. 
    In other words, the cases in rem proceeding, its character has not been changed by the giving of this letter of undertaking which says, “We'll pay any judgment you get against the Barge.” 
    And the judgment or decree in admiralty is for dollars against the vessel requires her condemnation and sale to satisfy the judgment and that condemnation and sale of course does not take place if someone comes in and voluntarily pays the amount due which is the normal course especially when bonds are posted.

    And you can bring the action wherever that race happens to be at the time. 
    In the land, it can only happen to be in one place, but the principle is the same in my opinion.

    Mr. Eberhard P. Deutsch 
    I think we must, yes. 
    I think that is correct, the latter statement, yes. 
    Now, very briefly, if I may be allowed a couple of moments more. 
    This question about an in rem action and it's applying only in compulsory pilotage cases and so on, it's a very real thing. 
    A solvent owner is liable in an in rem action only insofar as the value of that vessel is concerned and no more and that is very important matter. 
    In a salvage case for instance, the owner isn't liable at all unless he has made an agreement. 
    The vessel alone is liable. 
    He may defend and try to get the salvage reduced if he has that much of an interest. 
    In the case of the bareboat charter, when the vessel is in collision, the owner is never liable. 
    He said no part in the land and so on. 
    There are a number of such cases. 
    It isn't just one thing. 
    Finally, with regard to a question which was asked yesterday by Mr. Justice Harlan that occurred to me about Judge Learned Hand having expressed himself on this subject, the case is Foster-milburn v. Knight in 181 F.2d, he did express himself as saying that the role that there can -- that there must be two forums applies under 1404 (a).

    Mr. Eberhard P. Deutsch 
    In the Torres case which is cited -- the Anthony versus Kaufman case, Judge Frank does say that. 
    The Torres case however, talks of the vessel having been available in the transferee district as well. 
    And then Judge Medina goes on and says, “Anyway, they've waived it here.” 
    Now, to that extent, it is a doctrine. 
    Thank you.
