    Number 391, George B. Parr et al., Petitioners, versus United States. 
    Mr. Fortas.

    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    The Fifth Circuit affirmed these convictions of the petitioners on the various counts of an indictment, 19 counts of which, charged violations of the federal mail fraud statute and the 20th count of which charged the violation of the conspiracy statute. 
    This Court granted certiorari on two questions, first, whether the mail fraud statute is applicable in -- to this indictment and the facts of this case. 
    And second, whether the defendants should have been granted access to the grand jury testimony of one of the witnesses at the trial, Diego Heras. 
    In addition, due to impart to developments after petitioners have filed their petition for a certiorari with this Court and after the Solicitor General had filed his brief in our position to the petition for certiorari and the manner had been submitted to this Court because of events happening thereafter, to which I shall elude. 
    In our brief, we have suggested that the Court considered whether this case is suitable for the exercise of its supervisory power and whether the case calls for the exercise by this Court of its supervisory power over the administration of the federal criminal process. 
    Now, with the Court's kind indulgence, I shall commence with a discussion of the mail fraud point, which in our submission will dispose of the case and in our submission should result in a dismissal of the indictment. 
    Before doing that, I should like very briefly to give the Court, if I may, an idea of our point with respect to the grand jury testimony question and a very brief idea of the reason why we have respectfully suggested consideration of the invocation and use in this case of this Court's supervisory power. 
    I shall then go to the mail fraud point and shall then return to the grand jury and the supervisory power points. 
    On the grand jury point, the witness, Diego Heras, was in our submission, the Government's principal witness, the Government disputes that. 
    His testimony occupied 23% of the record below about 1000 pages out of about 6000 pages. 
    The Court instructed the jury below that they might convict on the testimony -- on the unsupported testimony of an accomplice. 
    The Court instructed the jury that Diego Heras was an accomplice. 
    The Court of Appeals stated that Diego Heras' testimony contained many inconsistencies and contradictions and it's said that the jury might have considered him far from trust -- trustworthy, as we argue in our briefs, those are mild and gentle words.

    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, subsequent as I said, after the petition for certiorari and the Government's brief had been submitted to this Court, the Solicitor General filed a memorandum in this Court saying in fact, “Oops, we're very sorry. 
    There is no transcript of Diego Heras' testimony before the grand jury. 
    His testimony before the grand jury was never recorded.” 
    That despite the fact that the distinguished prosecuting attorney, in the case in the District Court, Mr. Wilkey who was then United States Attorney in Houston. 
    Mr. Wilkey had stated trice in the trial court, in response to inquiry that there was a transcript of Mr. Heras' testimony and there are yards of words that were spelled in the District Court and miles of words that were debated in the Court of Appeals on that assumption and the case was litigated by the -- by the defense on that basis.

    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    Your Honor, there is no doubt I believe. 
    Perhaps Mr. Wilkey will agree. 
    I believe there is no doubt that the Court was asking him, “Do you have a transcript of Mr. Heras' testimony before this grand jury?” 
    And that Mr. Wilkey said, “I do.” 
    When he was asked that question on two additional times, Mr. Wilkey said he has it in his office. 
    Now, we as -- say as I hope to show in a few minutes that this is a case that falls within the -- this Court's doctrine as laid down in Procter &amp; Gamble and Pittsburgh Plate Glass, that this was a case of ultimate and absolute need because of the critical nature of Heras' testimony and because of his demonstrated unreliability and because he was a witness beholding to the Government. 
    Now, I feel it necessary again as I profess here to state why we have suggested that this Court consider whether this case is appropriate for invocation of its supervisory power. 
    In the first place, if the Solicitor General's statement is accepted that Mr. Heras was examined before the grand jury in this case and his testimony was not reported, we believe that that calls for an exercise of this Court's supervisory power. 
    We do not contend that under the rules, it is necessary as a matter of law for the testimony of every witness before a federal grand jury in Texas to be reported. 
    We do contend that in the circumstances of this case, it was an abuse not to record the testimony of Heras as an example and now come to others. 
    The Government knew at the time that Heras was put on the -- on the stand before the grand jury that he had given an affidavit, sworn affidavit to the FBI concerning the petition of Parr, that he had subsequently, given a contradictory affidavit to the FBI on the same matter in which he had said that he had not told the truth in his first affidavit. 
    The Government knew and Mr. Heras had not been prosecuted as part of this great kettle of fish involved in this part of Texas. 
    The Government knew that Mr. Heras was dependent upon the Government's mercy. 
    Every other important witness called before the grand jury, I think there were over 75, the testimony of all except four of the witnesses called before that grand jury was reported. 
    Of the other -- of this four, one was Heras, then the -- there was another one who was the -- a postal inspector and there were two people who were not witnesses at the trial. 
    All the others were transcribed. 
    The grand jury proceedings took place over a long period of time.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If the Court had -- I happened to be very sensitive to show practices by a prosecutor. 
    Is there any suggestion that this was a purposeful conduct on the part of the District Attorney?

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="612.639" stopTime="687.926">
    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    Your Honor, all I -- I know about this is what is in the papers as to the reasons for it. 
    And the Government's brief says that the reason that Mr. Heras' testimony was not recorded, was first that it was well known to the Government so they did not mean a recommendation of it for their own use at the trial. 
    And second, that he was brought in at the last day when the case was fully developed. 
    Now, that second reason, I find singularly unpersuasive, because Heras was such an important and a key witness and to his suspicious mind and I suspect that I, as an advocate, must have one and who have one, then maybe other reasons for the Government's having delayed and delayed in bringing Heras in as a witness before that grand jury and then finally bringing him in on the last day. 
    But I am not -- I can't suggest any -- what -- what the -- what was in the Government's mind beyond what in its papers, I do submit, Mr. Justice.

    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    Well, I'd -- I'd like to make two points to that, Mr. Justice. 
    First, I want to say that this grand jury proceeding was prior to the Jencks case and prior to the rush of interest that has since developed in a -- by -- on a private defendant in obtaining grand jury transcripts, I think that is an important point for the prosecuting attorney on his side. 
    On the other hand, Your Honor, my point is that regardless of whether there were or were not sharp motives, that responsible prosecution in the particular circumstances of Mr. Heras, would certainly have caused the prosecuting attorney to see that his testimony was recorded, the testimony of over 70 witnesses before that grand jury on this same manner were reported. 
    Heras was a self-confessed liar, thief, embezzler, who had given the Government a false affidavit. 
    Certainly, the minimum of prudence, the minimum of proper procedure, in my submission, Your Honor, would have meant that the prosecuting attorney would say in the case of this witness, “Above all, we will have a record because it is my duty to see that this man who has perjured, who has falsely testified before does not perjure himself before the grand jury. 
    And it is my duty to see that the innovations that are necessarily attended upon the presence of a report and the taking down of a witness' testimony are operative in this -- in this situation.”

    Mr. Abe Fortas

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Upon request --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="885.880" stopTime="886.772">
    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    -- now in the record, here.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="886.772" stopTime="889.231">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Upon request or volunteered?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="889.231" stopTime="1256.825">
    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    Upon request, as I -- yes, that is correct, upon request. 
    Well now, I should like to get to the mail fraud point here. 
    The Government agrees that the mail fraud situation here presents a “unique situation,” that is in quote. 
    They say that there is no case exactly like this. 
    It is our submission to Your Honors that the attempt to use the mail fraud statute in this case is not only unprecedented, but it's contrary to the law and that the result of the use of the mail fraud statute in this case, if it is sustained, would be to expand federal jurisdiction over whether are in substance local crimes, to an extent which would leave very little outside of the scope of federal jurisdiction in terms of the -- the heretofore local crimes of embezzlement. 
    Now, I'll have to just lay the facts out as briefly as I can, Your Honors. 
    The event in this case involved the Benavides Independent School District, which is located on the Corpus Christi Division of the Southern District of Texas. 
    This School District had to duty, under the law, to operate two schools and had the power and the duty to levy and collect taxes on property located in the district for the purpose of raising funds for school operations. 
    Now, there are 11 petitioners here, and six of them were officially connected with the School District. 
    One of them was the Tax Collector of the School District. 
    Three of them were on the Board of Trustees and one of them, for a short period of time, was the attorney for the School District and another was for part of the times, secretary of the School District, that's six of them. 
    The other five were connected with the fiscal affairs of the bank of the School District in this sense. 
    Two of the other petitioners are banks, one being the official depository for the School District, and then the remaining three persons who are the petitioners here including George Parr, were officials of the banks and it's also alleged that Mr. Parr dominated the affairs of the School District and there is evidence from which a jury might have drawn that conclusion. 
    Now, the indictment herein and the evidence viewed most favorably to the Government, showed that some of the petitioners misappropriated and embezzled funds of the School District over a period of years. 
    They -- overpaid of approximately five years, there's some doubt as to when the embezzlement stood. 
    Now, the technique by which the scheme to defraud the school operated was this, checks were issued to fictitious persons, nonexistent persons and checks were issued to real persons for a work that they did not do and the proceeds of those checks, the jury might have found, were turned over to the petitioner, Parr. 
    Now, this was the scheme, the scheme to which attention was directing. 
    These practices, as I said, were indulgent from a period of about five, perhaps six years, the indictment come because of the statute of limitations, covers at period September 1, 1951 to December 1954. 
    To give you an idea of the magnitude of -- of the embezzlement pursuant to the scheme, a Government -- the Government estimates that the fraudulent checks which I've just described in the five-year period amounted to about $190,000. 
    Now, because it maybe relevant later on, I'm going to divide that by the period of the embezzlements and suggest that mathematically, the embezzlements amounted to a little over $40,000 a year. 
    Because I want you to consider that if you will, as against the annual receipt from school tax assessments which -- or the annual school tax assessments in which run from the amount of $400,000 in 1949 to $650,000 in 1952. 
    Now, in other words, this was just a small part of the school tax assessments although, it was a lot of money.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1256.825" stopTime="1259.369">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Approximately 10%.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1259.369" stopTime="1262.251">
    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    Less than that, I think, sir. 
    In the later -- in the years --

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1262.550" stopTime="1741.715">
    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    -- covered by the indictment, it was substantially lesser than 10%. 
    Now, most of these petitioners have been indicted in the State courts for embezzlement and for these transactions that had same transactions that it covered in this indictment. 
    To the present time, they have all either been acquitted or after conviction, their convictions have been reversed in the appellate courts of the State of Texas. 
    There are a number of state criminal proceedings still pending, however. 
    Now, I've just described to you the central scheme. 
    In addition to this scheme, there is some evidence that there were individuals among these petitioners and perhaps other persons, who engaged in sort of folics of their own, petty grafts, thievery, embezzlements. 
    There are -- the only ones that are involved in this case in that category of this sort of individual frauds. 
    The -- the only instances involved the individuals Chapa, Garza and Oscar Carrillo. 
    Those are the only individual cases in which a mail fraud is alleged, as I will come to in a moment, in addition to the general and pervasive scheme. 
    The Government says that Chapa, who was the Tax Collector, took for himself some of the tax money belonging to the district, instead of this operating as part of the scheme, Chapa took it for himself. 
    The procedure which Chapa used to get this grant for himself was different from the scheme itself. 
    But the net effect was the same except that Chapa got the money. 
    In the general scheme, you will recall the checks, fictitious checks, were drawn against the general funds of the district. 
    In Chapa's case, he being the Tax Collector, into the two instances that are involved in the indictment, he received checks by mail. 
    He then cashed the checks, as he had a right to do under Texas law. 
    Under Texas law, it is not the checks, but the proceeds of the checks that belong to the district. 
    We've got that brief and I shall pause course to elaborate, that is the fact. 
    And Chapa, instead of turning over the cash proceeds of these checks to the district, appropriated them for himself. 
    That's very bad. 
    It is not a mail fraud as we show in our brief and as I think, I'll -- as I hope come too in a moment. 
    The other individual frolic, if it maybe called that, involves an item that the Government itself in its brief says is quite small and that is that two of the people here, Garza and Oscar Carrillo got -- bought some gasoline for their personal use instead of paying for that of their pockets, they charged it to the district. 
    Again, this is no mail fraud violation as we show in our brief, but I want to come in the little time that I have to the central school, because I am confident that the case turns on that. 
    Now, the essential point, Your Honors, is that this indictment does not charge. 
    There is no evidence to show that anyone of the fraudulent checks drawn on the funds of the district was sent through the mails at anytime. 
    It is not those fraudulent checks that are claimed to be violations of the mail fraud statute. 
    Actually, what happened is that all these people lived in and around this little town and the fraudulent checks were made out, they were then passed from hand to hand, passed over to the bank and then the proceeds were taken over by hand allegedly, to Mr. Parr. 
    So, the fraudulent checks are not charged as a mail fraud. 
    Well, held us, where does the Government get a mail fraud in this case? 
    Now, and here we are right at the nub of point. 
    The Government says that some of these and some of these petitioners, the three members of the Board and the Secretary of the Board operating they say under the domination on this property, were in charged of the School District and had functions with respect to the collection of taxes for the School District, you say. 
    And since some of those taxes came in by a mail, they say that is a use of the mails. 
    Now, I quote the statute for the purpose of executing the fraudulent scheme. 
    Now, they say that since one of the taxes were collected by mail since the proceeds of those taxes went into the general funds of the school, since persons stole from the general funds of the school, that therefore, the collection of taxes was a use of the mails for the purpose of executing the embezzlements from the fund. 
    Now, every time I say that, it sounds a little complicated, but we have suggested and I believe what an important qualification the Government has been impressed by this. 
    We have suggested that the Government's proposition here, as just -- is -- it is like to follow. 
    Let us suppose that a doctor got a secretary and the secretary sends bills out to all the doctor's patients through the mail and some of the bills are paid by use of the mails and then the payments go into the doctor's account and the girl -- the secretary has a petty cash fund, and let us say every week she dips into the petty cash fund and takes 50 cents or $5 or $10. 
    Now, in the Government's theory, in this case, on the theory of this indictment, most embezzlements are a violation of the federal mail fraud statute.

    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    That's right. 
    If Your Honor please, I -- I want to make this clear, but perhaps, I -- and I say we should have. 
    There were lots of frauds here. 
    One of the frauds that the Government talks about in great deal is that reports were submitted to the School Board in Austin, Texas by these petitioners and there were fraudulent representations in their report to that School Board, but the report to the School Board is not a use of the mails. 
    That is relied on in this case, it couldn't be. 
    One of the interesting and important things about this case, one of the things that we call to the Court's attention in connection with our supervisory power point is this, the venue of this case, this indictment was brought in Houston, Texas which is 250 miles northeast of the Benavides School District and of the area in which these -- the defendants, these petitioners live. 
    Although everything involved here, all the fraud involved here relates to the Benavides School District. 
    It was brought in Houston, venue was placed in Houston by the device of saying that the mailings had (Inaudible) in Houston. 
    What mailings? 
    The mailings of -- of taxes -- of checks and payment of taxes by the Humble Oil Company, the Texas Oil Company and so on, those are the counts in this indictment that I alleged to be the mail frauds. 
    Humble Oil Company sends in a check in payment of its taxes, that appears as a mail fraud and the -- and the petitioners are alleged to have committed the crime in Houston, how? 
    By causing Humble Oil Company to send in a check in payment of taxes, how do petitioners cause him to do it? 
    Petitioners cause him to do it by assessing the taxes as they have to do it according to law. 
    There is not a word in this indictment, if the Court please. 
    There is not a word of evidence, if the Court please. 
    There is nothing in trial court's charge, if the Court please. 
    To the effect that any of these tax notices or that if any of these tax payments was itself tainted with fraud, or that the taxes where inflated or that there was any kind of monkey work in connection with the taxes. 
    And Government, in it's final -- in it's brief here, as rather to my mind, rather extraordinary arguments trying desperately at this last moment to rewrite the indictment by suggesting that now, that there were, that the taxes might have been less, if it hadn't been for the scheme to defraud. 
    The trial court, their position was not that the taxes might've been less, but that the schools might've been better and I suspect they might've.

    Does the Court of Appeals proceed, in your view, on the basis that the evidence here established an increase in assessed valuations for the purposes of the bringing in an amount in excess of need in order to supply appeal for loot?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2096.714" stopTime="2203.961">
    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    The Court of Appeals indicates something to that general effect and the Government here elaborates on it, but more cautiously. 
    The Government here says more cautiously than the Court of Appeals that the taxes might well have been lowered, if it had not been forfeits. 
    Our answer to that, Your Honor, it is very claimed, if only maybe so bold as to say so, there's nothing to -- to that effect in the indictment. 
    There is no evidence to that effect. 
    There is nothing in the charge. 
    That's not the theory of this case. 
    That is no the theory of this indictment or the theory on which this case was tried. 
    The theory very plainly was this. 
    Remember, venue in Houston, the theory very plainly was that taxpayers in Houston send in checks in payment of taxes and the Board in Benavides sent out a few notices to people in -- in Houston that this tax collection process resulted in part, in the creation of a fund, which belonged to the School District. 
    I say in part, because there were funds from other sources too. 
    And these people embezzled and stole money from this fund. 
    It's exactly like the doctor's case. 
    There is no allegation in the indictment to the effect that the taxes that either -- that tax is whether in the aggregate or in individual cases were affected by this fraud.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2203.961" stopTime="2206.425">

    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    If Your Honor please, I don't recall anything about a budget here because the fact of the matter is --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2224.465" stopTime="2229.009">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I gather the taxes are raised against annual requirements for school purposes on that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2229.009" stopTime="2332.759">
    Mr. Abe Fortas 
    And the fact of the matters is that the tax assessing process is composed of two parts. 
    One is the valuation of property, of course, and the other is fixing of the rates. 
    So far as the valuation process here is concerned, that was done by a Board of Equalization in the -- with respect to Government estimate 75% to 85% of the property as a matter of value here. 
    That was done. 
    The valuation was fixed on recommendations of concededly independent engineers. 
    Most of the important property in this district is oil property and Humble Oil and Texas Oil Company only and there was a firm of independent engineers and appraisers who made the valuations and turned it over to the Board of Equalization, which was separate from -- that is composed of different people although they may have been nominated by the School District, but they weren't the same people. 
    And there were sorts of procedural rights. 
    The usual kind, taxpayer didn't like it he could apply for a hearing at the Board of Equalization and go -- go to the courts. 
    So there's no -- no question about the -- the valuation and no -- no such charge is made. 
    The second thing is the level of the rates. 
    The rates here were fixed, the -- the maximum that could be assessed was fixed by the -- by a state law and of course, one might argue that the -- the Board might have fixed the rates at anything lower than that. 
    At something lower than the maximum, that would've been rather -- that would have been --

    There's nothing in this record to indicate either an inflation of -- of the rates, because of the scheme or that the total amount collected was in excess of the reasonable needs of the district. 
    There's nothing like that in this case which, Your Honor, in order for it to be a federal crime, of course, that theory would have had to be alleged in the indictment, too.

    Mr. Malcolm Richard Wilkey 
    That is correct. 
    Now, let me explain and I want to do it at the outset and I can see, I know Mr. Justice Douglas' concern, but I know that the rest of the Court is concerned. 
    That's why we made no transcript here of the witness errors. 
    We had either 12 or 14 statements of Heras taken by various investigating agencies during the past two years of 1950 -- during 1953 and 1954. 
    We had 12 or 14 at that time and we subsequently acquired two or three more. 
    17 statements of Heras were turned over to the defense at the trial. 
    Now, in addition to that, I have the grand jury transcript recorded on Mr. Heras, before a grand jury which met in October 1954, concerning the affairs of Mr George B. Parr and concerning, in part at least, these matters made the subject to this mail fraud indictment. 
    When the last day came up and there was no particular reason why Heras would -- there on the last day, he could've been earlier. 
    Heras lived in Houston at that time and -- and was available anytime that we needed to call him. 
    When the last day came up, we had only two witnesses left, Mr. Heras and Postal Inspector, Mane (ph). 
    We did not need a court reporter and we told the court reporter, his services were not needed that day. 
    And there was no transcript made of either Heras or Inspector Mane. 
    Now, we hadn't made a transcript of Inspector Mane when he appeared on the first day of the grand jury and the reason was as in the case of Heras, Mane was there in Houston, we had reports of Mane, if we wanted to ask any questions of Inspector Mane we could have call him up on the telephone and ask him to come down to the federal building. 
    We had as I say 12 or 14 statements for Heras, taken on these matters and there was simply no need to make a transcript.

    Mr. Malcolm Richard Wilkey 
    Mr. Justice Black, I, myself, have no independent recollection, of course, as to why I made the error in the courtroom. 
    I assure you it was a flat misstatement, unintentionally made and I was not aware that this did not exist until we ascertained it later on. 
    And in reconstructing it, all I can say is that I must have been thinking of the tax grand jury transcript, which I hold here in my hand and which we did have, a record on Mr. Heras' testimony back in 1954. 
    Now --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you -- do you now remember definitely that you did not take it that much because you already had the statement or is that -- do you remember that definitely?
speaker="malcolm_richard_wilkey" startTime="3024.143" stopTime="3076.395">
    Mr. Malcolm Richard Wilkey 
    I can't remember that definitely but by going back as to what happen in the circumstances, I'm satisfied that that is true and there -- that was the reason we did not record them. 
    We could have had no other reason than the fact, we simply didn't mean it and I want to point out that in my two years as United States Attorney there, in March 1956, I had never had a demand for a grand jury transcript except in this case. 
    The Jencks decisions did not come until a year and a quarter after this mail fraud grand jury. 
    And it never occur to -- to us -- to me that there was any obligation on us to make a grand jury transcript for the benefit of the defendants.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3076.395" stopTime="3091.717">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I can -- I can understand that. 
    How long was it after the time the -- this gentleman testified before the grand jury, until you made the statement in court that you had the transcript of his evidence?
speaker="malcolm_richard_wilkey" startTime="3091.717" stopTime="3264.208">
    Mr. Malcolm Richard Wilkey 
    He appeared before the grand jury on March the 6th, 1956. 
    I made the statement, I suppose the first time, thinking I had the transcript on June the 5th, 1957, a year and three months later. 
    And I will call your attention further that the case has been tried once before in November and December and that I did not have in the courtroom, the transcripts and it had been, I'm satisfied, prior to the first trial that I have had occasion even to refer to the grand jury transcripts. 
    By the time of the second trial, in trial preparation, as counsel at the table, I had all of the information on all of the witnesses, pretty well reduced to notes that I could hold in my hand and use for examination. 
    In some instances, in this second case, I used a transcript made from the first trial. 
    But in most instances, I had (Inaudible) the thing down to the very essentials that we needed to present our case, and since we were doing it for the second time, we pretty well new what that was. 
    And so, I did not refer to the grand jury transcript of errors or any Government witnesses and I don't think I had any occasion to do so, at any time during the trial. 
    I have no recollection, but I don't think there was any reason for it. 
    They were all back in the files in the office. 
    Now, in the files was a grand jury transcript of Heras and that I'm satisfied in -- looking back on it now, was both what I had in my mind when I say I had a grand jury transcript and secondly, it, along with the 12 or 14 statements that we have of Heras, was the reason that we made no transcript of this witness' testimony. 
    This, I assure the Court, was not a selective effort to avoid making a transcript of Mr. Heras for any purpose whatever. 
    We simply didn't need it. 
    And we knew of no obligation toward the defense. 
    We never thought of it that would've required us to make a transcript. 
    Now, the petitioner says and admits that there is no requirement that the United States Attorney make a transcript. 
    But they say, the extraordinary cases, they actually -- that this is an extraordinary case and therefore, under these circumstances, it was an abuse of prosecutorial discretion, not to make a transcript. 
    Now, if we had a discretion, then the question is, whether or not, I exercise that discretion properly. 
    And the reasons that I have given are the reasons on which I acted.

    Mr. Malcolm Richard Wilkey 
    I certainly would, if his previous, erroneous or false statements had been concerned with the subject matter that we were inquiring about. 
    But, Mr. Chief Justice, I want to emphasize this and a -- you -- of these two statements are in the record and you have not only my opinion on it, but also the opinion of the trial court. 
    The two -- the only two really contradictory statements, the only two were some defense brought were sufficiently contradictory put in the evidence. 
    They didn't put these others in evidence. 
    The only two were on a matter not related to this indictment. 
    The judge -- the trial judge examined that and look at both of these statements. 
    They did not concern the subject matter of this mail fraud indictment in any fashion. 
    Now, they did show that this man had made a false statement and he gave us the explanation of that and he gave the explanation on the stand under cross-examination. 
    But on the subject matter of the mail fraud -- all of the matters related to this case, the witness, Heras, not only was accurate and truthful from the stand, but he was accurate and truthful in the preceding statements which we have. 
    Now, we have lodged of this statement, which we had at the time of the grand jury and all the other statements of Heras which were tendered to the defense. 
    We have lodged those with this Court, where they are available for inspection. 
    They were not in the Court of Appeals and we lodged them on the basis and in relation to whether or not, we properly exercised a discretion in not recording Mr. Heras' testimony. 
    I have read those three grand jury statements yesterday and today. 
    I say, I reread them, because it was on the basis of those that we interrogated to Heras before the two grand juries. 
    I have reread them yesterday and today and I think that any fair minded man with the facts that just the basic facts of Heras' testimony in the -- a trial court in his mind, could read those statements and see that Heras was a consistent witness. 
    He was not a misleading or evasive witness. 
    His story was straightforward and consistent and it was that on which we had to rely when we put him before the grand jury.

speaker="malcolm_richard_wilkey" startTime="3558.316" stopTime="3676.595">
    Mr. Malcolm Richard Wilkey 
    The subject matter of the two statements which are exhibits -- defendant's Exhibit 213 and 214 and are printed on the record. 
    The subject matter involved an alligation that George Parr had Heras transport a sealed envelope to Corpus Christi for eventual -- $5,000 for eventual payment to an FBI agent. 
    That story was false and Heras said it was false. 
    In both affidavits -- in both affidavits, there's no question about preoperative facts. 
    In the first affidavit, he said the story is false and I never told any such story. 
    All I said was, I told the facts and I related this -- a phone call that Mr. Parr got at the same time from this FBI agent. 
    And all I told was the -- we're trying to fix a date and a time of -- and things that occurred. 
    And somebody else may -- must've put the things together and got this rumor started. 
    Now, in the second affidavit, Mr. -- Mr. Heras said, the -- it is not true that any such money was conveyed to the FBI agent, which he'd said in the first affidavit. 
    But in the second affidavit, he said, “Yes, I did put out that false rumor.” 
    Now, let me give you the circumstances of that which were known to us before this grand jury and which he testified to on trial. 
    Heras, on trial said, “The first affidavit is true. 
    I just recited the -- the facts in fixing the time and I've never spread and originated this rumor, but putting two and two together to make four here, which was false.”

    It was -- no relation whatever to this indictment. 
    The only connection with this indictment was it mentioned the name of the petitioner, Parr, and that's all. 
    And the trial judge examined these two and said that there was no relevancy to the Diego Heras' trial testimony, whatever in these two.

    He then was transported, accompanied by either his father and a nurse or maybe only his father, to 275 miles to his house in Benavides, where he was in bed and had called the doctor and then received another injection to quiet him at the time the second statement was taken.

    Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I can only say in reconstructing, while I think was my conduct there that I simply did not go into these two statements because they weren't relevant to any of the matters there being concerned. 
    We did go into the fact and spread on the books fully that Heras had signed these fictitious checks that he taken them to the bank that he had participated returning the proceeds to Parr. 
    He had signed other fictitious checks. 
    In other words, the -- the jury knew all about Heras' conduct here.

    Mr. Malcolm Richard Wilkey 
    If you'll -- our testimony of -- the testimony of Heras is set forth in the record.Heras' participation in the fraudulent scheme ended July 12th, 1951, when the books and all were moved from Parr's office back to Benavides. 
    Every check in evidence and we've gotten -- we've got a huge batch of checks from the microfilm of another bank, besides the Parr banks, which shows who signed all of the checks. 
    And Heras testified he never signed a check after July and all these checks in evidence bear him out. 
    He didn't sign any of these fictitious checks after July. 
    He was cut off from the confidence of the participants in this scheme. 
    The direction and control of it was taken over in Benavides by the two people, Chapa and Carrillo. 
    The bank -- we don't have to rely on just Heras and the checks for that either. 
    We have the eyeball testimony of four bank tellers in Parr's own bank, as to what went on there. 
    Their testimony is that Heras did not come in with these checks. 
    We have able to fix the date as being definitely November the 1st, 1951, and there is no check after June, so we have no proof and all the evidence is he had no participation in the scheme after July 12, 1951.

    Mr. Malcolm Richard Wilkey 
    Well, in all frankness, I don't think that Heras have adjured the conspiracy.I think in July 1951, the conspirators adjured him. 
    And in December 1952 --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4836.849" stopTime="4838.548">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And may -- they held that on him?
speaker="malcolm_richard_wilkey" startTime="4838.548" stopTime="5297.824">
    Mr. Malcolm Richard Wilkey 
    They -- they cut him out of anything to do with it entirely. 
    And in December 1952, they discharged him from employment with the School District, although for, later on, for three -- three months period, they asked -- asked him to do some specialized work in concerning city lots of Benavides, in his own office and paid him for that. 
    I -- but the evidence is very clear that in July of 1951, the books in records were moved, Heras was -- meant he no longer had any part -- and in his responsible part, he had it no longer, any part in the basic elements of this scheme here. 
    I want to say also that making a grand jury transcript is unusual in our district. 
    In fact, in most districts and the only reason that we made a transcript (Inaudible) was that this was a investigative grand jury, in which we were seeking information from witness which we did not have in full and therefore, we made records of it. 
    In the case of Heras, we had 12 or 14 statements and this grand jury transcript and we saw no reason to make another record of Heras. 
    And at that time, we had no idea that the Jencks decision was a year and a quarter away, or that any demand would be made for his transcript. 
    Whether we had any obligation to at all, that simply was not in my mind or to mind of any my assistants, or in fact, within the knowledge of our experience. 
    Now, I -- I want to -- I want to go over some of the things which Heras testified about and which were confirmed absolutely by the testimony of all the other witness called. 
    These are matters that we knew about when we put him before the jury. 
    As far as -- with the exception of those two, contradictory FBI statements, as far as we knew, he was reliable. 
    He had told the truth that we have checked out, about this case. 
    Now, let's see that, Heras was the one who first in -- early in 1953, after he was discharged from the School District, he made statements to state and federal investigators in -- in regard to the fictitious names on the report. 
    We checked that out with the postal investigators and the others, interviews with postmasters in this county. 
    And at trial, we put on eight post masters and three or four other witnesses who testified that these names were indeed fictitious. 
    And this we knew, as to the practice of cashing these checks at the bank, we didn't rely entirely on Heras for that. 
    We had Carl Williams, Edna Fitch, Cristine Ray and Reed Nunnally (ph) who had either dealt with Heras three of them had dealt with him and -- correction, two of them had dealt with him, the other one that seen him in there, and Mrs. Cristine Ray, who went to work November the 1st, 1951 taking Carl Williams' place, testified that she had never dealt with Heras and had never seen him in connection with this, but the fictitious checks kept coming in. 
    And Reed Nunnally testified that Oscar Carrillo's visits to the bank increased noticeably and -- number at that time and he went to see Donald. 
    Now, the scheme at the bank as revealed by this eyeball testimony of this witness was that Heras normally went to Donald and Donald went the individual teller and picked up the bundles of cash. 
    So that was confirmed in every way, even the incident about Heras being shortchanged $1000 in which he had, one time, dealt with Mrs. Fitch. 
    She made a mistake. 
    She was interrupted by a telephone call and she put only $3000 instead of $4000 in the envelope. 
    And when he saw that, he had only three packs, he came back and she found she was $1000 over and he got the extra thousand. 
    That was remembered by the other people, he took her a box of candy in gratitude, and as Carl Williams testified, he ate some of the candy, the whole bank knew of this. 
    This was no secret going on in the Parr bank desk. 
    Now then, as to Benson, and Benson who was a much more jolting witness to the defendants then was Heras. 
    Benson was the auditor. 
    He had handled some of these packages of money in one case. 
    He had gone to the bank for Parr. 
    In another case, he had conveyed a package from Heras to Parr, which Heras told us about. 
    And furthermore, Benson had made out the income tax returns, not only at Parr, but at Chapa and Carrillo. 
    And he knew about this extra funds coming in. 
    And in 1953, long after, Heras have severed any connection with the School District, Benson testified as to the $19,667 of unidentified income in Chapa's return and a $10,200 unidentified on Carrillo's return. 
    And there were others years prior to that in which you see the thing just building up. 
    Now, as to obtain your signs, Mr Heras told us that signs and I think this was after the grand jury, but it confirmed the whole thing. 
    Then Mr. Saenz had an account with the Hebbronville Bank and we went down there and we found there the microfilm and you see the microfilm had disappeared for this five years from the two Parr banks. 
    We went down to the Hebbronville and we got this photostats of checks, which cover from 1949 to 1953. 
    And they showed that Benson signed -- countersigned the checks until 1950. 
    That George Parr countersigned thereafter, with exception of the last month or two when Milligan signed. 
    They show that Heras signed as makers, until June of 1951, that's the last check, June 1951 and thereafter, the factitious checks to the petitioners signs, which were in eight different names deposited to his account, were signed as maker by Oscar Carrillo and Octavio Saenz, which confirmed, what Heras said -- told us as to the practice in the office of who signed the checks and who prepared them. 
    Now then, in addition to these checks, we had literary hundreds of documents, tax notices, receipts, deposit slips, annual reports and a great number this had the signatures of Parr, Chapa, Saenz, Oscar Carrillo, I think those four principally on them. 
    There are any others I don't recall. 
    The FBI handwriting expert analyzing this for us and we knew that the signatures of the petitioners here on this fraudulent instruments were authentic. 
    There -- the petitioners had actually participated with there own hand. 
    In every respect, as to what had gone on, as to the origin of the scheme, Heras was confirmed and furthermore, by all this evidence, we carried the scheme on during the period of -- where limitations had not run.

    Is that the Tax Collector sends out bills I'd get them and I suppose you do, for taxes that are due? 
    That's all he does, that's the only way he uses the mail, but for five years he -- he continuously pilfers money that should be -- go -- go to the governing bodies, are you saying that under those circumstances, that's a violation of the mail fraud law?

    Mr. Malcolm Richard Wilkey 
    The evidence on budgetary figures showed that between Benavides and Freer, the revenues were split exactly equal and the budget in each case was almost exactly $200,000 for the two schools that made $400,000. 
    In addition to that, the school had to maintain the small office at Benavides which employed about six people. 
    Now then, in the same year, 1953, the evidence showed that the tax revenues were $650,000.

    And there is not a line of evidence in the record that would support that theory even if had been alleged. 
    That theory -- I've lived to this case four years and the first time I heard of it was when the opinion of the Court of Appeals has handed down last year.

    Mr. T. Gilbert Sharpe 
    Yes, sir. 
    We say that that was not their contention in the lower court if the record would bear us out. 
    The contention of the Government in the lower court was that money came in sufficient for the school needs, but was not spent for proper purposes. 
    And I can give you a record reference the argument of counsel is printed to Volume 14 of the record at pages 5006, 5007, were Government counsel and his submission, points out that very theory that the money came in, but was used for wrong purposes.

    Would you regard -- and if there was such a scheme to do that, if there was a designed scheme to fix the rate, held be it, it might be a legal rate to fix a rate to the end, that the school purposes maybe satisfied thereby, but also some cream maybe skimmed off and then the mail was used. 
    The mails were used the way they were used here, would you say that was or was not within the statute?

speaker="t_gilbert_sharpe" startTime="7303.339" stopTime="7305.849">
    Mr. T. Gilbert Sharpe 
    Well, sir, I -- I'm trying to answer it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="7305.849" stopTime="7306.805">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Alright.
speaker="t_gilbert_sharpe" startTime="7306.805" stopTime="7413.329">
    Mr. T. Gilbert Sharpe 
    No, sir. 
    I don't think that that -- I don't -- I wouldn't be with that position. 
    And read -- and then say so, as that we have cited the court a case in our reply brief, Madely versus the Trustees of the Conroe School District, decided in 1939, by Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, 130 S.W. 2d 929, which clearly holds that it is not improper for a Board of Trustee to accumulate moneys at the end of the year and that case, they accumulated some $150 -- $200,000 of maintenance tax money, which the district used for construction of buildings which ordinary will be supplied by a bond issue. 
    So, it is not illegal for a School District to set a budget which has a number of variable factors and that one would be the percentages of collections, the others would be expenditures, I serve as a School Board Trustee for six years, in the Brownsville District. 
    And I know what any School Board Trustee knows that you can't set a budget with accuracy, you have some variables on it. 
    But under the Government's theory, if the School Board Trustee fixes a budget of lets say, were an expenditure of $10,000 is required for utilities, gas and electricity and so forth and so on, the tax bills are sent out and the money comes in, and only $5000 are used for that purpose, the other $5,000 in -- is embezzled, that would be mail fraud case. 
    Now, Justice -- Mr. Justice Brennan asked the question -- asked us a question a while ago that I want to address myself to. 
    Under Texas law, each year a Board of Trustee is required to fix a budget and the collections, that is tax collections, are based upon, one valuations fixed by a separate Board of Equalization to the rate which is fixed by the School Board.

speaker="t_gilbert_sharpe" startTime="7428.886" stopTime="7433.223">
    Mr. T. Gilbert Sharpe 
    Either the tax rate has to be adjusted or the valuations and usually ---

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I understand it as a maximum --

    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="7437.477" stopTime="7452.758">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But assume you had rateables with requirements which dividing the latter by the former, would give you a tax rate of $1.25, well within the statutory -- the statutory limit, is that the way you arrive in a tax rate in Texas?
speaker="t_gilbert_sharpe" startTime="7452.758" stopTime="7470.304">
    Mr. T. Gilbert Sharpe 
    In sometimes, but in exceptional cases arrived at that way. 
    Usually, the Board takes the evaluation submitted to it by the Board of Equalization. 
    The needs, in most instances, exceed the amount of money the Board is going to get anyway and applies the maximum rate to it. 
    That is the usual procedure.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="7470.304" stopTime="7479.789">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, this is -- this is because in order to raise as -- an amount this close as possible to the needs, you then apply the maximum tax rate?
speaker="t_gilbert_sharpe" startTime="7479.789" stopTime="7487.475">
    Mr. T. Gilbert Sharpe 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But it is not illegal in Texas to raise money in excess of actual needs as is shown by the budget. 
    Now, I'd like to say that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="7487.475" stopTime="7497.111">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, this -- this I appreciate. 
    In other words, you might have a -- a provision in a budget which you -- everyone knows is going to -- to result in a surplus.

    Nevertheless, if you have such a provision in the budget, and were not now dealing with a -- a budget and valuation which will realize more than -- would require a rate higher than the maximum.

    Mr. T. Gilbert Sharpe 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Would that or would it not in your judgment to the mail fraud.
speaker="t_gilbert_sharpe" startTime="7543.009" stopTime="7672.445">
    Mr. T. Gilbert Sharpe 
    It -- it could be -- it could be Your Honor. 
    But I would like to point out this. 
    We have Texas statute which requires a budget of every School District to be found annually, with the county clerk. 
    All of the Government had to do, in this case, was to go to the county clerk and get the school budget for each one of these years 1951, 1952, and 1953 and offered in evidence, and that it failed to do and did not explain its failure to do so. 
    In other words, there was not only a failure of allegation in this case, as to the budgetary need in the requirement, but there was a failure of proof and a failure to explain the reason to supply that budget. 
    The budget that Mr. Wilkey talks about is an oral reconstruction to number of witness. 
    It is not the written budget that a School District in Texas is required to make out each year. 
    And I would like to say this further. 
    That we have printed as an appendix to our brief, appendix -- our reply brief filed today. 
    Appendix B which shows every single one of the essential mailings that form this basis of the 19 substantive counts in this case. 
    Every single letter involved in the appendix and in the indictment involved a use of the mail at Houston, Texas. 
    Either the taking or the placing of a letter there was a theory on Government's part to the taking and placing was caused over in Benavides, by the petitioners, 250 miles away. 
    Each one of the exhibits there will show other the purpose. 
    Everyone of them was for the legitimate purpose, either of the taxpayer sending a check with a letter of transmittal, or this oil company sending its bill. 
    Now, I would like to challenge Mr Wilkey's statement that the statutes of limitation had ran against Diego Heras, as to any offense. 
    And if the Court has before, if the Members the of the Court have before them, the appendix to our brief on page 13 (a), you will see a letter which is the basis for the first count of the indictment, signed by Diego Heras dated September the 26th, 1952. 
    The petitioner (Inaudible) convicted on that count and the statue of limitation did not run on that count until September of 1957, after this case was tried, the last time.

    Mr. T. Gilbert Sharpe 
    The indictment was returned in March of 1956, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Heras could've been indicted on that one count that the other petitioners were convicted on up until September the 26th, 1957. 
    The same thing is true Count 7, which appears at page 22 (a) of the appendix. 
    There is a letter, dated December the 3rd, 1952, signed by Mr. Diego Heras, on the petitioner in this case, with two exceptions, were convicted on that letter and Mr. Heras could have been indicted on that letter, until December the 3rd, 1957. 
    Your Honor, my time is about out here and I would just like to say this, the Government has switched its theory in this case, from reliance from the letters which are described in the last numbered paragraph of each count of the indictment which was simply a legitimate use of the mails of Houston for the purpose of paying and collecting taxes to one, in which they mentioned receipts, notices, letters, properties left of the rolls and not in single count in this indictment, not one involves a piece of property which was not on the rolls.
