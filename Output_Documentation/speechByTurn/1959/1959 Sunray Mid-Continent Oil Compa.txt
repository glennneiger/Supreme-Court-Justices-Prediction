    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- Commission. 
    Mr. Wahrenbrock.
speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="2.751" stopTime="620.710">
    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    May (Inaudible). 
    I would like to address myself to a question which arouse during the argument of these two Federal Power Commission certificate cases yesterday, that I think presents a good point of departure. 
    And that is, how does Section 7 (b) affect the Commission's certificating power? 
    And I -- I would answer that further by saying that it makes clear that there are two questions for the Commission to answer in considering an application for a certificate limited to the term of the contract. 
    The first question is, does public convenience and necessity require the sale? 
    And the second question is, does public convenience and necessity permit its termination at the end of the contract? 
    There was evidence in this Sunray case, that the Pipeline United needed the gas. 
    Pipeline sells 1,247,000,000,000 cubic feet of gas each year. 
    To maintain its reserves of gas, it has to acquire additional reserves each year equal in amount to that, that it sells each year. 
    This gas involved in these contracts represents an estimated reserve of about 123,300,000,000 cubic feet and that's about one-tenth of what United needs each year, if it's to keep its reserves up to where they have been. 
    Now, that was the nature of the evidence that was in this record as to the need for the gas, need for the sale. 
    But what was the evidence as to the -- that the public convenience and necessity would require or permit the termination of the sale? 
    Was there any evidence? 
    The answer is substantially, none. 
    The examiner described the testimony of the witnesses on that point and he summarized that in the -- in the following language, the factual accuracy of which has not been challenged. 
    He said that it might fairly be summarized by saying that those applicants and he was referring to Sunray and another, that has not perfected a review that those applicants would prefer not to be subject to regulation. 
    That was the sum and substance of their testimony. 
    But the Commission instead of denying the whole package because there had not been any evidentiary showing in support of the termination of the sale, which it could have done, as Mr. Justice Whittaker pointed out in some of his questions, instead of doing that and just taking a negative attitude allowing the applicant to come back and come back and come back until they found out something that could be granted, the Commission said, “We will grant an -- an indefinite term certificate.” 
    And it granted it. 
    Meaning, that the applicant was free to accept it or not.Under the Commission's regulation, the applicant has a period of time within which to accept the certificate. 
    It doesn't have to. 
    It wasn't compelled to. 
    And under protest, it did here, under protest, in reserving its right to question this, raise this question. 
    It did actually accept and has -- and the sale has started, reserving its right to question. 
    And the Commission accepted that acceptance or acquiesced in that acceptance upon the specific understanding that if the Commission's order was not set aside, Sunray could not abandon that sale at any time. 
    It could not abandon it without complying with 7 (b). 
    So that gas is now being sold. 
    Sunray says that there aren't two questions. 
    There's only one question. 
    That question is, if we understand its argument, is the sale required by public convenience and necessity? 
    That is, is it required for whatever term the applicant has contracted and proposes in its application? 
    Is -- is that sale required? 
    The Commission says that the sale which is authorized to be certificated is this -- because of 7 (b), is a -- a continuing flow, the continuing open-ended selling of the gas. 
    That's -- that's what can be granted. 
    That's what is applied for. 
    That was -- is what must be considered to be applied for. 
    That is what it will pass on, if there is anything more, if there is determination, then that must be separately passed on either -- and you can analyze it either way you want to by saying that it's an anticipation of the 7 (b) permission to terminate, or you can say that it's a condition which the Commission is authorized to impose under Section 7 (e), the terms of which provide that the Commission may impose any conditions it finds required by the public convenience and necessity. 
    So, in the Commission's point of view, two things had to be proved, had to be shown.Only one was, it offered the kind of certificate that that permitted. 
    Now, the question then was also asked, whether what difference it would make if the Commission's position which it here took was not affirmed, if the Commission could not do what it purported to do in these cases. 
    And Mr. Justice Black's questions about the procedural disadvantages to rate regulation if the -- particularly, if a shorter term contract were involved and particularly if it got down to one that could be terminated on 30 days notice, the impossibility of effectively regulating rates and particularly even in middle length term contracts of using Section 5 (a) instead of 4 (d) with its more effective protection to consumers. 
    That's -- that's a large part of our answer to the question of what difference it would make. 
    But beyond that, even if all of the contracts continued, that were sought, brought before the Commission, continued to be 20-year term contracts, even if Mr. Richter is right in his estimate of how large a proportion of the contracts that are presently under certificate are 20-year contracts. 
    Still, the 20-year contract presents a very serious -- further difficulty. 
    If applicants like Sunray can obtain 20-year contracts, limited term certificates, under such circumstances or if companies like Sun in the preceding case could treat their indefinite terms certificates for 10 or 20 years as limited term certificates, it would mean that at the end of the term, they do not have to comply with 7 (b). 
    They've already received their authorization. 
    And if they do not have to comply with 7 (b) at that type, if they may then may automatically terminate, that means that their purchaser, their pipeline with its fixed obligations is left without that future supply of gas, what gas remains there until those reserves have been completely depleted. 
    A natural gas is an exhaustible resource, of course. 
    And while pipelines are growing, new discoveries of gas are not increasing as rapidly as would be necessary to maintain the ratio of reserves to net production. 
    And a continuance of the trend of the last two or three years of new discoveries in relation to net production could make pipelines hard to fill long before the end of 20 years. 
    If Sunray and others are free to abandon their sales such as this to United from the -- from the production properties involved here, where United has built its pipeline in to take the gas, United will have to go out into the market and compete with others for the continuation of that supply or for a substitution for that supply and compete in a market which is bound at the end of -- by -- before the end of 20 years to be a short-supply market, unless we cannot rely upon present trends. 
    That market will include sellers who are free of federal regulation and the demand for gas will make it extremely difficult for a regulation to keep prices down. 
    Capital type of price conditions can be imposed when the applications are brought before us. 
    But if the sellers can sell their market elsewhere for high prices, those conditions will merely drive the gas out of the interstate market. 
    Sunray's arguments in this case with amazing frankness tend strongly to confirm this. 
    For Sunray frankly espouses its business interest, its legitimate business interest as it calls it, its business interest in being free at the expiration of its contract term to reconsider whether it will continue to sell its gas. 
    It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that this is a polite way of saying it wants to be free to use its economic power to the fullest.

    Not if the Commission is wrong in the position it took here. 
    They would be completely free if -- if Sunray can abandon at the termination of its contract, then Sunray is completely free to sell in intrastate commerce without the let or leave of the Federal Power Commission.

    It means until they can get 7 (b) permission and the two criteria, the alternative criteria for giving them 7 (b) permission to abandon -- are -- the two criteria are. 
    First, that the available supply of gas has become depleted. 
    And second or alternatively, that the public convenience and necessity permit the abandonment. 
    There is nothing to prevent them under the Commission's theory from coming in a year or 20 or 50 years later in asking for permission under those circumstances, if they can make either of those showings.

    This contract was to sell the gas that could be produced from that acreage. 
    Now, I -- I don't want to be held to all of these because of the complicated definition, but whatever the definition of gas being sold, it's that sale which is committed and not whatever else they may have elsewhere.

    Certainly, take the -- the simplest kind of -- of a contract that I can think of at the spur of the moment. 
    A producer says, “I'll sell you 10,000 cubic feet of gas per day or hour,” whatever it is. 
    That's all that's committed to interstate commerce. 
    He can sell it to somebody else out of the same well, 10,000 cubic feet of gas per day or hour, whatever it is. 
    Nothing to prevent. 
    It's the gas which he has contracted to sell, that sale which is committed to the public service.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And, of course, if after 10 years, the local demand should become such that they could withdraw all that was then in interstate commerce, I presume that people who had -- industries and the people who are dependent on gas, through interstate commerce, would be left with pipelines with no gas to feed the -- feed the customers.

    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    Exactly. 
    And even if gas could be bought at the same price, that would mean that the pipelines that have been laid to take that gas represent a waste investment. 
    And that was -- the basis of Judge McLaughlin's statement in the Huber case, which we quote in our brief in which he points out the -- the losses that would be involved in that duplication of facilities and the pipeline having to go elsewhere to get a supply to continue to carry its public utility.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you depend entirely on 7 (b) or do you depend at all on the general plan and purpose of the Act to provide for continuity of service at reasonable rates in the interstate commerce?
speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="938.189" stopTime="977.524">
    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    Well, I think that 7 (b) represents the apex of that -- the implementation of that policy. 
    We think that policy is consistent with the policy declaration in Section 1 (a) and with the -- the provisions of Section 1 (b) which state what is subject to the Commission's jurisdiction, both of which make the regulation dependent upon and applied to the sale, for resale, for ultimate distribution to the public. 
    It is that concept of the ultimate use that's being made of the gas that seems to inform the general provisions and the specific provision about not abandoning service.

    The same argument you're making, of course, I don't know whether it fits this statute.

    The finding is the same, we feel, in either case. 
    If we're going to grant a limited term certificate, we have to find first that the sale is necessary. 
    Second, that its termination is permitted by the public convenience and the necessity which to say that you've already made the finding which 7 (b) would have required in any event.

    I understand that, but that isn't the position of the Commission. 
    As I understand it, your position is that you will not, as a matter of rule, grant a term firmly, unless some very special consideration is shown in a particular case or do I misconceive your argument, what you told us yesterday?

    If we grant it now, we grant it without having enough facts to really know if we wait and we say, “We don't have enough facts. 
    You haven't made the showing now,” and that's what most of these cases are, you haven't made the showing, but that's -- you're still free to come in at the end of your term or anytime during your term and say, “Now, you can show it.”

    That's all right then.
speaker="howard_e_wahrenbrock" startTime="2032.219" stopTime="2047.190">
    Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock 
    -- for granting the certificate that we did. 
    These people had gas. 
    They wanted to sell it. 
    It was a newly developed field. 
    I don't know whether there might have been leakage or drainage, if they hadn't enough. 
    So the Commission gave them what it thought it could and they went ahead and acted under it. 
    Thank you.

    Well --

    Mr. Melvin Richter 
    -- our position is that we have applied for a certificate for 20 years in accordance with the terms of the contract. 
    That under Section 7 (e) of the Natural Gas Act that the -- we have -- which provides for the -- the Commissioner to consider the whole or grant applications as a whole or in part, that the entire part of our application, the entirety of our application is for a certificate for 20 years. 
    And that the Commission here denied such an -- such a certificate and instead gave us one of indefinite duration. 
    We go on and say further that Section 7 (b) is inapplicable here. 
    We have undertaken in our -- we are -- we will provide service for 20 years and we -- we concede that Section 7 (b) does apply if we wanted this service short of 20 years. 
    But at the end of the 20 years, that is the term of which we have applied for and we are -- that's our -- our understanding is we could terminate service.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do you say that if you were granted a certificate for 20 years, nothing is said about expiration, but that by a force of the limitation of 20 years, you could quit at the end of 20 years and not require and it would not entail an abandonment proceeding under 7?

    Mr. Melvin Richter 
    That's right, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2176.422" stopTime="2186.528">

    Because you say that 7, that are not made, make it a continuous duty once you've begun to go on until you get permission to stop.

    Mr. Melvin Richter 
    That's right. 
    That 7 (b), it's -- well, actually, a much more limited provision than Mr. Wahrenbrock would make it out to be. 
    In this connection, I would --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2194.918" stopTime="2198.066">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2198.748" stopTime="2217.234">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Suppose he is right that 7 (b) means that you can't quit, except by leave of the Commission. 
    Suppose it means that. 
    Then it might make a difference whether the certificate is granted, allowing quitting at the expiration of 20 years or not allowing quitting, wouldn't it?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But after 20 years, you disagree with the construction of 7 (b) by the Commission. 
    That 7 (b) disallows abandonment by certificate holder at any time no matter what period, definite or indefinite, he's operating under, without leave of the Commission. 
    You contest that reading of 7 (b).
speaker="melvin_richter" startTime="2264.611" stopTime="2319.981">
    Mr. Melvin Richter 
    Well, we say Section 7 (b) is not applicable here at all. 
    We don't -- we're not asking for advanced authorization, as Mr. Wahrenbrock would have here to suggest, to discontinue service at the end of 20 years. 
    We are here under Section 7 (e) of the Act. 
    And Section -- well, that's the certificate provision, not 7 (b). 
    7 (b), the Commission -- I may quote from an earlier Sunray case with the Commission's own language, “Although Section 7 (b) precludes abandonment of service rendered by facility subject to the Commission's jurisdiction without compliance to procedures, they have set out.” 
    There is nothing in that Section or its legislative history or in Section 7 (e) or 7 (c) or 7 (e) or their legislative history, to require a ruling that Section 7 (b), in anyway, restricts the power of the Commission under Section 7 (e) and 7 (c) to issue certificates of limited duration.

speaker="melvin_richter" startTime="2349.436" stopTime="2411.869">
    Mr. Melvin Richter 
    Well, sir, may I go into the history of this -- that case just for a moment? 
    In that case, the -- that was the first Sunray case in which the Commission -- Sunray signed a certificate of limited duration. 
    The Commission in that case held flatly that they had no authority to issue a certificate of unlimited -- of -- of limited duration. 
    They said 7 (b) precluded them from doing it.Sunray took them to the Tenth Circuit and demonstrated, beyond any doubt, that the Commission had in the past been issuing certificates of limited duration. 
    The various cases they now cite to the Court has demonstrating a consistently practice on the matter. 
    The Tenth Circuit went ahead and held that the Commission does have authority to issue certificates of limited duration and then affirmed the Commission's order on other grounds. 
    Sunray applied for certiorari and the document I just read from is a memorandum, submitted by the Solicitor General, acquiescing in reversal of the -- of this Tenth Circuit's opinion.

    Mr. Melvin Richter

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    And what if the Commission is saying in effect, as I understand it, is that in order to keep you in the business under Section 7 (b), they must give you an unlimited certificate so that they can prevent your getting out of the business --
speaker="melvin_richter" startTime="2438.584" stopTime="2439.398">
    Mr. Melvin Richter 
    Yes, and they --

    -- at any time in the future?
speaker="melvin_richter" startTime="2440.589" stopTime="2570.592">
    Mr. Melvin Richter 
    And a time that Mr. Wahrenbrock has just painted a -- a very black picture about the discoveries of gas and how at the end of the 20 years, that we are free to discontinue. 
    There'll be -- there'll be all sorts of people without gas and how bad it'll be on the consumers. 
    Yet at the same time, yet at the same time, as recently as last August, August 10, 1959, in the Transwestern Pipeline Company case, the Commission authorized the construction and operation of $192,000,000 project, $192,000,000 project whether the reserves at the -- the pipeline could show it only for 13 years. 
    And yet, they're complaining here when we're willing to commit ourselves for 20 years. 
    In another case, in the Truck Line case, issued -- an opinion issued on May 22nd, 1959. 
    The Commission granted a certificate for an $80,000,000 project with the -- the reserves that they could show was a maximum of 13 years and a minimum of 11 and a half years. 
    And that's not -- I -- those aren't isolated instances. 
    On pages 26 and 27 of our brief, we have others, with the Commission and pipeline cases. 
    Although they're complaining, they're crying here how gas is getting scarcer and how they needed an indefinite commitment from us and a 20-year commitment is not enough. 
    They're issuing in pipeline cases, certificates where the gas supply is shown. 
    And there's no obligation on the pipeline to get more gas. 
    That's a voluntary matter so far as the pipeline is concerned. 
    Well, they're issuing certificates where the gas reserves at 10, 12 years of duration. 
    Thank you very much, sir.
