    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I would like to reiterate that it is the position of the respondent that there is no right in the employee and no right in the Administrator under this statute or under the common law that justifies, legally, damages for discharge. 
    I would like to be emphatic about this point, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that there is no common law right to damages or in an employee for mere discharge where -- where those damages arise is when a contract is breached, a contract of employment but a mere day-to-day employment. 
    Being discharged from that would not give a cause of action because the employer has a -- an inherent right to discharge any employee in the absence of contract.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Is it then (Inaudible) however, they couldn't state under this law that one may not be (Inaudible) discharge for causes which the law prevents (Inaudible) and that thus to discharge his employment that his rights and action to condemn may be redressed for him?
speaker="r_lamar_moore" startTime="100.333" stopTime="161.602">
    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    Under the common law, I do not think there is any such right. 
    The case that is cited, which is a Georgia Case, involved a discharge of a railroad employee where they actually went out and accused him of not doing his work properly. 
    As a matter of fact, he sued for slander and sued for damages for wages for having been discharged. 
    The Court stated that regardless of the reason, for any reason that was in the employer's mind they could discharge that employee. 
    Now, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, while it is made unlawful to discriminate against an employee for the reason stated in this Act, there is no right given to the employee to any damages because of the breach of that legal duty to the public.

    -- is that your position?
speaker="r_lamar_moore" startTime="254.991" stopTime="416.749">
    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    I believe that's correct, Your Honor. 
    The cases -- basic cases relied upon, there are two cases, I have cited one and the -- the Secretary has cited one. 
    The case that they cite which is cited and approved by the case of Porter against Warner involving the Emergency Price Control Act, that case is clocked against Smith which is an old case involving the title to land in Kentucky and Tennessee. 
    The question there was whether or not a federal court, acting in equity, could grant a remedy which was provided for in -- under state law. 
    The courts -- the court found that the title to the land actually was in the plaintiff, but the Circuit Court divided as to whether or not the court, acting in equity, could grant the relief required by the State statute and the Supreme Court, this Court, held that equity could enforce that right. 
    The man was entitled to have the junior -- the junior deeds or junior patents to the land granted by the State, delivered into court and cancelled. 
    Now, that is a right upon which equity could act, but where no right exists now as in the case of Peter against Hargrave, an old Virginia case, pre-civil war case, where some slaves sued for their freedom under the will of one Hargrave and acquired their freedom by virtue of that will. 
    They sue -- they asked for an additional decree for the mean profits of their labor in the interim from the time that the will was probated until they were released by the Administrator, who had been procrastinating and vacillating and delaying the matter, and they asked for the profits of their labor. 
    The Court held that there was no legal right to the profits of that labor and consequently, equity in mandatorily giving them their freedom, could not grant damages. 
    Now, those two cases are old cases, but they are the cases or -- or a type of case, which point out the distinction where equity acts on legal rights, follows the law and does not go out and make new writs and grant extraordinary -- well, it grants extraordinary relief, but it does not grant new relief which has not heretofore been sanctioned at common law or under a statute.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="416.749" stopTime="464.038">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I haven't any doubt -- I haven't any doubt, but you can find though that many of the cases wouldn't be true that instead of remitting the -- the equity remitting the plaintiff, the law in order to -- to avoid and acquire his damages, money damages, that they're greeted all up in one -- one proceeding. 
    But the fact that in those -- that there are cases in which the money damages could, by an undetermined cause of action, draws in law, I do not think it establishes as such that if carrying out that for which the extraordinary remedies because in all that's said and done, equity is still is an extraordinary remedy --

    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="464.284" stopTime="502.402">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- except for a statute looks otherwise, to question one's exercise. 
    Well, equity puts the affirmative or coercive power of the State behind the cessation of evil conduct or compelling good conduct, and there are collateral damages in society that we can also say what you must make good, that monetary damage we do not have to sit in exaggeration to (Inaudible) or substantively determine whether you could bring a cause of action for money damages on the law outside of the court.
speaker="r_lamar_moore" startTime="502.402" stopTime="544.112">
    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    The respondent disagrees with that position, Your Honor, in this that the fact that there may have been a loss, does not necessarily give rise to damages and where there is a vindication of the public policy and no statutory basis for a granting of damages of that sort, equity now, acting as equity, does not step in with punitive measures of that sort. 
    It -- it does not go to vindicate public policy in -- in -- by -- by way of righting, say, a private wrong, where no remedy exist for that wrong.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="544.112" stopTime="563.802">

    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    I think you're correct but -- but I think where -- where equity acts, for example, if -- if add them up a stream and affect your riparian rights and your cattle pairs to them, you can come in to equity and enjoin me from blocking the water and at the same time, because equity takes charge and gives complete relief, you can get damages for the tort done to you by interference with your right, but you do have a riparian right. 
    Here, the employee has no right because of discharge, discriminatory or otherwise.

    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    Under the statute here? 
    Well, this statute, of course, changed the common law to -- to this extent in regard to discharge. 
    First of all, it created a right in an employee to receive a certain minimum wage, which he did not previously have so that was created and different from the common law right which -- which only gave him what he contracted to receive. 
    Now, in -- in doing so, this statute is somewhat self-contained, in -- in doing so, it provided further that if, in enforcing this right to minimum wages, this employee is discriminated against for that reason, then the Court can come in and enjoin the -- the discrimination and the -- the employee can sue on his own behalf or the Secretary with his written permission for him can sue for the unpaid minimum and overtime wages. 
    But, there is no provision in the Act. 
    It doesn't go that far to create a right to damages for having been discharged, it stopped short of that.

    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    I -- I don't believe the statute says exactly that. 
    Now, it -- of course, the Court may interpret it to say that, but the Court says in -- I mean the statute says in effect, “Thou shalt not discriminatorily discharge.” 
    It doesn't say that the employee has a right to any wages for -- or -- or damages for discriminatory discharge and it -- and it --

    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    Sir, I -- I do not -- oh, I -- I think that the Court in -- in the statute in going further and saying to the Court, “You can restrain this discrimination, this violation,” gives him the right, perhaps, to be put back to work under a mandatory injunction which the federal court is entitled to issue. 
    But I don't think that it means that the Court can go further and grant him any other right than that because it spells no right in him, it's a prohibition against the employee, I mean the employer, rather than a right granted to the employee. 
    Now, there are rights granted to the employee, and they are specifically spelled out in the Act, and they are -- that he can get certain minimal overtime that he has worked for and has not been paid, but the statute just stopped short of creating this right.

    Now, it is my position though that this Act is limited in its scope and the fact that it -- it maybe unlawful as against the employer who maybe criminally prosecuted for violation of the provision of the law just as I may be criminally prosecuted for speeding on the highway that that does not create any right, contractual, legal or otherwise, to any damages in that employee because the Court -- I mean the -- the statute does not contain that right and the only remedy provided for discriminatory discharge is that the courts can restrain violations of this Act and of the four or five things that the Act prohibits.

    I think that the statute must be construed in the light of its -- of course, its legislative history the -- the language particularly, the language used in it and particularly the omissions of language. 
    The Labor Department depends a great deal on the National Labor Relations Act and brings in the -- the power of the board to take affirmative action to effectuate the policies of the Act. 
    Now, that language is not -- is not found in the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
    And there is -- there is in the National Labor Relations Act as an illustrative as -- as an -- an example illustrating the affirmative action they can take. 
    That they can reinstate with back wages. 
    Now, unless Congress had thought that that was a departure from the normal accepted law, that illustrative example probably would not have been inserted in that Act to take affirmative action including the reinstatement with back pay as will effectuate the policies of this Act.

    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    Now, the Phelps Dodge case held that under but -- that language and coupling that with the definition of the word “employee” who did not have to be the employer's employee, the one involved -- the employer involved here, and coupled also with the interpretation of the word “ha”, discrimination in regard to “ha”, they held that they had to instate employees who were refused employment because of union activity. 
    And there is ample basis in that statute for that holding without going into and gleaning out of the general statement of policy the right to do that. 
    Now, the -- the -- these two acts compared will show that the National Labor Relations Act deals with a much more elusive subject matter, a much -- a subject matter of much broader scope and more complicated as evidenced by the fact that the board was created to handle and administer this Act, whereas here, the matter is comparatively simple, and it's not as complicated of administration as the National Labor Relations Act. 
    The Fair Labor Standards Act was passed after the National Labor Relations Act. 
    And significantly, the language to take affirmative action including reinstatement with back pay was not used in the Fair Labor Standards Act.

    And I feel fairly confident that that language was employed in the beginning of the Wagner Act.

    Do you think the 1945 amendment bears on your position?

    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    Well, I think this, Your Honor. 
    I think that can be construed. 
    That proviso which says that in and in proceeding by the administrative foreign injunction to restrain violations that the Court shall not have jurisdiction to grant unpaid minimum and overtime wages and liquidated damages, I think that this back pay, if there is any right to such back pay, which would be damages for discharge, if that exists and of course, that would be computed on the basis of the minimum wage, that that could very well be included within that proviso. 
    However, I believe that perhaps the best argument for interpreting that particular proviso is the legislative history wherein the Conference Committee said that this proviso will have the effect of reversing such cases as McComb versus Scerbo, which was based directly on the O'Grady case, which is the case opposite to the one that is now under review. 
    And I think that that legislative history had in it also that this Court --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    A criminal case did not involve a discrimination case?
speaker="r_lamar_moore" startTime="1385.034" stopTime="1460.123">
    Mr. R. Lamar Moore 
    No, the -- the Scerbo case involved an injunction wherein the unpaid minimum and overtime actually worked for was granted. 
    But the proviso split that apart and wouldn't let them do it. 
    It shows a policy of Congress not to let this -- this restitution and the injunction go together. 
    I see my time is limited. 
    I would like to -- I would like to say that an analysis of the cases, the -- the -- under the Railroad Act, the -- the National Labor Relations Act and under the Emergency Price Control Act show that in -- and -- in each instance, where equity goes and grants some sort of damages or takes extraordinary relief or disestablishes a -- a bargaining representative, that it is based upon some right which was created in that statute or existed at common law. 
    And it is our position in this case that the Fair Labor Standards Act includes all of the sanctions, criminal and civil, in specific language and that the -- a court of equity does not have ancillary power to go beyond the words of this statute and the common law in granting a relief. 
    We respectfully submit that the decision of the Circuit Court should be affirmed.

   Argument of Bessie Margolin

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Ms. Margolin.
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="1605.323" stopTime="1732.936">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    May it please the Court. 
    I think that the emphasis on the individual rights of the employees may have been overdone. 
    We're not concerned here merely or even particularly with the reimbursement of specific employee. 
    We're concerned with the public interest in the sharing employees that they will not suffer financial economic loss if they cooperate in the enforcement of this Act. 
    That the Act depends necessarily on their cooperation and that if employees learn or think, if they will, if the decision below remains enforced that they cannot be protected from loss of wages for an indefinite period. 
    That they cannot be protected and get redress for that, they are certainly not going to have much assurance under Section 15 (a) (3) that they are free to come in and complain or to file claims. 
    And it's -- it just become -- well, become apparent to him that that's -- protection, and I can assure you that our investigators refer to that when they -- when they are interviewed, and we take their complaints. 
    That they will -- they will be protected against discrimination and against loss. 
    Well, if they are not given redress for their wage losses, then that protection is just illusory because it's commonplace knowledge that an employee is just as much intimidated and deterred from cooperating with enforcement officers by the fact that he may lose his wages for an indefinite period, as he is by the fact that he may permanently lose his job. 
    And the thing that -- the public interest here is quite something -- quite apart from the private right of the employees. 
    We're interested in the reimbursement of the individual employees because it means that that is the only way the public interest can be protected.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Can I completely disregard inquiring to whether or not the employees have independent common law rights?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="1741.039" stopTime="1809.724">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    I think you can completely disregard that. 
    I think it has nothing to do with what we're concerned with here. 
    We're -- the -- the statute -- this Court has had frequent occasion to comment on the intimidatory influence inherent in the employment relationship, particularly for the low wage employees with which this Act is -- is primarily concerned. 
    And what Congress was obviously interested in, in enacting this 15 (a) (3), was to give the employee some assurance that they were not going to suffer economic loss by making their claims under this Act. 
    That they were not to -- they were not to submit to substandard labor conditions in fear of losing their job and in losing their pay. 
    And the loss of their pay is obviously just as serious to them as the loss of their job. 
    To reinstate them without redress for the wages they've lost, is to just thwart the whole purpose of this Section 15 (a) (3) provision. 
    It did --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1809.724" stopTime="1817.447">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is this 15 (a) (3) provision a -- do you find it in the statute or you find it in another statute (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="1817.447" stopTime="1837.278">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    It's comparable to the discrimination provisions of the Labor Board Act. 
    And it -- and under that Act, the courts have always recognized that reimbursement for loss of wages was -- was the -- the normal method of -- of enforcing that provision. 
    Now, with respect to the labors law --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1837.278" stopTime="1839.780">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the statute in -- that statute is very explicit, isn't it?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="1839.780" stopTime="1923.438">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Yes, well, I was going to come to that, that statute is explicit of course. 
    But the decisions under it and in particular, the Phelps Dodge decision says specifically -- explicitly that that remedy would exist even if there were no congressional mandate. 
    And Porter v. Warner under the Price Control Act says that. 
    And the fact that it would exist, I think, is demonstrated by the antitrust cases where the language is -- virtually the same, as to prevent and restrain violation. 
    And this Court significantly has used virtually the same language in describing the authority under the antitrust cases as it has under the Labor Board cases. 
    Now, we think the -- the reason for the specificity in the National Labor Relations Act is because there, you have enforcement by a board created by statute with only the right that the Congress gives them, whereas, under our statute, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the antitrust law, you -- Congress has put the enforcement in the hands of courts of equity, who already possessed these powers. 
    And the cases under Railway Labor Act, the Court -- this Court and -- and other courts have recognized that even without a provision to restrain violations, back pay could be awarded for violation of the policies --

    The wages, so far as the minimum wages and overtime are concerned, that can be easily calculated and to give each employee a right, it can -- they can sue for it more easily.

speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="2013.489" stopTime="2088.719">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    May I -- I'll just add one other point about the criminal sanctions. 
    The -- of -- of course, there are criminal sanctions for this as well. 
    But there was also the injunctive remedy, and I think there is a good reason for making both available there. 
    If criminal sanction is not adequate to assure an employee that he's going to be protected if he talks to the Government because it -- it -- the fact that the State may collect the fine from their employer is -- is not going to give them any assurance that they're protected or -- or believe them of the intimadory effect of -- of losing their wages. 
    The -- the fine in this case so far -- other violations didn't deter the employer here from firing them. 
    And the employees coming back without redress for their lost wages and all the other employees seeing them was obvious to them what -- what's going to happen if they, in the future, decide to assert their claims, only the most courageous, if not full hearty employee after learning that, is gong to take advantage of his -- of Section 15 (a) (3).
