Thompson v. City of Louisville
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="8.351">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- versus City of Louisville, et al. 
    Mr. Frick, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="herman_e_frick" startTime="8.351" stopTime="210.156">
    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    May it please the Court. 
    I'd like to propose my remarks here with the idea that in a situation of this kind where you have a dispute between an individual and organized society, sympathy is always for the underdog, the individual. 
    But there's a lot to be said for society, too. 
    After all, organized society has the duty of preserving order. 
    As a matter of fact, that was one of the purposes of constitutional government under the Constitution of the United States to ensure domestic tranquility. 
    And of course, one of the ways of preserving order for all of its citizens is through these offenses and ordinances and statutes relating to loitering, disorderly conduct, vagrancy and minor offenses of that sort. 
    They are designed to control society to -- to prevent individuals from congregating and as a result of idle minds stirring up crimes, which maybe of a serious nature and thereby injure society and all of the organized group as a whole. 
    Now, with that theory in mind with which I am approaching this case, I'd like to get to this point. 
    First of all, it seems to me that this case has been complicated by a certain number of irrelevancies, immaterialities and some speculation. 
    And I'd like to enumerate what I consider some of those chief irrelevances. 
    First of all, we have before this Court, a petition to review the proceedings of a single day, that is, the trial of February the 3rd, 1959, in the Louisville Police Court. 
    The Court will have observed both from the briefs and from the argument that there's been a great deal to say about certain proceedings which happened in the Louisville Police Court on January the 20th. 
    Now, they may have wondered, as did for some time when I first got into this case, how that happened to get into the record. 
    In the proceedings of February the 3rd, an agreement was made at page 35 of the record to stipulate the testimony of Dr. Dean. 
    That was page 34 of the record, I'm sorry, which was given at the trial of January the 20th. 
    Now, when this stipulation was entered and it was agreed to by the prosecutor, Mr. Dougherty and by the attorney for the petitioner, it was then filed and since that testimony was included with the testimony of all the proceedings of January the 20th, the entire record was filed. 
    Now, properly therefore, before this Court, there is not the proceedings of January the 20th as such, but only the stipulated testimony of Dr. Dean. 
    So therefore, after we reach the first 35 pages in the record and the stipulated testimony of Dr. Dean, the remainder is surplusage. 
    Now --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Was there a contention made in the proceeding that we're reviewing that this was simply a course of conduct of harassment against this man?
speaker="herman_e_frick" startTime="223.779" stopTime="238.300">
    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    Yes, sir. 
    That was to this extent, an avowal was tendered in which -- prepared by Mr. Lusky on behalf of his client that if he would be allowed to testify, he would testify as follows. 
    That appears, I think --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="238.300" stopTime="239.478">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    That's that avow?
speaker="herman_e_frick" startTime="239.478" stopTime="254.422">
    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    That's that avow, yes, sir. 
    That of course, was not allowed because in the feeling of the trial judge, that was irrelevant. 
    That -- the issue he had before him was the offense which was charged on February the 3rd.

speaker="herman_e_frick" startTime="659.776" stopTime="827.138">
    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    -- slight difference of evidence and of course, in all these cases for a police court where there are these minor offenses, not a great deal of evidence is adduced. 
    But briefly, this is what happened. 
    On this particular occasion, there were two police officers Officer Lacefield and Officer Barnett. 
    They went into this tavern and barroom known as the Liberty Inn Café. 
    Under the law of the City of Louisville, by ordinance, a condition is made before the issuance of any license for the sale of alcoholic beverages that it may be entered at any time by a police officer to observe whether or not orderly conduct is being carried on, on the premises. 
    So, pursuant to that ordinance and as a routine check, these two individuals went into the Liberty Inn Café. 
    When they arrived in the Liberty Inn Café, one officer testified, the only one who testified, they went up to the manager of the premises and asked him what that fellow was doing, pointing to Sam Thompson. 
    And they asked him whether or not, he had bought anything to eat or drink while he had been there. 
    The manager told them that he had bought nothing to eat, nor drink and that he had been there about 30 or 35 minutes. 
    At this time, the officer testified, “Sam Thompson was standing in the center of the floor dancing by himself, neither eating nor drinking, but merely dancing.” 
    And Officer Lacefield -- incidentally, Mr. Harlan, the officer who arrested the individual was Mr. Lacefield who did not know at the time of the arrest, anything about the previous trouble that Sam Thompson has been in. 
    The other officer, Mr. Barnett, told the manager that he knew of some trouble that he had been in at the bus station before. 
    Now, Officer Lacefield, in arresting this fellow, asked him what he was doing on the premises. 
    Now, instead of saying that he was there to eat or drink anything, Mr. Thompson said that he was waiting for a bus. 
    As the officer testified, the Liberty Inn Café faces on Liberty Street, which is a one-way street going west. 
    If Mr. Thompson wishes to catch a bus, he must go out of that building, go down the street and down to the corner and catch a bus going east. 
    So, on that basis, apparently, Officer Lacefield felt that there was not a satisfactory account given by Thompson and thereupon, arrested him.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Is it a violation of the ordinance of Louisville for an old colored man to go into a bar and to be guilty of loitering and disorderly conduct simply because he taps his foot to music on a barroom floor as he waits for a bus on a cold winter night?

    Mr. Herman E. Frick

    No, sir. 
    Shuffling is not illegal in Louisville. 
    What is illegal, if it may please the Court, is dancing in the premises licensed to sell liquor. 
    Now, that does not mean that the person who dances is committing a crime, but merely that the holder of the license is forbidden to permit dancing on his premises. 
    In other words, a license holder is the one who violates that particular --

    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    All right. 
    Now, let me make this point. 
    Your Honor, I'm telling you what Officer Lacefield said at the time when he testified as to the arrest. 
    On this question, he said, “I walked over and asked the bartender if he had bought anything in there and how long he had been there and he told us that he had been there a little over a half hour and that he had not bought anything.” 
    All right, now, that's what --

    You do know this question, “You do know this fellow, Thompson, had been there for half an hour and had not eaten anything?” 
    Answer, “I didn't see him eat anything.” 
    Question, “If he had had anything to eat or to drink, you would have known about it.” 
    Answer, “It seems like I would.” 
    Question, “Because you were there all the time?” 
    Answer, “Yes.” 
    Now later on, what Your Honor is referring to, at the bottom of the page, “But you never saw him buy anything.” 
    Answer, “No. 
    That don't mean he didn't buy anything. 
    He was standing out there on the floor.” 
    That is the part to which Your Honor is referring to.

    And if I didn't do that, I apologize to the Court.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I ask you -- may I ask you this question. 
    Assume that one takes your view of the evidence just as you present it, as you stated. 
    What I would like to have your views on this is whether, under Kentucky law -- Louisville ordinance law, finding a man in the saloon who shuffles, one doesn't know whether he's done it out of exuberance for 2 minutes or for 20 minutes and assume further that he hasn't bought any drink or a sandwich, does that constitute loitering or vagrancy under Louisville ordinance law?A 
    nd if it does, if that's all the evidence established there, is that consonant with the Fourteenth Amendment? 
    The two questions I'd like you to answer.

    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    Well, I think, briefly and this particular case has demonstrated. 
    It was so held to constitute loitering under the ordinance. 
    The ordinance provided --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is finding a man in a saloon who happens to shuffle his feet with -- and hasn't bought a drink yet, that constitutes loitering and vagrancy?

    The background you give I can't accept, namely, that all loitering statutes and all vagrancy statutes are constitutional.

    Suppose he was in a department store and was shuffling alone in a department store and haven't purchased anything for half hour.

    If those women are in there for the business purpose of the store, namely, to shop or to -- or to apprise themselves the prices for the object of future purposes, that would be a different situation.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you say that this evidence shows that -- that this man, no matter how long he might live, had no intention ever of buying anything in this store because of the evidence you have here?

speaker="herman_e_frick" startTime="1640.388" stopTime="1666.422">
    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    Well, what I'm saying is this. 
    That it's a concept that -- that a business operator invites the public for his business purpose. 
    Now, the business purpose of this barroom was to sell food and to sell drink. 
    The business purpose is not to provide a place to wait for a bus, nor is it, quite clearly, a place where one may dance.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1666.422" stopTime="1686.981">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Isn't the purpose of a place -- of a place of business what the operator of it considers it to be? 
    And if he considers a man was properly there, if he wasn't doing anything that was specifically unlawful, isn't he there lawfully?

speaker="herman_e_frick" startTime="1715.921" stopTime="1741.265">
    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    Well, Your Honor, I have expressed my opinion, namely, that the implied indication was only for the purpose of the business. 
    Now, the fact that there are a crowd of people there and there was no objection by the proprietor or the operator of the premises, I think is evidence which should be considered.

    Not to please me, but if the law warrants you.
speaker="herman_e_frick" startTime="2224.203" stopTime="2314.047">
    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    Here's a situation. 
    In this particular case, there was a writ of habeas corpus applied for to our Circuit Court to stay the execution of the sentence of this police court pending its review by this Court. 
    It was issued by the Circuit Court. 
    The City of Louisville objected on the ground that there is no such jurisdiction under our law. 
    It was appealed to the Court of Appeals. 
    Now, this is a collateral proceeding on habeas corpus and on this collateral proceeding, the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit judge on a habeas question -- habeas corpus question, saying that it alone had jurisdiction under Section 110 and said further, recognizing this fact that in a $5 or $10 appeal as such, there was no review and therefore, the only remedy was to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
    They say further, they -- by dicta, they set out this other idea that if there is a great and irreparable injury, this Court will take jurisdiction. 
    They also recite that this was an extreme case. 
    Now, I believe that -- without speculating, what a court would have done. 
    That in this collateral proceeding, if they felt that that was sufficient under Section 110 to take jurisdiction and on their own motion, order a stay of proceedings in the Louisville Police Court so that they might go to this Court. 
    That that court likewise, if they consider this case as important, would have the authority when the principal case and on the merits, comes before to taking grant relief. 
    Now, that is my position, but the Court of Appeals was never given an opportunity --

    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    I don't remember exactly where. 
    I'd like to make just one more point. 
    Now, as far as the Kentucky Court of Appeals is concerned, this is direct from the Louisville Police Court to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
    The Court of Appeals of Kentucky has not been asked to grant relief to this petitioner on any violations of constitutional rights. 
    Now, he has constitutional rights both under the Federal Constitution and under our State Constitution. 
    They had never been asked to do that, so, I don't see how that you can complain about the Kentucky Court of Appeals when they have not had an opportunity to pass on the merits of this question, but only on the collateral point which they considered important enough to grant relief on their own motion.

    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    I don't know what you can say unless the question is presented to a court. 
    Bear in mind, this is a collateral proceeding. 
    Under Section 110, the Kentucky Court of Appeals grants relief on its own motion. 
    They grant a stay of proceedings without being asked for to the petitioner. 
    Now, if they have that authority and deem it important enough in a collateral manner, they certainly have authority in the principal matter to consider it important enough.

    Now, they have said that in a case where there is a simple fine of $5 or $10, they will not grant relief under Section 110.

    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    Your Honor, in this Walters versus Fowler, I'd like to be fair about this. 
    In Walters versus Fowler, there was a $5 fine, I believe, and a question as to the constitutionality of the imposition of the fine. 
    And the Court of Appeals, under Section 110, refused to take jurisdiction on the ground that this was just a minor fine and there was no showing of great and irreparable injury.

    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    I don't attempt to forecast what the Court would do. 
    What I am saying is that here is a case -- this very case itself on collateral proceedings where they did entertain jurisdiction under Section 110 voluntarily. 
    Now, if an application will be made on the merits, would the facts in this particular case be different from the facts -- sufficiently different from the facts in Walters versus Fowler, that they would take jurisdiction? 
    That is the question.

    Yes.

    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    The reason for that is this. 
    I -- the other arrests are not material. 
    There is no point in cluttering up the record with that. 
    The arrests in the year preceding are admissible because, under our alcoholic beverage statute, it is illegal for the holder of an alcoholic beverage license to sell liquor to someone who has been convicted three times in the previous year, three times or more of drunkenness in a public place. 
    That's what DPP is.

    Mr. Herman E. Frick 
    Not as such. 
    The -- the criminal record of this man of 54 arrests was shown to the police court and the judge, at page 31, said, “Let the record show that the prosecutor showed me this record.” 
    The basis is not important. 
    It's just to show that there was some jeopardy of the license holder if he would want to sell beer to Mr. Thompson who claimed that he bought a bottle of beer on the premises.

    Mr. Louis Lusky 
    If the Court please, I -- I am going to do my best to confine myself the 10 minutes that's been allowed. 
    I -- I have taken note that some indulgence had been granted to opposing counsel. 
    And if I run over a little bit, I -- I hope I may be forgive, particularly since this basic question of jurisdiction has been raised. 
    Now, I think it's quite important to understand exactly what the Court of Appeals said. 
    This Court has a pretty clear conception of it now, as these questions have indicated. 
    The situation in the Kentucky Court of Appeals is that -- that substantive relief will not be granted under the power established by Section 110 of the constitution, even though a federal constitutional claim, a due process claim is made, if the sentence is too small for appeal. 
    This appears in a series of cases which is cited in our brief, (Inaudible) is the latest I think, Walters against Fowler, Thompson against Wood 
    .And Walters against Fowler, which is the case where the point is most fully discussed, as it happens, does not specifically refer in the Court's opinion to Section 110. 
    So, you can't tell from reading the Court's opinion that it's a Section 110 case, although it is the only source of jurisdiction. 
    Now, in order to -- I thought this might puzzle the Court when the time came to read the opinion and in -- in the Walters case. 
    And therefore, in order to eliminate any doubt on that score, I have obtained from the clerk of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, under the seal of that court, a certified copy of the petition for relief in Walters against Fowler, which shows that relief was sought under Section 110 of the constitution. 
    This is a little technical question that could come up and if there is no objection, I'd like to file it in the case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3424.673" stopTime="3426.666">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No objection.
speaker="louis_lusky" startTime="3426.666" stopTime="3772.832">
    Mr. Louis Lusky 
    The -- now, here is exactly the -- what the Court of Appeals said, we had -- for the reasons which I explained yesterday. 
    We were under the necessity of keeping the petitioner out of jail for -- until we could get certiorari ruled on in this Court so that the case wouldn't become moot. 
    We thought that the proper -- proper remedy - remedy was habeas corpus in Circuit Court, which does have power to fix bail where it's required by law and we -- and the circuit judge agreed with us and granted it. 
    The city took an appeal from that to the Court of Appeals. 
    The city and the Court of Appeals argued that there was no way we could get a review at all, there or any place else and that therefore, it was -- it would be a futile thing to grant a stay. 
    That excerpts -- pertinent excerpts from their brief in that Court are cited in our -- in our brief and in our petition for -- reply brief on the petition for certiorari, the Court of Appeals held, in a 4-to-3 opinion that it would not depart from the rule of Walters against Fowler as far as substantive relief was concerned. 
    They did, however, agree the four-man majority -- the four-judge majority did agree that we had a federal right to an opportunity for a federal hearing on our federal claim and that they -- they could, without inconsistency with Walters against Fowler, open the way for the presentation of that claim to this Court, even though they were -- they considered themselves bound by their previous decision, not to entertain our claim on the merits. 
    Now, the proof of that -- the proof of that has already been suggested in questions that have been asked and it's -- and it's -- it's very obvious. 
    The Court was -- was indulgent with this procedure. 
    They said, “If we wanted to -- to cut this thing square, what we would do would be to reverse this case because Judge Lawrence Grauman in the Circuit Court had no power to grant the relief that he's granted. 
    And you then could come in with an application for similar relief in this Court and we would grant it. 
    We know we'd grant it because we've had a full hearing on the case, oral argument even, which is very rare in that court. 
    And so, rather -- rather than make you go to all the trouble and expense of starting over, we're going to grant this on our own motion. 
    Now, it is perfectly clear that if they had thought that relief could be granted on the merits, they -- in that court, they would have done one or two -- of two things. 
    Either they would have granted a stay long enough for us to apply in that court, or they would have granted complete relief which they could have done because they had the full record before them, including the evidence. 
    Now, the opinion of the court shows on its face that they had every -- everything except the transcript of the evidence. 
    And since that doesn't show, I have obtained from the Court of Appeals, a certificate, again, under the seal of the Court, certifying which was the fact that the evidence -- that the same evidence which is printed in the -- in the record here. 
    The transcripts of the two trials were filed with the Kentucky Court of Appeals in that case. 
    So, they had the same record which you have. 
    They showed that they do not consider themselves embarrassed by the failure to ask for the particular relief which they thought was proper. 
    And they went just as far as they could go under the Kentucky precedence to grant us relief which was simply to open the door into this Court. 
    Now, three judges of the court said Walters against Fowler precludes us from betting relief. 
    Everybody agrees to that and it's -- it's ridiculous to suggest that the Supreme Court would take its time with the case like this. 
    So, they dissented on the ground that the stay that was being granted would be futile, but the whole court agreed that there was no basis for substantive relief and the -- the -- if you -- if you read the -- the -- another passage of the Court. 
    If you -- if you will look at page 38 and the petition for certiorari in the appendix of that petition, this is what Judge Porter Sims says. 
    First complete paragraph, “Appellee appears to have a real question as to whether he has been denied due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, yet, this substantive right cannot be tested unless we grant him a stay of execution because his fines are not appealable and will be satisfied by being served in jail before he can prepare and file his petition for certiorari.” 
    And then, they go on and, on the next page, they distinguished that Walters case not on the ground that the -- that Walters was being kicked around anymore than Thompson was being kicked around. 
    But, on the ground that Thompson wanted to go to a different court than Walters, was trying to get into. 
    It is only in an extreme case, in other words, as he says, it is only in extreme cases like the one at bar, where a person wants to go to the Supreme Court that we will interfere.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Now, is there any case where the Kentucky Court has granted direct review?
speaker="louis_lusky" startTime="3811.797" stopTime="4020.864">
    Mr. Louis Lusky 
    To my knowledge, sir, there is no case where the Kentucky Court of Appeals has granted substantive relief from a sentence too small for appeal. 
    And -- and it -- it -- in this -- in this very case, they've -- they've specifically said they won't do it. 
    Now, there're are a couple more points, if I -- I may, I know my 10 minutes is nearly up, but I'd just like to run quickly through a few points which are of some importance. 
    First of all, it must be borne in mind that what -- that this alternative state remedy which, as has been suggested, is a collateral attack. 
    Now, this Court has held in the case of Largent against Texas in 318 U.S. 418, that as long as you've taken the criminal case as high as it will go on direct appeal, you are not required to exhaust extraordinary remedies set up under the state law in order to perfect the jurisdiction of this Court. 
    Now, it's possible that -- that the existence of such remedies might have a bearing on the -- this Court's willingness to exercise this jurisdiction by granting certiorari. 
    But that case says that -- that jurisdiction exist when you have taken your case to the highest state court in which a -- in which a decision can be held. 
    Now, the second thing I would like to say is a question was raised by Mr. Frick as to how the -- the January 20th transcript got into this February 3rd trial. 
    And he suggested it only got in partway because it was offered to show Dr. Dean's testimony. 
    The fact is that he has overlooked that it -- that it came in two ways. 
    It came in with connection with the avow and on -- at the -- at the top of page 70, you will see that in the avow, that this transcript was tendered for all purpose. 
    That a trial on said charges was held in Louisville Police Court on that date, January 20th at which no evidence was introduced to support the charges as evidenced by the transcript of evidence authenticated by the certificate of James Giovanni (ph) official stenographer of said police court. 
    The counterpart original copy of which transcript has attest hereto and tendered in evidence herewith, so that that whole transcript is a proper part of this record. 
    Now -- and incidentally, since the court rejected proof of harassment by the police, holding that it was legally immaterial, it must be assumed as a matter of law on this record that such harassment did exist. 
    I think that is the effect of an -- of a rejected offer of proof the -- for the -- for -- that this Court must assume the proper evidence to be true. 
    That was the case in Moore against Depmsey and -- and various other cases, I'm sure you're familiar with, more familiar than I am. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked about the -- about the original charges. 
    This is the original record which contains photocopies of the arrest slips. 
    They -- they are informal. 
    They do contain the two charges and if the Court wishes to examine them, they're at pages 1 and 2 of the -- of the original transcript.

    Now, on this point of -- of whether -- of whether you can do anything more than reverse, it would be presumptuous for me to suggest anything -- I mean any -- that put the right opinions for this Court. 
    But the -- I -- I would like to tell you one fact with which has come into existence since this -- this Court granted certiorari, which gives this case a special importance in Kentucky. 
    In December, the outgoing general assembly voted to call a constitutional convention. 
    And early this month, the new general assembly has done the same thing, so that this fall, the voters are going to -- are going to vote on whether we should have a new -- a -- a convention to revise our 1891 Constitution that contains this medieval court system. 
    If that convention is caused, it would be a tremendous help to the delegates of that convention. 
    If this Court had spelled out, at least to some extent, with special reference to the judicial system of Kentucky, what the minimum requirements of essential justice in a modern system of criminal law administration are. 
    And I simply say that because it so happens that this case is timely from that viewpoint.

    Well, then we can't just -- they have a right to listen that the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment (Inaudible) them. 
    It's another thing to ask is to make a special address to people.
speaker="louis_lusky" startTime="4295.493" stopTime="4421.402">
    Mr. Louis Lusky 
    I hadn't intended to ask that. 
    All I intended to do was to acquaint this Court with the fact that this case might have a -- a special importance to the people in my home state, because it comes up at this particular time. 
    I didn't mean to be presumptuous anyway. 
    Now, if -- I -- I don't want to presume any further on the Court's time, but there are just a few detailed points that I would like to take off, if I may. 
    First, the -- the -- I -- I will say that this case is -- this place is referred to as a saloon. 
    This is the way the police referred to it and I noticed that -- that is been referred to that way in argument. 
    It is not a saloon. 
    It is a tavern that is licensed to sell beer only. 
    This is just the -- a term which has been injected into the case. 
    The -- on the question whether the -- whether the petitioner could have been properly waiting for a bus in a tavern which was half a block -- block away from a bus stop and was on a different street that ran the other way. 
    You have to know the fact that the -- these suburban buses run on schedules and the next bus wasn't due for half an hour. 
    And as far as whether the -- whether he was dancing or not, Mr. Justice Whittaker pointed out that Marks (ph) the café proprietor, did not consider what he was doing as dancing. 
    He said he didn't think it was dancing and of course, from a police regulation point of view, the significance of dancing is that it is men and women dancing together, two people dancing. 
    That's the thing that creates problems. 
    Now, on the question of what was the [Laughter] -- and some non-legal problems. 
    I -- I think that's -- that's about all that I -- that I really think I should take your time for, Your Honors, and I do thank you for your indulgence. 
    Would you like to have the list of arrests or not?

    You might as well file them.
