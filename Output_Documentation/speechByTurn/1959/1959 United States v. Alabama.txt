    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    On Friday of this last week, the United States filed with this Court, a memorandum describing action by the Congress that we think has a very important bearing on this case and removes some of the problems otherwise involved in the case before the Court. 
    I'd like very briefly to call your attention to that memorandum. 
    It refers to the action of the Congress in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1960. 
    That Act has not yet been signed by the President. 
    The United States believe that it will be within a short time.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="89.993" stopTime="91.533">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    When is the time of --
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="91.533" stopTime="385.472">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    I think it was up on the Fifth or I think by the Sixth, we will know about the action of the President. 
    And United States is willing to rely upon the assumption that it will be signed and that the Court should examine the case in the light of that action. 
    Now, that Civil Rights Act of 1960 is an amendment of the 1957 Act that was involved in this proceeding up to the time that we filed this memorandum and I think that it would govern the -- this proceeding hereafter. 
    As the Court will recall, it has held several times that since this in an -- an action for declaratory relief and injunctive relief, it is prospective in regard to the effect of it. 
    And therefore, there is no problem about what the law was at the time this case was before the lower court. 
    It is a question of what the law is at the time it is brought back and tried before that court. 
    And the court has also held that the mere fact that there are facts that have -- relating to acts that have occurred prior to the passage of the legislation does not make it retroactive. 
    The Reynolds case and Cox against Hart are both cases that bear upon that question. 
    So that the Court would properly, in examining this in the trial of this proceeding before the lower court, take into account assuming that this Act is passed, this amendment, the Civil Rights Act of 1960 would take as an amendment of the 1957 Act and try to determine what the law is with regard to the powers of the United States to bring such a proceeding in that condition. 
    Now, the 1960 act is very explicit in regard to the power of the United States Attorney General to bring such an action as this. 
    We have set it out on page 2 of our memorandum. 
    “The act or practice shall also be deemed that of the State and the State may be joined as a party defendant. 
    And if prior to the institution of such a proceeding, such official has resigned, or has been -- been relieved of his office and no successor has assumed such office, the proceeding may be instituted against the State.” 
    So, in this case, under the facts here, there would be two separate grounds for making the State a party, one, the absolute power to make the State a party and the other the power to make the State a party whenever the officer has resigned. 
    The parties, Rogers and Livingston, have both resigned in this case. 
    And so, it would come under both provisions of that portion of the amendment to the statute. 
    We do have one further aspect of the case and that is the fact that the lower court dismissed the action as to all parties. 
    And the United States made the Board of Registrars a party and also Rogers and Livingston, the two individuals, who were registrars and had resigned. 
    Though that question, we regard as a difficult question, we think the United States is right about it and we've developed it at length in our original brief, but we do not think the Court has to reach that question. 
    In light of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, assuming it is signed because we think that the Court should assume and the United States is willing to assume that with the State as a party, thus a state will comply with any final order that the Court enters in such a proceeding in regard to these most important rights of citizens to vote. 
    And therefore, we suggest that the Court need not reach the question of the individuals in this case and the effect of their resignations and that the Court can properly find that the State under the amended statute, would be a proper party and that the Court at -- would at the time the case is returned to have the power to take jurisdiction of a proceeding against the State.

    And so, there is no factual problem that the Court would have to consider as the lower court would have to consider in regard to this proceeding in passing upon what the Civil Rights Act of 1960 means as to whether or not the State can lawfully be made a party and whether the Court has jurisdiction to hear such a proceeding against the State.

    Well, there wasn't a suggestion to the -- and what you've answered a minute ago, it wasn't a suggestion that no decree could be directed against the State if it -- if it either was recalcitrant or denied the authority of the Court but merely that the statute did not authorize a decree against it.

    -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    The lower court seemed to have no difficulty with the -- it didn't reach any constitutional question but had no difficulty with the power of the Congress to provide for the State to be made a party if it saw fit. 
    The Court of Appeals doesn't seem to me as so clear in that regard and at least it's very clear that unless it is explicit, it would not assume that such an action could be permitted and it has some language to the effect that there might be some doubts or at least it wouldn't be. 
    [Inaudible] I think it's more correct to say it didn't reach that question. 
    And so it -- you can't say that they have recognized in advance that there was such a power in the Congress.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    The United States has taken the position that this Court should not now reach constitutional questions. 
    And we only ask that the Court reach the question if the statute is explicit. 
    We point out the legislative history as such that there was no issue about this provision. 
    There -- the explanation was by the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General that it was conceived that the United States had this power under the 1957 Act as it was but that it was to make it explicit and to have no doubt about the matter that it was now included in the Act. 
    And I don't think anybody will contend that it isn't there but we think the constitutional questions -- questions are properly reserved to consideration when the matter comes before the lower court again.

   Argument of Gordon Madison
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="858.353" stopTime="867.156">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Madison.
speaker="gordon_madison" startTime="867.156" stopTime="1120.446">
    Mr. Gordon Madison 
    Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Honorable Members of this Court. 
    We came to prepare to argue with two different parts of this case. 
    One related to the right of the United States to sue the respondent, Rogers and Livingston who at that time the suit was filed had resigned under Alabama law, had resigned under the common law. 
    Their resignations had been accepted. 
    They had accepted other officers of profit under the State and that part of the argument had fallen to me. 
    The other part of the argument was to be presented by Mr. Hare, Assistant Attorney General of Alabama which dealt with the right of the United States on the 1957 Civil Rights Act to bring a suit against the State of Alabama, more specifically, whether a District Court had jurisdiction of such a suit under the 1957 Act. 
    Now, Mr. Rankin's secretary called our office on Friday and relayed to me the substance of a memorandum or note which he has written to the Court, as they had to learn you could do that. 
    And we were furnished with a copy when we arrive here, Sunday afternoon, at our hotel. 
    And in order to properly analyze the ramifications of what we might do here today in this argument or what we might agree to on the assumption that the President will sign the law, I believe he will. 
    But as of today, it is not law and we don't know what he will do. 
    So far as -- as that the Court will bear with me a few minutes, I would like to point out because I don't know what you all will do, will you with agree the Solicitor General, which of it? 
    That under the statutes of Alabama, that all officers where they may hold office or shall hold office or not, have the right to vacate those offices by resignation, the statute set forth in our brief. 
    Now, a little difference for the common law in that that there has to be no acceptance by the appointing authority. 
    But here in this case, there wasn't acceptance. 
    So, even the Alabama law and the common law has -- has been complied with by the acceptance of those resignations. 
    And in addition thereto, the very statute which permits their appointment and which says that they may hold office as Registrars for a period of four years until their successors are elected and qualified, substance of it. 
    Also provides that they may be removed at anytime for any cause by the appointing authority which the Governor, state auditor and the Commission of Agriculture and Industries. 
    Attached to these pleadings and to our motion to dismiss and to a motion which we filed -- our answer we filed in response to a motion to produce certain records is in affidavit by each of the respondents, one, Rogers and the other, Livingston in which it set forth all the facts to show that they did resign. 
    The resignations were in good faith. 
    They accepted, by the proper authority that a -- in addition had been removed from office by those appointing authorities or authority and had assumed other offices of profit. 
    And under the Constitution and laws of the State of Alabama both, you are prohibited from holding two offices of profit on the State at one in the same time. 
    Now, there had been some suggestion in the brief about that the resignations were made in bad faith. 
    There's nothing like that. 
    The whole argument was based on the assumption that they did not become effective until the appointment of their successors or -- or resignation --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    I think that that on what the Solicitor General said that the Government of United States is willing to go ahead with the litigation without these two respondents.
speaker="gordon_madison" startTime="1129.323" stopTime="1214.328">
    Mr. Gordon Madison 
    Well, that brings a lot of questions, Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    Since you asked me that point blank I think rather if you go to assume that the case is going -- become -- I mean the act, it won't become law, we don't deal with it on that basis. 
    That I'd rather think on the short period of time that I've had that the -- the rather unusual case of Rice versus Sioux City Cemetery involving, I believe Mr. -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter held the opinion of the --of the Court. 
    And now the Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice and Mr. Black, Mr. Douglas dissented but the reason for that dissent is not present here. 
    And it could be well said that the writ will be improvidently granted in this case and you sent back to the lower court -- not sent back to the lower court but the Government filed a new suit under this new act as it passed. 
    We will then have an opportunity to plead to the constitutionality of it. 
    The only difference, they may have one ready now, as far as I know, assuming the President signed it, they could file it. 
    There'll be only a short period of delay and it seems to me that it will preserve better everybody's constitutional right, the State -- or to raise a constitutional question. 
    So, during the short period of time that we -- or I may say I have, that my colleague may have some other notions. 
    But it seems to me that that case which was reported 349 U.S. 70 would have some direct application and bearing on what should be done here.

    I will say through this though, there is something about this 1960 Act that somebody needs to go into whether it's ever held constitutional or unconstitutional or whatnot. 
    Now, I'm just an ordinary lawyer who deals -- that deals into constitutional matters all the time. 
    I -- in my 27 years of practice -- the general practice of law before going into the Attorney General's office, I had to take the rough-and-tumble as it comes and goes. 
    And it just keeps in my mind, he has master and a servant. 
    And the master giving specific instructions just exactly like our Board of Registrars would give the State of Alabama, “In a constitutional argument, you must do it this way, you must not discriminate on the basis of race or color or anything else.” 
    And now, here comes saying and says that when the Board of Registrars does that, it shall be deemed action of the State. 
    In other words, the servant act the way -- and beyond the scope of employment, scope of the story, scope for everything else. 
    And you say that's deemed to be the action of the State. 
    There are lots of questions to be -- to be -- that brought these things that needs some more answers too and I have mine.

   Argument of Nicholas S. Hare
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1467.509" stopTime="1469.895">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Hare.
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1469.895" stopTime="1525.867">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    Sir, I have only one thing to argue or rather to add. 
    I think the -- the case now has become one that it is abstract. 
    My argument which was devoted to showing as best I knew how, that the State of Alabama could not have been made a proper party under the 1957 Amendment, is no longer before Your Honors in view of the statement of the counsel for the other side that he is willing to rest completely on a speculative possibility that the new act may become law. 
    So, that reason -- nothing really for me to argue with reference to the inapplicability of the 1957 Amendment to an injunction against the State.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1525.867" stopTime="1528.457">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    How much of a speculation do you think it is?
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1528.457" stopTime="1541.733">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    Well I noticed that the N.A.A.C.P. is greatly distressed about it being only half a loaf and would apparently prefer that the half loaf be rejected in the hope of getting a full loaf.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1541.733" stopTime="1544.840">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that's not within their power even to sign it to veto.
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1544.840" stopTime="1549.976">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    No, but they seem to have considerable voice.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1549.976" stopTime="1552.451">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    At least you are not joining their field, are you?
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1552.451" stopTime="1713.041">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    No, sir. 
    Now, that the point -- the point which I wish to make is this. 
    That in this particular argument, in this particular decision which addresses itself to this Court which is in the nature of a review of two lower court opinions, and not anything really not to review something that is speculated that we are arguing on today. 
    If this case, this argument and the case itself has -- if not become moot has become one of limited importance. 
    Because assuming that the new law will come into effect, they will travel under the new law, some aspects of the new law which were entirely different from the old like the referee, the referee section which enables the District Court to appoint referees to oversee voting registration. 
    Now, that in itself might make it inappropriate to take such an unusual step as enjoining a State in a governmental function. 
    It may not be necessary to enjoin a State. 
    And the only prayer in the present bill is a prayer for an injunction which apparently has mandatory injunction effect. 
    But it's not necessary. 
    It won't be necessary under the new bill. 
    They can -- they can get all the relief they want by the voter registrar section of the new bill.So the point of it is, there are so many things to be considered that it -- it seems to me like this Court could well say that due to the intervening circumstance, that is a passage of this law, and due to the present limited, very limited importance of this particular case because it couldn't affect another case anywhere in the United States anymore. 
    Because of -- assuming the new act will pass, whether or not the State under the 1957 Amendment could be made a party would never arise again. 
    So I say due to this limited importance now, the Court should exercise its discretion as it has done many times in the past and in particular, the case which my associate mentioned, Rice versus Sioux City Cemetery where they said, “Due to the isolated significance of this particular piece of litigation, the writ of certiorari was deemed to be improvidently granted and the writ was denied.”
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1713.041" stopTime="1736.569">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But surely there's a decisive difference between Rice and this case. 
    In Rice, the -- there was no such situation of a new statute concerning the claim that was ambiguously urged or ambiguously sustainable under the prior situation. 
    But here is a confirming statute --
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1736.569" stopTime="1737.486">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    A confirming statute.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1737.486" stopTime="1738.703">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- a view of the Government --
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1738.703" stopTime="1738.933">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    From the view --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1738.933" stopTime="1789.599">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- that confirming the statute, the Government have argued a basic complaint as far as the State is concerned on an argumentative -- on an a elaborate argumentative. 
    Of course, the brief, the -- that the State is impliedly covered in the reach of the 1957 Act. 
    Along comes Congress and I quite agree with you, at the moment, we are talking about a -- a measure that isn't law though I think it's very real to assume it will not be law without -- within not more than ten days from whatever today was and doctrine was just put on further, instead. 
    And this is confirming legislation that so often we've had in the past an affirming legislation taking away the ambiguities of litigation.
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1789.599" stopTime="1799.224">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    Your Honor, with reference to the Sioux City Cemetery case that Your Honor is more familiar with than any other living human beings since its -- to you maybe --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1799.224" stopTime="1802.063">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Just a little of accounts of the loss of memory by an old man.
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1802.063" stopTime="1810.062">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    [Laughs] 
    In that case it was interesting that a statute had been passed after the beginning of the suit.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1810.062" stopTime="1811.205">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1811.205" stopTime="1817.385">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    And to that extent, it's just about as close as you'll find one, but --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1817.385" stopTime="1825.496">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What the statute did is against -- one of the statutes did in the relation of the second related statute to the prior situation makes all the difference.
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1825.496" stopTime="1887.513">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    Now, but we take the position that the -- this could not be a confirmatory -- could not be a confirmatory action because the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the last word on the subject had sustained the lower court. 
    That the State could not be made a party and that was the status of the law prior to the argument before Congress. 
    So it's a new thing. 
    It's a new thing. 
    So in effect, this might -- you might say the law, assuming that it becomes a law, does permit in same instances, suit against States. 
    In same instances, we will -- we -- we must be sure that the particular bill of complaint or the particular complaint that they have is applicable to this particular new section. 
    So, that's why we feel that the case should be started over completely. 
    It won't be in a hardship as we see it to anybody.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1887.513" stopTime="1911.592">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I wonder if you adhere to a State whether you would deny that on its face, 42 U.S.C. 1971 (c) on its face, I'm not -- not requiring to questions of constitutionality but on its face that is a congressional authorization for making the State a party.
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1911.592" stopTime="1915.339">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, no, no. 
    I mean of 1960, no, no, no. 
    The 1957 argument --
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1922.089" stopTime="1922.950">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    It -- it's this specifically.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1922.950" stopTime="1925.838">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The 1957 Act is a debatable act.

    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1926.126" stopTime="1932.065">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And my question is whether you're here to state whether the 1971 (c) --
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1932.065" stopTime="1932.439">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    That's what is --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1932.439" stopTime="1936.150">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And move, takes that out of debate and is explicit.
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1936.150" stopTime="1951.609">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    We say, sir that that does -- that is explicit, now. 
    However, it does not raise the question. 
    It doesn't go to some of the essential questions such as, does that confer jurisdiction, only a District Court could do that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1951.609" stopTime="1952.856">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The Act says so, doesn't it?
speaker="nicholas_s_hare" startTime="1952.856" stopTime="1958.564">
    Mr. Nicholas S. Hare 
    That's right. 
    Well, -- well then does it remove original jurisdiction from this Court to do that?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1958.564" stopTime="1958.645">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well I mean does that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1958.645" stopTime="1960.406">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That's a constitutional question.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1960.406" stopTime="2044.567">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's right, a constitutional question. 
    So that, there are so many aspects of it, Your Honor. 
    It's almost difficult to debate extemporaneously and that's what we are asked to do today where this is a -- came as completely as a surprise to -- to us, I might say, because we expected to -- to argue the case as it had been presented by the questions and brief. 
    And we -- but we do urge that in view of the changed circumstances, this particular case is no longer, will be -- it will no longer be controlling on the broad scope of the law. 
    Is -- it will be controlling only as far as these particular parties are concerned and it has no -- has no national scope or significance. 
    And we feel like that no hardship would be done, anyone by dismissing the writ of certiorari because if they have a valid case and intend to push it which I'm sure that they intend to push from they said today, they can bring it over again. 
    If we have a right to plead to this -- in the same suit below again, no additional time it seems to us, would be lost at all except just the time of the filing of the first -- the first suit. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of J. Lee Rankin
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2044.567" stopTime="2045.871">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Solicitor General.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2045.871" stopTime="2215.969">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    All I'd like to say about the fact of our memorandum being so late is that I think that none of us in the case should be surprised at having to deal with and contemplate the effect of the Civil Rights Act of 1960. 
    And as soon as it was passed by the Congress and we had reason to believe that the President would sign it. 
    Then it seemed to me it was the duty of our office and also counsel on the other side should be considering the matter to see if they could advise this Court as to how the matter should be disposed of in -- in the light of those events. 
    Because it had changed the situation so materially that this Court should not have to be burdened with an examination of a situation that was so materially changed that it wasn't the same. 
    And in light of that, while we could only file it when we did on Friday, we were considering the matter earlier as soon as the Congress had acted and I would think counsel on the other side should too. 
    And with the constitutional questions and all of the rest of it left to the trial, the only thing we ask the Court to do now is to say what the Court has done before in the past, no factual problem about it all, does this statute or does it not say that a State can be made a party in such a proceeding? 
    And we shouldn't have to face another appeal and delay in regard to the problem of that simplicity. 
    I don't think that if counsel were just given many weeks, he could figure out many arguments as to whether the statute does or does not say that very thing and that's all we ask.
