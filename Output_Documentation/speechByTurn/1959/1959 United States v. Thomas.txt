United States v. Thomas
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="0.000" stopTime="213.717">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    I would like to say something today to try -- Court by a misimpression. 
    I think the Solicitor General may have given you yesterday when the implication was made that people who have been taken off the rolls under this challenge system would have to go back and take some different type of literacy test or different type of test as required by the constitutional laws of the State. 
    The same test is issued to anybody when they register. 
    That is if they are challenged off the rolls and there is a necessity for them to reregister, they pass the very same test that they originally took. 
    That is these people who were challenged assuming for the sake of argument that they were to go back and reregister, they would be required to take no more than the same test that they took previously. 
    That test being completing the registration blank completely without blanks and thereby becoming what the Louisiana law calls a duly qualified voter. 
    The whole theory of the Registrar's case, this matter has been brought up upon, is a fact that we believe that the Fifteenth Amendment does not even come into play at the basis for the Government's allegation of discrimination, should not even be considered. 
    Because the fact that these people were challenged from the rolls was because they had made a mistake in their application for registration not because of their color. 
    There are no reasons in Louisiana law to challenge anybody because of their color. 
    Under the Louisiana law, you must first pass a test called a literacy test. 
    You pass that test by completely filling out the registration application blank. 
    In this particular situation, we are faced with a Registrar who allowed his rolls to become clotted up with illegal and irregular voters. 
    Under the Section which this case has brought 245, which gives qualified voters an opportunity to call to the attention, other Registrar, these facts, it becomes more apparent why you have a need for such a section. 
    For instance, assuming that you have a Registrar who has taken office and let us assume that the same thing has happened -- has happened in Washington Parish. 
    I think from the deposition of the Registrar himself, where he admits that he believes that 50% of the white people on these rolls have similar mistakes. 
    Of course, our position is that they don't belong on the roll. 
    They are not qualified anymore than the colored people who have made the same mistakes. 
    If the Registrar had conducted his office, we believe, in accordance with the Louisiana law, none of these people who are irregularly or illegally upon the roll, should be there.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They don't belong there, but they are there.
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="216.506" stopTime="273.076">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    That's right, sir. 
    Now, the problem is what is the solution? 
    Under Judge Wright's decree, this is what would happen, we believe. 
    We believe that Judge Wright's decree indicates that you must ignore these mistakes. 
    Ignore the mistakes that were made such as the deviation from printed materials, the miscalculation of age and the misstatements that maybe made or the misspelled words. 
    He says ignore them because the white voter has not been challenged. 
    So then, he concludes that the only reason why these people were challenged were on the basis of their color. 
    Our contention being that you cannot, at this stage, look at the Fifteenth Amendment until or unless you can show that the only basis that these people were challenged was because of their color. 
    If --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="273.076" stopTime="303.976">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if -- but if -- if 10 white folks and 10 colored folks are improperly -- allegedly, did not comply with the test called the literacy test, in -- as an object of fact, the 10 white folks stay on the roll despite that fact, but then colored folks don't, then, whatever the reason, there is a clear differentiation between white and colored.

    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    As a matter --

    As a demonstration.
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="305.591" stopTime="306.098">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    That's right. 
    It's an act of --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="306.098" stopTime="310.665">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But not many things in the law you can demonstrate, but this -- this is one of them.We call that arithmetic.
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="310.665" stopTime="403.422">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    That's right, sir. 
    To bring the problem even closer, if -- if I may, in order to answer your question, Justice Frankfurter, supposing I -- if I'll be allowed to give you this demonstration which maybe will bring the -- the point that I'm trying to bring out to the Court a little bit closer. 
    Let's assume for the sake of argument that all the nine justices of the -- the State Supreme Court -- the United States Supreme Court here, all members are the voting society of Washington Parish merely for the sake of argument to demonstrate. 
    And let's assume merely again, for the sake of argument, that we attempt to put the members of the federal judiciary under the Fifteenth Amendment. 
    That is, we amend the Fifteenth Amendment right now for the sake of argument of placing a comma and adding all members of this federal judiciary. 
    I then go into Washington Parish as an individual and I say to myself, “Subjectively in my mind, I'd say, I do not care for federal judgment. 
    And what I am going to try and do is to disqualify each federal judge from the registration rolls on the basis that subjectively, I do not like them.” 
    Whatever my reason is would be immaterial. 
    Now the Registrar, assuming that first, he does not even know what subjectively is in my mind, I then checked each one of the judges on the Supreme Court. 
    Each one, except one, makes a mistake such as a miscalculation base --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="403.422" stopTime="407.653">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean in -- you're going -- you'd better subject us to a spelling counterattack.
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="407.653" stopTime="420.088">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    No, sir. [Laughter] 
    Such as a misstatement of age, a deviation from printed material, all leaving a blank, now, all except one. 
    Now, I have effective --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="420.088" stopTime="422.984">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You mean he's perfect. 
    He satisfies all the requirements.
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="422.984" stopTime="528.711">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    Right, sir. 
    Effectively, I have issued -- initiated a challenge against eight judges. 
    Subjectively, I just don't like it. 
    The ninth judge however, even though I don't like him, I cannot subject him to their challenge because he has completed his Court correctly. 
    So subjectively, I had in my mind, to discriminate against federal judges. 
    But I could not bring that to a conclusion on one judge because he did not fit into any category for which I could challenge it. 
    So therefore, I have removed eight judges from the roll. 
    Now, the Fifteenth Amendment, even though I bear that discrimination maybe in my mind, cannot be brought into play because I cannot disqualify you as a registered voter in the State of Louisiana because you are a federal judge. 
    But if you make a mistake on your application for registration, which I think is enough to issue a challenge, then I can go ahead and force the Registrar to issue you a challenge. 
    Now, what remedy do you have? 
    You can come in and you can traverse the challenge as difficult as it may seem to traverse the challenge. 
    But once you traverse that challenge, the challenger has no right at all to keep you off those rolls. 
    The Registrar must put you back on those rolls and then, it is up to the challenger to go into the local court and determine whether or not, he had a right to determine that you spell Louisiana, L-U-Z-I-A-N-A.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="528.711" stopTime="546.886">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But does your argument start with accepting the testimony of the Registrar that 50% of the white (Inaudible) were subject to the same infirmity as these colored people were struck off the roll?Do you start with that accepting that or not?
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="546.886" stopTime="547.832">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    Oh, I have to accept that Your Honor --

    All right.
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="548.173" stopTime="548.802">

    -- that's what he said.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="548.802" stopTime="566.624">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Then you've got the objective fact that there is a -- that there is a striking off from a list, 1000 -- 1377 was keeping on whatever the hundreds are and the difference is within black and white.
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="566.624" stopTime="568.244">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    But that -- the reason why that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="568.244" stopTime="575.916">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, in the -- in the jury cases that we've had, that is the fact. 
    That is the result of the operation of a state law, isn't it?

    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    That's right. 
    It's in your jury case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="576.729" stopTime="611.471">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right. 
    And if that's the fact -- if that's the mathematical or an arithmetic fact, then this -- and this state machinery that brings about that fact, we've held in the jury cases that if that happens, it can't be accident. 
    Accidents don't happen, six of them -- seven -- six of them -- seven and 11 aren't (Inaudible) all the time. 
    They sometimes happen but not all the time. 
    And therefore, if that happens, the State has brought about a result not to an act accorded as we lawyers say, but some human operation.

    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter, let -- let me try and answer your question this way. 
    In the field of qualification of voters, I don't think that anybody doubts that it's up to the State to set those qualifications as long as they do not violate the provisions of the Federal Constitution. 
    The federal --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="630.767" stopTime="635.472">

    But they must -- they must observe them not on paper, but in action.

    They must --

    No use of saying -- no use of giving me a million dollars on paper, if I can't cash it in for $5, you know.
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="641.943" stopTime="674.486">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's true. 
    But the -- the State of Louisiana sets the laws up. 
    They all administered originally to -- to really show you here what happened. 
    Originally, if you look at the statistics if there was any discrimination in the literacy test, it was the discrimination of allowing more disqualified colored people to get upon the roll than disqualified white. 
    There were some 1700 people who are on the rolls who were colored people, and now that 1700, some 1300 were challenged.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="674.486" stopTime="697.921">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But we've got a case here on a record and we're limited -- bound by that record 
    And on that record, certain findings were made. 
    And the finding is an arithmetic differentiation on the basis of color. 
    You say you start with accepting that. 
    Now, how that was brought about is beside the point. 
    The question is whether it should be allowed to continue.
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="697.921" stopTime="725.726">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    No, sir. 
    I disagree with that as -- as besides the point. 
    Originally, these people were not qualified voters. 
    You cannot get a privilege to do something if you never had it in the first place. 
    These people were never voters. 
    What Judge Wright has done in our opinion, he has amended the registration laws by saying that you can be a qualified voter on the State of Louisiana only if you're colored, if you deviate from the printed material, if you miscalculate your age. 
    Miscalculation of age (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="725.726" stopTime="738.650">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That isn't what he wants. 
    That isn't the way I read his findings. 
    What he said is you can't throw these people off because you're keeping people on who have -- who were exactly subject to those infirmities with one exception that they're white and not colored?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. -- Mr. Roberts, may I ask you this question? 
    Mr. -- Mr. Justice Black was trying to get an answer to it yesterday, I thought, and it's this. 
    Are you -- are you saying to us now that there was not sufficient evidence to support the findings of Judge Wright or -- are you saying to us that the findings of Judge Wright are not sufficient to support the position of the Government?
speaker="henry_j_roberts_jr" startTime="852.121" stopTime="1017.117">
    Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr. 
    That's -- what I am trying to say, sir, is that the findings of Judge Wright were on the fact that he ignored in my opinion, the basic requirement of the Louisiana law which indicates that you must pass the test for illiteracy. 
    Now, what he did, in my opinion, is that he ignored that particular provision of the registration law of Louisiana and because he ignored that, he then came to the conclusion that the only reason why these people were challenged was because they were of a particular color. 
    In addition, he seems to take the position that under 245, which gives each party, either white or colored, a chance to -- to get people off the rolls under a challenge. 
    He seems to take the position that you should not have the Negroes off the roll, if you allow the white people upon the rolls. 
    He ignores the fact, in my opinion, that the machinery in the State would allow him, in my opinion anyway, to do something and insofar as the Registrar. 
    The reason why I say that Mr. Chief Justice is that, Mr. Thomas, who was a Registrar of Voters, was in this position. 
    Some 10 years ago or eight years ago, he was under a federal court order not to discriminate against anybody because of their color. 
    In the meantime, he evidently, being afraid of violating a court order, took some people on the roll which ordinarily should not have taken just exactly from fear. 
    And then when a group of people called the citizens council or individuals, come into his registration office and attempt to challenge only colored people, he didn't know what to do so he said, I'm going to my state court because I have a federal court order hanging over my head. 
    So, I'm going to my state court to see whether or not, I can take these challenges. 
    He went to his state court. 
    His state court told him, under our law, he must go ahead and accept these challenges and they've thought that he did not in accepting these challenges, because they were -- the state court concluded for cause, violate the federal injunction. 
    So therefore, he proceeded to do that and consequently, he was sued, made a party to the suit by the Federal Government. 
    But I do believe that Judge Wright's decision just ignored the fact of the registration laws. 
    What he has taken, he has put on a roll, two types of disqualified people. 
    The mere fact that the white people are -- are on the roll disqualified and the colored people aren't of course, I think this is -- the solution is to get the white disqualified people off.

    But after reading at the law and indicating what this -- Mr. Thomas, has done in his -- his deposition, that if I had been in Mr. Thomas' shoes and if this case had not been pending, I would've advised Mr. Thomas to go through his rolls and clear the rolls out of every illegal vote he has whether that voter is white, colored, green or pink. 
    Because he has allowed people, in our opinion, of his testimony to remain on that roll, who were not qualified and in effect therefore, discriminate against qualified voters. 
    Why not colored? 
    There are two -- 200 somewhat colored voters still on the roll. 
    Those colored voters, if they wanted to, could do that. 
    They could go in under this challenge. 
    Two of them can go in, since he admits that 50% meres a practical, political matter, that's what I would have done. 
    How to use my two voters, how to go on in, how to clean those rolls up, if the Registrar wouldn't do it, and our intentions are no matter how this case comes about, is to make sure that a man like Mr. Thomas is not in a position to administer the registration laws of the State. 
    Because we think that they administered wrong, because people who are not qualified no matter what color they be, should not be placed upon the roll.

    So that, the Registrar's an indispensable -- as an indispensable participant in the action of these citizens who have wanted to challenge, exceeded to a request of 1377 records of 1517 Negroes and exceeded to a request of only 10 for 11,000 whites. 
    Now, that for me is exactly like the cases we've had as the juries, where the mathematical result could not be brought about by any -- I hesitate, I was about to say honest, by any undiscriminatory action on the data. 
    They must've been discriminatory, if out of 15,000 -- out of 11,000, you look at only 10. 
    And out of 1500, you look for 1300 or nearly 1400 to find out whether there is misspelling. 
    Then, in the inevitable objective nature of things, you will call out unfairly as against the 1300 out of the 1500.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I'd like to just speak on very briefly about just a couple of matters. 
    I did not anticipate, although we tried to anticipate all the arguments we could in this case, that there would be no claim -- that there would be a claim that there is no attempt to purge the Negroes from these registration rolls. 
    We don't cite it in our brief because we did not anticipate it, but the report of the United States Commission on Civil Rights of 1959 in its official document on page 101 and on through page 106, deals with the facts of the deliberate effort to purge Negroes from these registration rolls and sets out the fact that Mr. Rainey (ph) who was a member of the joint legislative committee, to maintain segregation, had a Mr. Shaw, as his counsel, who was one of the lawyers arguing the Larche case before this Court. 
    And Mr. Shaw participated in instructing the Registrars how to accomplish this. 
    And the objective was stated publicly to try to get the 130,000 Negroes, then on the registration rolls reduced so they wouldn't be more than 13,000, because they had a disproportionate influence on the voting of the people in the State and they were able to get a -- an effect upon the laws of the State in the legislature and in the Government generally, because of their voting pressure that they would not be able to with this purge accomplished. 
    And then it proceeds to show that exactly the instructions that were developed by the white citizen council which as described as being the instruction prepared by the white citizen council as to how to develop, “The key to victory in the segregation struggle.” 
    And then it proceeds to give detailed instructions as style to accomplish it. 
    And then it goes on to tell just the constitutional test for registration that should be applied to accomplish this objective. 
    And it --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2038.612" stopTime="2041.404">

    Was that before -- was all these before Judge Wright?

    And this -- this also sets out tables of the reduction in the vote of the registration of the Negroes parish by parish, as a result of the purge. 
    So, it shows what the objective that was set out and what was accomplished in regard to it. 
    So that I think it's very plain that the history -- that that was the objective to discriminate and they proceeded and it was accomplished.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    There's one large -- larger community, it isn't a very large community, but one. 
    And they -- the -- Judge Wright didn't find that there were parish -- there were wards that had no Negro voters that were not examined at all by the challengers. 
    That was one of the important thing that he said, he made.

    There were references by the counsel for the Registrar that what this really was -- was not racial discrimination, but that the realities were that this was a contest between political facts in the State. 
    Is there anything in the record to draw a light at all in that situation?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2170.623" stopTime="2197.232">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, I believe that there isn't anything in the record. 
    There is something in the report of the Commission on civil rights that would indicate that there is some political controversy involved in it as one group thinks that they can get the Negro support and do get it and the others would like to get them out off office and so they like to get rid of the Negro vote as a part of that effort.

    Yes.

    And there is a report also about Monroe in Wichita Parish in which they wanted to get rid of the mayor and they concluded they couldn't do that without getting rid of the Negro vote and they did get rid of it and they got rid of the mayor, that kind of thing. 
    So, it seems to be tied in with the objective of getting rid of the Negro vote because it might contribute to one or the other, as well as the --

    Mr. -- Mr. Solicitor, is there any claim involved here of unconstitutionality of the Louisiana statute Section 244 or 245?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2246.417" stopTime="2316.552">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, I don't think that's properly before the Court this time. 
    If it was the only issue in the case, we would -- the Government takes the position that this kind of an application of those statutes was never contemplated, it is unreasonable and has nothing to do with whether a person is properly qualified to vote and therefore, would be unconstitutionally caused therefore. 
    I don't think the Court ever has to reach that because it wasn't decided in the lower court and I think the discrimination is so patent that that alone is enough to be decisive. 
    Now, there is some literature by the Southern Regional Council of the very able political scientist professor of Tulane University that this statute was never conceived to be used this way. 
    That the purpose of it was to identify the person who wanted to be registered and show how long he'd live in a particular residence and whether he did live -- live there and give his age and those material objective standards and that was all, but is being misused in this manner. 
    Now, that hasn't been tried out though.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    I notice counsel for Louisiana when I asked this question, shake their head negatively which I take to be an agreement that there is no constitutional challenge of the statutes that I have mentioned. 
    So then -- that says otherwise, you might have a jurisdictional question whether or not, this should be one of the three-judge court.

    No.
