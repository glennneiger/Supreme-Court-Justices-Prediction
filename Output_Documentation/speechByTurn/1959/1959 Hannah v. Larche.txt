    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    I had not intended to and I'm reluctant to go outside of the record in this case, but a statement by the Deputy Attorney General has caused me to feel that I must do so in order to put this case in its proper context and also to defend myself. 
    I might say that I am the general counsel for the joint legislative committee and was referred to as one who advised registrars to discriminate against Negroes in the -- when they attempted to register the vote. 
    I might say that that is just not correct and I feel that the Deputy Attorney General was misinformed, he's acting erroneously. 
    To properly explain what had happened in Louisiana, particularly in connection with voting and let's say this is not directly in the record, but I think the Court needs to know it, to understand what have been going on. 
    We have laws in Louisiana and have -- have number of other States which require literacy qualifications, also, a certain amount of intelligence qualification. 
    Those laws, for many years, were not enforced. 
    The same is true and most of the other States that have those law, they are approximately 15, as I recall. 
    Several years back, we -- we the members of my committee, in discussion with me, asked me to look into the situation on voter -- voting laws and recommend -- make recommendations to them. 
    As results of the studies which I have made, we have instituted a program to enforce our laws strictly. 
    That means to white people and as well as to colored people. 
    Our efforts have not been successful completely. 
    We -- there have been cases we know and we have freely admitted that there are many parishes in which the colored people are discriminated against. 
    Also, there are many parishes in which these laws are enforced uniformly. 
    And the Court probably can recall the instances which happened last summer in the legislature of our State in which the Governor of our State suffered a mental and moral breakdown. 
    And that was brought on by his attempt to change our voter qualification laws. 
    And his reasons for doing so were because we were removing from the roll, many, I think, the term (Inaudible) all white people,” who were the backbones of his -- his political organization. 
    And our reasoning on doing this, carrying out this program is this, that we have been plagued in Louisiana for many years, like demagoguery and our political opposite. 
    And we determined that the only way that we could safely protect ourselves against that is by a rigid enforcement of our voter qualification law.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    What do you mean by the saying that you were removing from those (Inaudible) white people?
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="208.671" stopTime="294.075">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    We have removed hundreds, if not thousands. 
    I say we, not I personally, but people who have consulted with our committee and got an advice, have challenged the legality of the registration of white people in many places. 
    As a matter fact, it resulted in one lawsuit which will eventually get to this Court in the Parish of St. Landry. 
    That happens to be one of the French-speaking parishes and there are many illiterate white people in that parish who do not speak or read English. 
    It's going to the attempt that was made -- started out, I think, they removed several hundred of them, before the registrar just tried to refuse to remove any more because of political exigency at the time. 
    And I'm saying this in order to remove what I think is an unfair prejudice that surrounds this case. 
    Our program that we have been enforcing in our State is aimed at improving our Government by enforcing laws which on the book and which have been upheld by this Court in an effect upheld recently in North Carolina when the Court refused certiorari in the case from North Carolina on their literacy qualification. 
    That is all that I want to say in regard to the background, but if there are any questions, I'd be delighted to answer them because I think haven't got a personal knowledge of what's happened as any person in our State.

    We are charged with Commission of crimes and also, the acts which give rise to damage -- suits for damages because the -- the complaint required by the Act, Mr. Justice Whittaker, is a complaint that you have been discriminated against someone on account of their race, and there is no way that you can discriminate against someone on account of their race, for example, without having an intent to violate these -- these civil rights statutes which the Court is familiar with in which I'll be glad to -- to read to you in my brief at -- the original Civil Rights Act of 1871 which is -- provides statutes 1979 42 U.S.C. 1983 also the conspiracy angle of that. 
    I might add further that there's another face of that which bears upon what this Commission would have to do, I'd like to read you if the Court ask this -- this section which is Section 6 of the old Civil Rights Act 42 U.S.C. 1986, “Every person who, having knowledge that any of the wrong conspired to be done” and mentioned in Section 1985 of this title, “or about to be committed in having power to prevent or aid in preventing the Commission of the same, neglect or refuses to do so, shall be liable to the party injured or his legal representative for all damages.” 
    And this Commission investigates and finds that registrars are -- to their satisfaction, that registrars are -- are doing something in violation of this Act, it becomes their duty to assist in the preventing of that and bringing little people to justice under the statutes of the United States.

    -- is this new program that you had changed the number?
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="1457.993" stopTime="1605.919">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    Oh, yes. 
    They've increased under this program because -- in a matter of fact, we have a system of registration in our State called “permanent registration”. 
    Once you register, you never have to reregister in -- in many parishes. 
    It's optional by the parish and we've had it in our parish. 
    You never have to reregister provided you vote periodically and the registration in our parish prior to the institution of our program with much larger than it is now. 
    We have first lost population and secondly, there had been a good many people who have failed to exercise their rights, who have been unable to get back on roll when they attempted to try and register. 
    We say what we are running into is frankly from our standpoint of the program that we have -- is our position, not only from the Federal Government but from the local authorities, people in politics, local, who want to have a full registration as possible without regard to our laws. 
    But -- but the very point that was raised by Mr. Chief Justice Warren about the Attorney General's opinion, what the Attorney General did in that chase is -- is this. 
    The law said that -- that you must permit anyone who is a registered voter to see these records. 
    It does not say you have to keep anyone else from saying. 
    That's the reason why I say the registrar has the discretion. 
    In -- in the instant case -- but this -- what the Civil Rights Act did, it said that the Commission had to observe certain rule. 
    It didn't say they couldn't adopt those rules. 
    I certainly think that Congress intended for the Commission to adopt supplementary rules. 
    There are many things that -- that the few rules that they had in the Act did not cover. 
    Anyone who has conducted investigations or legislative otherwise could see that. 
    I think it was -- that -- if we consider congressional intent in particular, that intent is set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    And the -- and I'm not advocating that we apply the Administrative Procedure Act here except for the purpose of using it as a measure of what the congressional intent is.

    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    I say this. 
    It depends on how you define the term “adjudicatory”, Mr. Justice Whittaker. 
    If you use the term “adjudicatory” as it's used in the Administrative Procedure Act, then it does have adjudicatory function.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker

speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="1649.812" stopTime="1729.430">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    May I read you the definition from the Administrative Procedure Act? 
    I think it's important because the Administrative Procedure Act uses the term “adjudicatory” as being the measure of when this ordinary function of due process or to be accorded when they are not and what the Commission in effect has done in this case is say the Administrative Procedure Act is not applicable. 
    Yet, they have adopted the very test that the Administrative Procedure Act gives, but they have used a different definition for the word “adjudicate”. 
    And the word “adjudicate” as defined by the Administrative Procedure Act, can be found on page 4 of my brief, in Section 2 of the Act 5 U.S.C. 1001, (d) -- Section (d) order and adjudication. 
    Order means the whole or any part of the final disposition whether affirmative, negative, injunctive or declaratory in form of any agency, in any matter other than rule making but including licensing. 
    Adjudication means the agency process for the formulation of an order.

speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="1764.960" stopTime="1772.647">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    By way of a report. 
    Matter of fact, this Commission is required to make reports not only to Congress, but to the President.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1772.647" stopTime="1776.164">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Is that a -- is that declaratory (Inaudible)?
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="1776.164" stopTime="1936.260">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    If they make a report which is declaratory in form saying that John Jones had discriminated in -- in Claiborne Parish against a certain registrant, in -- in recommending to the President that he uses executive powers to bring about the prosecution of that part, then I say that that is an order within the meaning of Administrative Procedure Act. 
    Let me go further, Mr. Justice Whittaker. 
    The test of due process, as I see it, is not to be bound down by this test of adjudication. 
    I think due process is a -- is a term that has been defined -- explained by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Joint Anti-Fascist Committee cases. 
    It is a living principle. 
    It's something that cannot be bound down by any particular formula. 
    It's something we have to examine each particular case and see whether or not it fits due process. 
    If you will recall in the Joint Anti-Fascist case, there was no sanction applied. 
    The Attorney General could not apply any sanctions. 
    All he did was make a declaration that certain organizations, communist fronts or something of that type. 
    In the Court itself, this Court pointed out, that there was -- was no sanction involved in the matter except there was a matter of declaring indirectly, indirectly the effect of making that declaration would hurt this particular organization just as indirectly, the effect of a declaration by this Commission would hurt these people who were called before it. 
    As I read the cases of this Court, the Joint Anti-Fascist case, Peters versus Hobby, in Greene versus McElroy or a series of cases which set forth due process, as I understand it, which must be accorded in administrative hearing and administrative proceedings where agencies of the Federal Government are concern. 
    And that in each one of those cases, the only question involved was whether or not Congress or the President or the particular creating agency explicitly -- gave the explicit authority to adopt these rules. 
    I would like to point out to -- to this Court that in the case of Groban and in the case of Anonymous, that question was not even involve. 
    In case of Groban, we have 1900 statute of Ohio which had been in effect for many years and recognized explicitly giving the authority to do this to the Fire Marshal. 
    That was not questioned.

    Constitutional rights as stated by Mr. Justice Burton, if we remove the question of authorization in this case will fairly bristle the constitutional question as I see it. 
    The lower court didn't find it necessary to go into that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2128.866" stopTime="2129.095">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But what I --

    -- but in my opinion --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2129.608" stopTime="2138.600">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- what I was getting at Mr. Shaw is would the same constitutional principle be involved if -- if it was a congressional investigation?
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="2138.600" stopTime="2181.308">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    The constitutional principle of that -- of due process could arise in any case. 
    But as I say, due process is something that you can't say, “Here it is and it goes this far and no further.” 
    And you -- you have to consider a congressional committee's investigation in context with everything is going before and -- and everything has not going before the same for administrative tribunal. 
    And I say that the administrative tribunals -- we've had substantially the same question so for as I can see indistinguishably. 
    The same questions arise many times, in the cases that I've cited in Peters and Greene and the other cases that had been decided by this Court.

    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    Exactly.

speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2222.479" stopTime="2225.139">

speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="2227.604" stopTime="2230.346">

    Or declaration. 
    I don't know of any --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2230.346" stopTime="2237.694">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Voice Overlap) declaration goes too far for me because that's the judgment maybe very well but it declared by court the declaration of rights.
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="2237.694" stopTime="2287.280">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    Well, I'm -- I'm speaking of declaration not in the -- that sense. 
    I'm speaking of merely a statement saying that so and so it done so and so. 
    But if you want to use any words of justice, well, so long as we have the same meaning in that, I say this, insofar as criminal proceedings are concern, I do not know of any preliminary criminal proceeding which if some basis is found for the action, does not result in some such order as you are speaking of. 
    On the other hand, you've got the case of the Joint Anti-Fascist Committee which was an administrative proceeding which resulted in nothing more that State address -- describing the organizations involved. 
    And that's exactly what I see would result in this case, a statement describing these individuals and their conduct. 
    And I think it --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Shaw, does your -- when your legislative -- legislature conducts investigations as to illegalities, alleged illegalities and irregularities, does it accord to all witnesses the right you -- you claim for these people here?
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="2304.428" stopTime="2315.439">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    In -- practically, every case that I know of in our legislature, we do not grant the right to -- of subpoena to our -- our committees and they do not follow these particular rights now.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2315.439" stopTime="2318.874">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you never -- do you never have the power of subpoena?
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="2318.874" stopTime="2437.205">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    I do not recall any case.I don't say it have not been in them, imagine they have been but in all the instances now had been involved, there are number of hearing, we've never had the right of subpoena. 
    I think that is a key factor in this whole matter. 
    That if there were no subpoena powers involved in the question of due process, would take much a different aspect in the case. 
    The -- that is the key to distinguishing the Norwegian Nitrogen case from which the Government relies from it. 
    Norwegian Nitrogen case which they say is very similar was to me almost completely dissembled. 
    First place, if Your Honors will recall in that case, what was involved was a -- a hearing of the Tariff Commission. 
    A public hearing called by the Tariff Commission in -- to receive evidence voluntarily not on the subpoena from anyone that I could find in which -- on which they would base tariff rates on Nitrate of soda. 
    Now, the Norwegian Nitrogen people who would be affected by it, appeared in our position to the American Nitrogen people. 
    And they were given the right of cross-examination and so forth and -- and the only thing that were restricted was certain information bearing upon manufacturing processes of the American Nitrogen people. 
    And I think if the Court will read that case, you will see the question of subpoena was not involved, the -- really the question of due process is entirely different. 
    The same thing is true of McGrain versus Daugherty which they have used in that case, the -- the person subpoenaed was a nephew of the Attorney General not the Attorney General himself. 
    The Attorney General was a person in -- accused. 
    Here, they are subpoenaing the accused which have been pushed in an entirely different aspect on the case.

    There's a difference in the Court. 
    I -- the Court has never agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment made all of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States. 
    But here, we have to consider this on the basis of the whole Bill of Rights, and that was not true in Groban.
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="2578.030" stopTime="2634.177">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    I would like to say one or two things before I sit down. 
    First is this that if Congress intended, specifically intended to give the Commission this authority, we've had an entirely different case. 
    This exact bill is the same bill is up for Congress at this time, right now. 
    If they wish to give them this authority explicitly, they can do it in as -- almost as sooner the time this Court could do it by judgment. 
    That authority resides in Congress and they are sitting over there now considering this bill. 
    If the -- if the Court holds the Commission to the ruling in Greene and these other cases, Congress will be able to -- if they wish to clarify and give them this explicit authority, they will be able to do so. 
    I think that that is a -- a matter that should be weighed very, very carefully in connection with what we are -- are here discussing. 
    Another thing --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2634.177" stopTime="2638.565">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    How -- how can Congress do that if their claims are incorrect and unconstitutional?
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="2638.565" stopTime="2676.320">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    What -- what I'm saying that -- that would remove the principal question involved here in this case which is one of explicit authority. 
    The -- the constitutional basis would also -- but what I believe, I sincerely believe that if this question is presented directly to Congress, Congress will going to make them yield the right of cross-examination and the right of confrontation in -- in notice, make them give it to people that are accused of crimes that are brought before them for an investigation. 
    Now, I don't think Congress are going give them that. 
    But -- but I say that the opportunities there, if Congress wishes to do it, they can remove that principle question by an act at this particular time.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2676.320" stopTime="2699.910">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You -- you agree with the Government that this -- the Court should be against you on the ultra vires of the rules promulgated by the Commission and therefore, when reaches -- therefore, when it's up to -- up again that -- in which way you look at it, up to the constitutional issues that this is the place to decide it and not to set aside.
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="2699.910" stopTime="2700.987">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    But I would have to --

    (Voice Overlap) -- on that.
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="2701.386" stopTime="2731.124">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    I would have to demur for this reason, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    The -- the court below decided the Act itself was constitutional. 
    They -- they specifically refused to decide whether or not the rules, if not ultra vires, were unconstitutional. 
    But I think it -- in all -- according to procedure it should go back to them to decide whether or not assuming that the rules not ultra vires, the rules themselves are unconstitutional.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2731.124" stopTime="2734.265">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I thought they'd already decided that the statute is constitutional?
speaker="w_m_shaw" startTime="2734.265" stopTime="2743.002">
    Mr. W. M. Shaw 
    They decided that the statute insofar that -- might be considered an improper delegation of -- of a legislative authority to be exactly what's constitutional. 
    They -- they specifically reserved --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2743.002" stopTime="2752.181">
