Hertz Corporation v. United States

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- the Hertz Corporation, Petitioner, versus United States. 
    Mr. Bernhard, you may continue your argument.
speaker="edgar_bernhard" startTime="14.090" stopTime="137.702">
    Mr. Edgar Bernhard 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The issues in this Hertz case are similar to those in Evans. 
    This case arises under the 1954 Code and involves the double declining balance method of depreciation, permitted under this Code, but before we get into that method and how it operates, I'd like to pick up counsel's answers to questions put late yesterday by Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    I know that the counsel for the Government, when asked whether the elimination of capital gains, was the real issue here, answered that it was not. 
    But he's apparently unaware that the Government has, on three different occasions, admitted that the elimination of capital gains was its objective. 
    First of those, that I do want to call the Court's attention to, appears in the Government's brief in Evans. 
    The Government stated at page 11 of that brief, the question, in this case, bears upon the proper computation or determination of capital gain. 
    In the Government's opening brief in the Third Circuit below, in the -- in this Hertz case, the Government said at page 40 of that brief, “The simple fact is that the profit is taxable at capital gains rates and taxpayer, under its view, receives the benefit of a deduction at a 52% rate and pays tax on the profit resulting from the increased deduction at a 25% rate." 
    This result can be avoided by defining useful life for purposes of depreciation as meaning, the period during which an asset is useful to the taxpayer together with a reasonable computation of salvage value. 
    This has been done by Section 1.167 (a)-1 (b) of the regulations referring to the 1956 regulations under the 1954 Code.

speaker="edgar_bernhard" startTime="140.028" stopTime="145.146">
    Mr. Edgar Bernhard 
    I was reading from the Third Circuit brief by the -- filed by the Government below in this case.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    All right, thank you.
speaker="edgar_bernhard" startTime="147.308" stopTime="632.839">
    Mr. Edgar Bernhard 
    Third, the Government admits the same point in its brief in this Court. 
    At page 49, it lays stress on the point that the deductions are taken at a 52% rate, whereas, the capital gain rate established by the Congress is 25%. 
    And fourth, the Undersecretary of the Treasury, this month, appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee, in behalf of new legislation in this area. 
    He was asking, he said, for legislation which would “eliminate the opportunity which now exists of converting ordinary gain into capital -- ordinary income into capital gain”. 
    He told about the workings of depreciation, particularly under the double declining balance method and the fact that, as he said, under present law, taxpayers were entitled to take capital gains on the sale of depreciable assets. 
    And on that basis, he asked for statutory change to eliminate capital gains on the sale of depreciable property at least, to the amount of the depreciation taken. 
    Just prior to that and the letter which was -- and the -- the incident which was responsible for the calling of those hearings at which the Undersecretary appeared and said what I've just accounted, was a letter dated February 12, 1960, which appears in our brief in this Court at page 53 in the appendix, Appendix A -- our reply brief, I'm sorry, our reply brief in this case. 
    And at the foot of -- of page 53 of -- of the brief, towards the end of the letter, the Secretary of the Treasury, who has, in this letter, asked for special legislation says “The proposed statutory change which would require the gains from sale of depreciable personal property be treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed, would make it possible for agents of the Internal Revenue Service to accept more readily, taxpayer judgments and taxpayer practices with respect to depreciation rates on salvage value.” 
    In other words, the Secretary of the Treasury is really saying to the Congress, “If you will just give us this legislation to cut off capital gains, we can be much more lenient about our definition of useful life.” 
    What he really means is that he would then be willing, if capital gains can be eliminated by new legislation, to go back to the 40-year practice and the 40-year definition of useful life, not broken until the 1956 regulations were issued. 
    Now, in view of all that, counsel's answer to that question and I want to take up another answer for just a moment, counsel's answer yesterday is simply not understandable, in view of these forthright statements from the Government that its real purpose is to eliminate capital gains by redefining these basic, long standing concepts of useful life and salvage value. 
    Now, the Government also stated to this Court, yesterday, that its practice in the past, in response to a question, its practice in the past was consistent with its position here in these cases, the Evans and Hertz cases. 
    Now, as opposed to all our citations in our briefs to show that this is not the case, the Government's briefs, first of all, answered actually with only one case, the Ludey case, with one sentence from that case which actually is dictum, because the Ludey case, as Your Honors are probably aware, does not deal with useful life, how useful life is to arrived at, the measure of depreciation and the sentence quoted which -- which the -- is the only part of the case that can be quoted at all, that seems at least to have some connection here, is pure dictum as we pointed out in our briefs. 
    And yesterday, in response to a question, counsel for the Government when pressed to name a -- a single case, as we have been asking for the Government to do, a single case prior to the promulgation of the 1956 regulations under the 1954 Code. 
    Not in which, it established the -- its new definition of useful life, but in which it contended for and -- in which it contended for any other definition except the one we are espousing in the Evans and Hertz cases. 
    Counsel finally answered with a single case, the Cohn case, 259 F.2d 371, but the difficulty is that this is in the same category with Evans and Hertz. 
    It was decided in 1958. 
    It's subsequent to the 1956 regulations, it does not meet the --the real question here, whether the Government is now changing position entirely or is simply following up with its past practice. 
    Now, I -- I wonder what the Government has to say today about its rulings, its repeated interpretations of useful life in case after case, and in its own Bulletin “F”, which came up yesterday and which I should like to bring up again in a moment. 
    But as to the cases, in Merkle Broom Company and I can -- I can do each of these in just a second or two. 
    In Merkle Broom Company, a 1926 case before the Board of Tax Appeals, the taxpayers' holding period was two years. 
    The Government claimed a five-year useful life, the whole physical life of the asset. 
    The Board of Tax Appeals held four years and the Commissioner officially acquiesced. 
    In Max Kurtz a year later, 1927, a Board of Tax Appeal case. 
    The holding period, two to three years. 
    The Government claimed a five-year useful life. 
    The Board of Tax Appeals held a five-year useful life. 
    And, of course, the Commissioner officially acquiesced, the whole physical life despite a shorter period of -- a shorter holding period known. 
    In Sanford Cotton Mills, 1929 case, holding period, two and a half years, Government claimed five-year useful life. 
    Board of Tax Appeals held four-year useful life and the Commissioner officially acquiesced, to move along to present day or almost present day, 1956, although there other cases and our -- our briefs present them, in 1956, Pilot Freight Carriers, 15 CCH T.C.Mem.1027, holding period, 32 to 36 months. 
    The Government claimed five years and six years useful life, two kinds of assets, tractors and another kind of vehicle. 
    The other cases were automobile cases. 
    The Government claimed, holding period 32 to 36 months. 
    Government claimed five years and six years useful life. 
    The Tax Court held four years and five years useful life.

    Mr. Edgar Bernhard 
    Well, the -- the reason for the salvage value, if Your Honor please, only appears after the 1954 Code allowing accelerated depreciations, so more depreciation could be taken. 
    And the adjusted basis therefore, reduced. 
    And then, if salvage value is to be interpreted as the Government interprets it, which we don't for a moment agree with, then you get the difference, a wider difference, it's true.

    Mr. Edgar Bernhard 
    Well, no, Your Honor. 
    I -- I wouldn't say that.The -- the reason for this controversy is this, that in 1954, the -- the Government, in granting our 1954 Code in granted, accelerated depreciation including double declining balance method, restricted it to assets with a three-year useful life. 
    It didn't define useful life in the statute, but, of course, you'd pick up the definition that had been standing for all these years. 
    Now, the Government now becomes interested in changing its definition of useful life to holding period, so as to keep down as many assets as possible into the category of assets with less than a three-year useful life, in order that the taxpayer, owner of those assets, will not be able to claim double declining balance.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="794.038" stopTime="796.789">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's the new problem in this case that was not present in the Evans case.
speaker="edgar_bernhard" startTime="796.789" stopTime="865.837">
    Mr. Edgar Bernhard 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    And it forsook, we say, its unbroken attitude about useful life and redefined useful life to holding period in order to get down below the three-year limitation and it's interesting, if the Court please, that in cases where the Government cannot contend for less than a three-year life, because under any definition of useful life, it's three -- it's a three-year life. 
    It's been held for three years and its total useful life is three years, the Government again switches in -- in Schaumburg the -- the Government has switched back and once it is beyond the three-year life for an asset, it then proceeds to stretch it out and go back to its old concept of full physical life. 
    Why? 
    Because it can then, by that method, again reduce the percentage -- the percentage rate of depreciation to be applied to those assets. 
    If it can stay under the three-year limit --

    I guess since other motor vehicles. 
    Automobiles, passenger, five years, salesman, three years and in our case, we rent cars to salesmen, we rent -- we rent cars to other persons, passengers, we took the -- it seems that our four-year life fits perfectly with Bulletin “F”, but in addition to that, we had offered testimony. 
    Testimony in the record, uncontroverted that a four-year useful life is the accepted useful life among accountants, among taxpayers, among business concerns, among renting and leasing companies and has consistently been that. 
    Evans took a four-year useful life since 1936 and in W.N. Foster, 2 T.C.M. 595 in 1943, when the Commissioner was trying to show what useful life was, he said in Bureau Bulletin “F”, “The average useful life of a passenger automobile used in -- of -- in business other than by a salesman is five years”. 
    Petitioners have not proved that the automobile was devoted to such extraordinary uses, Mr. Justice Black, if you please, that -- that the petitioner -- petitioners, the taxpayers have not proved that the automobile was devoted to such extraordinary uses as to justify a higher rate of depreciation than that determined by respondent. 
    That is by the Commissioner, so that what the Commissioner is really saying is, “Here is you guide, if you, the taxpayer, want to bring yourself outside the guide for any reason, put testimony onto show that you don't come within it either because of -- of less peruse or because of extraordinary uses.”

    There was no testimony offered to show that by reason of usage, that that was not before useful life of automobiles. 
    And we also testified to the fact that we had a reasonable maintenance program, a repair program and that our automobiles therefore, had at least, reasonable if not more than reasonable care and as I say, that was uncontroverted by the Government.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I'd like to first advert to the touchstone in this area and that is cost. 
    The whole purpose of the -- of the depreciation deduction is to ascertain what the cost of the use of the physical asset has been to the taxpayer during the year, because by using that asset, he has produced income. 
    The taxes imposed are net income and so, we must deduct his cost from his income. 
    We are not dealing here with wear and tear in the air or in the abstract. 
    We are dealing with the financial figure to be ascribed to wear and tear for the purposes of computing the taxpayer's net income.

speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="1770.550" stopTime="1837.726">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    I think that's right, but we're talking -- if we're talking simply in terms of a rate and we're talking about a rate which when applied aggregates cost, what point is it to base that rate upon factors which are wholly unrelated to the period the taxpayer will use the asset or what he receives when he finishes with the asset. 
    Why would a rate be meaningful? 
    We would suggest if that rate is predicated on a period of years, the asset is used in the taxpayer's business, if among the factors to be ascertained in determining the rate is the mode of operation of the taxpayer, how hard he uses the machine, the climate. 
    Why would we base the period of time which is in terms, the measure of the rate on all this factors which are personal to the taxpayer's operating situation, if we're not concerned that that period of time be -- produce such a rate that when aggregated, cost will be recovered. 
    I mean that is -- that is essentially our point here. 
    It doesn't make any difference to say that the asset will be used 10 years by someone and therefore, the rate should be 10%, if, in fact, you know the taxpayer will only use the asset five years --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1837.726" stopTime="1838.332">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that --
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="1838.332" stopTime="1847.314">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    -- because then the aggregate 10% only equals 50% and we're looking for a rate which when aggregated equals a 100% of the taxpayer's cost.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1847.314" stopTime="1873.490">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is there any reference in the regulation to that fact, Mr. Bernhard stated from the regulation, variations as to the kind of -- the kind of vehicles, three years, four years, five years? 
    Is there any reference in the regulation to the holding periods or is that -- does that all have to be spelled out from your conception of the relation of these factors to cost?
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="1873.490" stopTime="1885.973">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    The regulation states in terms that the proper allowance for depreciation is an amount which when aggregated over the useful life of the property in the business, equals cost.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1885.973" stopTime="1895.034">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well then, that it brings on what useful life means, whether useful life as a thing or useful life as an asset for the particular holder?
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="1895.034" stopTime="1949.432">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Now, we say useful life there means just what the regulation says, useful life of the property in the business, because if it meant anything else, you would not be recovering cost and the purpose of the deduction is to enable the taxpayer to recover cost, if the rate is based on factors which have no bearing and no relationship to the taxpayer's business, there is no guaranty, there is no probability. 
    There is no likelihood that the imposition of the rate when aggregated during the term the taxpayer holds the property will result in 100%. 
    As where the taxpayer determines, 10% to be the rate, because this abstract model is 10 years, but he using it five years. 
    You add five-10% equals 50%. 
    And we say when you know the taxpayer will only hold it five years, you cannot use a 10% rate. 
    You have to use a -- such a rate which will give back cost to the taxpayer.

    They say as I understand it that that simply is a description of the character of assets and they're subject to 117 jail, whatever it is, treatment and you say it means holding period as descriptive of useful life. 
    Your arguments, it seems to me, completely bypass each other. 
    There are arguments from the standpoint of administrative practice and what they argue is the law, your argument from what you conceive to be sound economic theory and you haven't met each other on either premise.

    Good.
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="1991.879" stopTime="2091.783">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    I have also had trouble in understanding what the taxpayer's conception of useful life is here. 
    As a matter of fact, I've just called at random, a few of the different terms he uses to describe it and he calls it whole life, overall life, business life, economic life, inherent functional life, normal useful life, inherent physical life, physical life and economic physical life. 
    Now, those terms can be, I suppose, made to bear any meaning the taxpayer cares to place upon them. 
    The one concession we have extracted from the taxpayer here, which I think is decisive, is that we're dealing with economic life. 
    Now, economic life presumes that there will be factors taken into account other than the engineering factor of physical deterioration of the property. 
    There will be factors other than physical deterioration, economic factors. 
    One of those economic factors we call obsolescence. 
    Other factors, we call inadequacy for use in the taxpayer's business, supersession by invention or technological changes, changes in consumer demands. 
    These are -- there are a host of economic factors and it is those economic factors to which I should like to make reference now, because it has been quite clear from the outset that economic factors other than wear and tear, economic factors peculiar to the taxpayer's business are factors which must be taken into account.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    To put another regulation, what other regulation?
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="2187.899" stopTime="2193.201">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Well, our regulations which have -- which have been with us since the Revenue Act of 1918.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2193.201" stopTime="2198.466">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes, but which one -- which one's significant to our problem?
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="2198.466" stopTime="2315.978">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Well, I think all of the -- all of the regulations from the time that the depreciation deduction was put in other statute are significant. 
    And I think that all of them show that from the outset, economic factors other than physical deterioration were all considered as relevant in determining useful life and they are economic factors which are dependent upon an analysis of the taxpayer's business alone. 
    Now, the regulations, for example, from the start have said, with respect to depreciation in the case of tangible property, it applies to that which is subject to wear and tear from natural causes and to obsolescence due to the normal progress of the art or the becoming inadequate to the growing needs of the business. 
    Now, there is an indication that there are economic factors which must be taken into account. 
    Now, that has always been in the regulations and the Commissioner has always taken the position that economic factors are to be taken into account. 
    I'd like to advert to Bulletin “F”, if I may for a minute. 
    And Bulletin “F” says, with respect to depreciation, “Past experience furnishes a reliable guide for the determination of the useful life of the property. 
    Such a determination should reflect all the peculiar circumstances of the use or operation of the property such as the purpose for which it is utilized. 
    The conditions under which it used or operated, the policy as to repairs with new rules and improvements in the climatic and other local conditions.” 
    Now, on the salvage value, Bulletin “F” has said, “Salvage value is the amount realizable from the sale or other disposition of the items recovered when property has become no longer useful in the taxpayer's business.” 
    Now, all of these factors are geared. 
    They are keys to an analysis of economic factors which bear upon the way the taxpayer operates his business.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2315.978" stopTime="2317.678">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Are those the old regulations?
speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="2317.678" stopTime="2606.672">
    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Those regulations have been in effect and substantially that form since 1918. 
    The whole concept of obsolescence has been one which has been adopted by this Court in situations which while precisely the same facts were not presented, this was by analogy, the principle was directly applicable in the case decided by this Court in 1932, U.S. Cartridge Company against the United States. 
    The taxpayer had built an ammunition plant in 1914 on property which he leased. 
    The lease ran until 1924 at which time he would have to leave the premises and leave the building there, of course. 
    He had never been in a business of making military ammunition and did this as part of the war effort. 
    When the war terminated in 1918, he had no more orders and he sought to take a large deduction for obsolescence of his plant in that year. 
    There is no question that this plant physically, which had been built new in 1914, as an abstract proposition had many, many years to run both beyond the end of the war and beyond the termination of the lease. 
    The Commissioner contended not as he would have contended had taxpayer's theory been correct. 
    He did not contend that depreciation or -- was to be allowed over the period of the abstract model life of a factory, let us say 50 years or 40 years. 
    He contended that the cost of the plant should be taken over the unremaining period of the lease. 
    That is until 1924. 
    Now, why did he choose 1924 as the terminus? 
    Because that was the period when the taxpayer's holding period ended and he -- he also contended that the taxpayer should not take obsolescence in 1918 because it's a factual matter. 
    It has not been demonstrated that he could no longer use the plant for any commercial, whatever. 
    But the principle was the -- the principle which the Commissioner supported was the principle that the holding period of the taxpayer is one of the essential factors in determining the useful life of property to him. 
    Now, this Bulletin “F”, for example, in another analogous situation, provides with respect to bridges that the useful life of a bridge shall be so many years unless otherwise limited by a franchise. 
    Now again, the purpose of limiting it to a franchise is because this limits the taxpayer's holding period of the property and to base a rate of depreciation upon a period which went beyond the franchise, would not provide that the aggregate amounts during the period of the taxpayer's holding of the property that is, the franchise period, would equal the amount of the cost he had incurred. 
    Now, these have always been in Bulletin “F”, the feature with respect to the lease that I mentioned is also in Bulletin “F” when it talks about furniture and fixtures in certain retail businesses, where it says that the normal average useful life shall be so much, unless otherwise limited by the term of the lease. 
    Now, the purpose again of limiting it to the lease is because that limits the holding period of the taxpayer. 
    And again, mathematically, you will not aggregate cost if you based the rate on a period which is not coextensive with the actual facts, with the period the taxpayer will be using the property. 
    The regulations have always provided with respect to the depreciation of mining equipment. 
    That mining equipment shall be depreciated for their abstract normal useful life, unless the mineral deposit will wear out, will be terminated, will no longer be useful in a shorter period. 
    If that is so, in that event, the taxpayer will depreciate his mining equipment over the shorter period, over the economic life of the property. 
    Now, in many of those cases, both the mining equipment is theoretically usable. 
    An engineer could analyze it and say, “Well, it's got so many more years of abuse left.” 
    And the reason we're not interested in that is because we are solely interested in returning to the taxpayer his cost. 
    We are not interested in wear and tear in the abstract. 
    And you can see that in the normal application of straight line depreciation. 
    Even on the taxpayer's theory, he takes 25% in the first year. 
    Well now, I'm sure that engineering studies would show that the actual rate of physical wear and tear is much less in the earlier years and increases vastly in the later years.

    We would not use straight line depreciation and a fortiori, we would not use the double declining balance method which accentuates the deductions in the early years running directly contrary to the curve of physical depreciation.

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    Well, like I'm unable to refer to the Court to a -- to car rental businesses. 
    I can refer the Court for example, to the Corsicana Gas and Electric case, which was a B.T.A. decided in 1927. 
    There, a power company had a plant which had not physically deteriorated and had many years of life left in it. 
    Because there, the local town grew at a pace which exceeded the capacity of this plant, the taxpayer knew that it would have to build a new and larger plant. 
    It was permitted to deduct the cost of the plant over the shorter period, not because the property had physically depreciated, not because the property in the abstract model sense had reached the end of its life, but because the unique facts affecting the taxpayer's business made it perfectly clear. 
    He was not going to hold that property any longer. 
    And therefore, the necessity arose, if he was to recover his cost to permit deductions over the shorter period. 
    Now, that's a case affecting a power plant. 
    That kind --

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    No. 
    Believe these were cases where there was also no controversy over the physical life of the property. 
    The -- these were all cases where the question was granted the physical life of the property, are the economic facts surrounding the taxpayer's business such that we are justified in cutting down the life from that physical life because of these operating facts. 
    Now, on the power plant case, it was because of facts which were utterly unrelated to the physical rate of deterioration of the property to the growth of the local community requiring the taxpayer to use this plant for a shorter period of time.

    Mr. Howard A. Heffron 
    I'm not aware of it and I should think a taxpayer would have to make a very great showing based upon their legislative history and the language of the Act to justify a situation where he is entitled to deduct on his income tax return as they saw it here. 
    From the income, he realizes through use of an asset more than the cost of the use of that asset to him during the year. 
    As a matter of fact here, the statute says very specifically that it shall be a reasonable allowance for depreciation and we would say that it is not a reasonable allowance for depreciation when you depart from the fundamental principle of returning to the taxpayer his cost.

    You do have other depletion statutes with respect to stumpage, coal, other things, do you not?

    Mr. Edgar Bernhard 
    Since 1918 in Hertz. 
    These income tax returns year after year showed the four-year life for automobiles and if that was not the practice and the consistent practice over all those years, it seems to me that the Government would surely have put someone on the stand to answer, for example, what the -- one of the accountants said in the Hertz case, record page 46. 
    He said he had under his supervision, an informal review of the practice of industry not solely that of a rent-a-car business, but general businesses in many lines. 
    And just as rough example, we had accumulated companies, whose gross sales were about $5 billion and in those cases, the average life was four years and a preponderant use by these companies was four years.

    Mr. Edgar Bernhard 
    Now, Your Honor, the testimony -- the clear testimony in Hertz and in Evans uncontroverted, is that there is no practice. 
    There is no rule and that the -- the selling of automobiles, the time of selling the automobiles is dependent upon unpredictable factors. 
    It is no part of wear and tear. 
    It is dependent upon such factors as strikes and lockouts in automobile factories, in the companies which delivered the cars. 
    What our competitors do, war or peace, weather conditions even, new demands, new compact cars for instance, shall they sell their cars and buy compact cars or will that compact car not be accepted. 
    It's easy to hindsight, to use hindsight, but most difficult to say in 1948 what you ought to do in 1950. 
    Now, whether you are going to sell your cars in 1950, 1949 or 1952 and what the conditions will be which will permit you to sell and buy new ones or whether they will not be available.

    Mr. Edgar Bernhard

    In the -- in the Massey case, the -- the record, I believe, shows that Massey was a dealer in cars, not through of Evans or Hertz, that he, from time to time, shifted cars, which he owned as a dealer, into car renting or leasing. 
    And then shifted them back or sold them, let's say after a six-month period or shortly thereafter and there is no such indication in either Evans or Hertz, plus the fact that he consistently sold the cars. 
    I think the Court will find consistently sold the cars for more than his cost and the -- the dealer question is very much in the -- in the Massey case as it is now. 
    It's not at all in the -- in the Evans or Hertz case.
