Miner v. Atlass

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 156, Honorable Julius H. Miner and Honorable Edwin A. Robson, Petitioners, versus H. Leslie Atlass. 
    Mr. Liebenson, you may now proceed.
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="34.686" stopTime="285.112">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court. 
    This is a case in admiralty. 
    It arose out of an occurrence in October 26, 1956, where two men were drowned in the Detroit Harbor Basin, who were alleged as crewmen of a yacht known as Sis, while returning from their shore leave. 
    Each men left a wife and three children, and the only persons present at the scene of this occurrence were members of the crew or members who were employees of the owner of the yacht. 
    In an effort to get information, the plaintiff in this case filed a motion for to -- for discovery depositions as to one of the parties and two or three of the employees. 
    The lower court granted said motion and I must point out that there was a local admiralty rule in this Court and the respondent then took -- sought a mandamus and prohibition writ in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to prevent the taking of said depositions, oral and pretrial for discovery purposes only and Judge Lynn Parkinson wrote a -- an opinion, holding that the writ of prohibition and mandamus should issue, which was issued, preventing the taking of the oral discovery depositions and further held that the local Admiralty Rule for this District, Rule 32 was void in that it exceeded the power of the local court. 
    This Court granted certiorari. 
    I -- I might point out one other thing. 
    This is an admiralty because of a limitation action. 
    Previous to the limitation action being filed, a Jones Act suit was filed by one of the deceased -- decedent's representatives and the -- then the limitation action was filed and an injunction was issued preventing the proceeding under the Jones Act. 
    So that the question we have is whether or not, oral pretrial discovery depositions are permissible in an admiralty case. 
    The question is only -- is one of procedure but it affects the whole of the admiralty bar because it would -- if the Court so holds in accordance with the Seventh Circuit, it will mean that it's going to change the practice and procedure of the admiralty lawyers throughout the country. 
    I say this because the following district courts in the following states have similar admiralty rule -- local Admiralty Rules pertaining to depositions, pretrial depositions, as similar to the one we have in our State, New York, Pennsylvania --

    Yes.

    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    No, sir. 
    He mentioned that it wasn't discussed. 
    This all came after the -- the New York rules, sir, came into effect after the Kelleher case when Judge Kaufman was appointed to the committee to formulate a rule and -- and then the rule and the practice followed thereafter.

    No.

    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Yes sir, and it is the uniform and universal practice of all lawyers in New York to follow such rule.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You -- would you clear up my -- I don't understand. 
    I understand the Mercado decision to say that that is beyond the power of courts, is that?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="389.515" stopTime="390.839">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Right, sir, but --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="390.839" stopTime="392.734">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well then how can it be still persisting?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="392.734" stopTime="399.801">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    No. 
    The -- the -- the -- what I have meant to say was that the -- in the Mercado Case is not the law today.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="399.801" stopTime="400.455">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's not.

    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    No, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="401.120" stopTime="404.275">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well has that been overruled by decision of the Court of Appeals?

    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    By the -- by the local court rule.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="407.787" stopTime="411.281">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But how could the District Court overrule the Court of Appeals even in New York?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="411.281" stopTime="434.090">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Because sir it is a question -- in the first place, sir, the Mercado case passed on the proposition of whether or not, the Court had the right to accept a -- evidence deposition as evidence and not as to the taking of evidence.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="434.090" stopTime="438.037">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    What is the point of --

    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    I'm trying to help sir.

    -- this if we can't use it.
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="441.307" stopTime="442.111">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    What is the point of the case?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="442.111" stopTime="446.699">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What is the point of authorizing the taking of their position if it's inadmissible as evidence?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="446.699" stopTime="451.977">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Because one is -- one is a pretrial discovery deposition --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="451.977" stopTime="452.118">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Can it be used for trial --
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="452.118" stopTime="487.990">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    -- for the purpose of discovery and the other is for the using of the -- of evidence -- of the deposition as evidence in a trial and there is a great distinction between the two. 
    In a pretrial discovery deposition, all you're trying to seek is information. 
    In taking an evidence deposition or when you try to utilize evidence from a pretrial deposition, you need a substantive law or substantive right to give you this.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="487.990" stopTime="489.303">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well take your case.
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="489.303" stopTime="489.492">

    I'd love --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you -- what are you after here, the deposition?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="492.693" stopTime="509.912">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    We're after a deposition so we can find out what happened because we have two men who have died and all the people who were around the scene belong to the boat who are employees and we can't get any information unless we ask them about it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="509.912" stopTime="514.873">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well the information that was authorized by Judge Miner and Judge -- well Judge Miner --
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="514.873" stopTime="515.105">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="515.105" stopTime="519.525">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- would that be useful to get about the decision? 
    Would that be utilized here by you at the trial?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="519.525" stopTime="525.433">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    No sir. 
    It's not for the trial. 
    It's only for discovery purposes to give us a basis to proceed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="525.433" stopTime="534.941">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The basis -- the basis on which subsequently, but you can't use it. 
    Is it a general rule that you can't use what you get in a pre -- pretrial discovery?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="534.941" stopTime="535.329">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Unless --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="535.329" stopTime="536.249">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- as evidence?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="536.249" stopTime="550.243">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Yes sir, unless for two reasons. 
    Number one, for impeachment purposes and second in order to use it for -- for evidence you have to have a specific statute granting you the right to do so.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="550.243" stopTime="559.234">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, can you use it -- at Miner of course. 
    Can you use it? 
    Could we use it for impeachment purposes if you are going to prevail in this case?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="559.234" stopTime="560.215">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    I'd say, yes sir because anything --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="560.215" stopTime="563.783">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is it under the Mercado decision of Judge Clark?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="563.783" stopTime="566.995">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    I don't consider the Mercado decision the law sir, because --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="566.995" stopTime="567.422">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well --
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="567.422" stopTime="568.847">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    -- because there has been so much.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="568.847" stopTime="588.740">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't know if it isn't the law. 
    What I want to know is that the decision of the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit and I want to know whether that governed litigation of Southern District of New York. 
    And the reason I persist about the Southern District of New York is because that of course is the most important admiralty centre in the country.
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="588.740" stopTime="589.988">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Yes. 
    That's my point, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="589.988" stopTime="592.101">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And so, it's important for me to understand --
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="592.101" stopTime="592.513">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Since --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="592.513" stopTime="596.652">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- what the practice, the allowable practice in New York is.
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="596.652" stopTime="616.287">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    I -- I thought I made the statement too, Your Honor that the practice in New York is that there is universal taking of discovery depositions in admiralty cases based upon the local rule.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="616.287" stopTime="628.446">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now my question is whether with Mercado on the books, could a proctor in New York impeach, use the pretrial discovery materials for impeachment purposes?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="628.446" stopTime="674.564">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    The question that I say is my -- this is my opinion. 
    The answer is yes because you are not using it. 
    When you use something for impeachment, you are not using it as direct evidence. 
    You are using it to refute a story that someone is telling from the witness stand whereas if you took evidence, a deposition, then you would read all the evidence into the case as though it were a witness testifying on the stand. 
    In this other situation that you ask me, all you are saying to the person, did you not say under oath or at this and this time and then you only ask one question if it applies and only it has to be material when applied.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="674.564" stopTime="692.865">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do I understand you to say that if this case -- if this question, the use a free trial discovery material for impeachment purposes came up before the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, Judge Clark sitting, he would say that the Mercado case doesn't apply.
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="692.865" stopTime="694.661">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    I think so and I tell you why sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="694.661" stopTime="696.470">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is there any decision on that?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="696.470" stopTime="741.106">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Because right within six weeks after he wrote the decision in the Mercado case, the Republic of France versus Belships case came up which -- where it was decided in that case and that -- the citation on that is District Court 1950 and the citation 184, F 2d 119. 
    In that case, the court, the lower court, decided that as long as there was a rule, a local rule, then you are entitled to pretrial discovery deposition.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="741.106" stopTime="742.624">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is that after the Mercado?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="742.624" stopTime="784.993">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Yes sir. 
    Yes sir and then the same -- At that time, the Attorney did as the Attorney in our case did, sought a mandamus and prohibition -- no, just a mandamus action into the Court of Appeals asking that this be prevented. 
    And in the -- in the Republic of France versus Belships case, the Judge Clark who sat -- who wrote the Mercado case and also said on the -- in the decision of that case held that they were not entitled to mandamus and in effect held that the lower court ruling was correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="784.993" stopTime="795.666">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you -- are you -- am I wrong or right in finding Judge Clark's opinion in Mercado and Judge Fee's opinion in Dowling in contradiction.
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="795.666" stopTime="805.795">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    I'd said so yes on a different basis but I'd say that they are -- they are in contradiction. 
    We cite the Dowling case as a basis in --

    As a basis for what?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="807.487" stopTime="810.613">

    For permitting oral discovery depositions.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="810.613" stopTime="812.407">

    But not --

    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    The law of the Southern District of New York is the -- is the law that has been cited in the -- in the cases which I would be glad to -- which we cite in our brief but which hold that where there has been where there is a local rule in force, then you have the right to take an oral discovery deposition and that came up in the Ludina case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="848.385" stopTime="864.388">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well I'm sorry to break-in on your argument, but when you said the Southern District of New York, that naturally raised a very important question in my mind because if you're right about that then I must reread Mercado and get a different understanding of it.
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="864.388" stopTime="878.093">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    I -- If I -- In our petition for certiorari, if the Court please, we presented letters and I have many more from all the leading practitioners in admiralty.

    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    Because sir, it's material in that if this rule, if the Court holds that pretrial oral discovery depositions are not permissible in admiralty cases, that means that everyone of these states which have local rules and which are the coastal states and which are the great lake states that handle all the admiralty cases are going to have change their whole practice and their whole procedures.

    The -- this oral deposition is such a vital and important factor because of -- of very many things.

    It gives the lawyers the chance to go out and obtain and determine the facts. 
    It eliminates the element of surprise that has been so much a part of cases in the past and that has -- they have tried to eliminate at the present time.

    We have been utilizing that to great assistance, because take this case. 
    We're not permitted, if we're not permitted to go ahead and take oral debt -- discovery depositions, the only alternative would be written interrogatories. 
    Now for written interrogatories, these are -- these are made up at the attorney's office. 
    Questions are in advance, the attorney can ask the person a question, then write it down, but you don't get the opportunity to know exactly what the person who is giving the information knows. 
    Whether its hearsay, whether this person is going to make a good witnessing court, whether it's a personal takes a very, makes a believable statement and whether or not the questions that are so important to determine all the facts can be answered by this witness. 
    So, how can an attorney on their faces say to his client, “Well I know everything about this case and this is what I recommend, because we're -- we're just held in the dark and yet it's pretty difficult to make a recommendation until you see all of this from the witness stand.”

    It's got to be something, sir, material for instance, if a -- if you ask a witness on a deposition of what day, whether it was a Monday, or Tuesday, or Wednesday, that -- that isn't important. 
    He may make a mistake, but what if it goes to the very significant thing that as in this case, that there was no board so these man could get on or off this boat present and one witness says, “This witness who maybe an employer or someone comes in and tells under oath that this is so, there was a board and you have 10 witnesses who will say there is no board. 
    Isn't this significant for you to know so you can tell your client that they have one witness who says it?

    Let us not I should state what my brother Whittaker said to you, a little differently. 
    He said the correction is whether this Court has given the District Court the power to order a pretrial discovery. 
    I should defer to put in not whether it has given it because plainly it hasn't given it, but whether it has left it to them. 
    And the argument from my point of view that you have to meet is that this Court in 1939 in revising the Admiralty Rules explicitly took over a number of the civil procedure rules, but as the Second Circuit found, significantly didn't take this one over.

    What I'm saying is that here is Judge Clark, who wrote an opinion even though it doesn't go as far as one that assumes from reading, he does go at great length and with great particularly to his great regret to the conclusion that there is great significance that this rule of the Civil Procedure, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, was significantly omitted when it did deal with cognitive rules which it included.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1866.004" stopTime="1872.240">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you know whether any rule like that has been submitted to this Court by the Judicial Conference or by others?
speaker="harold_a_liebenson" startTime="1872.240" stopTime="2126.546">
    Mr. Harold A. Liebenson 
    No, sir. 
    There was some – in one of the other briefs that we read, there was some discussion about the Maritime Law Association had some discussion about it and then we don't -- there was no information that we've been able to obtain. 
    Someone else may have it and we tried to get it and we couldn't. 
    Now, the significance as to whether or not, Rule 44 applies -- or whether Rule 46 applies and the de bene esse applies, I think should be taken into considerations. 
    In the first place, in Rule 46 to the Supreme Court, talks about in all trials testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally in open court unless otherwise provided. 
    Now, counsel in his brief has made much of this and this is why I bring it up. 
    Rule 46 applies to trials. 
    De bene esse also applies to taking evidence for trial purposes. 
    In the Carpenter versus Winn case, this Court held that trial does not include the pretrial matters or matters preliminary to trial. 
    The purpose I bring this up is this. 
    If we were trying to take a deposition rule for evidence, Rule 46 and the de bene esse statute would apply. 
    However, where we take a pretrial oral discovery deposition, which is not used as evidence but is a matter preliminary to trial, we are in no way talking about a trial or we are talking about evidence for a trial. 
    What we are talking about is a discovery procedure which does not affect any substantive right. 
    And as long as it doesn't affect any substantive right, then we know that we do not need a special statute or a special power and the Court then has the right to take it under Rule 44 in 2071 and 2073. 
    Now, of all the cases that have been decided, we have categorized them into four branches. 
    The first, the cases decided prior to there being the local rule are where a local rule was not taken into consideration. 
    In those cases, counsel cites three cases; one the Mulligan case, two the Mercado case and three the Kelleher case. 
    Now, on the Kelleher case which was in 1950 and after the others, the judge who wrote the decision in that case denying the right for an oral deposition became the judge who wrote -- headed the committee for Rule 46 which is now their local rule and which is followed to this day in the practice. 
    All these have been Southern District New York cases that counsel has cited. 
    In the second category, decisions basing the right to take the pretrial oral discovery depositions because of Admiralty Rule 32 (c), we cite the Brown versus Isthmian, the Bunge, the Ballantrae, and the Galperin cases which appear in our brief. 
    In this case -- in this situation, the judges took the attitude that Section 32 (c) written as it was has sufficient basis to infer the right to take oral pretrial depositions. 
    In the first group of cases, there was no local rule involved.

    I think we need a little housekeeping to start with. 
    My learned friend states that after Judge Clark held in the Mercado case that the application of Rule 26 of the civil rules in admiralty was inconsistent with the statutes and the rules of this Court, but then six months later, he reversed himself and held to contrary, and that there was a right to take on all the depositions for discovery in admiralty. 
    I don't have some offense with Judge Clark. 
    I have been before him. 
    This Court has law. 
    I think perhaps it maybe truly said of that wonderful gentleman that once he gets his teeth into an idea anybody who can get him out in six months is a miracle. 
    What Judge Clark held --

    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    Well no. 
    What Judge Clark held in the subsequent case was that where witnesses only had been required to appear, they have an adequate remedy by appeal from an order of contempt. 
    And that for that reason the Court of Appeals would not employ the extraordinary renting of mandamus or prohibition, citing this Court's decisions as to the extreme standard of urgency that must exist for that extraordinary remedy where there is appellate interference with interlocutory proceedings of (Inaudible), stating that he did not see that this case complied with those standards and for that reason declining an interlocutory remedy and not holding for one second that he had retreated one millimeter from the views that he so clearly stated in Mercado.

    That enlightens me a little bit on what – on what the distinction that Judge Fee made without passing on it between the requirements of a party as against the witness.
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="3145.552" stopTime="3400.104">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    I shall have more to say to that if I -- as I go along. 
    My friend has stated that they have this rule throughout the State of New York. 
    That is not my information. 
    I am not a practitioner in New York. 
    I do not have that distinction, but neither has my learned friend. 
    I am informed by able admiralty practitioners in New York whom I know well that there is no such rule in the Eastern District of New York and I know the Western District has specifically held that it would not be valid to make one. 
    The law in the Second Circuit is the law as declared by Mercado, and Mercado is followed by many of the judges in the Southern District of New York. 
    The Kelleher case for instance, the Erisco case follows it in the Eastern District, Ellis versus Browning is the case in the Western District. 
    I recall I am not certain for the case is only reported today nisi prius that Gulf Oil versus Alcoa was a Southern District case. 
    There exists an unseemly confusion in the Southern District of New York by reason of the fact that allowing witnesses to take an appeal from a contempt order, is not enough to maintain the orderliness of the judicial process at nisi prius and until the Second Circuit exercises its right and power to enforce its stated views of the law as declared in Mercado, that will continue and it was partly for that reason that the Seventh Circuit said there wasn't going to be anything of that kind within the scope of it's territorial jurisdiction. 
    My learned friend refers to a long list of District Courts, statutory courts of the United States, according to the ideas of legislative policy that have filled to them at different times and places have undertaken to make local rules upon this subject. 
    He refers to them as the cases around the coasts of the United States, but his list does not exhaust that geography according to my understanding of it. 
    You won't try that kind of thing if you go to New Orleans or to many other ports. 
    Now I'm not going to debate with him the desirability or undesirability of a particular form of pretrial discovery. 
    It occurs to me with all difference to him that that is not his business and it is not mine and it's not an appropriate matter for the judicial process. 
    Such considerations of policy are legislative matters and this Court has been appointed by Congress certain legislative functions to be exercised only in cooperation with Congress. 
    The rules must be submitted before they become effect -- effective.

    Admiralty rule?
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="3401.204" stopTime="3579.197">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    Admiralty rules, yes sir, by Section 2073 of the new judicial code. 
    Furthermore, you could always have done it if you had wanted to under the revised statutes. 
    Ever since 1878, this Court has had the power to prescribe the mode of obtaining, discovering inequity and admiralty. 
    You have never done that. 
    I was interested in the question as to whether or not, this Court had ever been approached with such a suggestion. 
    My learned friend, according to his explanation unfortunately did not have access to the sources of information on that particular point. 
    That occurred in 1949. 
    Document number 328 of the Maritime Law Association of the United States, reports it. 
    It was raised here in the argument, it isn't in my brief. 
    I'll tell you what it says. 
    It says that certain gentleman and members of the bar came to this Court and they came from the Southern District of New York. 
    And they suggested a revision of the rules that, this was 1949, that would have allowed discovery depositions in admiralty. 
    And the committee reported to the membership of their association as follows and I quote “The Chief Justice, however, decided that the previous and present deposition practice under revised statute 863, 864 and 865 which are not repealed, was satisfactory and does not require restatement. 
    Hence, he did not send any report on a new Admiralty Rule to Congress. 
    Our suggested text has been withdrawn. 
    At this time, there is no Admiralty Rule pending or under discretion. 
    This position appears to us to be satisfactory. 
    It leaves our admiralty practice unchanged.

    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    Report of the committee on the revision of Title 28, U.S. Code. 
    Now as I said, I am not going to engage with my friend in a debate on whether admiralty oral deposition discovery is a good idea or not. 
    I point out that it has been explicitly decided by this Court that it isn't a good idea. 
    This Court may at anytime change its mind, but it hasn't. 
    If it changes its mind, it will change it, one assumes, in the way appointed by Congress for the exercise of its legislative function rather than as part of the judicial process. 
    This Court having already, in an earlier case cited in my briefs, rejected a suggestion coming from none other than the Attorney General of the United States in an opinion by the Chief Justice that a rule which the Attorney General regarded as nationalistic in admiralty law, the -- rejected in favor of the civil practice in the exercise of the judicial function, and the reply being that is not the judicial function. 
    The judicial function is to know the law, to find the law, to enforce the law, but the legislative function is to make the law. 
    And when this Court acts under the legislative function that Congress has committed to it in the manner that Congress has prescribed, that's one thing but not in the exercise of a particular case, not to change the rules in the middle of the game, if that isn't the dirty word when discovering, discussing discovery. 
    It's inconceivable that counsel should make such a distinction as he undertakes to make, I say it's inconceivable, I retract and apologize. 
    Counsel has undertaken to make a distinction between taking depositions on the one hand and the use of depositions on the other and he has undertaken it under the Mercado case. 
    What the Mercado case held was based on some hard law according to what His Honor, Judge Clark, called the ordinary ground rules of judicial decision. 
    And that law was -- that the existing rules of this Court and the existing statutes to which the de bene esse were inconsistent with what was attempted to be done in deposition discovery practice in that case. 
    Now in that case to be sure, they had used the depositions below. 
    And that is something that is covered by the de bene esse act. 
    But equally and in the first section of the de bene esse act, the taking of depositions is covered, covered by a carefully considered elaborate quote which says “Just when you can take depositions,” that statute applying in admiralty. 
    You can take some them when a witness resides more than a thousand, a hundred miles in the place of trial, bound on the voyage to seas, he is bound out of the countries or something of that kind, in those circumstances you can take, but you take them high, you take them de bene esse. 
    What does that mean? 
    De bene esse is defined by Bouvier. 
    The examination of the witness de bene esse takes place where there is danger of losing the testimony of an important witness from death by reason of age or dangerous illness, or where he is the only witness to an important fact. 
    In such case if a witness be alive at the time of trial, his examination is not to be used, but you can't take it unless there's danger of losing it. 
    The examination in certain cases, the courts will allow evidence to be taken out of the regular course in order to prevent the evidence being lost by the death or the absence of the witness. 
    This is called taking evidence de bene esse. 
    Now it is the de bene esse acts that are preserved by Congress for admiralty and for admiralty alone, and to take the witnesses' testimony for any other purpose or under any other conditions and those that are prescribed by the statute of the United States -- is inconsistent with the statutes and since when could District Courts of the United States make rules that changed federal procedural statutes. 
    My friend says that it isn't inconsistent because it doesn't affect a substantive right. 
    I'm not prepared to engage in a semantic fencing match as to the meaning of the words, procedure or substantive. 
    I prefer to go directly to the substance of the situation and that is that where you have a court say to a man, drop your ordinary affairs, go to a lawyers office, sit there as long as we think we want you too or have a use for you, but answer everything he asks you. 
    And so that lay not only with reference to framed issues but if he thinks he can maybe find out something that would equip. 
    When you do that to a man, you invade what from the time of Coats institutes has been known as common right. 
    I don't care whether it's procedural or whether it's substantive, that's rough.

    I have a good deal to say about it Your Honor. 
    The first of which if you will permit me is this that you are asking me a question on which I should like to hold fort for a long time at a legislative hearing. 
    There is a difference between law and equity on the one end and admiralty on the other right in this respect. 
    I would love to go into that, but I submit that as Your Honor so permanently pointed out to counsel who preceded me, the question is not whether it's a good idea but as this Court felt and found it to be a good idea and authorized it.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4269.803" stopTime="4282.269">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The question isn't whether we've done it. 
    It is a quite question is whether it is forbidden to the District Courts to do it, in lieu of this Court having explicitly authorizing it, a manifest statement of the issue.
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="4282.269" stopTime="4336.034">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    Well a district court's -- do District Courts require, I'm not trying to mince with Your Honor but I do think it's important to distinguish between the means by which District Courts acquire power. 
    District Courts would not acquire power I suppose by non action of anybody. 
    District Courts must have affirmative power given to them, that's obvious, I apologize for undertaking to make the distinction coming directly to what Your Honors I'm sure meant in asking is this action by the District Court authorized in the absence of any statutory authority and -- which is substantially conceded it doesn't have now by counsel. 
    Then the next question is, is this statutory authority?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4336.034" stopTime="4359.620">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well there -- you said you would agree that there are rules which District Courts may promulgate for the conduct of admiralty litigation that clearly would not be in conflict with the promulgated admiralty rules of this country of 1939. 
    And then the question is, is this one of those or is it -- I didn't mean to imply, if I said anything that --
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="4359.620" stopTime="4631.555">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    I know I apologize for it I guess, I understand. 
    Coming directly to that which of course is the next obvious step in the discussion, counsel relies on what. 
    He relies on Rule 44. 
    What does Rule 44 say? 
    Rule 44 says that in matters not provided for by these rules, that's number one, the District Courts can regulate their practice provided their regulations are not inconsistent with the rules of this Court. 
    Now first thing I wish to point out is that the two limitations, first, that the matter must be one not provided for by this Court's Admiralty Rule. 
    But even in matters not provided for by this Court's Admiralty Rules, it is possible for a District Court to strike off in some directions. 
    It would be inconsistence with the policy of the rules of this Court and therefore the second proviso is that there are two distinct limitations upon the rule making power of the District Courts. 
    That is Rule 44. 
    That is not a statute. 
    That comes as a rule. 
    That's a rule of this Court and certainly this Court did not undertake to exalt the power of District Courts beyond those powers which the Congress which created them had given. 
    And therefore, we must find behind that rule a statutory authority and that statutory authority is the statutory authority presumably that existed when Rule 44 was adopted which was before the current Judicial Code. 
    Under a statutory situation which expressly, explicitly and in terms confided to this Court the power to prescribe the mode of taking discovery to the District Courts. 
    Indeed the intention of Congress by making that provision one of giving power to this Court was so clearly designed to create uniformity, national uniformity of practice in that regard, that it is conceded of all people even by Judge Fee and referred to by petitioners in their brief. 
    And when Congress passed the new Judicial Code, it said that this Court -- the constitutional court and the only one and all courts, the statutory courts could do what, for they could make rules for the regulation of their business. 
    But such rule shall not be inconsistent with rules of practice prescribed by the Supreme Court. 
    This is no housekeeping rule. 
    This is a rule of vital importance as evidenced by the fact that under the statutory situation on which- - under which Rule 44 was adopted, the power to prescribe them to taking discovery was given to this Court, the only Court whose rules operate generally. 
    As evidence to gain by the fact that this Court has over the years, ever since 1844 specifically legislated as it had the power to do by these national rules with respect to the mode of taking discovery.

    Up to 1913 that was substantially the course of procedure in equity suits until oral testimony was introduced.
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="4749.636" stopTime="5125.507">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    I'm interested that to the fact - in effect that Your Honor refers to equity. 
    One statute is 88, the handy work of the founding fathers provided that testimony should be taken in open court, in admiralty, and in equity as that common law. 
    There went all the ecclesiastical material. 
    Why? 
    It doesn't work to have trial by deposition without a Court there. 
    They have tried it. 
    They've tried it a long time. 
    They found it (Inaudible). 
    In 1802 in equity, there was a statute that said that if either party wanted to, he could have it done by depositions, in equity, not admiralty. 
    So what did they do? 
    They went to work and they had deposition trials. 
    Until what, until 1861, the December term of this Court when somebody dug up that statute, one statute 88 that never had been repealed and this Court amended equity Rule 67 to provide that either party could require that all evidence should be taken in open Court except as provided otherwise by statute or by these rules. 
    Well that didn't work. 
    Either party can require the judge to do it. 
    The judge is going to decide his case on the facts that he want to sit there and listen to all evidence. 
    That didn't work. 
    And in --I think it is 11 or 12, federal rule decisions, you will find that eloquent description by a practitioner who practiced them to those rules as to what went on in one of Judge Clark's symposiums on discovery. 
    Now what did you do? 
    In 1912, seeing that that didn't work, you passed a further amendment to Rule 67, the one to which I referred. 
    And it was pretty hard to get district judges to set those cases for trial. 
    You prescribe the order in which they were set for trial. 
    The judges wouldn't do it and in one of the cases cited in my brief to the lower court it's printed in the record. 
    You have to issue your own writ of mandamus to make it. 
    Judges don't like to hear evidence in district courts. 
    We tried it. 
    We tried it in admiralty. 
    We tried in equity before the United States was formed. 
    We rejected it in 1789. 
    Then we tried it by inadvertence again in equity in this country and it worked out the same way. 
    We rejected it in 1912 and when they tried to suggest the same thing to this Court in 1949 after more than 10 years experience with that kind of business under the civil rules of -- Federal Rules of Civil Procedure tried to introduce it -- reintroduce it in the admiralty, this Court said no. 
    Well was that an accident? 
    Was that inadvertence? 
    What this Court mean to be with the District Courts to do what this Court had refused to do, to create the Joseph's “pattern” to which Mr. Justice Frankfurter referred to be persuaded by considerations of policy which this Court had rejected. 
    Well if it did, why did not this Court leave to District Courts all the other methods of discovery? 
    In admiralty, we've had interrogatories, a necessity for narrative pleading in answer. 
    In 1939 this Court did not leave this matter of discovery to local judicial legislation. 
    It adopted in haec verba the civil rules -- the civil rules for discovery of documents for requiring admissions, for inspection of the person. 
    Several of the rules of discovery from the civil rules adopted in but not Rule 26 for deposition discovery. 
    For when that rule succeeds in doing what it was hope to do, namely, get parties to go off and try their cases without bothering the judge. 
    Then you had what? 
    Then you had trial by deposition all over again, we tried that. 
    Why do we have to learn over again in every generation that the plausible errors of the past are only what they were before?

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Mr. Hayes, may I ask you a question?
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="5127.907" stopTime="5128.315">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    Yes sir.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="5128.315" stopTime="5135.859">

    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    I can call my friend to witness sir, I am.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="5140.648" stopTime="5164.283">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    I'm trying to find out how this works. 
    Suppose now you had this rule that the deposition that you are talking about, you were in Chicago, the other side notifies you that they have a witness in California. 
    Do you have to go there or have somebody there to represent you to take the evidence of that witness? 
    Is -- what's the provision with reference to call?
speaker="edward_b_hayes" startTime="5164.283" stopTime="5361.627">
    Mr. Edward B. Hayes 
    May I give Your Honor an example right straight out of the book? 
    An Illinois ex -- either exporter or importer, I don't recall which had some goods that were damaged by a vessel. 
    Well the vessel stopped only on the east coast, the Southern District of New York. 
    So what did he do? 
    He filed the characteristic action in admiralty and the action in rem which must be brought where the vessel is. 
    They had this rule in the Southern District of New York and what did they do? 
    The Court said there's nothing in the affidavits that would indicate that anybody in Chicago knows a thing about this. 
    But the respondent says that he wants to take the deposition for a discovery of the people in Chicago to see if they do and so what? 
    So you proctor for this libelant must bring his managing officers here to New York and pay their expenses yourself or else if you prefer, you can pay the expenses of counsel for the respondent to go Chicago because discovery deposition is so much better than interrogatory deposition. 
    One case referred to in five federal rules decisions and the symposium by one of the counsel in the -- the case begins that - you held that lawyers didn't have to produce his own work product, that's Hickman against Taylor. 
    That lawyer told of cases in which he had been required to bring all his witnesses from farm states and sit them down in the office of counsel for the other section. 
    That isn't going to work in admiralty. 
    Crews go all over the world. 
    Vessels go all over the world. 
    If there is a problem as to the possibility of imposition by the use of depositions and every advocate of those rules admits there is such a problem. 
    That problem is multiplied by a very high factor when you try to import it into Admiralty. 
    I can understand why you might not have wanted that rule in Admiralty. 
    I know you did not and I don't think you meant to authorize District Courts or that Congress meant to authorize them to create a crazy thought of practice with respect to anything so vital as discovery. 
    Right or wrong, if it should be done, it should be done nationally.

    I don't see how he can talk about not using a deposition when you use it to impeach the other fellow. 
    Rule 26 says explicitly that that's a use of depositions. 
    Rule 26 says explicitly that testimony, this is a civil rule, testimony maybe taken either for use in evidence or for discovery. 
    What does the Admiralty Rule say? 
    Admiralty Rule 46 says testimony shall be taken in open Court except as otherwise provided that there he stopped. 
    It doesn't stop except as otherwise provided by statute and that statute is the de bene esse act.
