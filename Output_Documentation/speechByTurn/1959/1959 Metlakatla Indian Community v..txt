    Mr. John L. Rader 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court. 
    Before going into the technical legal argument to place the case in its proper perspective, I'd like to discuss for just a moment the economic hardship that these appellants have pleaded and which their affidavits certainly show. 
    The record, however, if it's closely read will, I think, portray this situation of Alaska fishery. 
    The affidavits of (Inaudible) and those are the affidavits of the appellants, show that five canneries recent close -- recently closed in Southeastern Alaska representing 25% of the productive capacity of the area. 
    One affiant stated that properties that were valued in 1947 at $533,000 were now worth $75,000, cannery properties. 
    The appellant, Kake in here, for instance, shows that they paid, or the Federal Government paid for them $260,000 for their cannery equipment that is now worth $207,000 and that they are indebted in amount of $848,000, which means this, it comes through the record to you that they've lost money at the rate of about $100,000 a year.

    These people who are here in Court now?
speaker="john_l_rader" startTime="104.952" stopTime="241.571">
    Mr. John L. Rader 
    These people who are here in Court, Angoon. 
    Kake, paid $363,000.The properties are worth $377,000 and their total indebtedness is $781,000. 
    In other words, since 1950 to the time of those affidavits, they lost about $700,000. 
    Kake did. 
    Appellant, Metlakatla, I don't believe gives us the detail on their financial picture like Kake and Angoon due their -- their financial situation is not nearly as serious certainly as -- as Kake's and Angoon's. 
    But what we have as a result of the depleted industry is, we -- we have something that, to me is like the dust bowl. 
    It is the resource of the region and probably, if there was any material factor that -- that had as much to do with statehood, the -- the most material factor. 
    I mean, of the wealth or the way the people live of Alaska when their quest for statehood was to control this fishery upon which we -- we have -- we had to have it, and it had been exclusively under the federal control and it was a -- it was a disaster. 
    The Southeast -- the economy of Southeastern Alaska was in a disastrous situation and everyone including these appellants, when they voted for Ordinance 3 of the Constitution, when they voted in the referendum in 1948, voted overwhelmingly for the abolition of the fish trap to which we -- and our position is that we, the State, the son have watched our parent, the United States, in the control of this fishery, and maybe we can't do any better. 
    But our position is, we have a right to try and if that's what statehood gave us, was the right to try. 
    And that these appellants must try with us whether they want to or not at this time because at one time, they were certainly willing. 
    And the reason really that this -- this moved to abolish the fish traps are -- was led by appellant communities and others just exactly like them is because that was not their way of fishing.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="john_l_rader" startTime="253.235" stopTime="478.041">
    Mr. John L. Rader 
    To begin with, Your Honor, Section 4 is a compact and it is gross error to rely upon the interpretation of Section 4 by merely congressional intent. 
    If this was a compact, and that's what it says it is, then our understanding of that compact in -- for the purposes of interpreting that contract -- compact today is just as important as was Congress' intent. 
    Our understanding of it was this. 
    There are fish wheels on the Yukon River. 
    There are reservations in Alaska. 
    There's a (Inaudible) Indian reservation. 
    There may be some fishing right. 
    We don't know. 
    Congress didn't know, and Congress did not want to do this. 
    In -- in the issue of statehood, they did not want to attempt to neither enlarge nor diminish whatever those rights might be. 
    We understood it, that it would be if someone could come in here and show a property right to the common fisheries that they would have it and we would no longer own it, but we construe Section 4 to be a disclaimer of property interest, not a disclaimer of state police power over our citizens when they start to fish. 
    We thought that it was -- a boat is a property right, a fishing area in our fishery is not a property right. 
    It can neither be bought nor sold. 
    That was open to all citizens and all citizens alike. 
    A fish trap is a device. 
    It's made out of -- of poles and wires and houses. 
    It has a house on it, for the watchman. 
    That is a property right, but there was no ever a property right to a fish trap site or location in the common fishery, and this Court held that in Hynes versus Grimes. 
    Now, there are fish wheels on the Yukon River. 
    There are international treaties which give the natives of Alaska the right to engage in -- in sealing, pelagic sealing. 
    They call it fishing sometimes. 
    Sometimes they call it hunting. 
    Those might be rights, but Congress did not want to concern itself with those rights or anything else, and so it said including fishing rights, and it should have said, “if any,” because that's what it means that we disclaim any right title and interest inany property, including fishing rights. 
    That, you can't disclaim right title and interest to an Indian when he's fishing. 
    Those are citizens. 
    That's essential to our sovereignty. 
    It's the biggest part of our -- of -- our biggest resource. 
    Although we could give away property, we cannot give away sovereignty and then we say this. 
    That if, as a condition of admission to the Union, we did cede sovereignty over our citizens on the basis of race, then that was an unfair exaction and it was an exaction as a condition to admitting as to statehood that violates the equal footing doctrine, because there's no other State in the Union that where such a principle is recognized. 
    And I don't believe you can find any other Statehood Act where it says, “Including fishing rights.” 
    Therefore, Congress said this, “We will leave that to future legislation or judicial determination.” 
    That's what the -- that's what the appellants are doing here today. 
    They came -- they're coming in here to attempt to establish a property right in this Court, as Congress contemplated that they should, but that should not be taken by this Court to mean that such a property right exist. 
    They have not -- excuse me.

    Well, I was going to say, there has been no pleading of aboriginal rights here. 
    Those are not pleaded. 
    They -- they plead only a right to fish under the regulations of the Secretary of Interior.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="493.926" stopTime="512.852">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Rader, do you happen to know if in any other States where there are Indian reservations, if the Government grabs any different hunting or fishing rights to Indians than -- than it does to the general populace?
speaker="john_l_rader" startTime="512.852" stopTime="558.393">
    Mr. John L. Rader 
    Well on a reservation, I think that they could perhaps. 
    In the case of Tulee versus Washington, there was a treaty and the treaty provided that not only were the Indians involved in that case have the right to fish exclusively the waters on their reservation, but that they would have the further -- and this is a treaty right -- to fish in all usual and accustomed places that they had previously fished and that took them beyond the reservation, it took them into the common fishery, and this Court held in that case that they could not be charged a license fee because the license fee was not merely for purposes of regulation, it was also for purposes of taxation. 
    Does that answer Your Honor's question?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="558.393" stopTime="595.874">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, in -- in a way, but I was thinking this. 
    That -- that whatever special rights they might give to -- to Indians on reservations would probably fall, would they not, if we decided with Alaska in this -- in this case? 
    Would we not be saying at the same time that -- that wherever the Federal Government attempted to invade the police power as you -- of the State as you see it, that -- that they have done that unconstitutionally and therefore, the regulations or the statutes must fall?
speaker="john_l_rader" startTime="595.874" stopTime="653.119">
    Mr. John L. Rader 
    I don't believe so for this reason. 
    This case does not present a factual situation which would -- which would permit you to reach that point except by dictum, because in Kake and Angoon, there is nothing even resembling a reservation. 
    On Metlakatla, there is a reservation and I -- I can't tell whether it's an Indian reservation or not. 
    But it was a reservation set aside for the immigrants who called themselves the Metlakatlan Indians who came to Metlakatla to be administered under the authority of the United States. 
    I -- I don't -- certainly, the Indian -- inland waters of the State, and that's where we get to our equal footing doctrine and I would come to that in a few minutes. 
    There is not -- there is no problem there. 
    So the upland reservation problem that would -- could be created by this case as applied to other reservations, it just isn't in this case, I don't believe.

    Mr. John L. Rader 
    Yes, sir. 
    And it applied there before the 1953 and 1957 statute that was cited to you by a counsel for Metlakatla. 
    The District Judge in the case of United States versus Booth stated, “It has always been assumed that the territorial law applied to Metlakatla, and it has always been assumed that they have applied.” 
    And the reasoning of United States verus Sandoval, in cases of that nature, is absolutely inapplicable here, because those people there have their own system of government. 
    They were never brought under the -- the laws of the State. 
    There had been a reluctance of the State to govern those persons because they couldn't pay their own way, so to speak, in a government sense. 
    Their worst enemies, of the tribes, were the pioneers and the settlers who -- who settled in amidst them and -- and adjacent to them. 
    That's not true here. 
    All of that reasoning, of that -- of those cases, in fact, the whole intent of the Federal Indian Law, which of course is wonderful in its concept, becomes to be -- it -- it comes to be a -- to work against itself in a most destructive manner in this case because these people are not our enemies in Alaska.

    But here, you have -- you have a device which is -- which has a capacity to perhaps catch $25,000 worth of fish in a day. 
    And all you have to do is to have a man on that -- on that fish trap when the airplanes are gone and when the boats are gone, and you can see in 50 miles in each direction, is to open it up and let it fish. 
    And you can't tell when you -- when you -- if you close it up, stop the fishing when you see a boat or an airplane coming, you can't tell how long the fish have been in the pot or in the heart. 
    They're there, they're alive and they have been caught when the season was open. 
    It is such a tremendous device that the abuse is -- is so easily accomplished. 
    Now, that's true of the nets also. 
    A fisherman that gets hungry, when he watches a fish trap operate, and he finds out that his hours have been closed, that his days have been closed, that he cannot fish and he wants his fish trap to operate, he's pretty tempted also to take his nets and go off and throw them across the stream and that is destructive, equally.

    These fish traps are put in place for these Indians by the Whiz Fish Company in the case before you today, hired out of Seattle with their large equipment to come up and install this fish trap device. 
    These things are monstrous. 
    They're beyond the capacity of -- of the Union villagers to construct. 
    They're not a hand-constructed type of thing and they are not -- their historic way of fishing. 
    And that was really the reason, probably, that the Indians so thoroughly opposed with the rest of the people who lived in Alaska the use of the fish trap because it was a device which was so efficient that it was -- we believe, whether the Secretary of Interior does or doesn't, we believe that it's destroying the fisheries.

    That's right. 
    The -- I think the transaction is indicated in the complaint and in the affidavits, is that the United States bought from a pack from two packing companies. 
    Their complete packing operation, canneries, boats, equipment, fish traps and fish trap sites it says, the title was taken in the name of the United States in trust for these corporations which have been organized by the Department of Interior.

    Mr. John L. Rader 
    Well, Metlakatla has been operating since 1915 and I don't know whether that was out of their own funds or whether it was loaned, but I do believe it's been paid off. 
    The Metlakatla fishery has been successful, partly because they got into the business before it was dust bowl. 
    They -- they've been into it back when it was good, 1915.

    Yes. 
    They -- they used fish traps in 1915. 
    In fact, aboriginally, the Metlakatlans in Canada used a -- something like a fish trap, I guess. 
    It was a small device, but I've been told that the word “Metlakatla” means “fish trap people” for Metlakatla in Canada. 
    However, that was -- that's -- as much a -- the same as a fly is to a horse to what we're talking about today, the type of devices they had.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Even with the hook and line?
speaker="john_l_rader" startTime="1550.229" stopTime="1721.619">
    Mr. John L. Rader 
    I presume not, that's Indian fishing. 
    A trap is as foreign as anything else. 
    That's not their method of fishing. 
    They're fishermen in boats and skiffs. 
    Why shouldn't it be with a hook and line? 
    It's an Indian fishing right. 
    They have the right to fish with a hook and line before, why don't they have the right to fish with a hook and line now? 
    They had just as much right to fish with a fish trap before as they do now, but before, they never had a right to fish with a fish trap because that was a right that all citizens of the United States had. 
    Perhaps that'll become more clear if you'll -- if I may summarize my -- my legal argument and go back to the first point of it, which is that point. 
    Briefly, we state this. 
    Number one, prior to statehood, in the commercial fishery -- now, we're not talking about a subsistence fishery. 
    Perhaps that's what they meant by Indian fishing rights, a subsistence fishery, to catch fish and feed it to yourself and your dogs along the Yukon River, up north some place or maybe in this area too, but we're talking about the commercial fishery. 
    Number one is, before statehood, there was never any right in any person to an exclusive right of privilege to the commercial fish -- fishery, and that included Indians, Aleuts, Eskimos, Whites, Swedes, Englishmen and Irishmen. 
    It included everybody. 
    They were all legal. 
    We come into the Union and we have Section 4, which says that the State will disclaim all right to have an interest to any property including a fishing right. 
    We contend that their wording actually is that we -- we disclaim right to have an interest to a fishing right if any, and there may be some. 
    And this Court cannot possibly foreclose that today because you don't have all the fishing rights in Alaska before you today. 
    You have only the fishing right today in this case as it pertains to a fish trap. 
    That's the narrowest issue of this case. 
    And we say that Congress did not intend as to change the status quo, that the White Act, if it please the Court, which was to prevent discrimination did not now become the instrument of discrimination and that is exactly what it is, a compete perversion of an act of Congress which was passed to prevent any exclusive right or privilege in the common fishery of Alaska. 
    And as this Court observed in Hynes versus Grimes, it should be open to all of our citizens when it was attempted there to set aside for any group of Indians.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1721.619" stopTime="1732.154">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that may be a good reason for a white fisherman to come here and say “I'm being discriminated against.” 
    What gives the State's standing?
speaker="john_l_rader" startTime="1732.154" stopTime="1767.234">
    Mr. John L. Rader 
    Well, our standing brings us to the next point. 
    That if we're wrong in the first two, if there is a property right and if we did disclaim it and if we did disclaim not only a property right, but the right to regulate our citizens on the basis of race, then we say that if you violated the equal footing because the inland waters and the fish and game were held in trust for the future State of Alaska that by operation of law, it passed to Alaska and that this is an unwarranted infringement by an arm of the Federal Government into our sovereignty.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1773.577" stopTime="1794.118">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well now, if you're -- if these are Indian tribes, or assuming there, tribes, then you wouldn't be making this third argument, would you? 
    Wouldn't you grant the power of the United States under the -- under -- under its power to -- over commerce with Indian tribes to -- to impose this kind of infringement.
speaker="john_l_rader" startTime="1794.118" stopTime="1859.321">
    Mr. John L. Rader 
    No, we wouldn't for this reason. 
    And that is if -- if you're going to withhold from the State absolute jurisdiction and control, you must define that, because normally, this -- that was the question that was raised this morning as how -- how can the State argue about the rights as between the Federal Government and the Indians? 
    The reason that we have a right to argue about that is because it's our property you're arguing about, the fish and game and the resource of Alaska. 
    And we say this. 
    If you made an Indian reservation out of all of the inland waters of Alaska and took from Alaska the resource which represents 85% of the natural resources harvested as a condition of entry into the Union, then you will have violated the equal standing of Alaska with Washington, Oregon, the original 13 states and the rest of the states of the Union.

    In other words, although I may own a pond or may own a cornfield and there's migratory birds come and land on it and no one else can trespass on my property and fish my area, I am still bound by the fish and game laws of the State as to when I can shoot those migratory birds and we take the position that they are bound to the laws of the State as to when they can take these migratory fish when it passes through their reservation.

    I -- I -- do you rely on the Pollard doctrine in connection with the last part of the 1891 reservation statue which said, “Subject to such restrictions may be proscribed from time to time by the Secretary of Interior?” 
    Is that the way you -- the basis on which you say that has no bearing here?
speaker="john_l_rader" startTime="2239.274" stopTime="2508.152">
    Mr. John L. Rader 
    Well, we needn't destroy the purported reservation of inland waters, the 3000 feet Presidential Proclamation. 
    We -- we have argued that that was destroyed, but we needn't destroy that. 
    We needn't reach that point in this case actually because the Presidential Proclamation -- remember the statue that set aside the Metlakatla Reservation, speaks of the body of lands known as Annette Islands. 
    This Court interpreted it in Alaska Pacific Fisheries case to say, “Well, these lands were no good to these people, they are seafaring people without some waters.” 
    And -- but you did not adopt the Presidential Proclamation which said that -- in the -- of 1916, which said that there would be 3000 feet around the lands. 
    You did not adopt it, but you did not reject it either. 
    You just refused to dignify it and held on a different grounds, although the Circuit Court went off on that grounds completely. 
    Now, under the Presidential Proclamation, the -- it states that they shall have the exclusive right to fish this area subject to the general fisheries laws of the United States. 
    At that time, the United States held a municipal jurisdiction, as this Court observed in Hynes versus Grimes, held not only federal jurisdiction but you held municipal jurisdiction. 
    You held a jurisdiction to control fish and game of Alaska because there was no State there, and because it had been withheld from the territorial government. 
    You held both municipal and federal jurisdiction. 
    We argue that when by operation of law, when municipal jurisdiction over fish and game and over the inland waters comes to the State when the State is created that those are the general fisheries laws. 
    And if you want to look at the status quo, if there's one thing the Congress did by Section 4, it said, “We want to reserve the status quo.” 
    That's the reason that we weren't worried about it. 
    The status quo was that everybody fished as equal under the general conservation laws. 
    We have always disagreed with the Department of Interior as to what conservation is. 
    But I don't think this Court will argue with us what we think conservation is because I think that's our determination and the appellant, Metlakatla, has admitted that the -- the reason for banning was for conservation purposes. 
    Now, we argue that, although as -- with any migratory resource, if you're going to give someone exclusive right to fish, if you're going to give them 80 acres and say no one else can trespass on this area, to shoot birds or anything else, if you want to give them 80 acres of water and say no one else can fish there, that's all right. 
    We really aren't trying to knock out that reservation unless as a last resort, we have to. 
    But we say this that giving them the exclusive right to fish under the general fisheries laws of United States, which are now the general fisheries laws of Alaska, the only reason you made general fisheries laws up there is because you exercised the powers of a state government in that area, there was no state government. 
    Now, there is a state government. 
    And the control of a migratory resource as this Court observed in Dow versus Ickes means nothing, means nothing. 
    And this was a fish trap case, Dow versus Ickes. 
    It means nothing unless it work -- works to the final end of conservation and you don't have a -- and you don't have a conservation chain with a reservation in the middle of it that -- that reaps the fruits of conservation. 
    You can use dynamite and dynamites are the most effective way there is to fish. 
    If you really want to catch fish, dynamite. 
    That's even more efficient than a fish trap. 
    But they've always said, “No". 
    This is a migratory resource. 
    It has to be controlled as a migratory resource. 
    It has to be followed from the spawning streams, in the hills to the high seas.” 
    And our argument is, that Metlakatla, with the exclusive right to use this area did not have and does not have the right, the unregulated right to fish. 
    Now, by that, I mean to violate the state laws and follow the Secretary of Interior's laws.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Rader, I -- I was wondering this if -- if your interpretation of fishing rights is as limited as -- as you have made it to -- to us, it wouldn't have been necessary to say anything of that kind at all. 
    Would it -- wouldn't it be necessary to make any reservation because when Alaska became a state, they would have that right, the same right of all other citizens. 
    So the Government must have intended something else when it reserved the rights of fishing in that reservation, mustn't it?
speaker="john_l_rader" startTime="2599.724" stopTime="2721.177">
    Mr. John L. Rader 
    The Government, you -- you have to assume that -- that they wanted to make a decision at that time as to whether or not there were fishing rights. 
    The Government did not want to make that decision. 
    The Congress did not want to make that decision. 
    And the -- the legislative history is this. 
    That we neither enlarge nor destroy whatever these rights may be if any, and there may be some rights in other areas. 
    But today, we're arguing about the commercial fishery and we're arguing about corporations that have used fish traps for 12 years and in the case of 327 and since 1915 in the other case. 
    It may mean something some place else. 
    The Act said, “We'll leave this to future legislative and judicial determination.” 
    And I think that -- that the fact that they say there may be a right and now, these appellants are claiming it, doesn't mean that there is a right because they cannot point to a grant or recognition by Congress of fishing rights, any place. 
    And this Act was intended to preserve the status quo to neither augment nor diminish the fishing rights of the Unions. 
    Now, it -- it may have in some other -- in some other area and in some other device, it -- it may have as a different meaning. 
    But in the commercial fishery to where everybody had an equal right to these fish trap sites just like they have a right to go out and fish at a certain spot if they get there first. 
    There was no right to carry it over and so when we say this is a compact, and I insist that the intent of the State and the understanding of the State must be considered by this Court, as well as the intent of Congress. 
    And when they say the status quo, and we know the status quo in the common fishery to be this, equality, the right of all citizens that it has always been administered under the White Act by the Secretary of Interior.

    Incidentally, I think -- before I turn the jurisdiction problem, if you'll permit me just to make one observation. 
    And that is this. 
    That the Congress of the United States in the jurisdictional act, which gave rise to the -- to the Tlingit and Haida Indians of Alaska versus United States, has recognized that all of the Indians of Alaska, aboriginal Indians of -- of Southeastern Alaska, and that's the area we're herewith concerned, may present their claim to the Court of Claims, and if they'll be compensated for whatever they lost, including fishing rights. 
    And the Court of Claims has so ruled because truly, whatever rights they once must have, they were lost now. 
    And the Court of Claims has ruled that the most valuable asset lost to the aboriginal Indians of -- of Southeastern Alaska was their fishing right. 
    And the scheme becomes apparent. 
    Of Congress, the scheme was to compensate these people for the fishing right they lost because it was opened up to all citizens of Alaska -- of the United States equally, and it had been pretty well diminished. 
    They have the rights of any other citizens now but they no longer have the exclusive right or special privilege or anything else because --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2863.697" stopTime="2924.215">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But the whole -- whole point of Section 4 is to qualify your egalitarian system by referring whatever special rights the Indians may have had because they were Indians. 
    That doesn't tell me what those rights were, but the whole significance, unless, you just wipe out, sponge out Section 4 is to give Indians a treatment different from everybody else, the Indians and the other two native categories. 
    I think it would send a message. 
    The whole point of that is not to subject them to a uniform rule but to leave them whatever protection maybe accorded by the United States Government. 
    Isn't that true? 
    Except that you say, “I can understand the argument.”

    Mr. John L. Rader 
    The -- we're in a dust bowl and anyone that depends upon the fish in Alaska is in tough shape and that includes these people. 
    But it's so easy to -- to shift their means of catching fish from a fish trap to boats. 
    That's the way the rest of the Indians in Alaska fished. 
    That's the way the Kake and Angoon fished until 1948 and 1950, they've only relied upon this device for 10 or 12 years. 
    Of course, it's going to hurt them. 
    And I can't help that that hurts them.If they'll be for, I presume, the executive branch of the Federal Government, if they -- if they -- want to assist, to assist and up to the State to assist. 
    But the -- the fact remains that you cannot take a sick industry and all the rest of the communities in Alaska to not take a sick industry and suddenly be well again. 
    No matter what we do, with or without the fish traps, this will hurt. 
    It will require a shift in policy as every community that has had fish traps or every group of people or private citizens or canneries and a lot of them have closed. 
    It does hurt because the resource is sick.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3482.273" stopTime="3495.309">

    Well, that -- that gets us into their whole status. 
    It's a -- it's a state school. 
    It's state laws. 
    They pay state taxes. 
    They send representatives to the state legislature, things of that nature. 
    And I -- if you want to call them wards of the Government, in one sense, they are. 
    The Government has extended a -- a hand to them, which everyone appreciates, and which I think could be extended after this litigation no matter what happens to it. 
    But -- and we do -- we do not think that you can -- you can destroy our sovereignty in that process. 
    And we think that for these villagers, what did these villagers think when they voted against fish traps? 
    What did Angoon think when they voted 127 to 7 against fish traps that when fish traps are finally going to abolish, what they would do. 
    This is what they knew and what we all believed. 
    And that is we depend upon the resource. 
    The fish traps have destroyed the resource. 
    We will abolish our fish traps if everyone else will abolish theirs. 
    And we will use boats. 
    And of course, it's going to hurt. 
    But in 10 or 15 years, perhaps we can rebuild this fishery. 
    The way it is now, it's a -- it's been a consistent lying down for 50 years and I don't doubt for a moment that -- in fact, believe me, I don't believe that these -- that these people would be fishing in these fish traps if it were not probably for their economic situation.

    Mr. John L. Rader 
    Yes. 
    This -- it's a -- a fish trap is a-- underwater throughout, so to speak. 
    There's a lot of different types of fish traps, but these are floating fish traps. 
    They float out of three city blocks, 900 feet into the water. 
    They're anchored with 5000 pound anchors to hold them away from shore. 
    They have to be put in position by large tugs and things like that. 
    They have a wire that extends -- the lead goes from the trap to the shore. 
    And the lead is a wire fence that extends from the surface of the water to the bottom of the ocean. 
    And the migratory salmon in seeking their freshwater streams to go back to their spawning grounds go along the coast, they hit this lead. 
    They can't pass. 
    They wary along the lead until they come out to the end of it, and at the end of it is a theory of ever confining spaces. 
    The fish will finally come and swim into one space and -- by -- by fins and so and so forth while he finally ends up in a pot. 
    And then you come along with a brailer. 
    You brail out your fish trap and you take out tons of fish and put them on a scuttle.

    That's debatable. 
    We just don't know that much about the fish, but we do know every so often we end up with a barren stream and fishermen have ways of deducing these things at a -- I don't know if they're accurate or not, but that's certainly what a lot of them believe.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="john_l_rader" startTime="3849.879" stopTime="4043.167">
    Mr. John L. Rader 
    It's quite an operation. 
    Congress in the -- in Section 4, if we want to construe the intent, particularly as -- the -- the legislative history on Section 4 has preserved the status quo to neither enlarge nor decrease Indian fishing rights. 
    The congressional history as to the commercial fishery of Alaska, if you go back before Hynes versus Grimes, go back about 1916, Columbia River versus Berg, it was held then that there was no exclusive right to anyone in a -- into an exclusive fishery of Alaska. 
    You have the Hynes -- You have the White Act of 1924, where Congress specifically prohibited any exclusive fishing right. 
    This Court in Dow versus Ickes, when fish traps were destroyed by a regulation of the Secretary of Interior in 1934 or thereabouts, this Court held that no one had a right to a fish trap. 
    In Hynes versus Grimes, when the Secretary of Interior attempted to give the Karluk Indians a reservation, it was held that he could not do so, a single amount, give them special treatment. 
    Section 6 (c) of the Statehood Act talks about turning over to Alaska its commercial fisheries on a certain timetable which has now occurred and actually, as a matter of act, this litigation occurred when Section 6 (c) was in effect. 
    Section 6 (c) said that the Secretary of Interior shall have the right to continue to manage Alaska's fisheries until such time as he certifies the Congress of the United States that they have made adequate provisions to protect and manage the resource he has certified. 
    In other words, the Statehood Act itself indicated, there would be a turnover to the State of its fisheries. 
    Section 6 (c) also calls for the transfer of all the property of the Federal Government used in the policing of these fisheries and that's boats all the way from 15 feet to 100 feet long to turn them over to the State to police the industry, to police the fishery. 
    We argue that because it was -- it -- it shows the complete withdrawal of the Federal Government from the regulation and control of the fishery, and the complete transfer by every means apparent to Alaska of the means and the methods, the property to control that fishery. 
    And here we have Indians who are 42% of our commercial fishermen who are no longer under our control under the theory of Kake and Angoon. 
    Under the theory of Metlakatla, if they confine themselves to the reservation, it's a different problem. 
    But on the theory of Kake and Angoon, it cannot be stopped there. 
    Then are two -- then on 59 corporations.

    They didn't intend any such thing. 
    When Congress said that they were going to preserve the status quo and not tinker with -- with native rights, I think that's what they meant and I think that you have to look at the picture before statehood and after statehood to see what they have today and they never had a right to fish with a fish trap by nature of a property interest or an aboriginal right, because it's a different type of device.

    I was not aware. 
    Those appeals were filed the very day that counsel were served with the reply to the briefs filed by appellants on the motion to dismiss. 
    They -- I said they were filed. 
    They were prepared and they were mailed from Washington, airmails as a precautionary matter to be sure if this Court were to hold that these people did have a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Alaska which certainly was -- I must disagree, it was in existence.

speaker="john_w_cragun" startTime="5461.617" stopTime="5889.762">
    Mr. John W. Cragun 
    Mr. Schifter had requested that I read the following paragraph from an affidavit of the Mayor of the Metlakatlan Indian community which appears at page 37 of the record. 
    And that's the first transcript of record, not the supplemental. 
    It has been referred to persistently as raising a question of a concession on the part of Metlakatla. 
    The final paragraph in that affidavit says that the purpose in seeking ban on the use of fish traps in Alaska was to conserve the runs of salmon. 
    That the use and operation of the four fish traps of the community -- well in but a very minor manner if any affect the conservation of salmon in Alaska waters. 
    That the State of Alaska will not suffer any material damage if the traps are permitted to be operated while on the other hand, if the Indians of the reservation are denied the right, they will suffer irreparable damage and loss. 
    It's his feeling that a good deal of moral was read into that paragraph than the paragraph deserved. 
    I want to recur to the references that had been made to the basis of the secretary's action in authorizing these fish traps. 
    I think perhaps it's best shown by the new regulations which are proposed and in the red appendix at page 34 and 35. 
    We find the places set forth in the federal register as is required. 
    We find that the authority is not merely the White Act to which reference was made but that it comes under Section 2 and 9 of Title 25, Section 485 of Title 5 and cites other acts. 
    Now, I think that a little more could have been said on Title 5 of the U.S.Code. 
    They cite Section 485 which says the Secretary of the Interior is charged with the supervision of public business relating to the following subjects first and then second, the Indians. 
    They did not cite Section 22, the so-called housekeeping statute on departmental regulations which applies to all departments and says, “The head of each department is authorized to prescribe regulations not inconsistent with law for the Government of his department and the performance of business and two or three other including custodial matters. 
    The sections with respect to Title 25 of the Code, Title 25 as Indians, Section 2 which is cited in this assertion of authority on the part of the Interior -- of the Secretary, says, “The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior and agreeable to such rule regulations as the President may prescribe in the management of all Indian affairs and of all matters arising out of Indian relations.” 
    And the other sections, Section 9, the President may prescribe such regulations as he may think that for carrying into effect to the various provisions of any act relating to Indian Affairs and for the settlement of the accounts of Indian affairs. 
    The next item on which I was concerned arose in response to some questions of Mr. Justice Douglas respecting Hynes against Grimes Pack -- and refer to the fact that he had decided that the Court's opinion is something else. 
    I must confess that I have the same misunderstanding of the holding in Hynes against Grimes Packing as had Mr. Justice Douglas if I understood correctly his questions until I got around to studying it for the sake in this case. 
    Hynes against Grimes Packing held very flatly concluding at page 116 that there was a valid establishment of an Indian reservation at Karluk in Alaska. 
    That the Secretary of the Interior did have authority to establish it, but it then went on to hold concluding at pages 122 and 123 not as I have sort of vaguely recalled the Court held and as I believe we shared by one member of this Court but to say we find nothing in the White Act that authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant reservation occupants the privilege of exclusive commercial fishing rights. 
    Now, the holding of that case is not as I understand it but because of the White Act, no such rights could be accorded by the Secretary but that he had ceased the wrong authority and you couldn't say that the White Act authorized him to put an exclusive right in the hands of the natives. 
    He would have to look elsewhere and the balance of the opinion carries that distinction through all of it. 
    I've been further concerned with the references that would indicate that while Metlakatla may very well be confined to the island down there that Southern tip of Alaska where it lies for each fish traps, that somehow under Kake and Angoon have a role making profit to go all over Alaska and fish, fish traps wherever they want to. 
    I wish to call attention to the President proposed regulations, if I may, at pages 36 and 37 of this red appendix. 
    The Court will see that as to Kake and Angoon, I omitted of course, the ones respecting Metlakatla then in Mr. Schifter's brief, the locations of the 21 traps, or as distinctly specified by latitude and longitude down to the second and they can't operate the 21. 
    They're permitted to be permitted in this season to operate only 13 in all.

   Rebuttal of John W. Cragun
speaker="john_w_cragun" startTime="5955.427" stopTime="6085.471">
    Mr. John W. Cragun 
    I‘m informed by Mr. Schifter that he can say that all fishing trap sites were specified either White or Indian. 
    These Indians, of course, set by here for quite a while and watched non-Indians fishing the traps, which later was the cannery were purchased by the United States and turned over to Indian fishing. 
    However, the fact is that as to Indians since the Secretary exceeded the closing up all fish traps except Indian fish traps, the Secretary has very directly regulated it. 
    This is not an unregulated right if that impression has been given this Court. 
    The Secretary of the Interior is manifestly concerned with the matter. 
    He has fish and wildlife under his jurisdiction. 
    He is manifestly concerned with preserving the salmon lives there as necessary to Kake and Angoon and the Metlakatla as they can't be to anyone else in Alaska and they are regulated by the Secretary. 
    The size of the traps is unimportant, I suggest. 
    The question is how many fish you take out of them, not what gear you use and traps can be regulated and are regulated to determine how much of a pack you take out of them. 
    It's no different if you spread it amongst more men perhaps running the actual boats and they take just as many fish with yawl nets or purse seines or some other method, we're really confusing to quite different issues. 
    I repeat again that in my judgment, there is no conservation issue here unless Alaska can say “Well, the Secretary isn't going to regulate this from a conservation standpoint but we would.” 
    Unless that can be said, I -- I don't see how this issue can be imported into the case. 
    And there was one other thing that occurred to me in that connection when it was said --

    Mr. John W. Cragun 
    They -- the only matter from conservation standpoint that appeals to make and make any sense is the number of fish you catch and the number you left through the ghost pond and how carefully you regulate it. 
    Now, our grant that dynamite is forbidden under the Interior Department regulations as under the State, that is a highly nonselective method of regulating fish. 
    I suppose it could be used but it's -- it's frowned upon. 
    Now, Alaska certainly frowns upon the use of fish traps but I am unaware, provided they are regulated and here they are regulated that there can be possibly be any issue other than how many fish you take by one method or the other and how you let you runs a fish through this pond.

    Certainly, the traps are more efficient. 
    They require fewer men. 
    There are more capital investment in them but they have fewer man to run them. 
    They efficiently supply the cannery. 
    There's very little loss from injured fish as there are by any other method of fishing. 
    They are efficient. 
    They've been proved that over a long time. 
    And now we have from eight to 11 traps, 13 this year permitted to operate by the Secretary of the Interior. 
    We have up over 200 authorized, only two and three and four and five years ago. 
    The numbers are set forth in two different appendices to the briefs, one Mr. Schifter's and one in my brief and shows the rather de minimis nature of what is left here but it is not, even what we have here an unregulated right.

    Not more than 21 salmon fish trap sites heretofore recognized as Indian salmon fish trap location as here and after described maybe utilized for the purpose of salmon trap fishing by Indian villagers etcetera.

    Certainly, if these people have a small remnant of the aboriginal right that they once possessed, it would relate only to their own area and it doesn't infest all Alaska. 
    They tried in this country with particular fishing rights as limited and usually to a particular area. 
    We -- this Court has dealt with many of them, the Wyman's case and the Seufert case, the Tulee case. 
    They're not unfamiliar, but it doesn't mean that they have a right to go into somebody else's theory and fish there. 
    It's not a profit good for all of Alaska. 
    It's a profit within their own area and of the overwhelming, both of these 300 traps were white, they're closed down.

    Yes, sir.

    And the Government takes the position there that they had no -- no principle right to intense -- we're not entitled to fish.
speaker="john_w_cragun" startTime="6534.528" stopTime="6691.712">
    Mr. John W. Cragun 
    I am not aware that the Government takes that position, although I'm bound to confess, I do not represent the Indians in that case and I don't want to be held to it. 
    I would have to consult counsel in that case. 
    I must say this that in a reference and their note in the brief amicus curiae in the District Court, the Government doesn't intimate that it contest a right of recovery. 
    And since Congress authorized the suite for aboriginal rights there, I take it there would be no question raised on that issue. 
    Well now, I was concerned too about another aspect to Mr. Rader's argument which intimated that what is involved here is just a Seattle operation perhaps in the name of the Indians. 
    I'd been hampered by not much knowledge outside that the record in these cases but certainly as far as the record goes, a supplemental transcript in the complaints of Kake which commences at page 82 and the complaint of Angoon which commences at 102 in paragraphs one, two, three and four, plainly and explicitly point out that this is an Indian operation in which substantially, the whole village is engaged and on which that villagers' income and well-being depends. 
    In concluding, I think perhaps I ought to share with the Court an outrageous pond that lurks in the record in this case which was brought to my attention by an assistance solicitor and interior in the suit of Kake and Angoon against Egan Governor. 
    He said the question here was whether these Indians could have their Kake and Egan too.

   Argument of John D.Calhoun

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Calhoun, I think Mr. Justice Brennan want to ask you a question. 
    Your time is up but -- I think he want to ask you a question.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6698.664" stopTime="6717.055">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    There are really two questions. 
    The first Mr. Calhoun, I sent out with -- to Mr. Cragun. 
    Are we to understand that this 88.2 is a determination by the Secretary of the Interior that the outside limit of sites that he may authorize is 21?
speaker="john_dcalhoun" startTime="6717.055" stopTime="6722.033">
    Mr. John D.Calhoun 
    That is the understanding of the Department of Justice as the position to the Department of the Interior.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6722.033" stopTime="6736.250">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now, what is the position of the Department of Justice? 
    Does the Department believe that under Section 4 of the Statehood Act, he has power that as the Secretary does to authorize more sites than 21?
speaker="john_dcalhoun" startTime="6736.250" stopTime="6762.636">
    Mr. John D.Calhoun 
    It is the position of the Department of Justice that Congress in enacting Section 4 reserved to itself power to direct the Secretary of the Interior that authorizes many according to the standards that they set as are necessary to meet the needs they want to fill. 
    At the moment, we believe there is sufficient authority under the White Act to issue more than 21 if conservation needs and the Indians needs require the issuance of more.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6762.636" stopTime="6764.091">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Or allowed more --
speaker="john_dcalhoun" startTime="6764.091" stopTime="6764.620">
    Mr. John D.Calhoun 
    More than 21.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6764.620" stopTime="6772.890">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Does that mean then to the limit of 334 which apparently was the number of sites before other.
speaker="john_dcalhoun" startTime="6772.890" stopTime="6812.570">
    Mr. John D.Calhoun 
    I would doubt on the basis of the little myth that I know about Alaskan fish runs that he could -- he could defend 300 without running into an argument of being rather arbitrary and capricious in the conduct of the administration of that statute. 
    But if -- if at any time, Alaska is -- may challenge his -- his performance of his duty. 
    I think it has standing probably to do that. 
    Certainly, people who were fishing in those waters have standing to challenge these regulations but nobody has attacked that his -- saying that -- nobody suggesting that the Secretary has improperly administered a congressional mandate.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6812.570" stopTime="6825.717">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Your -- that the -- the position of your -- your possession -- the Department's position is that there is in Section 4 no quantitative limits, upon whatever rights they reserve. 
    Is that right?
