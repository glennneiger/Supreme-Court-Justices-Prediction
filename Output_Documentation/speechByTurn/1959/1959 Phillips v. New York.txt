    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 497, Willard H. Phillips, Petitioner, versus Joseph -- versus New York. 
    Mr. Schober.
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="15.611" stopTime="430.036">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    If it please the Court. 
    This matter is here on certiorari issued by this Court to the Court of Appeals of the State of New York. 
    To review a judgment of affirmance entered by that Court, affirming a judgment of conviction entered in the County Court of Nassau County for the State of New York convicting the defendant of the felony murder of one Sunday Graham. 
    The question that we raised and upon which we are here is whether a confession obtained from the petitioner was secured in violation of due process as accorded to him and guaranteed to him under those provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    In considering and approaching that question, we feel that we should bring before this Court those factual circumstances which are conceded by the respondent to have existed with regard to the development of the investigation and ultimate securing of the confession and which are undisputed in the record. 
    In approaching this problem and giving some of the background of the crime itself and of the investigation that was conducted, may I call attention first to the fact that the respondent Phillips, a male Negro of the -- of the age of approximately 42 years have had prior conflicts with the law. 
    He had been convicted on a prior occasion in this very country, the Country of Nassau of the crime of attempted rape by violence. 
    He was sentenced to imprisonment for that crime and having been released on parole, he was later again apprehended, charged with a violation of his parole for the commission of a sexual offense upon a young white girl. 
    And upon the charge for violation of parole in that instance, he was recommitted for a period of time. 
    The petitioner Phillips had sometime prior to the commission of the crime charged here been married to one Manita Graham (ph). 
    They had been divorced but they had continued an illicit relationship between them subsequent to time of their divorce. 
    Mrs. Graham had adopted Sunday Graham who was approximately eight years of age upon the time -- about the time of her unfortunate demise. 
    Now, on May 12, 1958, Sunday Graham was last seen leaving the school which she was attending. 
    She was dressed in a school uniform and was seen by one of her playmates to enter an automobile driven by a male Negro, a car of a type kind that was owned by Phillips and driven by one who is dressed in clothing such as that which had been possessed by Phillips at that time. 
    Once she did not -- when Sunday did not return to her home, Mrs. Graham, at about 5:30 in the evening of that day, made report to the police. 
    And she gave them the information concerning a prior marriage to the petitioner and stated also to the police that petitioner had followed her within a short period of time prior to the disappearance of Sunday and had expressed certain threats to it. 
    But Mrs. Graham had asked Phillips to get out of her life, and he stated to her in return that if he did get out of her life, he would not get out alone and that she would be sorry. 
    About 10:15 on the evening of the day of Sunday's disappearance, the local police precinct in the village of Hempstead, Nassau County communicated with the precinct of the country police that had jurisdiction over that location. 
    And at about 10:20 on that evening, the country police officers were given a description of a missing girl, the location of the school at which she had been attending and the other information such as I have just mentioned to this Court. 
    The following morning, the country police spoke to the classmate of Sunday who had seen her entering the automobile. 
    They obtained the information from that classmate, Kathy Mullen (ph) concerning the place at which the automobile was seen, the person driving and the fact that Sunday attended. 
    At 11 a.m. because of the information that had been obtained by the police concerning Phillips' background in relationship with Mrs. Graham and Sunday, visited Phillips' home in Hempstead, searched his rooms and took clothes from him that he had been wearing and that were in his apartment and also had him identified through them the automobile which he owned. 
    They questioned him concerning Sunday Graham and his -- and her disappearance and then requested that he accompany them, the police, to their local police precinct some distance away and beyond the place where police headquarters of the county are located. 
    They arrived at the local police precinct at about 1:15 in the afternoon of the day. 
    And at that time, the interrogation concerning this disappearance of Sunday Graham began.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You claimed that he was under arrest at this time or did he went over there voluntarily?
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="435.283" stopTime="513.499">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    The record would seem to indicate that he accompanied them voluntarily, sir. 
    But we say that whether he was under arrest or whether he had gone voluntarily, that the fact of his going and the circumstances that took place from that point on are to be considered in connection with the ultimate determination to be made by this Court on the question that we say is presented here. 
    But we do -- we do say that so far as the police officers are concerned, they expressly testified that it was not until some time later that Phillips was actually placed under arrest. 
    The testimony in substance on that score being that he was requested to stay. 
    That he could have left had he indicated his desire to do so. 
    That he would not have been restrained in his leaving. 
    And that it was only after the violated dead body of this young girl was found that he would've had difficulty in leaving. 
    We say that these two is a plot of the totality of circumstances such as this Court has referred to in determining the effect of all of the things that have occurred here.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Until the -- until the body was found, there was, of course, no way to know there was any crime committed. 
    That's --

    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    That's right, sir. 
    There is no question about that but we say that whether or not a crime had in fact been committed prior to that time or whether there was knowledge of the commission of that crime, it becomes immaterial when you now currently consider all of the things that went before, after and immediately at the time that a confession was ultimately obtained.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="542.390" stopTime="551.432">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's question, you were speaking of the time when it wasn't known that violence had been committed.

    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    Yes, sir.

    (Voice Overlap) to what -- what -- in this Court?
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="556.108" stopTime="572.876">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    It is true that there was an interrogation that took place with regard to Phillips, questioning of Phillips that took place prior to the time when it became known to the police that a murder had in fact occurred.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="572.876" stopTime="573.341">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that the police --
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="573.341" stopTime="574.500">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    That time --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="574.500" stopTime="578.306">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- the police officer at that time was trying to find out where this missing girl.
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="578.306" stopTime="616.336">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    That's right, sir. 
    That's right. 
    And that questioning concerning the missing girl took place between 1:15 in the afternoon of that day and sometime at about 3 o'clock when an exculpatory statement, a complete denial by the petitioner was obtained by the police, reduced to writing and signed by him. 
    It was 4 o'clock in the afternoon of that day that the dead body was found, found who have been violated and was found to bare the clothing and all the other identifying material that indicated that this was the body of Sunday Graham.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="616.336" stopTime="627.688">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But the exculpation by him was not exculpation of any charge or innuendo of a charge of murder, was it, as to whether he had any knowledge of the girl?
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="627.688" stopTime="662.992">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    Exactly, sir. 
    But the exculpation at the same time indicated the presence by the petitioner at about the place where the missing girl was last seen alive with his automobile at that particular location. 
    And we say that these two are circumstances which eventually we -- I intend to refer this Court to in a determination as to whether or not the police were in a position to make a charge of the commission of crime.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="662.992" stopTime="685.316">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I didn't mean to question even by implication, your submission that -- that -- to tell if the circumstances should be considered. 
    I merely wanted to be sure that you agreed that up to 4 o'clock what the police did was the conventional inquiry into the facts of a complaint that had been made him.
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="685.316" stopTime="710.682">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    I will say this to Your Honor that while I make the concession that what they did was in connection with the investigation of a missing person as distinguished following investigation of a crime actually known to have been committed. 
    Whether or not it is the conventional investigation, we say, is to be determined from this and the other circumstances --

    I'm not suggesting you're not entitled then to look at the whole sequence of the events but up to the -- up to what to -- up to -- what to -- what took place up to 4 o'clock? 
    Judge by itself in isolation for the moment, is there anything that you complaint of?

    Mr. Henry W. Schober

    -- to that extent.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I mean if -- if the girl had turned off or if such a complaint is made to the appropriate police, I suppose, it's necessary to make an inquiry to -- into the -- into a missing girl, and up to that time, they did what -- I -- I take it, police are entitled and indeed under duty, bound to make.

    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    -- we say exactly that, sir, that as of that time, there was someone missing and they were bound to make an investigation. 
    Immediately after 4 o'clock and while information had been received concerning the finding of the violated dead body of this young girl, the questioning was resumed. 
    As the particular officer who was examined on this score stated, "Phillips was not questioned continually but on and off," but he says also that Phillips continued in his denials of any complicity in the trial. 
    Now, that -- his statements were entirely exculpatory. 
    That questioning continued from 4 o'clock until 6:30 p.m. of that day.

    6:30.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, does the evidence, the undisputed evidence up to the number of people or the relayed in which this question was taken place, what is your view of the record?
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="835.040" stopTime="869.186">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    We say that the undisputed testimony in the record given solely by police officers themselves is that not only did Detective Rouffet (ph), the one who began the investigation, interrogate Phillips, but that he was joined then by a Lieutenant Carn (ph), a Captain Kloss (ph) a -- and a Detective Diggs (ph). 
    And that they were occasions when Diggs in particular was left alone with the petitioner Phillips.

    Where they in there collectively or individually in succession?
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="872.100" stopTime="890.347">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    So far as -- so far as Rouffet's testimony is concerned at this particular time, it would indicate, we say, as we read the record, that not only was Rouffet there but that Captain Kloss, Lieutenant Carn and Detective Diggs were all together during the course of the questioning.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="890.347" stopTime="893.900">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Wasn't -- wasn't the Captain (Inaudible) who Phillips knew?
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="893.900" stopTime="899.988">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    No, this was a Lieutenant (Inaudible). 
    This comes shortly after --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="899.988" stopTime="903.081">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That he did introduce himself, didn't he, to him?
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="903.081" stopTime="904.574">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    Lieutenant (Inaudible) did, yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="904.574" stopTime="913.274">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, I'm not talking about prior to the captain, didn't the captain stay in there only for a little time within -- isn't that the evidence?
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="913.274" stopTime="925.649">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    I don't recall that to be, sir -- so, sir. 
    I am not in a position to give Your Honor direct answer. 
    But my recollection is that Captain Carn.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="925.649" stopTime="927.729">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Not Captain (Inaudible) I'm talking about --
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="927.729" stopTime="950.236">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    Oh, Captain Kloss. 
    Well, that Captain Kloss did stay in for a short time and left but he returned to the later period of time again, sir. 
    Now, at 6:30 p.m., this group investigation, this group interrogation ended according to Detective Rouffet.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="950.236" stopTime="964.481">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, it's nothing to address you but these things are -- one has to go to creep along. 
    When you say group investigation, the evidence is not very clear whether three or four or five or two or one or in there any defined length of time, is that right?
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="964.481" stopTime="1004.073">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    That is right, sir. 
    And that's throughout the entire state of the record would appear except that there are times when Detective Rouffet indicates even later on in the evening that more than himself and Detective Stock (ph) and others were in the room and took part in the questioning. 
    But I -- I do have to say that there is no clear statement in the record that there was a -- a marathon of interrogation here, where one after the other participated but rather a statement only that he was continued to be questioned while these people were there.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1004.073" stopTime="1011.441">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What you call a marathon what we've called in conations as no relay of -- of officers infringing on, is that right?
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1011.441" stopTime="1016.330">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    Well, we -- we say that the record doesn't demonstrate that there was no such relay.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1016.330" stopTime="1016.768">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand that.
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1016.768" stopTime="1022.570">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    The record rather, we say, demonstrates the inference that there was but there is no clear statement in the record --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1022.570" stopTime="1022.810">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    One has --
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1022.810" stopTime="1023.449">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    -- on that score.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1023.449" stopTime="1025.435">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- one has to read and draw his inference from it.
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1025.435" stopTime="1182.152">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    Exactly, sir. 
    Now, at 6:30 p.m., Detective Stock arrived at the precinct and at that time, stated to Phillips, the petitioner, that they were going to perform certain tests and examination upon him. 
    And he described the examinations and tests as being those where they would examine his clothing, take the parings of his finger nail for microscopic examination and that they would wash his privates. 
    Shortly after that, a physician, Dr. (Inaudible) and Lieutenant Pribell (ph) arrived and Inspector Pribell arrived at the station house for the purpose of conducting that examination. 
    Pribell was acquainted with Phillips, had been prior to the time of his arrival at the station house. 
    Dr. (Inaudible) says in substance that when they approach Phillips for the purpose of having this examination conducted, yet Phillips was reluctant that he said that he wanted advice about it, that he didn't think that the police had the right to conduct such an examination. 
    And Inspector Pribell then requested that the others leave the room and leave him alone with Phillips so that he could discuss the matter with him privately. 
    The record would indicate that that private discussion took approximately 10 minutes and at the end of it, the other detectives and Dr. (Inaudible) were again re-invited to enter the room. 
    When they did, Phillips was still reluctant to undertake the examination or have it conducted with regard to his personal or his clothing. 
    And it was only at that point that -- that Inspector Pribell in his discussions with Phillips, told Phillips that he would drink some of the solution with which he intended to conduct the washing of Phillips' personal. 
    And having invited, he stated to Phillips that after all, it was not harmful to his personal, and the testimony would seem to indicate that at that time, Phillips stated to the doctor, the inspector and the others that he would undergo that physical examination and the other tests
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1182.152" stopTime="1184.887">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You told us previously that he could have his own -- his own doctor.
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1184.887" stopTime="1193.496">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    That's right, sir. 
    And he stated to them at that time that he didn't think that they had the right to conduct the examination.

    Well --

speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1202.782" stopTime="1231.382">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    Well, we say that it helps only to the degree that it required that his clothing be removed from him and it required him to subject his person to the examinations by the positions and taking along with the other continued examination that was conducted by the police, we say that it indicated clearly the purposes and the extent to which the police intended to go in order to ultimately obtain incriminatory statements from the petitioner.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1231.382" stopTime="1243.372">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, they -- if they offered him that his own physician or any physician or a friend physician could make these tests that would indicate the limit of how far they were intending to go, doesn't it?

    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    That would seem to indicate such a limit, sir. 
    There's no doubt about that. 
    But by the same token, when the -- when the -- the offer was first made and then the -- the discussion continue by a person who wanted to speak to Phillips alone and by a person who had been acquainted with Phillips on -- for some time prior, we say that this would indicate a circumstance that could -- will raise question concerning the activity by the police at that particular time.

    That particular time was 7 o'clock in the evening, approximately 7 to 8 p.m. 
    By 8 p.m., the entire -- the entire examination had been completed. 
    The tests were -- the result of the test was not known to the police until sometime thereafter. 
    Now, after the examination had been made and the test taken, a Stock Detective Stock left for dinner. 
    Detective Rouffet remained with Phillips and stated that while he did not interrogate Phillips, he may have spoken with him. 
    That Phillips was seated in a chair at that time. 
    It was about 9 o'clock in the evening when Captain Kloss arrived and he and Stock again, had returned from dinner, he and again interrogated Phillips for about an hour continuing down to 10 p.m. on that day. 
    Rouffet joined then that examination also, so that this is one of the times when there were more than one in the examination. 
    It was about 10:30 in the evening when it was learned that Mrs. Graham, the foster mother of the violated child was in the station house and although the detectives state that they asked Phillips whether he would speak to Mrs. Graham and he gave his consent to that, they arrange so that Mrs. Graham and Phillips would be in an adjourning room with the door open so that he could be observed in his actions while the conversation continued. 
    It was in about 11 o'clock of the evening of that day that notification was given to the official court reporter.

speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1492.770" stopTime="1503.316">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    There is no -- there is no other testimony on that score whatsoever. 
    Nor was there any testimony concerning the state in which Mrs. Graham was at that particular moment.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1503.316" stopTime="1507.668">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's why I say so far as one can tell it, it -- I don't know what inference to draw from it.
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1507.668" stopTime="1526.698">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    Except that we say -- we say to this Court that under that -- having in mind, the fact that there was this -- this dispute between the petitioner and Mrs. Graham that there was the expressed threat by petitioner against Mrs. Graham. 
    That there was this high up --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1526.698" stopTime="1536.610">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But at that time, it wasn't known that there was this threat. 
    This threat came out on the trial later and as I understand it, you -- no credence should be attached to it.
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1536.610" stopTime="1551.724">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    We don't say that there shouldn't be any credence attached to it to this degree. 
    That certainly we feel, we feel that this was information that the detectives must have had since they -- they received from Mrs. Graham. 
    The description --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1551.724" stopTime="1570.136">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That would be -- that would be relevant if they had forced Mrs. Graham on. 
    But the question I'm putting to you is all we have from the record is that he was asked to draw (Inaudible) as voluntarily and as -- as could make -- should be because I'm asking you a question and he suggest, "I'd like to see it."
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1570.136" stopTime="1580.925">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    Well, I -- I appreciate -- I appreciate Your Honor's statements on that score. 
    I have to admit that we have a different view --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1580.925" stopTime="1586.186">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, then, I have no other knowledge than what I really record. 
    Therefore, I'm asking you questions.
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1586.186" stopTime="1687.527">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    I -- I say to Your Honor in all -- in all candor that I have nothing else on that point that I can offer from the record. 
    I say that at 11 o'clock, notice was given by the authorities to the official court reporter to the effect that they would desire his services at the police station or at the -- the police officers in connection with this investigation that he should hold himself in readiness. 
    That he was not required at that particular time. 
    And there was sometime after that, that Mrs. Graham's brother was brought in and the record is -- has force information in this connection as it is with regard to Mrs. Graham. 
    But it would seem to indicate that thereto inquiry that was made of Phillips as to whether or not he would speak to Maddox and that then, Maddox and Phillips met in this adjacent room on the -- the same physical circumstances at least. 
    Maddox apparently spoke to Phillips until approximately 1:15 on the morning of May 14 and after Maddox left, Detective Rouffet resumed the question -- his questioning of Phillips. 
    Stock also questioned Phillips along with Lieutenant Cummings.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1687.527" stopTime="1699.265">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I ask you this? 
    Did anything come out at the trial, be it on the record of court as to what took place in the talks between Phillips and Mrs. Graham in later Mr. (Inaudible)
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1699.265" stopTime="1811.666">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    No, sir, no, sir. 
    They say -- stated between -- at about 1:15, Rouffet resumed his interrogation with Phillips and so did Stock along with Lieutenant Cummings. 
    It was about 1:30 a.m. that Rouffet left the police precinct and in his own language, he stated that he was a very tired man. 
    Now, in this Court too I feel that I must state to this Court that the record would indicate that Rouffet had been working on the investigation since the prior evening of May 12. 
    I don't want to give the impression that Rouffet was awake only during a portion of the period. 
    But there is some reference to the fact that he had been working on the investigation since the evening of May 12. 
    Rouffet stated though that at that time, Phillips was a sleepy man. 
    But at 1:30, Cummings and Stock continued their questioning of Phillips and continued until about 2:30 o'clock at that morning. 
    It was at that time Phillips' story remaining the same that it would determine that he should be removed from the third precinct, the local police precinct to police headquarters in Mineola. 
    And it was shortly after 3 a.m. in the morning that they arrived at the police headquarters. 
    There, they were met by the chief of police who went over the entire examination and questioning of Phillips all over again. 
    Present at that time were Inspector Lita, Lieutenant Cummings who had been with Phillips before and of course, Detective Stock.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Schober, may I ask you, if you would be good enough to summarize what you conceive to be whereas the evidence in the procession of the police, up to that hour pointing to guilt or innocence.
speaker="henry_w_schober" startTime="1828.577" stopTime="1905.048">
    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    Yes, sir. 
    I think that we have done that and set forth particularly in our reply brief beginning at page 4. 
    But we say there that as of that time, as a matter of fact, we start with approximately 4:45 on that afternoon, but we say that as of midnight of May 13, the police knew, of course, of the fact that Sunday Graham was missing and the circumstances under which she was last observed. 
    They had the description of her clothing. 
    And by midnight of May 13, they had an identification of the body, and they have had an examination by the -- by Dr. (Inaudible) at the morgue. 
    They had the information concerning the acquaintance and the relationship between Manita Graham and Phillips on the prior occasions. 
    They had the information, we say, in spite of what Mr. Justice Frankfurter implied about before. 
    We say that they had the information concerning the threats made by Phillips upon Manita Graham. 
    They had --

    We say that it is -- it is again another element to be considered in the light of this totality of circumstances even though the question of the instructions relates solely to what happened judicially after the arrest and after the confession had been obtained and at the conclusion of the trial itself. 
    But continuing, as of midnight on the evening of May 13, they knew by Phillips' admissions that he had been in the neighborhood where Sunday Graham was last seen entering an automobile driven by a person of his description and an automobile of the -- of the kind and description owned by Phillips. 
    They had the -- they had the information to the effect that there were peanut shells that were in Phillips' automobile and which had been found in the hair of the body of the dead girl. 
    They had the information concerning the finding of blood beneath the body and had obtained from Phillips' home, his underclothing on which there were bloodstains although the ultimate testimony given by the experts -- by -- by the experts who submitted to analysis was to the effect that while the stains were a blood, it could not be determined whether it was human blood or other.

    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    My recollection of the record is that he had -- his education extended just to the primary grades that he had not -- that he had not gone ahead and as a matter of fact, his testimony and substances to the effect that his -- his uncle -- that his parents having turned him over to grandparents, that he was not unable to complete his high school training. 
    There is indication of the fact that he did attend high school for a period of time but he had actually accomplished the completion only of his elementary training. 
    So that there'll be no question, sir. 
    I -- I do definitely state again, he did attend high school. 
    I -- I don't want to have at felt that I am misstating. 
    I know that he did not complete his high school education.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2496.273" stopTime="2498.461">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And had ambition even to go to college.

    Mr. Henry W. Schober 
    He did, sir. 
    That's what the record would indicate. 
    As a matter of fact, the record -- so far as the testimony given by psychiatrist would indicate that he have a high intelligence quotient, but that he was subject to certain personality disorders. 
    We say that those things is being subject to the personality disorder of things that or is a thing that must be considered in determining the extent to which he could resist the actions of the police. 
    After he had been taken to police headquarters and after Chief Panell (ph) had gone over his entire story again with him, he was interrogated for about an hour according to Detective Stock and at that time an Inspector Lita, Lieutenant Cummings, Stock and Chief Panell were all present. 
    Now, the Assistant District Attorney was at police headquarters at that time but did not enter the room or the location where the examination of Phillips was being conducted at -- at that particular moment. 
    And there were -- was an occasion then when the detectives in the main spoke to Assistant District Attorney (Inaudible) the -- the ultimate prosecutor of the case. 
    And there is no clear indication of the person or persons with whom Phillips was left on that -- at that time. 
    In any event, it was at about 4:15 a.m. of May 14 that the request was forwarded to the report (Inaudible) to come to the police station for the purpose of taking a statement. 
    And it was about 4:30 that the Assistant District Attorney (Inaudible) first on -- to question Phillips and continued examining him and interrogating him until 5:10 in the morning at which time the first break in Phillips story came along. 
    Now, this was not the time when Mr. (Inaudible) stated to Phillips that they had found blood on his underclothing and inquired Phillips at that time of his knowledge concerning Sunday Graham. 
    It was then also that Phillips stated to Mr. (Inaudible) that he was sorry and then asked that the -- the police officers be brought in to him so that he could shake their hands. 
    That he did. 
    The examination continued. 
    The complete confession was obtained from him. 
    But we say that the confession itself must be read in the light of the prior interrogation and of Phillips' statement, not disputed or anywise answered, that he had been subjected to brainwash. 
    That he was parroted what had been told to him by the police officers and that he was taking the easy way out of the continued interrogation and questioning. 
    We say that reading that it will be seen that his answers in effect state that the factual matter included by the Assistant District Attorney in his questions were as good as any factual matters that Phillips himself might state in his answers and that -- in that fashion, we say that it's -- he's born out that he was accepting the version that was given to him by others, stating that his mind was a blank concerning the occurrence, he was merely repeating what others had told him concerning a claim occurrence. 
    We say that -- considering the fact that he had been awake since some 6 o'clock was 6:15 on the morning of May 13 that he had no sleep, no food, nothing to drink, nothing to smoke and in spite of the fact that the respondent points out that on six occasions, there were request, I withdraw that, that on four occasions, there were requests made to him as to whether he desired food and on two others, their food was offered to be brought to him that nevertheless, here was a man who did not have sleep, rest, food or drink and that these are circumstances to be considered in -- during the inferences concerning the state of mind in which he was as the result of the questioning which began at 1:15 of the afternoon before, his state of mind and his ability to resist or retain and keep his position. 
    We say that under those circumstances viewed in that light, there can be no determination that this was the result of his freedom of choice that he had any freedom of will in the matter but that actually what was occurring that was -- that he had been subjected completely to the will of his detainers and that when viewed in the light of the statements by Officer Rouffet, who said that they kept him for the purpose of extracting a confession from him that this was clear proof that what they --

    -- for him -- from him and Detective Stock who claimed that his detention was merely for the purpose of continuing their investigation said nothing further concerning any reason for his continued detention on that score. 
    The fact still remains, we say, that the information that they had at 4 o'clock was the same information that they had at midnight and the same information that they had the following morning at the time that he was booked and arraigned except for the confession that they had rung from his lips by virtue of this continued examination. 
    We say that the delay in arraignment while of itself and we're mindful of the decisions of this Court concerning delay in state prosecutions of arraignment, we say that the delay in arraignment can be used by this Court and considered by it in determining.

    We say that viewed under those circumstances and in that light that we are entitled to take the police at face value and that when Detective Rouffet said that one of the reasons is that they wanted to extract a confession from him that were entitled to view all the other circumstances in the light of that concession. 
    And that being so, that there are sufficient undisputed conceded facts in this record from which the inexorable conclusion must be that this was not a free, voluntary, uncoerced statement by the -- by the petitioner but was rather a compelled one, that its introduction know by his objection during the course of the trial was improper and constituted a denial of his rights.

    Mr. Henry W. Schober

    There are -- there is testimony by the police, by Detectives Rouffet and by -- Detectives Rouffet and Stock to the effect that he was not beaten nor did they hear any threats expressed to him while they were present. 
    Now, we point out to this Court that there were a number of police officers who saw and were in Phillips presence or in -- who had him in their custody on occasions when Stock and Rouffet were not present so that any denial by them in that regard is to be taken as a denial only of circumstances occurring while they were there. 
    On the other hand, there -- there are the statements by Phillips, the petitioner, were on cross-examination, and we say that this cross-examination is to be viewed to in the light of the record as it stands at that time, who stated that he was pushed around and forced to do different things, that he was brainwashed, that he barely parroted what others suggested to him because it was the easiest way out, that he wasn't able to resist.

   Argument of Joseph I. Heneghan
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3273.813" stopTime="3281.112">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Heneghan.
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="3281.112" stopTime="3475.084">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    Your Honors, you've just enjoyed a -- an extraordinarily fair statement of the facts in the record from Mr. Schober as to the basic facts in his presentation, I have no quarrel.Some of the inferences that he draws principally in his briefs more or so than here on the argument this afternoon, I do quarrel. 
    What I'd like to do was confine my argument just to the facts in the case. 
    I believe from the comments that were made from the bench, some of the points that were covered in the respondent's brief as to the length of the questioning as to a murder investigation, as already been observed by the Court, through the petitioner was with the police at the third precinct in Williston Park from 1:15 in the afternoon until 3 a.m. the following morning when he was moved to police headquarters, but it was not until sometime between 4 or 5 o'clock when there was positive identification of the body of Sunday Graham that the police were conducting a murder investigation. 
    Up to that time, Detective Rouffet had been carrying on this all by himself if there were -- if there was any overzealousness by the police, it was Rouffet who, starting the night before, gave up his sleep, searching around Hempstead, looking for this little girl to reunite her with her family, and he was the one almost unaided that questioned the petitioner. 
    And it was very intimate questioning up until the time of the discovery of the body. 
    Now, during the argument and in the briefs for the petitioner, Mr. Schober points out that from Hempstead where the child was found -- was supposed to come home from school, the petitioner was leaving. 
    The police came, took him from Hempstead to East Williston and in the petitioner's brief they say, the reason is not explained in the record. 
    Quite simply, the precinct which has geographical jurisdiction over the village of Hempstead is physically located in East Williston. 
    Why the police brought this petitioner to East Williston, was because they had -- that was the only facility available for conducting this local investigation into a missing child. 
    The petitioner also complains that the record fail to explain why at 3 a.m. in the depth of the night, he was moved to police headquarters. 
    There is no explanation on the record other than the chief of detectives had his base of operations in headquarters and didn't go out to all the 28 police departments and 8 precincts of the county police.

    That is right, Your Honor. 
    Now, I don't honestly know when those tests were -- the results of those tests were known to the police.

    That was the testimony on the trial. 
    In that connection, Pribell also testified that the purpose of these tests and these were not unique. 
    There were equally designed to exonerate as well as to inculpate the petitioner, even the questioning of this petitioner as a suspect in a murder investigation wasn't continued, once it had started at 9 o'clock. 
    We have the interruptions when he conversed privately and apparently from the testimony in the record, none of the detectives overheard what was the private conversation between the petitioner and his former wife, his paramour until four days previously, Mrs. Graham, neither did they overhear the private conversation between the petitioner and Mrs. Graham's brother.

    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    Before the questioning commence by the Assistant District Attorney, it was a further period during which the petitioner wasn't questioned at all, following the questioning by Chief Panell. 
    What we have here basically is the question before the Court. 
    Why did he confess at all? 
    He was a -- I understood that he was a high school graduate, the way I read the record. 
    He was a high school graduate, a man with admittedly superior mental prowess, a man moreover with considerable experience with the police. 
    In 1947, when he was arrested for that rape at a night point, he resisted all efforts to confess, took the stand in 1947 and swore innocence. 
    He was a man who had spent 10 years at (Inaudible), one of the best postgraduate legal institutions we have today.

    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    And in several fields, Your Honor. 
    At any rate, he didn't -- the feeling of the respondents, it wasn't the suction process of interrogation as the petition would have us understand on this brief that was responsible for it. 
    When he was told by Assistant District Attorney that blood had been found -- that Sunday Graham's blood was found on his underclothing, that was the point at which he knew that the jig was up.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3986.971" stopTime="3991.192">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What was the justification for saying that way?

    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    This, of course, is not again, not explained in the record. 
    All I can -- is -- it was an assumption of the Assistant District Attorney. 
    It was probably a misunderstanding of the information that had been communicated to him by the police during that conference just before he started a talk or have a dialogue with Phillips.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4013.269" stopTime="4014.189">

    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    The blood apparently, visual inspection, showed what appeared to be bloodstains. 
    The Assistant D.A. and all of the police assumed it was Sunday Graham's blood.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Heneghan, how does, as a matter of practice, the procedure in -- in your county?

    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    -- the Assistant District Attorneys are invited on occasion to participate in the questioning but only after the police have run out and exhausted their own resources. 
    In practice, these Q &amp; A's are taken in the event that there is an indictment might be return to ascertain whether or not, there is some proof of lying by a defendant who makes in a main and exculpatory statement.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is there anything in the record to show when this -- during his office was alerted?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Heneghan, there are some question raised as to the fairness of the District Attorney in saying that they found Sunday's blood on his under -- underclothing, was there -- is there any doubt as to whether the District Attorney at that time knew that -- that blood was found on there?
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4135.895" stopTime="4139.243">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4139.377" stopTime="4139.738">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    -- the police --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4139.738" stopTime="4139.979">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4139.979" stopTime="4140.888">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    -- had shown what --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4140.888" stopTime="4141.096">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4141.096" stopTime="4141.939">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    -- appeared to be bloodstains.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4141.939" stopTime="4162.161">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    So if there -- so if there was any -- any misrepresentation on his part, it went no further than to -- to make the assumption that what the police had told him was bloodstains on -- on the underclothing of the defendant was Sunday's blood.
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4162.161" stopTime="4162.532">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    That is true.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4162.532" stopTime="4165.899">

    That -- that's the only thing that could be wrong with it. 
    Is that right?

    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was there any --

    Yes.
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4178.549" stopTime="4183.526">

    -- but apparently from its effect on the petitioner, he know whose blood it was.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4183.526" stopTime="4196.548">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was there any suggestion that the trial that -- that Phillips was overreached by this statement and was it claimed that the trial of this statement was conscious false on the part of the District Attorney.
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4196.548" stopTime="4217.299">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    Yes. 
    In this sense, Your Honor, in arguing at the close of the People's case, the attorney -- the trial counsel, the attorney who led for the defense, argued most vehemently that this confession should be excluded and that the indictment should be dismissed because of this misrepresentation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4217.299" stopTime="4220.254">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I mean in -- in -- on the witness stand --
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4220.254" stopTime="4220.662">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    No, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4220.662" stopTime="4230.903">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- was it -- was the -- the claim made through question and answer before the jury, that the defendant has been overreached by -- by a consciously false statement?
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4230.903" stopTime="4513.799">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    None whatever, Your Honor, none whatever. 
    Well, returning to the principle question which is, why did he confess? 
    Up to this point, and we must bear in mind that this question and answer statement that was taken by the Assistant District Attorney was not interrupted for any reason. 
    It was not a situation where he continued its exculpatory statement, then there was an interruption, the Assistant D.A. left the room, a half hour or an hour passed and then when he came back, he was agreed to already to confess. 
    The early -- but this was one statement. 
    The early part of this statement is remarkable. 
    Phillips in addition of being intelligent is an extremely articulate individual with a mask of almost total recall of specific detail. 
    This part of his question and answer statement that he was -- gave to the Assistant District Attorney was almost exactly the same as he had given earlier before the discovery of the body to Detective Rouffet and that he gave license numbers, names of people he met, detailers involved, itinerary had taken the day of the crime, so as to place himself far away from the location of the school or the corner near the school were Sunday had been picked up. 
    Incidentally, the description that was furnished by Sunday's classmate could have fit anyone of thousands and thousands of Negro men in the village of Hempstead to say nothing of the rest to the County of Nassau. 
    But here was this statement going along until the moment when he is confronted by the one thing that he couldn't lie away from. 
    Up to that, the statement was a tissue of lies. 
    There was -- this was the one thing that when he was confronted with it, he realized that he could not lie away from. 
    At that point, here is a man -- we have this word in the suggestion, of course, in the briefs now that he was beaten and kicked around. 
    Here was the man who -- when he is confronted by that, calls the -- asked the Assistant District Attorney call in those police officers. 
    Why? 
    The point, the matters, “He kicked me, he beat me,” no, to shake hands with them. 
    In their reply brief -- in the reply brief, the petitioner says, "Well, these put up evidence on number of things,” the shaking of the hands, evidence that he was finally so overcome, so overborne that it was significant of the fact that he was giving in capitulating. 
    We can assume all kinds of things as to why he shook hands with these officers. 
    He might have been congratulating among their appointments or promotions, that was beside the point. 
    If this was the man who on cross-examine -- while being pressed on cross-examination and tried to wiggle out of the Assistant D.A.'s questions as to why his testimony deferred from the answers he gave in his question and answer statement that he was beaten, would he shake hands with him? 
    We say it's inconceivable. 
    Further, the record shows that the police exceeded to his request to call in a priest. 
    He was Catholic. 
    The little girl and her mother -- the entire family was Catholic. 
    He was -- the police called in a priest right away. 
    They brought in Manita Graham and Curtis Maddox again. 
    They arraign them at the very first opportunity at 10 a.m. 
    Following the arraignment, Phillips voluntarily agreed with them to go out and visit the scenes of the crime. 
    Now, is this -- is this conceivable that a man who claims for the first time on his trial that he was beaten? 
    After arraignment before a judge would thereafter voluntarily, drive around the county with the police? 
    Is it conceivable that if a police had beaten him or had laid a finger on him, they would have brought in his former wife, a priest or arraignment before a court where he could make prompt complaint? 
    No complaint was made. 
    There was no complaint made when he was placed in a detention cell. 
    In fact, there was no issue raised at the trial.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4513.799" stopTime="4519.107">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    When were -- when were the two counsels who defended him at the trial appointed?
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4519.107" stopTime="4597.983">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    Not until after the indictment had been returned. 
    The practice in New York is to assign counsel after indictment and not before. 
    The preliminary arraignment before the magistrate is merely to advise him of all his rights under the statute to fix bail if it's a case where a bail maybe fixed and to conduct an examination if requested by the defendant. 
    New York practice is in all arrest prior to indictment. 
    The defendant is entitled to an examination, confrontation of the witnesses and they must take the stand and spell out by their testimony and they are subject to cross-examination whether or not basis exist for holding him for the action of the grand jury, and that basis is there must be proof that a crime has been committed and unless be reasonable cause to believe that defendant under arrest has committed it and unless the people produced that proof within 48 hours and no adjournment is permitted under New York practice unless that proof is produced within 48 hours, the Court must order the release of the defendant.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4597.983" stopTime="4602.921">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Counsel therefore -- the indictment is filed, the counsel appointed in a capital case.
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4602.921" stopTime="4605.297">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    Usually -- in a capital case?

    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    I believe so, but I am not certain. 
    It's --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4615.131" stopTime="4616.649">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What's the average time?
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4616.649" stopTime="4639.039">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    Usually, in non -- in all non capital cases, they are appointed immediately upon the arraignment. 
    As soon as the defendant is arraigned on the indictment, counsel is assigned in all felony cases in the -- in Nassau County today. 
    Counsels are assigned every defendant unless they indicate that they intend to retain counsel.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Heneghan, may I ask? 
    Is the entire conversation between the District Attorney and the petitioner in the record (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4649.026" stopTime="4649.834">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    Everything, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4649.834" stopTime="4651.516">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It's all in there.
speaker="joseph_i_heneghan" startTime="4651.516" stopTime="4748.165">
    Mr. Joseph I. Heneghan 
    In fact, on cross-examination of this court reporter who has been a court reporter for over 50 years, this was a fact -- question that was asked by the petitioner's trial counsel. 
    That was the whole break in the trial. 
    Up to that point, the petitioner's trial counsel had been making statements which seemed to indicate that he planned to bring out 36 witnesses to prove that he had been assaulted, largely police witnesses, we have to assume. 
    However, when he asked the court stenographer, the court reporter, whether or not these transcripts had everything that was said and whether or not it was a fact that Phillips -- that the report and the Assistant District Attorney did not come in to Phillips presence until after he'd agreed to confess, upon receiving a negative answer from the court reporter, the whole thrust of the offense changed from that point forward in the trial. 
    There was not another word read as to any violence because examination of the transcript shows that the Assistant District Attorney talked with the petitioner for almost an hour before he broke out and confessed and the testimony of the court reporter, in fact the testimony of Phillips himself is that that transcript omitted nothing, everything was put into that transcript by this court reporter.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4748.165" stopTime="4756.424">
