    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    It might be responsive to Mr. Justice Douglas' comment yesterday as to stockholder approval. 
    To state, in this case director, vestry and churchwardens of Trinity Church are constituted the corporation under their charter from Queen Anne. 
    And that therefore, in this case, we do have the effect of stockholder approval. 
    The actual body corporate approved it insofar as that is legally possible.

    Mr. Clendon H. Lee 
    Well, the Government did not raise, at any point, the issue of corporate capacity. 
    Now, if they were to raise that point either under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 or Federal Rule 9, then they would be in a position to raise that point here. 
    The manner in which they've raised it, they're asking this Court to create a nationwide body of corporate incapacity in complete violation and in complete conflict with the Erie Railroad against Tompkins, they're asking this Court without having the charter, the colonial charter of Trinity Church here, on appeal on certiorari. 
    They're asking this Court, in effect, to do away with the Dartmouth College case when Trinity Church is not a party to this proceeding.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="141.351" stopTime="154.784">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I -- I didn't suppose that the corporate capacity would come directly under review, but -- but might it not be -- might it not be important to determine whether it was a gift or not?
speaker="clendon_h_lee" startTime="154.784" stopTime="467.006">
    Mr. Clendon H. Lee 
    The Government could have raised that point, Your Honor. 
    And the Government stipulated on trial in the reply brief that's referred to on record pages 18 and page 60. 
    The Government stipulated that the only question involved was the question of the nature of the payment to Mr. Stanton. 
    Now, here, they have purported to raise a question of corporate capacity and they have done that not through the familiar process of stating that Congress, for purposes of bankruptcy, for purposes of taxation, for so many purposes, may describe the legal incidence of certain transactions, may say what consequences flow for the purposes of federal law. 
    They have said, “Instead, we must go back and find an inherent corporate incapacity to make a gift.” 
    And they have done so by citing a few cases. 
    We only got the Government's brief and printer's proof form of 78 pages plus 30-page appendix on last Friday. 
    And I'm afraid I haven't been able to deal in detail with all their points.But they cite questions like Rogers again Hill. 
    Hill is relating to eluding the corporation. 
    I don't think they have any bearing on this point at all. 
    This inveterate principle of federal corporation law apparently wasn't clear to the Government just a few weeks before, when it did the Duberstein brief and they're asking this Court in the first instance, to promulgate this federal rule of corporate incapacity and we submit that it's wholly improper for that question to be here. 
    And the Government attempts to put this Court in that position by conceding all the evidentiary facts. 
    The case of Mr. Stanton is not referred to in the Government's brief until page 77. 
    They concede the evidentiary fact. 
    They expressly concede, on page 77 of their brief that the vestry and director who is part of the corporation necessarily, intended to make a gift. 
    And I think they must necessarily be understood as also conceding that the majority in the Court of Appeals below made certain patent errors in reviewing the facts. 
    Now, one of those particular errors, I -- I should like to refer to at some length, unless this Court perhaps, not perceive it. 
    The resolution awarding the gratuity to Stanton, which appears on page 4 of the main brief -- page 5 of the main brief, “Be it resolved that in appreciation of the services rendered by Mr. Stanton as manager of the estate and so on. 
    A gratuity is hereby awarded him of $20,000 and so on.” 
    And then, there's a proviso, “Provided that with the discontinuance of his services, the corporation of Trinity Church is released from all rights and claims to pension and retirement benefits, not already accrued up to November 30, 1942.” 
    Mr. Stanton resigned on November 5. 
    His -- this resolution was adopted November 19. 
    The effective date of his resignation was November 30. 
    Under this resolution, any treatment of the gift to him, as anything other than a gift, was precluded. 
    If Stanton had died, his legal representatives could never have maintained that further pension rights accrued after the effective date of his resignation. 
    He no more gave up anything under this resolution, than he gave up future salary. 
    There is -- the resolution itself is really the -- the copper riveting, so far as the vestry was concerned, to preclude its being treated for corporate purposes or by legal representatives as anything other than a gift. 
    Now, having referred to that one particular error and the Government having conceded it on its brief in this Court, I think that it might have been perhaps preferable if they had joined in petitioner's petition for rehearing in the Second Circuit to permit the Second Circuit to correct that error. 
    And then consider its opinion in that light, rather than trying to precipitate the issue in this Court with the Duberstein case at the same time. 
    Now, I shan't, at this point, refer to the clusters of evidentiary facts which are recited on pages 24 and 25.

    Yes, your Honor.

speaker="clendon_h_lee" startTime="472.354" stopTime="517.346">
    Mr. Clendon H. Lee 
    The factual error is an error in Judge Hands' opinion where he stated that, “Stanton gave something up under this proviso which would presumably be some variety of consideration.” 
    In lieu of his pension rights, he got this, which isn't a fact at all, because he got all of his pension rights. 
    And it's the misreading of that proviso which the Government conceives, I believe, under its brief -- in its brief in this case, which caused that unfortunate mistake in the Second Circuit. 
    And that's why I say that would've come with better grace, if the Government had joined in our petitioner for rehearing in the Second Circuit. 
    Now, the fact that stand (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="517.346" stopTime="527.386">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you -- do you ask us to read that -- read out that language above pension -- pension rights entirely as being -- as being inconsequential?
speaker="clendon_h_lee" startTime="527.386" stopTime="988.024">
    Mr. Clendon H. Lee 
    It is completely inconsequential, Your Honor. 
    And if it's to be given any meaning at all, it reinforces the nature of this as an outright grant without consideration, because he kept everything which had accrued through the effective date of his resignation. 
    And in the record, page 34 in the record, one of the trustees of the pension fund refers to his voting to refund the money, that is Stanton's own contribution, which he was entitled to get. 
    On page 51 of the record, Stanton had contributed $1590 to the pension plan of Trinity Church and $594 to the pension plan of Trinity's real estate subsidiary. 
    These amounts were refunded to him which was one of the elections which he could take under the pension plan. 
    So that he did not give up anything. 
    He received the $20,000 gratuity and he had the option or the election of either leaving that in the pension plan or taking a cash refund. 
    And he took the cash refund. 
    And it's just that one unfortunate error, which I want -- wanted to refer to at some length here, before going into the cases. 
    The Government relies upon this Court's opinion in 1956, Commissioner against LoBue or LoBue, in which a Stock Option Plan was offered to employees as an inducement, as an incentive to keep them on the job, to promote the business of the employer. 
    Now -- so the Government says, “This substitutes motive for intent.” 
    And bearing in mind Mr. Justice Frankfurter's remarks yesterday on the unfortunate necessity of dealing with states of mind, I should like, if I may, to refer specifically and perhaps pedantically to the LoBue case. 
    This Court unanimously, speaking through Mr. Justice Black, and I've quoted this on page 7 of petitioner's reply brief, stated, “But there's not the slightest indication of the kind of detached and disinterested generosity which might evidence a gift in the statutory sense.” 
    These transferors of stock bore none of the earmarks of a gift. 
    They were not made by a company engaged -- they were made by a company engaged in operating a business for profit. 
    And the Tax Court found that the Stock Option Plan was designed to achieve more profitable operations by providing the employees with an incentive to promote the growth of the company by permitting them to participate in its success. 
    Under these circumstances, the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals properly refrained from treating this transfer as a gift, that company was not giving away something for nothing. 
    Now, in the Stanton case, something was given away for nothing. 
    There was no past consideration because he got $22,500 a year, salary. 
    His successor got approximately half that. 
    So, in Mr. Justice Brandeis' language, “Past services had fully requited.” 
    No further acquittance was necessary. 
    There was no future consideration because he did nothing, nor did he refrained from doing anything in the future. 
    There was no covenant not to compete, no consultation. 
    It was not a substitute for the pension rights. 
    It was not consideration in any way. 
    Now, we believe that the key to intent to make a gift lies in the presence or absence of consideration. 
    This is the traditional element of a gift, an absolute grant without consideration. 
    Without consideration is the realistic test. 
    Motive can never be a realistic test. 
    Motive, if this Court were to direct the lower courts to pursue motives, we would have the sort of the question which I had to participate in several years ago in the Third Circuit, where the Government revoked retroactively, the tax-exempt status of a charity on the ground that the assets of that charity might have been used to provide a source of raw materials, if needed by the donors and the founders of that charitable foundation. 
    Now, Judge Goodrich, in the unanimous court, would have absolutely nothing to do with that point of view. 
    And I don't think that the point of view of Government by motive has very much to commend itself to this Court. 
    We'll get in the filed of -- of constitutional vagueness. 
    Look at murder. 
    Look at anything. 
    Motive arises all of the time, but sometimes we have to look at the actual events and that aspect of the event which involves the state of mind. 
    We can't escape from some dealing with the states of minds, but any antecedent motives, any states of mind, which a person might have, certainly cannot form the basis for directions by the this Court to the lower courts. 
    It's -- I think, also of importance that the Government concedes here that affection is not the sine qua non of a gift. 
    The Government expressly states that affection is only one of the elements which might be taken into consideration. 
    And they refer to an opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas for this Court in Robertson, where a person gave up certain public performance rights to a musical composition, in a contest, in which he entered and he received a prize and that was held to be income. 
    And this Court differentiated the case of -- where something is given out of affection and certain other impulses and affection was one of the examples. 
    Now, certainly, good emotions certainly, can't be the criterion of a gift. 
    Wiley Oddyseus to Priam with the Trojan Horse, Greeks could bear gifts without having affection for Trojans. 
    And I think that we -- we must restrict ourselves to the very basic concept, the traditional property and contract law concepts of gift and whether it is with or without consideration. 
    Now, just very briefly, reviewing the facts with respect to Mr. Stanton, so if the Court will have it in mind --

    I think where there's no anticipated benefit, no incentive and in Mr. Justice Brandeis expression in Bogardus, where past services had been fully requited, I -- I think there, a trier of fact can properly find a gift. 
    Now, if employment has been the occasion for knowing someone, it seems to me that that should not vitiate a gift. 
    Now, the Government asks here that corporations be completely, absolutely, from the beginning of the republic to the present day, be disabled from making a gift. 
    And that faithful stewards and old retainers be disqualified from their statutory right to receive it. 
    And the Government asks for definitions. 
    Now, Congress has not defined the gift. 
    The Government appends 30 pages of cases.

    I would like today, to seek more hospitable ground by disassociating myself from that argument. 
    In our view, with the main controlling issue in Kaiser case was really not the “gift” issue at all, but -- but the income issue. 
    Whether relief payments regardless of the interest that they pay or -- or the kind of thing that Congressman Taft and it's included in the definition of income. 
    Now, that problem is not involved in Duberstein and Stanton at all. 
    We are here concerned solely with this specific purposes and policy of the gift exclusion. 
    What is a gift? 
    Now, the extinction between gifts -- the gift problem and the income problem as Mr. Elman pointed out, also distinguishes the problem here, the problem on the Pot O' Gold and the other advertising giveaway cases, which -- though they stated the results in terms of gift, really turned on the considerations that go into the income question.

    The first case, the Pot O' Gold case, itself, is evident in the opinion, that they're talking about Eisner and Macomber, that the receipt was received without any investment of capital, without any effort. 
    And therefore, in the Eisner and Macomber idea of income, it was not income. 
    And we think that really was the basis for those decisions and they likewise did not involve the gift issue. 
    Now, is this case that poses the gift issue in its most basic and most litigated form, payments to employees to their families? 
    There'd been perhaps, over 100 decisions in the area and still there's no clear line for what is and what isn't a gift. 
    This case sharply presents the issue of the -- Mr. Stanton worked for the church for 10 years. 
    The church gave Mr. Stanton $20,000. 
    Now, the problem in resolving that is primarily a problem of terminology, we think. 
    That's the reason for the -- the troubles the courts have had -- have had.

speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="1515.010" stopTime="1614.172">
    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Now, that's illustrated here by the argument that the question is one of consideration. 
    Now, is -- the service has existed and the payment existed. 
    And the problem is to tie them together. 
    How do you decide whether one is for the other? 
    And you can't answer that by saying it -- it is or is not a consideration. 
    They just begs the question. 
    The courts in trying to make -- to make the connecting tie between the one and the other have generally phrased the question as whether the payor intended to pay for the services. 
    Now, the problem in this -- what they meant by intent. 
    Now, used -- in a technical sense are precisely used. 
    Intent, we think, is an act of will. 
    It's -- it necessarily implies power of choice. 
    I can intend whatever I want to intend. 
    Now, if the courts mean intent in that sense, it necessarily means that the question turns on what the payor will. 
    He can will the payment to be a gift or will it to be compensation. 
    And its -- one thing is clear, that's not what the courts mean. 
    They don't -- they don't mean that the payor can specify whether it's going to be a gift or compensation. 
    What we think they mean, if you look to what Government's decisions, rather than the language, is what moved the payor to make the payment? 
    Why did he make the payment? 
    And that relieves all we mean by motive to distinguish motive from intent.

    Of the -- the dissenting opinion, for example, speaks of -- whether it is made with the intention to show goodwill, affection or esteem. 
    Now, it certainly has to make any difference whether you intent to show this or when you -- when you intend that somebody will believe that you have these feelings. 
    These feelings are relevant only if it was out of that that you made the payment.

speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="2022.878" stopTime="2142.668">
    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    This is a -- a problem of avoiding a -- a restrictive meaning of -- of words like, “do an obligation.” 
    Judge Hand in Bogardus, used the phrase, “whether once moved by some scruple,” some -- some sense of an easiness that that he hasn't fully responded as he should, unless he makes the payment that it satisfies that sense. 
    Now, that -- that is the most subtle problem, which will very sought and be a rate -- be raised. 
    Letter -- that common really arises first of all, only in a case of -- of payments by individuals. 
    We think that problem so -- selling the (Inaudible) in -- in -- by a corporation. 
    And the standard that we draw in that case is exactly the same standard of connection to the business that is necessary to justify a business expense. 
    Now, we have a body of law of what the business relationship has to be, to justify a business expense. 
    What we're really saying in the end (Inaudible) would like to get there is that you apply -- since the same standard of business relationship, where the gift purpose has to do for the business expense purpose. 
    Now, I think that there is a very solemn area since no one ever looked at the statute. 
    I -- I think actually, there's a great deal to be learned from the statute here, when -- I think it -- it's perhaps the strongest support for our definition of gifts as excluding those nature for business reasons. 
    First of all, the assimilation of gifts to devices, inheritances and -- and bequest. 
    Now the -- a bequest is an essentially personal matter. 
    I -- these are interest family transfers by enlarge and you can be understandably -- they involved personal kinds of motivation. 
    And we think that including gifts in exclusion, Congress had in mind the same kind of transfer in a -- in revivals transfers.

    We say that when a corporation has made a payment. 
    You can answer the question, why did they make the payment, by asking of what basis was the use of corporate assets justified. 
    Now, on this case, for example, we -- we ask the legal question on what basis was the use of a church -- the church's assets to make a payment to Mr. Stanton justify.

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Yes, yes. 
    Well, we -- we get to a problem -- for example, take -- take the case of the -- a payment that is unanimously approved by the stockholders. 
    Now, we don't think a majority approval makes any difference, because the majority stockholders had the same duty to use the corporate assets only for business purposes as the directors do. 
    But if it's unanimously approved by the stockholders, that may bar our use of the presumption, because the -- the stockholders, unless creditors were prejudiced, could use the -- the assets or whatever they wanted to. 
    But then a federal rule comes into play of income attribution. 
    Now, if the stockholders, say a family corporation, did use the business assets to make a gift to a widow, of -- of the president of corporation. 
    This is fairly completive most to the weight of bonus cases. 
    Now, if that -- if there was a business justification for the use of the corporate assets, let us say that -- that -- because of the past services performed, the corporation felt a -- a sense of obligation to make some provision for the widow. 
    Then, of course, it would be income (Inaudible) they would to the widow. 
    It would not be a gift to her. 
    If on the other hand, of the sought to be shown, that wasn't quite a major payment at all. 
    The reason they made the payment is the stockholders happen to like the widow or felt personal sympathy for the widow. 
    It would follow then that -- that -- of course, it was -- it was a gift to the widow. 
    But by the same token, it was a distribution by the corporation to the stockholders, the dividend of the stockholders. 
    They've used corporate funds to satisfy their personal purposes. 
    Now, that's why I say that -- that if we can define a gift in terms exclusive of business reasons -- actually, we were very seldom be a litigated case, because the recipient is not going to claim.

speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="2522.052" stopTime="2615.370">
    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    In the case of a -- individual who makes a payment to someone who has previously performed services for him. 
    We give you the example on our brief of -- but first we get the extreme examples, someone rescues her child and you were moved to make a lavish reward. 
    Now, for safety that's -- that's our gratitude for services, but it is more than that. 
    Your response involves a -- a -- emotional response. 
    Now, a -- a more borderline case, we put in our Beacon and -- and Stanton. 
    Where a sole proprietor has made his fortune and his business, then sold the business to retired and now he's got millions of dollars and doesn't know what to do with them and he doesn't want his aunt to get it when he dies. 
    And he's moved out of the -- just a sense of goodwill to make a generous distribution to all of his old employees. 
    Now we don't say that can't be a gift, we say if the -- whether it is or not, deters upon the question it backed, whether he was moved by any of sense of that something more in equity and fairness was due the employees. 
    Now, I don't mean to -- I -- I don't mean to -- to state a test of -- of legal obligation, a moral obligation, but something that makes it as -- as Learned Hand said, “Something less than an unconstrained act of generosity.” 
    Or it is the sense of -- of composure, if I may -- that is owing and that --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2615.370" stopTime="2620.488">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Does not the Bogardus rule take account of that theory?

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Yes. 
    Well, that -- that is our explanation of Bogardus. 
    That -- that Bogardus actually adopts the same line that Learned Hand tried to spell out so carefully. 
    Now, the opinion there talks about the stockholders removed -- the hypothetical I gave you is this really the Bogardus case, except that we have the complications of corporations, but the payment there was treated by the Court as having been made by the former stockholders themselves, not by -- this new corporation. 
    And so they were in the same positions as my sole proprietor, who has retired from the business. 
    And if you read the Supreme Court opinions in the light of the -- of the issue stated by Judge Hand, of whether it's unrestrained generosity or a sense of -- of something more being due.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2671.191" stopTime="2695.990">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    As I understood you though, you would require a jury or the fact-finder, if not a jury to negate any feeling or condition of the payment being for something not previously done that should have been done.

speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="2724.727" stopTime="2756.477">
    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Well that -- that is true -- if you very carefully define donative intent to mean that. 
    The most course don't mean that, when they say donative intent. 
    What they mean is that I didn't have a legal obligation and I intended that he should have the money. 
    And that's donative intent. 
    Now -- and that's not what I mean by it. 
    I mean, I don't think it's what you mean by it. 
    And -- what we would like to do is avoid to use of words like intent and like consideration that -- that aren't -- don't, themselves, convey any specific meaning you have to -- have to spell out exactly what mean before they -- they're useful.

    I've followed the advice of Mr. -- or the suggestion of Mr. Elman tendered and if one read Judge Hand's opinion below, which I have done and not only where in his opinion, but I read Judge Swan's dissenting opinion in that case. 
    And I agree with -- I don't know that heart of the number of times, the opinions in this Court. 
    The Bogardus opinion in this Court is a -- is pie with many plums --

    What I get out of the opinions of the lower court, the need of this Court. 
    It is the different plum that picks by different people in different cases, for different purpose. 
    And I should -- I now understand why the Government doesn't ask as to overrule Bogardus, if you were to ask me to do that, I wouldn't know what I was overruling, except one thing --

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Yes.

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2856.397" stopTime="2952.608">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- namely, that in view of the fining of the Commissioner as sustained by the Board of Tax Appeal, the court, the District Court, none of the courts should have overruled those joint findings. 
    And, I think, the numbers of case, I said what I think about it. 
    For me, I think your chasing the wrong hare in all its business. 
    Because Mr. Justice Sutherland, as tow whom I have great respect, had affection as a man. 
    In this case and so of with his opinions, talked to much. 
    Indeed, I think, almost all the judges in this field talk too much. 
    Because he didn't restrict himself to moral and legal duty, except something else which is very pertinent. 
    All of the incentive and -- of anticipated benefit of any kind beyond the satisfactory close from the performance of a generous act. 
    I ask you, could you let lose a more confusing and diverting set of words than those? 
    How can any judge or any jury, any court, at least, if the jury has found it, decide whether or not, something that was given, was given as an incentive of anticipated benefit of any kind beyond the satisfaction. 
    Parents give gifts to children or friend give gifts to friends and who is to pursue the complexity of motive that entered. 
    Now, then, I think the Bogardus case really -- the lower court is a clash between the view of Judge Hand, who said that the determinations of fact and practically final from him.

    Think of lawyers stipulating this kind of thing. 
    It was stipulated that the disbursements were not made or intended to be made for any services rendered or to be rendered, or for any consideration given or to be given etcetera, etcetera.

    Well, let me say that in 20 cases, in 20 cases, I purport to refer to the presumption that a corporation cannot make a gift to its officers and employees. 
    And in every case, every case -- now, was that presumption has been inferred to, it was held not to be a gift. 
    And one case said nothing more than that. 
    That's -- that is an answer to almost all of these cases, it's the answer to this case. 
    In this case, the plaintiff was not a gift, because the vestryman could not give away the church's assets, unless it was reasonable compensation for their services.

    That -- in the Court of Appeals, we did argue this business about possible (Voice Overlap) --

    Where is -- what is -- what -- on what grounds do you know or at anytime challenge the findings of the Court of Appeals or the District Court?

    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Well -- I -- I can say -- I can state the challenge as one of insufficient evidence, but what I'm really saying is that if you apply the right test, the right definition of a gift, there is no evidence to support an inclusion that these directors violated their trust, their duties to the church by giving away the assets for their personal reasons. 
    And that was that the only claim that would raise the question of fact. 
    There's no evidence of that. 
    And therefore, the -- the finding of fact is not supported by the evidence, but since it's just the problem of definition other than one of evidence.

    Do you conceive that (Inaudible) that the Government said the corporation did intend to make a gift from Mr. Stanton?
speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="3359.800" stopTime="3394.873">
    Mr. Wayne G. Barnett 
    Oh, we had -- we have tried to say that intent is an act of will and we agreed that they intended with all their might that this be a gift that it be not taxable to Mr. Stanton. 
    They wanted it not to be taxable. 
    I dare say they were advised by counsel that that depended upon whether they intended as a gift and therefore, they did intend it as a gift. 
    We -- we concede that. 
    We -- we think certainly, the result does not depend upon that kind of -- of act or will. 
    Thank you very much. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Clendon H. Lee

    Mr Lee.

    Mr. Clendon H. Lee 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think in what Mr. Barnett has just stated that he has put ourselves right back in the Dartmouth College case and in the -- and in the Erie Railroad against Tompkins, because he says that it is only, if they breached their trust that this can be a gift, that the corporation is inherently incapable of making a gift. 
    Our Federal Rule 8 provides that affirmative defenses shall be pleaded. 
    There was no affirmative defense below. 
    This is a complete afterthought. 
    It was an afterthought after the filling to Duberstein brief. 
    They knew that they couldn't -- couldn't support the -- they -- they couldn't upset the fact findings of the trial court and they perfectly, logically and the brief of the Government is, I think, thoroughly consistent in this regard. 
    It proceeds and says, we must throw away property and contract concepts. 
    We must look at the corporation, we must dehumanize it. 
    It's the non-anthropomorphic view of corporations. 
    That's what it is. 
    We dehumanize it. 
    And by the same token, a corporation cannot commit a crime including tax fraud, we strip it of all intent, all will, all emotional coloration and we say that that has been the law since the beginning of the republic. 
    A corporation is inherently incapable -- incapable of making a gift. 
    Now, I am a little bit perplexed about the reference to deductibility of business expenses. 
    I can appreciate the Commissioner's desire and the Solicitor General's desire to introduce symmetry into the statute, but that is purely a -- a congressional function. 
    The Internal Revenue Code is the baroque masterpiece of Congress. 
    And it can't be redone by the pseudo-classical canons of criticism of the Commissioner or the Solicitor General.

    Very well.
