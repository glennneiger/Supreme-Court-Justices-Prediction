    Number 33, Mitchell, Secretary of Labor, Petitioner, versus Oregon Frozen Foods Company et al. 
    Ms. Margolin.
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="25.471" stopTime="489.674">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The issues in this case concern two related exemptions from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as those exemptions apply to the processes of frozen vegetable. 
    The first section, first exemption is to that of Section 7 (c) which insofar is pertinent here, provides for an exemption of for not more than 14 work weeks in a calendar year, for employment of employees in a place where the employer is engaged in the first processing of or in the canning or packing of perishable of seasonal fresh fruits or vegetables. 
    The other section involved is the Section 7 (b) (3) which provides another overtime exemption also for not more than 14 work weeks, but limited to 12 hours a day and 56 a week, for any employee employed in an industry found by the administrator to be of a seasonal nature. 
    Now the issues under both of this -- these exemptions turn on the same language because the administrator made his seasonal finding under Section 7 (b) (3) in the same language as the first processing language of Section 7 (c) and determined that the exemptions could be accumulated. 
    I'll say that the issues turn on this -- the same language at least all the issues that were raised in the court below, the whole issue was about the meaning of the language, the first processing of perishable, of seasonal fresh fruits or vegetables as used in the statute in Section 7 (c) and the identical language as used in Section 7 (b) (3). 
    For -- in the briefs of respondents and of amicus curiae, the National Association of Frozen Food Packers for the first time in this Court, a question is raised as to the validity of the administrator's seasonal finding under Section 7 (b) (3). 
    We have filed -- petitioners filed a reply brief directed primarily to this issue and if time permits, I will come in on it later, but since the issues presented by the -- decided below and tried below and presented in the petition for certiorari related solely to the meaning of this language, I'll address myself primarily to -- to that question, to -- to that issue. 
    The pertinent facts are not in dispute. 
    As a matter of fact they were agreed to and incorporated by agreement in the District Court's pretrial order and by the way were the contentions and the issues. 
    I'm not making too much of the point of that because we -- we think that the -- the new contention is -- is without merits, certainly not well taken, but there is some question as to whether it is -- is properly -- whether it has not been foreclosed by the stipulation of the parties at the pretrial order. 
    The operations of -- of Oregon are described in these agreed facts. 
    If the -- they have an active season, they're engaged in -- in freezing and package -- and packaging corn and carrots and on mixed vegetables -- mixed frozen vegetables. 
    The active season for corn is about nine or 10 weeks from August 1st to August -- to October 10th and the active season for carrots is from about October 15 to December 1st, about six -- approximately six weeks. 
    The process through which the -- the Oregon purchase that -- purchases the -- the crops during the harvested season and from nearby -- from nearby farm and it has -- has to immediately process them to stop the natural deterioration and -- and to put them into preservable form. 
    The process includes the cutting and cleaning and otherwise preparing for blanching, a partial cooking process. 
    And -- and this partial cooking process kills the enzymes which are responsible for our organic growth and the consequent rapid deterioration from natural causes. 
    Then the -- the blanched vegetables are put through the freezing units and quick-frozen. 
    After they've been quick-frozen in loose farm and this is done immediately on receipt of the -- of the vegetable, some of the vegetables are immediately packaged in consumer-sized containers. 
    Normally, however, only a small part of the vegetables -- the frozen vegetables can be so packed immediately. 
    Less than a third of the corn for example was packaged during the active season in 1954, I believe it was. 
    The balance of the vegetables is packaged in large bulk, this is after they've been quick-frozen, in large bulk containers and placed in cold storage to be repackaged when the rest season ends. 
    This can be and is spread out over many months and may continue through the following May even. 
    In addition to the -- the freezing and the bulk packaging of the corn and carrots, Oregon also from December through -- I think in December and January for several months, mixed -- prepares a mixed vegetable, mixed frozen vegetable from its corn -- its own frozen corn and carrots and from -- mixed with peas and beans and lima beans, string beans and lima beans, which it purchases already frozen from other processors in Washington, California and Oregon. 
    The -- during the active harvesting season, Oregon employs approximately 300 employees -- production employees for the processing of the corn and reduces that number at the end of the season to about 20 employees. 
    For carrots during the active season, about 40 production employees are employed and that's reduced to about 20 at the end of the active season.

    They're rather confusing. 
    I've tried to make something of them and I think that it's rather confusing because it doesn't correspond with the -- the agreement as to what the active season was.

    We can see that during the active season when the crops are coming in, when there's a great influx of crops and they have to be immediately processed and they -- we -- and that the freezing process is -- the freezing process and the immediate repackaging, that continues operation until there's a break that that is a – exempt, but when there's a break, the subsequent operations are not that.

    Ms. Margolin you may proceed.
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="723.324" stopTime="1188.083">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    The administrator's interpretation of this language of the exemptions, his long standing interpretation has been that this seasonal -- that it is a seasonal exemption limited to -- to the purpose of giving relief, the seasonal commodities during the peak season when prompt processing is essential for preservation of the crop and when the heavy influx during the short harvesting season can be handled only by working large quantities of labor for long hours and that it was not intended to exempt activities which could be extended around the year and where there was ample labor -- year round labor available to handle it. 
    This position as we'll later it show, has been the long standing interpretation of the administrator and has received the approval of -- of Congress. 
    So, it -- it is also, we believe, are clearly in accord with the original legislative purpose although we think it is unnecessary to examine very far into the original legislative purpose because it has clearly been approved by the subsequent legislative enactment of the 1949 Amendments under this Court's decisions construing those amendments. 
    The purpose though, as explained in both the deliberations in the House and the Senate debates, was made plain that it was to be for these peak seasons to use the language of Senator Black, who was Chairman of the Senate Committee, the Committee was concerned with the necessity of excluding purely seasonal activities which cannot operate in any other way except by speeding up the work at a particular time. 
    It was also equally concerned with not extending the exemption to related operations which didn't require of the exemption. 
    We think that the very fact that there is such a reduction in the number of employees at the close of the active season in this case, indicates that the purpose of the exemption does not apply. 
    There's other legislative history which we go into in our brief, particularly the -- the turning down of a -- an amendment which would have broadened this exemption, the so-called coffee amendment in the House, which was rejected by -- by the House for the narrower first processing language and for this -- it was specifically pointed out that the broader proposal, coffee proposal was -- was made because the first processing language might not include all operations leading to the final marketing. 
    Now, the trial court took the position that the -- that the only reasonable interpretation of the first processing of fresh seasonal perishable or seasonal fresh fruits, was the operations leading up to a final finished product for market. 
    We believe that the statute on its face, that the phrasing of the language of this statute, its context in -- in relation to other provisions of the statute, make it clear beyond doubt that the first processing as used in this section, did not -- did not intend and certainly it was not necessarily must be read as -- as going to the processing of a finished product for market. 
    Some of the other exemptions specifically so provide and a number of them use the term, “processing,” as distinguished from first processing. 
    So that the terms of the statute itself show that the first processing meant something different from processing, distributing and marketing. 
    Whether if there were any -- if the statute were less clear and the original legislative purpose were less clear, we submit that what has happened in Congress since then, has result any doubt about it. 
    Congress was, at an early date, made aware of the administrative interpretation. 
    At the time of the -- of the 1949 Amendments, various proposals were made to amend both of these exemptions and they were -- hearings were held on them and although Congress did amend many other sections, it didn't amend either one of these exemptions except for -- in amount of detail not here applicable concerning buttermilk and left those sections intact and at that time, Congress was made fully aware of just how the administrator was interpreting Section 7 (c) and how he was applying Section 7 (b) (3). 
    And we feel that apart from all of the other arguments of purpose in supporting the administrator's position in this case under both exemptions that the congressional approval at that time was sufficient to -- to resolve any possible doubt of its validity. 
    I want to call particular attention to the fact that the -- in these various industry members that appeared at that time and at the hearings and to consider when these various proposals to amend sections -- these sections were -- were before Congress, they appeared at the hearings to oppose any -- any changes in these sections. 
    And one of the representatives of the National Canners Association explicitly advanced the argument that they shouldn't be amended because the meaning of the exemptions had and I quote, “Become crystallized in administrative ruins, court decisions and industry understanding. 
    And any unnecessary changes may open -- reopen the entire problem, disturb existing understanding of administrative interpretation and policy of enforcement and possibly put back the application of existing rules at least a decade.” 
    Now, we have cited that, we haven't quoted it in our brief, but the National Frozen Food Packers Association also filed a statement at that time and they stated that they agreed and -- and approved of the statement of the National Canners Association. 
    The fact of the matter is that -- that nobody, none of the industry members wanted any changes in these provisions, because they felt it would upset the long standing administrative interpretation.

    Oh, yes. 
    He's ruled that perishable -- seasonal perishable fresh vegetables means vegetables in their raw and natural state, that when they've been frozen, they've been processed and what -- what -- is here, we're talking about the repackaging operations of the vegetables previously frozen.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    I don't understand.
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="1276.972" stopTime="1560.670">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    He has -- he has also specifically ruled that -- that a -- a process -- packaging doing operations, subsequent operations on vegetables processed by someone else at another place of business, couldn't tack his operations onto the other processes, in order to take advantage of the exemptions. 
    The -- his -- his interpretations in this respect have been -- were publicly announced in 1943. 
    They were included in his regulations under Section 7 (b) (3) and is consistently adhered to it since then and as I say in 1949, we submit that if they secured the -- the gratification of Congress. 
    On the -- we also contend that even if they weren't so clear that the administrator's interpretation is -- of the statutory language was -- were controlling, that at least as to the interpretation of that language in his own determination under the seasonal exemption of 7 (b) (3), it would be controlling under this Court's decisions. 
    Now, respondents in the amicus curiae don't take issue with that argument, but they've come up with -- with the new argument I mentioned before. 
    They -- they now assert -- now contend that the administrator had no authority under Section 7 (b) (3) to limit this seasonal determination to particular operations of an industry. 
    We think that -- that argument is clearly without merit of -- even if it is properly raised at this time. 
    The industry -- the definition of -- in first place, the -- the section -- the exemption is clearly not self-operating. 
    It depends upon a finding by the administrator that the industry is of a seasonal nature. 
    An industry is defined in the Act to mean a branch, trade, business, no -- no, trade business industry, any branch thereof and we believe that this definition is clearly flexible enough to permit the administrator to take out the seasonal parts of an industry and find that that is the branch and that that is seasonal. 
    And that is what he has done since the beginning of the operation of this Act. 
    He's done it for years. 
    Those determinations have generally been accepted. 
    They've been reported to Congress periodically. 
    In 1949 the whole list of them were reported. 
    It's shown on their face that most of them were done in terms of the operations and as a matter of fact, the particular determination in this case was upon the -- the application of the industry members. 
    No objection was made to it. 
    We went through formal hearings and it was published and objections were to be made within 15 days. 
    No industry member made any objection. 
    And they have been in effect since -- the particular determination here has been in effect since 1940. 
    The respondents rely on a dictum and a decision of the Tenth Circuit a few years ago, which we think the Tenth Circuit was led to because of some -- of confusion and misapprehension as to just what our function -- our regulation, the general regulations of the administrator play. 
    If it -- if it really meant to hold that the administrator could not validly issue such determinations limited to the operations that are seasonal, we submit that it was clearly erroneous and should be overruled and was gone into -- to that fully in our reply brief. 
    If I may, I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Martin P. Gallagher 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Members of the Court. 
    Counsel has given you a picture of these two exemptions with which we are concerned with. 
    I'd like to emphasize that they are two exemptions, they are not one exemption. 
    We have first in our interpretation the rather broad exemption under 7 (b) (3). 
    Our interpretation of that is that as a seasonal one, exemption based upon seasonality. 
    It applies to an industry or a branch of an industry which is found to be found by the administrator as seasonal in nature. 
    And if the administrator does find that an industry or branch of an industry is of a seasonal nature, it's our position that that broad exemption exempts all the related activities that are closely related to that industry or branch of an industry which is found to be seasonal. 
    The other exemption with which we are concerned is a more narrower exemption, 7 (c). 
    It is what we call a first processing exemption and it has to do and deals with directly, the particularly type of process that the employer is engaged in not generally, the type of industry that he's engaged in, but particular process. 
    Therefore, by definition, it is a narrower exemption.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1668.914" stopTime="1676.382">
    Justice William O. Douglas

speaker="martin_p_gallagher" startTime="1676.382" stopTime="1711.656">
    Mr. Martin P. Gallagher 
    Yes Your Honor as they interpret it particularly. 
    They have come on certainly a lot closer to be in a branch of an industry, if we included all the activities of first processing and if by our first processing, we would mean all those steps that are necessary from the reception of the vegetable to the final package of it, if that is first processing (Inaudible) be a branch of an industry.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1711.656" stopTime="1714.462">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Are all of those presently exempt?
speaker="martin_p_gallagher" startTime="1714.462" stopTime="2064.808">
    Mr. Martin P. Gallagher 
    Yes. 
    Under this Act, all the steps from the reception of the corn to the final packaging of the corn and retail packages, if done, even in continuous process is considered to be first processing. 
    Now, that's why we raise this question of two exemptions and that the first processing as interpreted by the Government that is just freezing corn and put it in a 64-cubic foot bins and put them in a cold storage, simply couldn't be a branch of an industry. 
    Branch of an industry, we feel, should include all the steps that are necessary to have it -- give it some economic justification, some purpose, some end result. 
    And certainly, there would be no end result or nothing accomplished simply by taking frozen corn and put it in cold storage. 
    Therefore, that -- that in our opinion is not a branch of an industry but rather it is a part of a process of a branch of an industry. 
    Now, so I should like to talk about exception 7 (c) that is the narrower one, as applied to the facts of this case. 
    That is the first processing and at this plant that we're concerned with, there are two operating companies, both of them are parties to this litigation. 
    This litigation started out by the Secretary of Labor to restrain Ore-Ida Potato Products Company and Oregon Frozen Food Company, from violating certain terms of the Act and asked for an injunctive relief. 
    Before and during the trial, it became apparent and the Government proceeded that the -- all the activities, the Ore-Ida Potato Products were clearly exempt, no question about that. 
    Now, these two companies are affiliated companies. 
    They operate side by side from a parent company. 
    Their freeze lines come down parallel, all the activities practically the same. 
    They have potatoes peeled, sliced and blanched and then either blanched in steam or oil and then frozen and packaged. 
    In the other lines we have identical situation. 
    We have the corn and the carrots coming in it's washed and peeled and diced, steam-blanched to kill the enzymes, frozen and then packaged to the extent that it can be packaged during the harvest season. 
    Now, either the correct interpretation of this operation would be that the primary purpose is to get all these corn in and freeze it in storage -- in bulk storage and then package it at leisure, if that was a correct outlet on this operation, then perhaps Government's position would be sound, but it's simply isn't that at all. 
    The primary purpose -- the primary object of this corn operation is to get this corn in and get it into consumer sized package at the very earliest date possible. 
    If it is a large year with large production, then it is impossible to get it all in consumer sized package during the harvest season. 
    In a given date run, the lines operate all the products are put in to consumer sized package as physically possible. 
    The balance of it is put in large 64-foot -- cubic foot containers in the (Inaudible) and put in the next room which is the storage room, zero storage room. 
    That corn is brought out of the storage as fast as possible and put in the consumer sized package. 
    And if there's a lull in the operation of the day, if the corn doesn't come in at night and the night crew is working, then these pallets are pulled out. 
    It's all one operation. 
    And as soon as the corn crates coming in at the end of the season, well that operation is continued. 
    These pallets are pulled out of storage, taken to the packaging line, then are packaged. 
    Now, a great deal of emphasis has been put on the reduction and force. 
    Well that's obvious and it's very natural. 
    It takes a great number of people to process this large quantity of corn. 
    And is shocking the -- cutting the kernels from cob, or fixing the cobs and all that. 
    It takes a lot of people to do that, but it doesn't take many people to run the package line. 
    There are only two or three package lines and they accommodate approximately 20 people to the line, I think the reduction is to 40, which would indicate two lines. 
    And those package machines operate directly from a freeze tunnel or from the bins. 
    That's why there is a reduction. 
    There -- I don't think there's any great significance and the reduction is simply because it takes a lot of people to process corn where it doesn't recommended people to package corn. 
    Of course, we've got to increase our package and facilities and perhaps get all that done in harvest season, but that's a practical impossibility, financially and every other way, it be practically impossible.

    Mr. Martin P. Gallagher 
    But as the season peters out of the end, where there're more of these bins pulled out and at the end of it, all these bins are pulled out continuously until it's all packaged. 
    So in answer to your question categorically, it is one operation -- that's going right straight through until it's all put in consumer sized package. 
    1954 was a disastrous year, but 1955, we've reduced it down to 1000 acres from 3500 acres or 1000 acres and it was the hope of that year at least, this testimony is taken July of 1955, which was preceding harvest season with the hope of management there to getting all done during the harvest season.

    Let's take the example of a night crew having a slack period of time. 
    The corn is not coming in from the field. 
    Perhaps it rained that day or something, so there's available time (Inaudible) learned in harvest season. 
    That a cubic foot or the bin is brought back out of full storage perhaps that evening, that night, or the next day, whenever this factory comes, the corn from that pallet is then dumped into the packaging line and it comes down the package line as graded and sized.

    It comforts me because this same situation must've arisen since the beginning of the Act.
speaker="martin_p_gallagher" startTime="3059.862" stopTime="3117.490">
    Mr. Martin P. Gallagher 
    The only explanation I have for this coming up now is within my own recollection known familiarity with it would be that first time I've known that they've said that this limitation of first processing breaks off here at -- when we put them in bins. 
    And it's -- I think it's generally an attempt of the wage and hour administration to limit these exemptions as much as possible and I think the intent of the Act is to extend these limitations. 
    I think Congress was -- just as answered in giving the farmers these exemptions and these are important to the farmers as it were protecting the industrial worker. 
    Now, on the other side, there's a --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3117.490" stopTime="3134.830">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well except that the exception -- is an exception -- exception is an exception or exemption and therefore, limitation upon general purposes of the Act. 
    They're not – they don't run in parallel columns.
speaker="martin_p_gallagher" startTime="3134.830" stopTime="3231.995">
    Mr. Martin P. Gallagher 
    They don't run in parallel columns, but we feel that Congress was very interested in those exemptions for the benefit of the farmer. 
    There're some economic considerations in this matter and that I think that are important. 
    The question of whether or not, we can pay time and a half over time for this process is -- simply gets down to the point of -- frozen food industry operates on about two point something percent profit, margin of profit and paying overtime increase the cost of that would undoubtedly wipe out any profit in the industry. 
    The frozen food industry, in this plant particularly, just cannot pay time and a half for processed labor. 
    Now, we have one or two choices and we did take one choice that is the reduction of acreage, so that we could come closer to complying with this, using the Government's interpretation, but there again, we feel that that is a detriment to the farmer. 
    Farmers like to produce this corn, it's a good crop and we have to pay time and a half, if we have to shorten our production down. 
    To meet that, that means that there's probably 2500 acres of corn is now produced in Nassau County.

    Ms. Margolin, could one make a valid distinction between the processing described by Mr. Gallagher which is a continuous, uninterrupted assembly line, if I may use that to all that analogy and situations where there is a real temporal interruption of one moment or a minute?

    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Well, the administrator has and I assume that for practical reasons, so if there's continuous process and uninterrupted, he is not going to try to break off the things that are -- are directly –

    Well I've got a question put here that so long as there is bulk – bulk of process or bulk storage, at that point, he's rather – rather perfectly good physical lines, if all of peas that have come in, all the corn is to be frozen, that's perfectly physical -- good easy physical line, what you say that –

    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Oh, I'm not sure I understand Mr. Gallagher's position there. 
    They stated in the stipulation that they intended to continue these proceeds -- no repackaging in the future. 
    And so I assume, it's going to continue to go on. 
    Well, I understood him to say is that sometimes they like to get it, they can get it packaged in consumer packages. 
    I think he made clear however that their -- their need to get it into consumer packages is not -- has not urgent by reason of any seasonal factors or perishability factors that in a preservable state when it's frozen and – and will last for months. 
    As he have said some of the -- some of the corn didn't have to be repackaged of – wasn't repackaged for that nine months.

    And it's the -- it's the need to label it, put the firm one -- to get firm orders. 
    It's they're – either their convenience or to meet the orders of their customers that they do the repackaging. 
    That is not dictated by the perishability or seasonal pressures.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3843.689" stopTime="3879.983">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm not talking about perishability, but as far as the statute goes, there's nothing in that that to me makes a difference between not going into the last state because you haven't got any order in going into it because you think it will have orders. 
    It -- it -- a process is continuing -- is the first process that every state where none of the prior stage is itself a salable commodity, what is there in the statute which says you can't wait till you have a promising market?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="3879.983" stopTime="3881.724">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    That you can't wait until you have a promising market.

    Yes.
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="3882.794" stopTime="3918.157">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    There's nothing in the statute that says that. 
    There's something in the statute that should make it pretty clear that what Congress was interested in was relieving from overtime requirements because of -- of perishability and seasonal -- natural seasonal factors. 
    That's -- that's all it was interested in. 
    I think that appears from the language perishable or seasonal fresh fruits of vegetables. 
    It appears from the language not more than 14 work weeks and by the way it says not more than notice that amicus curiae reads that as entitling them to the 14 work weeks.

    Well even so it will bear on the fact that it ceases to be, although it's the continuous things from a commercial point of view and it's approximately that it's done in two days, but it's not a processes, because it's done in two weeks or two months.

    Ms. Margolin is there any significance to the fact that the fact that itself does first processing of these things during this period of – work periods of not more than 14 work weeks in the (Inaudible) in any calendar year. 
    Is it your suggestion there that first processing might refer those in the (Inaudible) up to a year?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="3976.336" stopTime="4039.829">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Well, if there's a suggestion that you might have several seasons. 
    I think in some – in some commodities, you do. 
    They come in a different season, then you can take -- you can take it for -- for example they'll take – they'll take it for the first processing of corn at one season, for the first processing of carrots in another season. 
    I think all I suggest is that you -- is that you – you – it may have different seasons.
