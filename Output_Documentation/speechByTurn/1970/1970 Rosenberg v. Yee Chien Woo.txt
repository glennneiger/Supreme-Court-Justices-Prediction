    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    In this case, an alien who has been an overstayed temporary visitor in the United States since 1965, claims a right to remain under a statute which grants special benefits to refugees. 
    The issue concerns the construction of Section 203 (a) (7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act which affords a haven for refugees who have been -- who are fled persecution in communist countries, who are unwilling or unable to return and who are not nationals of the country or area in which their application is made. 
    Respondent unquestionably fled communist China in 1953. 
    However, like hundreds of thousands of others, his flight stopped at Hong Kong where he was granted generous residence privileges, established a home, was married and had a child and continued to live for seven years. 
    In 1959, respondent came to the United States for the first time as a temporary visitor for business. 
    He stayed a few months and returned to his home in Hong Kong.

    In 1960, the respondent again came to the United States as a business visitor and left his wife in Hong Kong to operate the family business.

    When he left Red China, communist China, did he take his wife and child with him or did he live alone?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="153.523" stopTime="214.553">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    He left alone and was married in Hong Kong, and the child was born in Hong Kong. 
    He had previously been married in communist China. 
    His wife died and he had five children whom he left there. 
    He was married a second time in Hong Kong and have an additional child in Hong Kong. 
    After his coming to the United States in 1960, the respondent continued to remain in the United States. 
    His wife and child followed him to the United States in 1965, also entering as temporary visitors. 
    The temporary stay of the entire family expired in 1965 and they continued to remain here. 
    Deportation proceedings were brought against respondent and his wife and a deportation order was entered against them with the privilege of voluntary departure.

    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    In California. 
    Immediately, the respondent filed an application for benefits under a proviso to Section 203 (a) (7) which grants refugee benefits to refugees who have lived in this country for two years. 
    That application was denied by the immigration and District Director by the Regional Commissioner on the ground that the respondent was no longer a refugee since he had established -- firmly established a residence and a home in Hong Kong. 
    He then sought judicial review. 
    The District Court ruled in his favor, finding that he had not been from the resettle in Hong Kong because of this allegation that he have never intended to remain their permanently and that he harbored an intention to come to the United States at all times. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    They found, the Ninth Circuit. 
    The Ninth Circuit found that the question of whether he was firmly resettled was irrelevant. 
    The court said that under the statute, once respondent had been a refugee, he was entitled to its benefits even though he had established a stable new home in another country. 
    This con --

    Yes.
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="310.521" stopTime="497.046">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    -- develop that. 
    That conclusion incidentally is opposed by the later decision of the Second Circuit in Shen against Esperdy which is reported in 428 F. 2d. 
    Now admittedly, Section 203 (a) (7) of the statute does not contain a specific disqualification of refugees who have been firmly resettled. 
    But I believe that the purpose to exclude them, clearly appears if we examine the history and the purpose of the statute. 
    After World War II, the United States became deeply concerned with the massive problems presented by millions of refugees’ leftover from that war and it developed temporary programs to deal with those problems. 
    These programs were reflected in a series of measures adopted from time to time. 
    The first of these, the major -- the first major statute was the Displaced Persons Act of 1948. 
    Under this statute in a three-and-a-half year period, the United States received approximately 400,000 refugees. 
    That statute did have specific language disqualifying refugees who are permanently, firmly resettled. 
    The next major statute was the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 under which, approximately 200,000 refugees were received into the United States and again, these statutes specifically excluded refugees who had been permanently resettled. 
    After that, the next statute was the Refugee Act of 1957. 
    This was a temporary statute again for a limited purpose, and the purpose was to assign approximately 18,000 visas that had been unused when the Refugee Relief Act had expired at the end of 1956. 
    The 1957 law said that these visas should be assigned to a group known as refuge escapees and in designating that group, it did not mention firm resettlement. 
    The next of these temporary statutes was the so called Fair Share Act of 1960. 
    Now, this again was a temporary measure. 
    It was designed to enable the United States to participate in a worldwide movement to enable the United Nations to close the remaining refugee camps. 
    And under the terms of this statute, the United States undertook to receive what it considered its fair share of these refugees in the camps; 25%. 
    Now again, this statute said nothing about refugees who had been firmly resettled.

speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="505.295" stopTime="514.979">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    No. 
    That’s completely independent and came later. 
    The camps remained -- it’s as strange as it may seem for all the years between World War II and 1960.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="514.979" stopTime="517.583">

    15 years after 1945.
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="517.583" stopTime="539.050">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    And the problem had not yet been liquidated. 
    In 1960 – 1959, the United Nations undertook a concerted drive to close these camps and the United States cooperated with that movement in so called world refugee year and adopted the 1960 law as part of that movement.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="539.050" stopTime="545.123">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    These were not -- this law was not concerned with the refugee camps in the Middle East?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="545.123" stopTime="600.394">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    No, specifically not because the United Nations mandate to which it was tied did not apply to the Middle East. 
    Again as I said, this law, the 1960 law did mention firm resettlement, and it did add language which excluded or which decreed that it would not apply to those who were nationals of the country in which their application was made. 
    Now from these developments, the Ninth Circuit took the position, came to the conclusion that because of this chain of events and the changes in the language of the statute, Congress had intended to make a change. 
    In the language of the court, this was a clear manifestation of congressional intent to change the criteria.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="600.394" stopTime="603.483">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What was the specific language that they arrived at?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="603.483" stopTime="726.494">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Two things; one is in the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 and in it predecessor, the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, there was specific language barring refugees who had been from the resettlement. 
    Second, in the 1960 Fair Share Law, there was new language saying that its benefits would not apply to those who are nationals of the country in which the application was made. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that this addition of the language “not a national” was intended to be a substitution for the criterion of those firmly resettled. 
    Now, no legislative history is cited by the Court of Appeals to support this conclusion, and I would suppose that if Congress had intended such a marked departure from the previously established procedures, criteria, it would have expressed its purpose in some clear manner. 
    Yet, nowhere in the legislative history is there any indication that a change was contemplated. 
    Moreover, the Second Circuit in a very careful and a very long and detailed opinion, studied the legislative history in much more detail and let’s say than the Ninth Circuit, they came to the conclusion that no change had been intended. 
    I think the 1957 law furnishes the key. 
    The 1957 law was the first law which changed the language, which eliminated the firmly resettlement. 
    But in the House report, reporting this legislation, and you recall Your Honors, this legislation was intended to take care of a group leftover from the previous law, the House Committee said they intended that in applying this law, the same criteria should be utilized. 
    So, it seems obvious that no change was intended.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The Second Circuit pulled on the basis that the man had to actually be homeless?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="731.905" stopTime="733.036">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Exactly.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="733.036" stopTime="735.174">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And he wasn’t homeless he can --
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="735.174" stopTime="738.798">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    That’s exactly what I believe the statute was intended to deal with.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="738.798" stopTime="740.710">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Not with the Second Circuit --
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="740.710" stopTime="966.292">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    And of course, we agree with the Second Circuit, but I think that as I develop my argument, I think that the history of this legislation indicates quite decisively that these statutes are intended to deal with homeless people, to provide the haven for a homeless into this place. 
    Now, I believe the “not a national language” which was inserted for the first time in 1960 had an entirely different purpose from that envisaged by the Ninth Circuit. 
    The court, unlike the Second Circuit which is I say considered this with great care, the court below overlooked the fact that the 1960 Act was tied to the mandate of the United Nations, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
    The mandate of the High Commissioner, which is incorporated in a U.N. statute specifically declares, among other things, that his mandate shall not extend to refugees situated in the country of their nationality. 
    So in adopting the criteria of the United Nations Congress followed that formulation. 
    Now when that formulation was carried over into the 1965 Act, which succeeded these laws, I believe Congress had in mind the change in world conditions that had occurred by that time, in 1965. 
    In the original refugee laws, Congress confronted a world, Europe particularly that was shattered by war. 
    The countries of Europe, even the countries which were receiving their own nationals were unable to care for such nationals and therefore, the United States pitched in and helped. 
    And in the earlier refugee laws, there was specific provision for the reception of Greek, Dutch, German and other ethnic refugees who were situated in the country of their nationality, Italian I believe is the other one. 
    Now, by the time the 1965 law was being considered, the situations as I said had changed. 
    Congress I believe concluded that these nations were now able to care for their own refugees and therefore, it inserted this proviso that it would not extend to refugees who were in their own countries, the countries of their nationality. 
    Now particularly, I call Your Honors' attention to the situation of West Germany, which may have been in the mind of Congress, which previously had been the beneficiary of all the refugee laws which had been previously enacted. 
    By the application of the “not a national” proviso, Congress apparently were saying that since Germany had now fully recovered, the ethnic German refugees who are coming into Germany could be cared for by their own country, and it was no longer necessary for the United States to pitch in and help. 
    I think, this is the basis for the adoption by Congress of the “not a national” proviso and it seems to me completely without warrant to assume that Congress intended to utilize this special statutory provision for the aid of refugees who didn’t need immediate help, who were not homeless, who were not displaced. 
    Our briefs recite the consistent administrative interpretation which has found that benefit under these refugees statutes are not available to refugees who have become settled and stabled new homes.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="966.292" stopTime="972.776">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Gordon on the respondent’s theory, does refugee status once acquired continue forever?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="972.776" stopTime="975.694">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    This is the way I would construe it.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="975.694" stopTime="986.248">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Incidentally, now that I’ve interrupted you, is there any distinction in immigration law terminology between the term national and the term citizenship?
speaker="charles_gordon" startTime="986.248" stopTime="1185.645">
    Mr. Charles Gordon 
    Yes. 
    It’s a slight difference in the present practice. 
    National is a person owning permanent allegiance, includes citizens, it’s a broader term than citizens. 
    As used in our context today, I think it’s synonymous with citizens. 
    Now as I’ve said, the administrative interpretation is consistently upheld the view on arguing here today. 
    For example, when the 1957 Act was adopted, the state department immediately promulgated regulations which announced the firmly resettled concept even though the law hadn’t said anything about it. 
    In addition, a series of reported administrative decisions have expressed that concept. 
    And finally, that concept has been reflected in reports which are made by the immigration service to Congress every six months showing the operations under Section 203 (a) (7) as required by Section 203 (f) of the statute. 
    Now Congress has never questioned that interpretation and indeed, no court other than that court below has ever reached a contrary conclusion. 
    Now, respondent seeks to find support for his interpretation in a statement made by Senator Kennedy during the course of the debate on the 1965 law in which Senator Kennedy said that Section 203 (a) (7) refugees and I quote "must be currently settled in countries other than their homelands." 
    This statement was a small part in an explanation by Senator Kennedy of the many provisions of the 1965 law which primarily was adopted to abolish the national origin's coding system. 
    I think Senator Kennedy was not addressing the concept, he didn’t say he was and it doesn’t appear that he was addressing the concept of firm resettlement. 
    In context and reading the statement in entirety, I think Senator Kennedy was speaking of providing homes for the homeless, for the displaced. 
    And in our reply brief at page 6, we set forth some additional excerpts from Senator Kennedy’s statements. 
    For example, Senator Kennedy spoke of the need for this country to remain and I quote “a haven for the displaced.” 
    And that again and I quote “the cases of the greatest need can be processed at once.” 
    Later in the floor debate, Senator Kennedy commented that the Bill, again I quote “establishes what we mean by refugees, those fleeing from communist dominations and from the other categories mentioned in the statute.” 
    I believe Senator Kennedy’s reference to those fleeing is an accurate paraphrase of the statutory requirement that speaks of those who have fled persecutions.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I think that’s the most important point I can make. 
    The point is that this is a small allotment intended to deal with emergencies and throughout the legislative history, the sponsors of this measure and the committees emphasized the need to keep this reserve authority in the hands of the President and the Attorney General so that they could deal with emergencies as they can arise -- as they do arise.

    It seems to me that there wouldn’t be, unless he can establish that he is a refugee, and he hasn't a claim that he has any right or any eligibility for any discretionary benefit. 
    Now as I said, this is a small allocation and the fact that the certainty that it was intended for emergencies is underlined by the fact that the statute says that these persons shall be granted conditional entry.

    Either they won’t take them or they don’t have stable residence there. 
    They let them stay there for short time. 
    They’ll permit them to remain, for example, the Czechoslovak situation, many Czechoslovakian refugees crossed the border and came into adjacent countries. 
    They did not have residence privileges. 
    Under the emergency authority, which is granted in this statute, the President, the Attorney General can admit them immediately to this country as conditional entrance. 
    Now in addition, the fact that this is a design for emergency action, for keeping open the opportunity to deal with emergencies is underlined by the statement in the House Committee report on the 1965 law that this statute and I quote from the committee’s report “will permit the President to act immediately if the situation so request to come to the aid of refugees as defined in the Bill.” 
    I believe the acceptance of respondent’s interpretation would defeat the statutory purpose. 
    Approximately two million refugees have -- from China have settled in Hong Kong.

    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Respondent’s position is that Congress knowingly and intelligently used the term “national” in excluding would be refugees under this Section 203 (a) (7). 
    And we say where an applicant qualifies under the literal terms of the statute, unless he’s become a national of intermediate country, he is eligible for consideration under the law. 
    So when respondent Harry Woo fled from Red China and he went to Hong Kong and he open up his one desk business of getting orders in the United States for clothing and he was able to live in an apartment of one room, with his $3.00 Hong Kong money when he arrived in Hong Kong, and was able to make a sufficient business so that he was able to get a trip to United States as a business visitor, and he was given by the British Government a certificate of identity and that’s all. 
    He had not become a British national. 
    He is eligible under the act.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1985.246" stopTime="2002.196">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, isn’t the status of -- as Justice Douglas suggested that most of the people in Hong Kong precisely that that is they are on the certificate of identity which has the much the same function as a passport I take it.
speaker="gordon_g_dale" startTime="2002.196" stopTime="2053.056">
    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    That is basically true Mr. Chief Justice, except that a certificate of identity gives one no assurance of its continuance. 
    It is a certificate of identity. 
    It has to be renewed periodically. 
    As a matter of fact, respondent’s certificate of identity expired in 1967. 
    At the request of the petitioner, the immigration service, he was directed to apply for renewal of the certificate of identity. 
    He did so and was informed by the Hong Kong authorities; he must apply in Los Angeles at the office of the British Government there, the British consulate. 
    Now, the British consulate said we’re not interested. 
    Your application has to be made in Hong Kong. 
    So at the present time, Harry Woo has a three-year, four-year-old expired certificate of identity.

    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    He was legally in the United States until 1966, I believe on a series of extensions granted by the immigration service. 
    Now, his original visit in 1960 --

    He lived in here and perhaps a better way to put, he was here at sufferance very definitely?

    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    He is -- I would say at sufferance since 1966, but he had a lawful extension of his business visitor’s visa each year from 1960 to 1965. 
    We contend that Congress used this term national because national is a well recognize term in international law. 
    We used that term in our Nationality Act of 1940. 
    We’ve used that again in our Act of 1952, the basic immigration act under which we now operate. 
    Certain rights and obligations go with nationality, among them of course the most important, military service to the country of which you’re a nation, and in turn, the nation provides the national with some protection abroad. 
    For example, could Harry Woo, the respondent expect some kind of protection for the British Government to the United States? 
    Not at all. 
    They are not interested in him. 
    Do we provide protection for people who have permanent residence in United States if they’re visiting abroad, not at all.

speaker="gordon_g_dale" startTime="2189.409" stopTime="2294.180">
    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    In the Second Circuit, the court stated that in referring to the Fair Share Law for example, the Fair Share Law of 1960, the basic Refugee Act at that time. 
    And they claim that this statute provided the necessary understanding for the 1965 statute, and quoted the language under the United Nations High Commissioner for mandate and the court use the language, this particular statute which used the term “not a national” only applies -- applies only to those refugees who do not have the right and obligations of nationals in the country in which they reside. 
    And the court immediately picked this up and said “it might seem to prove the Ninth Circuit’s position” and I claim exactly, it does indeed. 
    But then the court makes a leap back into legislative history. 
    We claim that legislative history has no part in this case where the language is absolutely clear. 
    The petitioner would have us completely topsy-turvy apply the statutory construction rule. 
    The statute is plain. 
    But if you delve into the con -- the legislative history is sufficiently and not only of this act, but the 1948 Act, the 1953 Act, the 1957 Act, the 1960 act, the 1962 Act, I assure you, you can find sufficient confusion that now you can ignore the plain meaning of the statute. 
    Now, you’re in the position to look and decide what would be a good standard to apply, and that’s exactly what the petitioner has done under the statute.

    I would suppose only that because the term national was used in the 1952 Basic Immigration Nationality Act to determine -- to describe a national as one who owes permanent allegiance, and it was used again in the 1940 Nationality Act.

    I think under our law, there are a couple of island areas where the natives are nationals.

    They’re not nationals of the crown colony and they are not citizens. 
    They have a certificate of identity that identifies them as residing in Hong Kong which can be lifted. 
    So there’s no law that says that there’s anything that guarantees them, anything like for example, permanent residence in the United States. 
    If you have a permanent residence certificate here, so long as you do not become subject to deportable offense, you can remain here permanently and the law says you can. 
    There’s nothing that assured for a person who lives in Hong Kong with a certificate of identity.

    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    Of course in the first place, I do not subscribe to the Government’s contention that this is primarily a hardship statute. 
    There’s another section of the immigration law that allows parole in the United States under Section 212, parole in the United States where there’s a really emergency. 
    You can be assured that under this program of admission to the United States, under 207, there’s a long careful screening of each applicant who seeks to come in under this statute and nobody is just going to come drifting in under 203 (a) (7). 
    If there’s a real emergency, Section 212 I believe would be used which allows the Attorney General to certainly parole people in the United States.

    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    He had not at the time that he’d left, no. 
    I would like to refer to another point that we have made that the 1951 convention on the status refugees, the signatories agree that they will not expel of compel refugees who come into their territory to go back to the country from whence their life or freedom might be threatened. 
    But when the United Kingdom exceeded to the treaty, it had the option to include all the territories whose foreign affairs that was responsible, but the United Kingdom chose to exclude Hong Kong from this agreement. 
    They did the same thing with the 1968 protocol, doubtlessly had good reasons. 
    Like China not impose certain conditions under retention of the crown colony and say we want some of those nationals returned. 
    But the United Kingdom didn’t want that treaty restricting their freedom and they wouldn’t agree that Hong Kong was included. 
    Does that sound like a certificate of identity holder like the respondent? 
    Could be assure that he had a nice safe haven in Hong Kong? 
    We claim no. 
    We claim that this refugee true had a place to stay, but it was a very tenuous location indeed, and Congress contemplated that this was a hazardous situation and said when you’re a national, then, you’re disqualified.

    Mr. Dale, I take that the Government’s direction to this man to apply for renewal of his certificate of identity in Hong Kong through Hong Kong was a not a gesture or a futile exercise for the purpose of seeing whether he could be reinstated there. 
    And if he could, if he now could be reinstated in his former position in Hong Kong, would you still claim his -- within the reach of a hardship statute?

    Mr. Dale, a little while ago, I think you were about to say something about quotas. 
    If the quotas are over subscribed and he is here, then presumably, there are a lot of other eligible people who can’t get in.

    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    Yes Mr. Justice Blackmun. 
    I want to quote from the 1969 visa office report on the numbers who have applied and been accepted under the statute. 
    According to that report, in 1966, 3,991 were admitted out of allowed quota of 10,200. 
    In 1967, 4,337; 1968, 6,325; 1969, 9,850; so that in none of the four years reported has the entire quota have been used and I think it’s interesting that and one of the immigration reports referred to by Mr. Gordon, there is a record of denials of applicants who sought to come in and they denied them on the basis that they were firmly resettled. 
    And the total number of denials for the whole year 1967 was 82. 
    So, I think it’s unrealistic to imagine that we are going to be an inundated with refugees either applying abroad or applying here under the statute. 
    The facts just aren’t that way.

    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    Yes, it does.

    I don’t even know anybody there.

    And the court decision was in 1968 I believe in the Court of Appeals decision in our favor was 1969.

    Of course you would agree that by the two circuits disagree; this is a pretty close case?

    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    Oh, I just think the Second Circuit is wrong Your Honor.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What?
speaker="gordon_g_dale" startTime="3444.049" stopTime="3525.722">
    Mr. Gordon G. Dale 
    I just think the Second Circuit is wrong Your Honor. 
    [Attempt to Laughter] I would like to refer to the decision of the Supreme Court in Schwegmann Brothers versus Calvert Distillers Corporation where the writer of the opinion said it’s a business of Congress to sum up its own debates and its legislation. 
    Moreover, it’s only the words of the bill that have presidential approval where that approval has been given. 
    It’s not to be supposed that in signing a Bill, the President endorses the whole congressional record. 
    And incidentally, this record appearing covers some 1,500 pages on that are referred to by the petitioner. 
    For us to undertake to reconstruct an enactment from legislative history is merely to involved the Court in political controversies which are quite proper in the enactment of the Bill which you have no place in its interpretation. 
    And ending by and large, I think our function was well stated by Mr. Justice Holmes. 
    We do not inquire what the legislature meant. 
    We ask only what the statute means. 
    We believe that on the basis of the statute, our client, the respondent qualified under the statute should be considered and should therefore be eligible for such a visa, and we ask that the decision of the Court of Appeals, for the Ninth Circuit be affirmed.

    Could I ask you a question? 
    You argue of this case I suppose in the Ninth Circuit, did you?

    Ninth Circuit, I did.

    No, I did not.
