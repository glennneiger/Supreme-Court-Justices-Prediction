United States v. Mitchell

    Mr. Bray.

    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    These combined income taxes cases are here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit. 
    They involved the Louisiana community property system. 
    In each case, a husband and wife living in Louisiana realized community income of which each own one-half under the Louisiana law. 
    No federal income tax returns were filed by either spouse, either separately or jointly. 
    The marriages were subsequently dissolved and the Government separately assessed each wife for the income taxes on her share of the realized but unreported community income. 
    The cases present a single question whether where no returns have been filed a Louisiana wife must report and pay the federal income taxes on the one-half share of community income which under the laws of that state she owns. 
    In each of these cases, the Fifth Circuit held that she need not do so where she neither expressly accepts liability for those taxes nor receives any benefits from the community property upon the dissolution of the community. 
    We believe that in doing so, that court failed to perceive an important distinction. 
    One which we feel underlies the decision in this case, that is the distinction between imposition of the tax on one hand and collection of the tax from the individual owing it on the other.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Mr. Bray, could you tell me one detail, is the income of the community on which the deficiency was determined due to the wife’s earnings or income from her property at all?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="122.529" stopTime="152.264">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    In the Mitchell case, it was partially due to her earnings. 
    In the Angello case, the record indicates that all of the community income was due to the husband’s earnings. 
    In neither case, was any significant amount of income due to the wife’s individual separate efforts. 
    This however, we do not believe determines the case since regardless of who generates the income, under the Louisiana law, each spouse owns an undivided one-half interest of it from the very moment it comes into being.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="152.264" stopTime="157.322">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    This has to be your position necessarily. 
    It’s rather reminiscent to the old embezzlement cases, isn’t it?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="157.322" stopTime="270.820">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Yes, sir and even before that, the split income cases in the 1930 term of this Court. 
    To that, we think those cases decide this case and compel the result for which we here content. 
    Our position is that this case involves only the imposition of the tax and that because the wife owns her share of community income, she is tax on it. 
    While we recognize that our position may result in hardships in certain instances to why as residing in community property states. 
    Yet, we think the law is clear and compels the position that we take. 
    At least as the statutory law presently exist. 
    In some, we argue that it is now and for many years prior to this well established that the federal statutes imposed the tax against the owner of the income. 
    That under Louisiana law, the wife owns outright her one-half interest in community income as of the very moment that it comes into existence. 
    And that it follows that she must report and pay taxes on her half. 
    On the other hand, as regards to the collection of these taxes, we think there is no real dispute on our position here. 
    The state laws exempting the Louisiana wife from community obligations and we would here acknowledge that taxes -- federal income taxes, all community income are indeed a community obligation. 
    But these state laws exonerating the wife from the community obligation simply are ineffective as against the United States in its efforts to collect the tax from the individual owing it. 
    The dispute here really is whether the wife’s ownership of her community income -- her share of community income is sufficient under the federal statutes for that statute to impose the tax against her and compel her to return it and pay tax on it.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="270.820" stopTime="276.013">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Mr. Bray, is that renunciation Louisiana provision common to all community properties?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="276.013" stopTime="325.810">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    It is not, it was common in the Spanish law. 
    It arose under the Spanish law, but as far as we can tell, Louisiana is the only state which has carried this over from the Spanish law. 
    I might point out in that regard that even under the Spanish law, it was very clear that during the existence of the marriage the wife owned that right her half of community income. 
    The renunciation provision was merely one designed to protect her from community creditors. 
    Again, community creditor or rather a creditor right type of proposition which gave her the right upon determination of the marriage to forego her otherwise vested interest in the community income and for that matter, all community property, and similarly to be relieve of any obligations all community debts.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="325.810" stopTime="329.104">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    By termination of the marriage, this would include death of the spouse?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="329.104" stopTime="334.958">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    That’s correct, in fact in these cases, one dissolution occurred because of death.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="334.958" stopTime="338.310">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Does it apply in the reverse? 
    Does a husband have the same right?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="338.310" stopTime="373.603">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    No, the husband does not and this is because again originating from the Spanish law. 
    The husband has the management generally speaking of the community property. 
    It was therefore thought that because he manages the property, he ought to be responsible for the community debts regardless. 
    And indeed, historically, not only was he responsible in the sense that the community property was responsible for the debts, but he personally was responsible for those community debts. 
    In other words, if the community was not sufficient to take care of the community debts, he had to come out of his own separate property to pay those debts.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    It is also for that same theory that there’s no way the rank could compel the “master” to pay?

    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Yes, that is part of a theory, but I would point out that there are protections for the wife while she can’t perhaps compel the husband to pay the taxes as such. 
    Yet, she does have protections under state law which are very clearly spelled out not only in the state law cases, but for that manner in the two cases in which this Court has dealt with Louisiana community property. 
    Bender versus Pfaff, the split income case and Fernandez versus Wiener, the state -- I beg your pardon, the federal state tax case and in both instances it was noted that while the husband had management rights over her half of community property nevertheless, that she had some rather special provisions of state law which protected her interest in that property, including the right to separate her property from her husband’s without terminating the marriage and from that point forward to have complete control over her property.

    Justice Byron R. White

    Where did she get the information to file a return?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="493.064" stopTime="507.622">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Under a state law, there is the possibility that she could compel her husband to give her this information. 
    Frankly, I know of no case under Louisiana law for that matter under any other community property state law which would give her this right. 
    But on the other hand, --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="507.622" stopTime="525.231">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But how could she ever protect herself from penalty, she can file a return and say, “I don’t -- my husband refuses to tell me what the community income is, but I have income on my own. 
    I can tell what my contribution is. 
    Other than this, I’m awfully sorry.” 
    Would that be a compliant?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="525.231" stopTime="550.074">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    No, it would not be a complete compliance. 
    Now, with regards to your specific question, certainly, she could I think protect herself from penalties in that situation. 
    By filing a separate return and reporting all that she knew about, she would not be subject to any penalties. 
    On the other hand, I think it follows from the existing state of a law that she would still be liable for the tax in statutory interest on the --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Even though it was practically impossible for her to comply?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="553.025" stopTime="588.187">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Even though it was practically impossible, yes sir. 
    Now, again, this special situation if indeed it is a problem and we would recognize that it is can be handled in one of two fashions. 
    One would be amending the present Internal Revenue Code. 
    This of course has been done quite recently in a situation whereas joint returns have been found. 
    In that situation, the recent amendments that came into being in January of this year lets the wife or relieves the wife of liability if she in fact is completely innocent and has done everything she can to comply with the requirements of law.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="588.187" stopTime="590.176">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But fraud liability relieves her from.
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="590.176" stopTime="592.250">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Well, not only fraud but also from the tax liability.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="592.250" stopTime="592.723">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Does it?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="592.723" stopTime="649.624">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Yes, sir it does. 
    But, let me emphasize this, that statute presently applies only where a joint return has been found and thus both spouses are jointly and severally liable for the entire tax. 
    Now, this highlights the problem we’re faced with here under existing law as we interpreted, the husband is not liable for the taxes on the wife’s share of community income. 
    Thus, only the wife, thus we may presently only go after the wife. 
    If indeed, similar legislation is presented to relieve an innocent spouse in a community property state from liability on his or her one-half share of community income of which he or she knows nothing, then we would hope that Congress would impose liability on the guilty spouse with respect to those taxes. 
    Otherwise, half the income will escape taxation under the present state of the law. 
    Now, --

    Mr. Bray, isn’t the --

    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="653.242" stopTime="669.674">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I’m going back to Justice White’s question. 
    Isn’t the same kind of dilemma presented to the -- to a member of a husband-wife team in a non- community property state if there’s an advantage in filing a joint return and she can’t find out what income he has?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="669.674" stopTime="670.460">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Absolutely, --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="670.460" stopTime="676.571">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of course, it isn’t the same because she could file a separate return and avoid penalties directly?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="676.571" stopTime="745.333">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    That’s right and let me say that in that regard, while the present legislation has relieved the wife of liability in certain very limited circumstances, there are two important features of that. 
    First of all, the legislation we feel was absolutely necessary notwithstanding some cases to the contrary to bring about the change in the law, that is relieving the wife of liability. 
    Secondly, I would point out that again historically under Spanish law, the wife has not been deemed the one-half owner of fraudulently obtained funds. 
    So that the situation against or to which the amending statute is specifically directed. 
    That is where the husband has fraudulently obtained funds and the wife knows nothing about this would not under the historical approach of the community property law be a problem in community property states because the wife doesn’t own any part of that fraudulently obtained income. 
    But to answer your question as directly as I can, yes the situation would be identical in the common law states.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="745.333" stopTime="769.861">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In a common law state where a joint return is made and let’s say there’s an understatement of the income that’s negligent, non-fraudulent, non-criminal so that the -- there’s more taxes owing and that’s discovered. 
    Now, does each spouse -- can each spouse be held liable for the entire common state?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="769.861" stopTime="771.218">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    No, in the community property state?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="771.218" stopTime="772.575">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, no, in the common state.
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="772.575" stopTime="775.358">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    If a joint return has been filed in some, yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="775.358" stopTime="775.725">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="775.725" stopTime="778.758">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Until the amendments of the statute in January of this year.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="778.758" stopTime="780.404">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Each spouse can be held liable for the tax.
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="780.404" stopTime="786.952">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    That’s right. 
    They were jointly and severally liable for all taxes both those reported and those found to be due upon subsequent audit.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="786.952" stopTime="794.626">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And unlike, as I understand it, you told us that in a community property state, the spouse is only liable for half the taxes?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="794.626" stopTime="917.188">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Absolutely. 
    Now, I think again, this serves to highlight the problem here. 
    The problem is not one of our making but rather one of the community property laws. 
    Historically, the community property laws have provided community property husbands and wives with some rather significant advantages. 
    Before of the day of the joint return and I might add that the joint return came into being essentially because of these advantages. 
    Before the day of the joint return, the spouses could split their income, report it separately and thus avoid or at least lessen the impact of the graduating income tax. 
    When this Court held in the 1930 term upheld the right of the spouses to do this in the series of cases are found in Poe versus Seaborn, the advantages were very clear cut and the Court established at that time that taxation follows ownership in so far as the individual taxpayers concern. 
    We think that that compels the position which we take here that the wife owns her share and she must pay taxes on it. 
    And I might add that since 1930, that has been a whole basis of the taxation of individuals in the Federal Income Tax Code. 
    That is its tax the income to its individuals and this has been repeatedly recognized and the Congress has acted on this understanding of the law. 
    Indeed, the recent amendments serve to emphasize this once more, in those amendments or rather in the legislative history of it. 
    The congressional reports indicate that except for the amendment, Congress recognized that in the community property state, the wife would be deemed the owner of one-half of all community income and would have to report and pay tax on it. 
    And because of that, the Congress inserted in this amendment amending statute a provision relieving the wife of liability in the joint return situation or where she otherwise would have that liability not just because she signed the joint return but because she own the income.

    Ownership has the right to dispose.

    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Well that -- this Court again in Poe versus Seaborn distinguished between management on the one hand which we acknowledged that the husband have.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Bear ownership on them?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="1019.302" stopTime="1528.540">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    And bear ownership on the other and I might add that in a subsequent dissent, Mr. Justice Douglas pointed out that this was the technical distinction made and that now, ownership determines who is liable for the taxes. 
    As I’ve indicated both state and federal law is important for the question before this Court. 
    The state law creates the legal interest involved while the federal statute taxes those interests. 
    In our view, it is clear that the federal statute taxes income to the individual who owns it. 
    This was decided in the 1930 series of cases and has been bedrock with respect to subsequent revenue legislation. 
    We don’t see anyway around this at this point in time. 
    Now, with respect with to the state law, we think it’s equally clear that the wife owns her undivided one-half share of the community income and we don’t think there’s any real dispute either with respect to the respondents or for that matter with respect to the Fifth Circuit on this particular topic. 
    Indeed, the Fifth Circuit said in its opinion that under the Louisiana law, the wife has a present vested ownership interest in one-half for the community property including its income. 
    The Court could only say this following not only the decisions -- the many decisions of the Louisiana Supreme Court so stating but also the decisions of this Court in Bender versus Pfaff and in Fernandez versus Weiner so holding. 
    But the Court went on to say, it rejected what we say must follow that is that the wife must report and pay taxes on her half by saying that under Louisiana law, the wife’s interest in the community is of such a character that she is not personally liable out of her separate property for the tax of her share. 
    We think in this regard, the Court confused collection of the tax which state law does provide protections that would ordinarily protect the wife from community creditors. 
    And imposition of the tax, which we think is truly the issue here involved. 
    The Fifth Circuit rested its decision -- its decision that the wife’s ownership interest was qualified sufficiently that she could not be held responsible for the taxes on her share essentially on two grounds. 
    First, on the ground that the husband had very broad management rights over the wife’s community property not only over his but also over the wife’s. 
    And secondly, that the wife’s property was -- I beg your pardon, that the wife’s separate property was generally protected from community creditors. 
    However, under the state law, again as that law has been recognized in this Court. 
    These two features of state law simply are ineffective in so far as protecting the wife from the taxation that is listed upon her because she owns the income. 
    They do not -- these features do not owe to the fact that she owned that right her share of the income. 
    And we think that she must report and pay her share -- I beg your pardon, the tax on her share of the income based on this Court’s decisions in the 1930 split income tax cases. 
    Admittedly, these cases did not bring before the Court the question of whether the wife is required to report it, but rather only whether she was entitled to do so. 
    But we think a case decided along with these cases in that same session of the court made clear that not only may she do so but she must to do so where the spouses have not otherwise reported their income on a joint return. 
    This is the decision in United States versus Malcolm. 
    Malcolm was decided some five years after an earlier Supreme Court decision in United State versus Robbins. 
    In Robbins, this Court had decided that in California at any rate, the husband must report and pay taxes on all of the community income. 
    In Robbins, the court based its decision on two grounds. 
    Primarily, on the holdings of the Supreme Court of California that the wife’s interest in community property during the existence of the community was merely an expectancy, she had no present vested interest in the community income. 
    Alternatively, the Court bounded its decision on the fact that the husband had such broad management powers that this would entitle Congress to tax all of the income to him. 
    In recognition of this decision, California subsequently amended its laws and stated unequivocally that the wife’s interest in the community during the existence of the community was a present existing interest equal to that of the husband. 
    Following this amendment and the statutes were not amended significantly with respect to the husband’s management powers, he still manage his wife’s share of the community. 
    But following the amendment with respect to the vested interest versus expectancy interest, Malcolm versus United States came before this Court and in a per curiam opinion based upon the Court’s split income decisions in Poe versus Seaborn and the other cases. 
    The Court held that under the federal statutes, the husband need no longer, the California husband need no longer report and pay taxes on all of the community income in California. 
    They further held that the wife’s interest under state law were such but she should and I use the word “should” because that was the question posed to the Court that she should report and pay the taxes on her share. 
    We think that this makes clear the position that we’re here taking and indeed every court up until the Fifth Circuit’s decision is here who has considered this question has so held. 
    Now, in doing so, we would suggest the court abandoned the management ground on which Robbins had alternatively based the decision to tax the husband on all of the community income. 
    The court instead opted in favor of ownership -- bear legal ownership and made clear that management is not the touchstone under the Code rather ownership is the key and whoever is the owner must pay the taxes. 
    I might point out that this is not unlike the situation in several other areas of the tax law. 
    Specifically, the partnership area, the wife’s interest has been compared by the Louisiana Courts to that of a limited partner and a limited partnership just as unlimited partner must pay taxes on his share of partnership income so the wife must. 
    And this, mind you whether or not the partner is around at the time the partnership returned and the individual returns should be filed and whether or not the partner has ever made distributions of the partnership income. 
    Thus, if the partner absconds with all of the partnership funds this does not relieve the limited partner in any respect from his obligation to pay federal income taxes on his share of the partnership income. 
    Similarly, in the situation where a grantor creates a trust and because he is also the beneficiary of the trust, he is taxed on its income. 
    If the trustee absconds with all of the trusts income, the grantor beneficiary would not be relieved of his obligation to pay taxes on the trust income. 
    Thus, we can see no reason to suggest that taxing the wife on the share of her income is unconstitutional as a violation of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments. 
    There is just no basis for this as far as we can tell. 
    We have been able to find no cases suggesting that this would be such an unfair and invidious tax system of taxation as to render it unconstitutional and we note that while our opponents suggested that it would be unconstitutional. 
    They do not either cite any authority for this proposition.

    Alright, not under that provision but prenuptially the parties may determine not to be bound by the community property laws under Article 2399, which provides that absent on agreement, the marriage super induces a partnership of right between the spouses “unless, they otherwise agree.” 
    And it’s clear I think under Louisiana law that they can otherwise agree, but to enunciate the Article 2410, if I’m not mistaken does not go specifically to prenuptial arrangements rather only to dissolution.

speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="1591.867" stopTime="1716.183">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    No, we don’t but I might add that the Fifth Circuit didn’t base its decision on renunciation per se. 
    The Angello case makes this quite clear as thus the subsequent Ramos case, which comes out of Texas. 
    In Angello, there was no form of renunciation. 
    There, the husband died and the wife merely -- there’s no evidence that she got anything from the community that previously existed between the spouses. 
    She did not formally renounce her interest in the community under Article 2410. 
    Ramos as I say, comes out of Texas and there, there is no renunciation. 
    However, in both Angello and Ramos, the Fifth Circuit based on its Mitchell holding found that because the spouse -- the wife had not received any benefits from the community and had not expressly agreed to be bound by her share, on her share of the taxes. 
    She could not be made the pay that share of the taxes. 
    If the Court accepts what we think is the clear law, one that the wife is the owner of the tax and two, that as the owner, she must report and pay the taxes on it. 
    I beg your pardon, one, that the wife is the owner of her share of the income and two, as the owner, she must report and pay the taxes on it. 
    Then, we think it follows that the Government is entitled to collect those taxes from any property she has. 
    Including after acquired separate property such as, is in involved in these cases. 
    I don’t understand the respondents to seriously object to our propositions in this regard which we have set out fully in our brief. 
    Rather, their objection just as the Fifth Circuit’s opinion is to whether or not the wife’s ownership is sufficient to impose the tax against her in the first instance. 
    If indeed, she -- the tax is imposed against her and she owns it then it’s clear that the federal collection statutes prevail over state exemption laws and entitle us to collect the tax for many property that she owns except there’s --

    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Unfortunately, Mr. Justice Blackmun, we can’t claim the equities in this case and we recognize that only too well, but we come here because we think the law is clear and has been for some 40 years now. 
    Ever since, the split income cases and that law is that in the individual tax herein -- the individual who owns the income must report and pay the taxes on it. 
    Further, if we have a means of going at to the husband, this might not be quite so much of concern to us, but under the existing state of the law, as I’ve explained, we can’t go after the husband. 
    Again, we think the Malcolm case and the cases that have come along since it make that very clear.

    Is it very like you that you never get a case in this area that was not a hardship case?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="1771.289" stopTime="1874.817">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Not on this subject, I don’t believe we would, but I might point out that of course the wife as I mentioned earlier realizes some rather significant benefits under the community property laws which she doesn’t have in the common law states. 
    Those benefits were before the Court in the split income cases and this is merely the other side of the coin from state law. 
    Now, of course the state can change its law just as Congress could amend the revenue statutes with respect to these specific hardship areas. 
    Indeed, my understanding of California law is that there, if the husband abandons the wife, the income which she subsequently owns which is the Ramos case is his separate income and the wife has no interest -- no ownership interest in that. 
    And thus, would not be obligated to report and pay taxes on it. 
    There’s nothing to preclude, I presume Louisiana from doing the same where that the -- and that’s truly the hardship case more so and I think than Arms where the wife was residing with the husband and indeed in all probability shared with him whatever earnings he had. 
    And today is where all, the wife does indeed spend quite a bit of the income which even her husband makes and I think it’s only realistic to recognize that. 
    But in the area where that Mr. Justice White deposited where she has no knowledge of what’s going and can’t because her husband has abandoned her for instance. 
    Then there’s nothing to suggest that Louisiana couldn’t modify its laws to say in that circumstance the husband owns that right, his income and the wife has no interest in it.

    Thus, we would not be faced, I don’t think in the community property state with quite the same problem in the embezzlement area. 
    Now, I might add that it’s for this very reason that Congress so fit to amend the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code this January to relieve the wife of liability in this hardship case. 
    And --

    And the Congress there again confirm its understanding that income is taxed to its owner and that in the community property states, the wife is the owner and thus is the tax payer of her share.

    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Under Louisiana law now again presuming limitations or something else doesn’t bar him from going after. Of course in Angello the husband is dead and the record would indicate that the estate is himself. 
    But under state law she does have a remedy against her husband if he fails to pay the community obligation that is the tax is on the community income. 
    But, let me emphasize that unlike the suggestion in the Fifth Circuit below, the community simply is not a tax paying entity just as the partnership and the trustee is not rather it’s merely a flow-through device. 
    The individual spouse is under local law. 
    It’s very clear own individually their interest in the community property and its income and thus are required to report and pay the taxes on it. 
    If I may, I would like to reserve whatever time I have left rebuttal.

    As imposing a tax on her would make it unconstitutional as applied to her and secondly, irrespective the constitutional argument.

    Mr. Paul K. Kirkpatrick, Jr. 
    That is correct. 
    We contend that in term Section 1 of Code as imposing a tax on the wife violates the Dues Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it is arbitrary and unreasonable and that she has no control and it has no -- and the husband at the same time has power to deny her the property. 
    If she is required to report, it is legally impossible for her to do so unless her husband -- she can only do so unless her husband gives her the information. 
    If she does not have separate property and he will not advance the funds, it is impossible for her to pay. 
    Whether or not she pays are of course depends upon his whim and we contend that to pay to require her to pay community taxes with her separate funds is to confiscate her separate property.

    Your Honor, when you’re comparing a wife in a separate property state who have signed a joint return and made herself liable by signing the joint return she made it possible for the family to split the income, that the Congress makes her liable, makes her agreed to be liable for all the taxes by virtue of signing the return. 
    Now, the question whether fraudulently income -- money is income or not and this Court has decided twice and at this moment it is income. 
    I doubt seriously that we can avoid taxation to the wife in Louisiana because our state law said, that embezzle money was not the property of the community.

    Mr. Paul K. Kirkpatrick, Jr. 
    Right, yes she is and just as hard part of the position, but the Government says here, “You must file return. 
    You don’t have a choice of whether to file a return and be liable or not file return and not be liable.” 
    The Government says, “Here, you must file a return and be liable.”

    Well, they say that because of their theory of who’s in company?
speaker="paul_k_kirkpatrick_jr" startTime="2789.300" stopTime="3002.247">
    Mr. Paul K. Kirkpatrick, Jr. 
    That’s correct and it’s our contention that it is not her income that Section 1 of the Code when it imposes the tax on the income of individuals does not impose the tax on the wife. 
    Now, the argument goes that since she has a vested interest in the community, she owns a community’s income, but this ignores a basic fundamental concept of community property law. 
    The community is in an entity. 
    Community property is not a form of co-ownership, co-tenancy. 
    The community property is the property of the community. 
    It is not owned one-half by one and one-half by the other. 
    Community property is the community is separate from the husband and the wife. 
    The problem is, the tax problem arises from the fact that the community is not a tax paying entity and -- or define an individual or individuals who will pay its tax, the community’s income must be attributed to some person. 
    The question then it really and truly is not whose income is it, but to whom should it be attributed Now, Poe v. Seaborn, did not, which held that the husband and wife in split income was not based upon the concept that the husband and the wife own the income. 
    It was based upon the rational that neither owned it and sets one -- the case said, that the opinion said that it could not be said that one owned it more -- any more than the other. 
    And as a result, they were permitted to split the income, but that is not the same thing it saying that one owns the income or the other or both own it. 
    Mitchell says, that Seaborn permitted both to file returns and split the income that this is a -- that the whole rational of Seaborn if they did not and if we do not look -- Mitchell said, that if the husband and wife do not split the income and file returns, they say, if they do the wife has assumed the liability by virtue of filing the return that return. 
    Why? 
    Because Seaborn said, she could file the return. 
    But if they did not split the income and file returns that the court should then look to see to whom should the income be attributed. 
    The Fifth Circuit said, “The income should be attributed to the husband because he had control of the property and because to treat it any other way was to reap up the community property law unnecessarily by the use of the tax law.” 
    It said, “The husband was liable for the debts of the community, that this was by its nature a community debt and the husband was the logical person to pay the tax.” 
    Mitchell does not conflict with Seaborn unless, that the import of Seaborn laws that the husband could only be required to pay on one-half or that the wife was liable for one-half of the tax on her separate property without regard to anything else. 
    If that is what Seaborn meant although it did not say that, we suggest that this Court should overrule Seaborn because that is an illogical interpretation of Section 1. 
    It creates an unnecessary problem with state law and it causes the collection problems that the Government complains of here. 
    It is unnecessary for this Court to overrule Seaborn, to affirm Mitchell. 
    But if this --

    She is not liable from at the point of inception to debt.

    Alright, let’s assume that the community terminates, she does nothing about renouncing?

    Mr. Paul K. Kirkpatrick, Jr. 
    Then she -- well, let me say that prior to the 20’s she had 30 days in which it was presumed if she did not renounce in 30 days, it was presumed she had renounced. 
    Under this law, she is not required to come in now and renounce. 
    If she takes hold of the community and takes any of its property and uses it. 
    Then she is presumed to have accepted the community and then she becomes liable for its debts, but if she renounces at that point it’s put out of question that she -- that is a statement that she will not become liable for its debts. 
    But if she has a separate debt, which is what the Government has argued that she has a debt, if she can -- you understand that during the existence of community, she can contact debts that are on her own separate debts which are not -- cannot be paid out of the community, cannot go to the husband and ask you and pay them.

    It is the interest in the community.

    Mr. Paul K. Kirkpatrick, Jr. 
    That’s correct. 
    That’s correct, the husband and the wife that before marriage it is not necessary that they elect to come out of the community property system. 
    They may record a marriage contract in the public records which eliminates the community property system as to them. 
    But once they come under that system if the wives grant a renunciation comes about only at the termination of the community. 
    That’s the debt separation been barred, divorced and that action for separation of property.

   Argument of Patrick M. Schott
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4137.857" stopTime="4140.050">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Schott.
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4140.050" stopTime="4286.205">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I’m here on behalf of the other respondent Frances Angello and Your Honors if you would indulge me for just one moment, I cannot stand here and launch on my argument without noting that after almost 20 years before the Bar. 
    This has to be the one of the greatest moments of a professional career to argue a case before this High Court. 
    And I do thank the Court for allowing us this few additional minutes to make this argument. 
    Your Honors, the policy that we have submitted in the Government’s position in this case is in and all the simple of occasion of an issue and in a failure to consider that which this Court has held must to be considered in order to make a determination such as this. 
    For instance, my opponent made the statement a moment ago that state law creates a legal interest while federal law taxes those interests so created. 
    That statement is incomplete, that is not with this Court has held and if that were a complete statement of the law, the logic of the Government’s position may very well follow. 
    But what this Court has held and what this Court has said, I think it’s more accurately put in the Government’s brief on page 14 and 15 where they said that -- excuse me Your Honor. 
    The Government has cited the case of Morgan versus Commissioner on page 14 of its brief and in that case, the Supreme Court held that state law creates illegal interests and rights. 
    The federal revenue acts designate what interests or rights so created shall be taxed. 
    Now, in Seaborn and in Bender versus Pfaff --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4286.205" stopTime="4293.409">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And what do you say Mr. Schott, I missed it and it was my fault but I -- excuse me. 
    Your Honor is saying that a certain statement was incomplete and erroneous?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4293.409" stopTime="4293.779">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4293.779" stopTime="4294.997">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And what was that statement?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4294.997" stopTime="4496.473">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    That statement is “that the federal government taxes interests that are created by the state, but state law determines what those interests are.” 
    Now, what I have said is that if that standing alone were under consideration before the court then the logic of the Government’s argument might follow that therefore, such things as the exemption if you will of the wife separate property from vulnerability of seizure by a community creditor or mere exemption statutes. 
    But that is not what the law is, what I say the law is that federal law indeed does designate the interests to be taxed but also the rights that the state law creates. 
    Federal law designates the rights that are to be taxed also and I say that in that omission by the Government of a look at what is the right of the wife to renounce the community. 
    In that omission, is the crux of the Government’s error in this case. 
    Under Louisiana community property law, it is true that the wife has a present vested interest in the property. 
    However, that law says that she has a right to renounce the community and under our holdings of our Supreme Court, it is as though the community never existed as far as she was concerned. 
    Now, the reasons for this of course have already been touched upon by my colleague Mr. Kirkpatrick in talking about the almost unlimited control that the husband has over the community property. 
    For instance, an answer to a question by the Chief Justice, the question was, can the husband alienate the homestead? 
    The answer for that question is yes. 
    Now, there is a provision in the state law which gives the right to the wife to file a declaration of homestead and prevent the husband from doing so. 
    This is not usually exercise and if the ownership or title of the property is taken in the name of the husband alone even though it is the homestead. 
    And the wife and children live in the home, the husband is free to alienate that property and he cannot be forbidden from the wife in doing so or he cannot be call upon to account to the wife after he has done it. 
    So, I say to the Court that because of this great power of control and because of the very effects that would flow from the hypothetical which we have inserted in our brief, which I think is a good analysis and a sound analysis or an analogy excuse me. 
    I think the Government has admitted that the effect of their position would be that where the husband earns his money, squanders it. 
    They can come back to the wife and ask the wife to pay on half of the income that she never saw, never controlled, never enjoyed it could not do anything about it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4496.473" stopTime="4502.060">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Would you say then the Government could collect the entire trans bill for the entire community from her husband?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4502.060" stopTime="4518.411">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    I think that the logical extension of Louisiana community property law if it’s left understood in this case is that the husband owes all of the community income tax because the husband under Louisiana law does not have that same right than the wife.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4518.411" stopTime="4521.538">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Does this require any modification of prior cases in this Court?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4521.538" stopTime="4565.178">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    No, I don’t believe it would Your Honor. 
    Mr. Justice White, I think the only prior cases that the Government relies upon being Seaborn and Bender are cases that stand only for the proposition that if the wife chooses to file a separate -- joint return or separate return, split income in other words, she has enough a sufficient vested interest in the community to do so. 
    The Government would have you extend that to mean that because she has that sufficient vested interest, she therefore we just all look her rights. 
    That is the right to renounce in the event that she chooses to do so under our law. 
    Now, the other point that I would like to make to the Court --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4565.178" stopTime="4573.200">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But there no case or intimation in our cases that the Government may not collect the entire tax bill from the husband?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4573.200" stopTime="4575.558">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    I find none Your Honor.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because number one the Malcolm case?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4579.662" stopTime="4582.224">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    That is a per curiam decision and --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4582.224" stopTime="4583.267">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Certified questions?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4583.267" stopTime="4621.423">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    That case was -- a case in which the husband and wife had filed a joint return and I think that does make all the difference in the world because in effect, the wife in signing the joint return makes herself automatically liable under the tax laws. 
    Now, I might add to Your Honors that even under Louisiana community property law. 
    For instance, if the husband borrows money and he signed his name on a note. 
    Under the law, he obligates the community, but he does not make the wife individually liable so that her separate property can be seized to satisfy that debt. 
    However, --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4621.423" stopTime="4632.466">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, is the end-result then of your position is that the husband should -- is responsible for the entire tax bill for the community?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4632.466" stopTime="4633.246">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    That is correct Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4633.246" stopTime="4636.880">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the wife has no really substantial present interest in it?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4636.880" stopTime="4638.081">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    She doesn’t have anyway of controlling it, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4638.081" stopTime="4644.211">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And therefore, it should be no division of income for purposes of the tax rates?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4644.211" stopTime="4655.086">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    If she has a sufficient interest under Poe and Bender in order to split the income for tax purposes but to say to the wife now that even though you’re renounce the community --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4655.086" stopTime="4665.253">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think that Louisiana law though still gives her or not of an interest so that the husband doesn’t need to pay as though he is a single taxpayer?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4665.253" stopTime="4774.845">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    I think that it does. 
    In fact, Your Honor I was going to add that the Malcolm situation and the thought that I was trying to make here and answer to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question was this. 
    That under Louisiana law, if a husband and wife both signed that same note to the finance company. 
    In other words, the wife has not joined in signing that note, under Louisiana law; she has voluntarily then obligated herself personally to pay the debt so that then her separate property can be reached. 
    But the point is that the husband can actually endanger the community, all of the wife’s interest in the community when he signs that note. 
    And it’s under that condition and we say that the law has provided for the wife to renounce. 
    And Your Honor, the only have a point I want to make for the Court is that the Government’s characterization of what I have called the wife’s separate property is immunity if you will from vulnerability to seizure by the Government for tax purposes. 
    That has been characterized by the Government as a state exemption statute. 
    The way you would exempt for instance insurance proceeds under law or the way you might exempt the tools of trade from seizure that type of thing. 
    Your Honor, I think that that is almost a crest characterization. 
    This is an integral part of our community property system which flows logically from the others that since the wife can renounce and since she doesn’t have control, therefore her separate property cannot be seized by a community creditor. 
    And I say to the Court that that is not merely an exemption statute that the federal law preempts more than that. 
    It is an integral part of our community property system which I believe would have to be respected in determining what her rights are for the imposition of federal income tax.

    Why shouldn’t we -- why shouldn’t the federal government take you seriously then to say to the husband when he says, when they try to collect from him all of the taxes at single taxpayer’s rates, why should the Government say, will you tell me that this doesn’t belong to the wife, she has no interest in it?

    Your Honor, certainly that the federal income tax laws could be amended so as to require the husband to pay all the taxes as Mr. Bray pointed out in his address to the Court. 
    There’s no doubt that they could amend the federal tax law if that needs to be done to make the state law consistent in this case. 
    But what I’m saying is that an analysis of Louisiana state community property law does lead to the conclusion. 
    One, that the wife may renounce and avoid the payment of that tax and two, that the husband himself would be the one who would owe the tax with the Seaborn decisions injunction.

    That is correct except for the federal regulation which permit her to sign that joint return as she did in Malcolm and make herself liable for half of it.

    Mr. Schott, help me a little bit with your renouncement argument. 
    Has it none always been the case that the renunciation of income doesn’t necessarily lead to non-liability for tax on that income?
speaker="patrick_m_schott" startTime="4872.009" stopTime="4918.247">
    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    Your Honor, in Louisiana a renunciation of the community by the wife is a peculiar aspect of our community property law which gives the right to the wife, the right to renounce not only the benefits of the community but also the obligations of the community to the extent that the community as far as she was concerned never existed. 
    She can disassociate herself from all of the assets as well as all of the liabilities on a renunciation or a refusal if he will to accept that community. 
    Now, I don’t think that that is the same as a renunciation of income in a state for instance which would not have this peculiar concept that gives the wife the right to do this.

    Mr. Patrick M. Schott 
    Well, I think Your Honor as Mr.-- as my colleague pointed out I think that you are looking at a bundle of rights here. 
    And to say that she has a sufficient interest in the community to go ahead the return the half of the income and then to ignore her right to that statute -- that renunciation under our law which our court has held would place are in this position as though the community never existed is to simply ignore one part of our property rights system and to put undue emphasis on the other.

   Rebuttal of William Terry Bray
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4955.039" stopTime="4958.052">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Bray, you have about eight minutes left.
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="4958.052" stopTime="5309.984">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Thank you. 
    I would like to respond to four or five items brought out in the argument. 
    First, it’s our position that the federal statute at this point in time is very clear that it taxes income to the owner and that this is been the law since this Court handed down its decisions in the 1930 term in split income cases. 
    Thus, the inquiry under state law is who is the owner and we think the law of Louisiana is equally clear that the wife owns her one-half share of the income and thus it follows that she must report and pay the taxes on it. 
    The taxpayer’s arguments essentially are that the various state law rights to which they refer so qualify the wife’s ownership that she can’t be obligated to pay the tax that the ownership does not rise to the level which the federal statutes tax. 
    Listening to that argument, it duplicates almost verbatim of the Government’s brief in the Poe versus Seaborn cases. 
    All of these arguments were made by the Government in the 1930 cases in support of their position that the husband must report and pay taxes on all of the community income. 
    We argued there that he was the in fact owner of all the income because of his practical powers, management powers albeit over that income and of course not only did we argue his management powers but we also pointed to the wife’s protections under state law, specifically her renunciation power. 
    And we argued in our brief that this renunciation power was inconsistent with the wife being a sufficient “owner” to entitle her separately to report and pay taxes. 
    Notwithstanding our arguments, the court very clearly held and this contrary to the assertions of respondents that the income is tax to the owner. 
    It did not tax it to the community as an entity but rather to the owner and found that individual spouses each of them owned their respective shares of the community income. 
    This was the very clear holding not only in Poe versus Seaborn, the Washington case but also in the Louisiana case where the court said, if the test to be as we have held that it is ownership then the Louisiana case is probably the strongest of those presented to us in favor of the wife’s ownership of one-half of that income. 
    It went on of course to hold that because she was the owner, she was entitled separately to report it and pay taxes on it. 
    The wife indeed has protections under state law but these protections do not affect her basic ownership right. 
    They are outlined in the Weiner opinion to which we refer on page 10 of our brief in support of the court’s decision there, the Louisiana Supreme Court’s decision there showing that the husband’s management powers are not so extensive as to destroy the wife’s ownership. 
    These protections indeed limit the husband’s powers. 
    The husband not only has these rights with respect to management but has a duty to manage the community property for the benefit of the community. 
    So that duties go along with the rights. 
    I might add that the provision of Louisiana law dealing with separation of property without dissolving a marriage, provide not only for the separation of property where the wife’s, I beg your pardon -- where the husband’s activities endanger the wife’s separate property but go on to say or win the disorder of his affairs induces her to believe that his estate may not be sufficient to meet her rights and claims. 
    And of course it’s our position that one of her rights and claims would be the right to receive her share of community property upon dissolution of the community. 
    And thus, if the husband was furthering away the community income, obviously this would be -- entitle her to a separation of property under Louisiana Civil Code. 
    With respect to the right of renunciation, let me say that this of course occurs only after the community is dissolved and as in the cases here long after the tax years in which income is realized. 
    At the very moment, the income is realized and this is the clear law of Louisiana. 
    The wife owns her share of that income, it would certainly be an unusual and in fact unique in the tax law if many years later because of some act she took with respect to the state’s definition of creditor’s rights she could remove the liability which otherwise is imposed on her by the Federal Taxing Statutes for her tax on her share of the income. 
    Now, let me emphasize too that the decision below opens up also many non-hardship cases or at least it poses a problem in such cases. 
    Under that decision, there is nothing to keep why is now from just not reporting their share of income and to the husband filing a separate return and paying the tax on his half of the community income. 
    Under the decisions of this Court and we think Malcolm in contrast to our respondents is quite clear that we cannot collect the wife’s taxes from the husband. 
    Thus, the taxes on her share would escape taxation under the decision below. 
    Let me mention that perhaps Judge --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why can’t the -- why couldn’t the Government’s theory -- the Government to collect the husband’s share for the -- even if the income of the wife’s set of property?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="5321.060" stopTime="5326.786">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Because the wife has no obligation on the husband’s -- on the taxes on the husband’s share of the income.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5326.786" stopTime="5331.145">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean, it isn’t the same reason that you could collect?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="5331.145" stopTime="5343.815">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Well, certainly with respect -- yes to answer that directly yes. 
    It’s not her taxes and just as it’s not his taxes and thus we can’t collect her taxes from the husband.

    That was if they, I suppose if a joint return is made in a community property state just as a matter of federal law of each spouse --

    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    That’s correct, I think --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5370.260" stopTime="5371.968">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It’s not different from a common law state?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="5371.968" stopTime="5378.022">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    That’s correct and I think the best case makes very clear that in that situation we’re not bound by a state exemption laws.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5378.022" stopTime="5379.146">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="5379.146" stopTime="5423.472">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    But the characterization of the wife’s ownership is something less than sufficient for federal tax purposes is simply not with this Court has recognized or what the Louisiana courts have held time and again. 
    And this may explain Judge Ainsworth joining in the majority opinion here. 
    Perhaps, she was too influenced by the parochial views of Louisiana law having been a Louisiana lawyer for many, many years and he failed to see that the federal law taxes the owner and the state law in Louisiana makes the wife the owner. 
    The other peculiar taste of that law do not diminish in any regard her ownership and this regard the case --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5423.472" stopTime="5425.647">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    If she is bound, can she sell it?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="5425.647" stopTime="5426.544">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Can she sell it?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5426.544" stopTime="5427.066">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="5427.066" stopTime="5438.704">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    Alright, she has no right to convey the property during the existence of the community. 
    I know of no reason why she couldn’t assign whatever rights she might have at such time as those rights can be.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5438.704" stopTime="5442.888">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    She doesn’t have ownership the way I understand ownership, does she?
speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="5442.888" stopTime="5461.515">
    Mr. William Terry Bray 
    No, sir. 
    Not in terms of conveyances. 
    Now, I might answer that by saying that the husband’s right of conveyance are restrictive wherever the wife’s name is own community property. He can’t convey without her consent. 
    So, in that regard his rights of conveyance are restricted too.
