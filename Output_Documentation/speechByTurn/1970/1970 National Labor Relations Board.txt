    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Sixth Circuit. 
    The board issued its order directing the respondent utility district to bargain collectively with the union which a -- the voice of the district in an appropriate unit had previously designated as her bargain representative. 
    The district contending that under the laws of the State of Tennessee that it is a political subdivision for an arm or instrumentality of the state has refused to comply with the order. 
    The statute specifically excludes from the definition of the term employer, the United States or any state, or any critical subdivision thereof. 
    The two questions presented here are first, whether for purposes of the Labor Act, federal standards or state law governs the determination whether an entity is a political subdivision within the meaning of the statute or an employer within the meaning of the statute. 
    Secondly, if federal standards and not state law govern that determination whether boards find it that the district here is not a political subdivision within the meaning of the Labor Act but an employer is entitled to affirmance. 
    The court below rejecting the board’s view held that state law is controlling with the respect of the determination of whether an entity is a political subdivision or not and on the basis of the state, the code of the State of Tennessee and the Supreme Court’s -- and the decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee confirming the legislation. 
    It held that the district here was a political subdivision within the meaning of the Labor Act and therefore not an employer.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Yes, eminent domain is not a unique characteristic of political subdivisions. 
    Private concerns quasi-public you might say have been given that sort of authority. 
    Now, I want to summarize perhaps a little bit more at length than I normally as the case in this Court. 
    I do want to summarize one of the facts, custodian facts that relate to the district’s status as an employer under the act or as the other side would have it as a political subdivision under the Act. 
    The district sells and distributes natural gas without profit to residential homes, commercial businesses and industrial firms in Hopkins County, Tennessee. 
    It was incorporated in December 1957 under the Tennessee Utility District Law. 
    Under the provisions of that law, a group of local real property holders in Hawkins County filed a petition with the county court setting forth the statement of the need for the service to be supplied, the estimated cost and the names of free local residence proposed these commissioners of the district. 
    After a hearing, the chairman of the county court, the chairman of the county court is a judge. 
    The chairman of the county court found that public convenience and necessity justified the creation of the proposed district that it was economically sound and desirable and accordingly granted the petition. 
    The chairman of the county court as required by the state law appointed its commissioners of the newly created district, the three persons nominated in the petition. 
    The district was financed through the private sale of bonds and no public money was used. 
    The district constructed a natural gas distribution system with the proceeds of the bond sale. 
    Under the statute, the gas system became subject to a lien in favor of the bond holders until the debt was paid. 
    Principal and interest on the bonds are payable solely from the revenues of the district. 
    The rates charged by the district must be sufficient to pay its expenses and as bonded in datedness. 
    The district has no power to levy or collect taxes and its service charges are not to be construed as taxes. 
    The powers of the district are vested in and exercised by three member board of commissioners. 
    The commissioners are not subject to county or state regulations. 
    They adopt the necessary rules and regulations and set the district service fees. 
    They control the labor relations of the district. 
    And under their supervision, the manager of the district hires and fires employees and sets their wages. 
    Neither the state nor the county has any control over the district’s employees. 
    The state statute also gives the district the power of eminent domain as the Chief Justice has already alluded to. 
    And it authorizes the board of commissioners to inquire into any matter relating to the affairs of the district and to carry out this function to issue subpoenas and administer oaths. 
    Finally, the enabling Tennessee statute provides that a utility district is a municipality or public corporation and exemption from state, county or local taxation. 
    The Supreme Court of Tennessee has upheld this tax exemption on the ground that such a district is an arm or an instrumentality of the state. 
    As I stated earlier, the court below concluded that state law governs the determination whether an entity is a political subdivision or not and under the laws of Tennessee as confirmed by the highest court of that state, the district here is a political subdivision and therefore refused to enforce the board's bargaining order. 
    The Fourth Circuit on the other hand in dealing with a related type of problem has rejected the contention that state law governs the determination of whether an entity is a political subdivision or not and as held the federal standards govern the determination of whether or not that particular entity is a political subdivision or not.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, but there’s no issue between you here today as far as I know.
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="456.897" stopTime="617.979">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    I had not fully appreciated that. 
    Now, both the act and this legislative history are silent as to the meaning that Congress sought to attribute to the phrase political subdivision of a state. 
    The obvious purpose of course, of Congress was to avoid, to avoid interference and to the labor relations the employment relations of -- between a governmental entity and its employees. 
    Now, I shall not attempt to give any kind of a comprehensive definition of what a political subdivision is. 
    Indeed the cases tell us, the cases tell us that an entity may be a political subdivision for purposes of one statute and not another. 
    Now, any definition of a political subdivision for the purpose of the statute, must I think taken to account the basic purpose which underlies the Governmental exemption in the statute, namely the avoidance of interference. 
    The avoidance of interference into the employment and labor relations between a state, between a governmental entity and its employees. 
    So therefore the threshold question in this case as it was in the Missouri Transit Workers case decided by this Court several years ago. 
    The threshold question in this case here, do we have that kind of state involvement in the creation, the administration, the operation and particularly the labor relations. 
    The employment relations of the districts, do we have that kind of state involvement here that should bring in to play, should bring in to play the congressional purpose to bar the labor board from intruding, from intruding into the labor relations of a governmental entity. 
    I submit that the answer to that question is that we do not have that kind of state involvement. 
    The state did not directly create the district. 
    It was formed by private individuals. 
    It is not administered by publicly elected officials or their designees. 
    It has not become assimilated or incorporated into the state or local government so as to become one of its constituent parts. 
    The county judge exercises no independent judgment in appointing the districts commissioners except in the remote contingency that two of the commissioners may not be able to agree on filling a vacancy. 
    The Tennessee statute requires him to appoint those persons nominated in the petition filed by the local property owners. 
    Utility system is owned by the district itself and is not state property.

speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="649.367" stopTime="655.053">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Supposing they’re involved during their terms in some kind of directions in that way?
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="655.053" stopTime="960.748">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    There is in Tennessee an ouster statute. 
    And under this ouster statute, the ouster statute provides that where an official of a municipality or political subdivision is failing to perform his duties that the Attorney General of the state or the city attorney or the county attorney as the case maybe, may bring ouster proceedings in court, whether any such power has ever been exercised with the respect to any of these districts and we are told that there are approximately 270 of them in the State of Tennessee, I don’t know. 
    Now, the utility system is owned by the district itself and is not state property. 
    It has no authority to levy taxes and must meet its expenses and obligations from its revenues. 
    The district is completely autonomous in the conduct of its affairs. 
    The state exercises no supervisory power over the conduct of the district's day to day affairs or its operations. 
    Indeed, the Tennessee statute expressly bars any state public utility commission from exercising any jurisdiction over the management and control of the system or its rates or charges. 
    Finally, the district alone exercises the power to hire and fire employees. 
    The state does not control either directly or indirectly the terms and conditions of employment for the district and apparently on the basis of a decision by a Circuit Court of Appeals in the State of Tennessee. 
    Apparently these employees are not deemed to be subject to the state restrictions applicable to the state or municipal employees with the respect to strikes and picketing. 
    Essentially, the district appears to be -- the board found that essentially it’s a private venture to be sure for the benefit of the community and for the benefit of the community but nonetheless a private venture having no identity or relationship to the state. 
    Now of course, as the State of Tennessee as seen fit to its legislature to characterize, to label this district here as a political subdivision of the state as a municipality. 
    But that factor cannot be dispositive of the status of this district here for purposes of the federal legislation. 
    As this Court said some years ago, the Labor Act is a federal legislation administered by a national agency to solve a national problem on a national scale. 
    And the general principle is that normally that Congress intends that it's law shall have uniform application so that its programs would not be impaired. 
    Now, of course, a state has an important interest in defining its political subdivision and the board of course pays considerable attention to the state's legitimate interest in defining its political subdivisions. 
    But that interest it seems to us must be weighed, must be weighed against the policies of the statute and the uniform application of those policies which this Court had repeatedly confirmed Congress intended. 
    Now, local considerations, local problems may prompt a state, may prompt a state to characterize as a political subdivision, what is essentially a private venture. 
    Having no real identity or relationship to the state and over which a state exercises no control. 
    If state by state characterizations of an entity as a political subdivision were to be determinative of the problem, then the result might well be a patchwork of policies, a patchwork of policies and exemptions from the provisions of the statute which have no relation to the underlying purpose of the governmental exemption in the statute, namely the avoidance of interference and the employment in labor relations between a governmental entity and its employees. 
    I don’t believe (Inaudible) say that in this particular case that the State of Tennessee has seen fit to label a district as a political subdivision not because it really regards as an armed or instrumentality or a department of the state but rather because it sought to give us some kind of tax exemption and thereby encourage you, encourage local citizens, local property holders here to create these districts.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Manoli, how important is this case to the board? Do you have a lot of cases such as this, is this just a spare one that happens to come along?
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="1368.957" stopTime="1405.020">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    No. 
    Over the years, I think the board has had at least those which have come -- are now incorporated in these official records. 
    There have been in the neighborhood of a dozen or so cases. 
    But the problem however though is much broader than that because in this particular state for example, in Tennessee, we are told that there are 270 of these particular districts. 
    Now, what the situation maybe in other states, there maybe differences of course. 
    In some cases, perhaps the district similar to this one here maybe regarded by the board itself as a political subdivision, here is not. 
    So --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1405.020" stopTime="1412.702">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I noticed though that so many of these very districts in Tennessee have been held to be exempt by a regional director.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Well, there was never any appeal from that decision to the board itself. 
    The board has expressly overruled that decision of the regional director, the holding rather, the holding of regional director in that particular case. 
    So that particular case has no more presidential value, if I may use somewhat exaggerated example then the decision of a District Court, after this Court had come down with a decision under the same type of issue.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    If the union were to seek representation or if somebody was fired there. 
    That somebody was fired there because, let’s say he became a union member and the charges were filed with us today or a representation of petitioner was filed today, that regional director would entertain those -- either the representation petition or the unfair labor practice charge on the merits. 
    He would be bound by the board.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    The crux of the board’s position is this. 
    That it limits the term political subdivisions to those entities that are either directly created by the state so as to constitute either a department or administrative arm of the state or those entities where the individuals administering that particular entity are either responsible directly to publicly elected officials or to the general electorate. 
    That’s the distinction that the board has drawn.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Well, I think that it certainly was an important element in the board’s thinking here that underlies the classification, that either the interpretation of the political subdivision here. 
    But what the board is looking to is to what extent, to what extent if it’s a political subdivision of a state that we’re concerned, to what extent is the state administering that particular entity? 
    To what extent has the state become involved? 
    To what extent has the state become involved in the operation, the administration of that particular entity and particularly its labor and employment relationships. 
    And where you have the case such as we have here where there’s simply an enabling statute which permits private citizens to create this kind of a district with all the various characteristics that I have described there. 
    The board says “Well, we don’t have that kind of involvement.” 
    We don’t have that kind of involvement by the state that should bring in to play the congressional purpose and to bar the labor board from intruding into the employment or labor relations of our governmental entity and its employees.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Well, it’s not so much a question of distinguishing between what kind of service, what is water or gas or electricity but rather it goes to the question, what is the entity that is performing that service. 
    Now, in the case that I referred to where the board -- there, the gas district was part of the city, of the city’s operations, it was run by a board of the utility commissioners I recall them under the supervision of the mayor. 
    And the city had financial responsibility for the operation of that particular gas district as I recall it. 
    So the distinction is not been made upon whether it's water, gas or electricity, what have you, but what is the nature of the particular corporation or entity that is performing this kind of service and what is its relationship? 
    What is relationship, whatever the service may be, water, gas, whatever, what is its relationship to the State Government, to the City Government or the general electorate

    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    It is the position of respondent here that the question presented is not whether the state or federal determination controls whether the utility district is a political subdivision under Section 2.2 of the National Labor Relations Act. 
    Respondent agrees that state law is not controlling but that state law is a factor along with all the other factors to be considered in reaching this determination. 
    It is respondent’s position further that there was no conflict between the Hawkins County case in the Sixth Circuit below and the Randolph case which is referred to by the board. 
    Respondent accepts the rule in the Randolph case which is to the extent that the board has considered the economic realities and the statutory purposes, its determination is entitled to great respect. 
    It is simply submitted that the board inadequately and improperly considered the economic realities and the statutory purposes and that to the extent, the Court of Appeals below in the last two sentences of the opinion which was several pages long stated that state law is controlling. 
    Respondent explains this the same way that the board has explained one of its decisions in its brief that state law is controlling. 
    The board has held state law to be controlling. 
    But now on page 19 on a footnote to its brief, it states that that language was not necessary for the result reached. 
    Now that is exactly the position of respondent here. 
    Because what the Court of Appeals did for several pages is take the rule in the Randolph case and apply by examining the economic realities one at a time and deciding that the board had inadequately and improperly considered that. 
    We have here basically a jurisdictional matter. 
    The board bestowed jurisdiction upon itself and has repeatedly thereafter refused to reconsider this.

    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    They are as a matter of fact in a late board decision which incidentally involves Tennessee, I’m answering Your Honor’s question. 
    Coincidentally involves the State of Tennessee, an exemption was granted to the Fayetteville Lincoln County Electric System. 
    Now this is a June 1970 board decision. 
    And in that case, we have nearly identical facts to the case here. 
    We have enabling legislation, the Tennessee Municipal Electric Plant law. 
    We also have a private act to the state legislature by which a city took over a local electric company. 
    But once the system was setup, the Mayor nominated a board of directors. 
    The board of directors then had a manager. 
    The manager employed all the employees. 
    Now, there is absolutely, we submit, no distinction between the Fayetteville Lincoln County system which was -- the exemption was granted and the case at bar with the one exception that there, the Mayor appointed the board of public utilities and here the county judge appointed the board of public utilities. 
    And we submit that that is not a legitimate basis to award or not award coverage under the National Labor Relations Act.

    Mr. Greener, maybe I misunderstood you but I did not understand that the county judge performed that function. 
    I thought he more or less accepted the nominations as they came to him and secondly that if there was a vacancy, the board was self perpetuating and unless they couldn’t agree.
speaker="eugene_greener_jr" startTime="2393.679" stopTime="2415.335">
    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Let me clarify that Your Honor. 
    As in numerous similar entities, for instance the Fayetteville Lincoln County system that I just referred to, individuals are nominated to the county judge and usually, customarily, he appoints the nominees.

    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    As we pointed out in our brief, the power to appoint and we have referred to some municipal law in McQuillin, includes the power not to appoint. 
    Now, we are not faced with that particular problem here but we submit that if the county judge felt that a nominee was incompetent or should not be placed in this position that he would not have to make this appointment. 
    There’s nothing in the statute that says that. 
    And secondly, as we said of course that in certain counties, the commissioners are elected by the qualified voters. 
    All the qualified -- this happens to be a smaller county and don’t operate in this fashion. 
    Now, next addressing to Your Honors question about vacancies. 
    Vacancies are filled by the remaining commissioners but this is something that many county boards have this administrative procedure. 
    However, if they cannot agree, it is specifically provided that the county judge will fill these vacancies. 
    And I might add one of Your Honors asked about the Ouster Law. 
    The Ouster Law of Tennessee applies specifically to public elected officials, public officials, they don’t have to all be elected. 
    Let’s take a county road commissioner who’s guilty of dereliction or maltheisms in office, an action would be brought against him by the county attorney. 
    There would be jury trial. 
    He would be removed or not removed based on the findings of the jury. 
    This Ouster statute applicable to public officials, applies to utility district commissioners.

    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Your Honor, that I do not know but I will say this that we and also in an answer to the Chief Justice’s remarks earlier, we have districts in Tennessee that provide fire protection, police protection, sewage, natural gas. There are all kinds of services that a district can provide. 
    And when counsel informed the Court that there are 270 districts. 
    Right there are but they provide a myriad of services in areas where usually in rural areas and this was setup by the legislature with that in mind to provide governmental services where there was no other entity available to do so.

    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    No sir. 
    They are identical. 
    As a matter of fact, they were both natural gas districts. 
    The Benton, Caroll County district is a natural gas district. 
    This is a natural gas district. 
    But a district can perform any one of these other types of services, and often performs more than one type of service. 
    It can have fire and police and natural gas depending on what is needed in the particular area involved.

    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    In accordance with the rule of law that we contend is applicable here. 
    We would like to bring to the Court’s attention several undisputed relevant facts in this record that have not been mentioned here before. 
    Some of which we submit have not been properly understood by the board. 
    First place, Section 6-2615 TCA, the same utility district law designates a utility districts records as “public records.” 
    Secondly, as referred to by counsel, a utility district has the power to issue subpoenas for witnesses and has the power to administer oaths to witnesses. 
    Now, the reference was made by the board’s counsel to that Section of the Act 6-2613 specifically exempts a utility district from regulation by the Tennessee railroad and public utilities commission. 
    What the board has done since the outset of this litigation does not understand the significance of that. 
    This entity is exempt privately owned public utilities and railroads are regulated. 
    Also, under several federal statutes, acknowledgment has been made that the utility district is a municipality. 
    For instance, the employees of the district are covered under the social security law on a voluntary rather than on a mandatory basis which is a test of course for a private enterprise.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2843.256" stopTime="2845.778">

    That’s under the Social Security Act Provisions.

    No sir, none. 
    And as a matter of fact, the utility district commissioners as I have said earlier in certain counties are elected by the general electorate. 
    Now, in reference to the power of eminent domain, the chief justice asked originally about this district not only has the power of eminent domain but has it against other governmental entities. 
    We certainly as a stronger form of the power of eminent domain then for instance a telephone company might have. 
    In addition to these factors that we have referred to, Section 62612 of the Utility District Act grants to the district all the powers necessary and requisite capable of being delegated by the legislature. 
    So, we contend that when all of these factors are added up and the totality of the picture is before this Court, the conclusion must follow that we have an exempt municipality. 
    I would like in addition to the Lafayette-Lincoln case which is a electric system under the Tennessee Municipal Electric Plant Law and which is practically identical to the case at bar, the June 8, 1970 decision by the board granting the exemption. 
    We also have another late board case granting the exemption to the City of Austell Natural Gas system. 
    This natural gas system and the electric system were both granted the exemptions as being municipalities. 
    The difference if you can call this a difference is that in these cases the board of trustees was appointed by a Mayor, rather than by a county judge. 
    And the board's standard which the board states in its brief is controlling, that is how the labor relations are carried on. 
    It is submitted that the labor relations in the district and the labor relations in the Austell Natural Gas case and LaFayette-Lincoln electric system case carry on exactly the same way. 
    That is there is a manager who hires the employees and that as far as the commissioners are concerned, they more or less direct the operations of the gas system in the Austell case or the gas system in the utility district of Hawkins County case. 
    So we submit that considering these two cases, we can find no distinction between them and the case that is before us. 
    We think we also should refer to the board’s standard which it alleges --- it has been uniform and reasonable in its application.

    Do you have the doctrine of sovereign immunity in Tennessee?

    Or does it -- and then is it applicable when a Government is acting in a proprietary capacity, that’s a distinction we used to have in Ohio --

    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    That law has been changed recently and according to my recollection, the sovereign is now required to carry liability insurance. 
    And to that extent can be sued. 
    But there has been no such suit against the utility district of which I am aware and I have read the cases on utility districts.

    I was just curious, thank you.

    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Yes.

    Do you challenge the Government's right if it wished to do so to subject employees of an agency like yours to the National Labor Relations Act?
speaker="eugene_greener_jr" startTime="3501.858" stopTime="3507.720">
    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    I contend that we are exempt under the specific language of the act.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3507.720" stopTime="3510.695">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I say what if you claim any constitutional exemption?
speaker="eugene_greener_jr" startTime="3510.695" stopTime="3526.654">
    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    No sir, it’s statutory. 
    We are a political subdivision to the State of Tennessee and specifically under Section 2 (2) of the Act, a state or a political subdivision thereof is specifically exempt.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3526.654" stopTime="3529.572">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Does the district have a president?
speaker="eugene_greener_jr" startTime="3529.572" stopTime="3530.187">
    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Sir?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3530.187" stopTime="3532.757">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Does the district have a president like a corporation?
speaker="eugene_greener_jr" startTime="3532.757" stopTime="3640.050">
    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    No sir, it does not. 
    It has three commissioners who served with a nominal compensation who are appointed by the county judge and is much the same as a county utilities board. 
    If these were a county utilities board or if these were -- as in Lafayette-Lincoln case, a board of trustees to run the electric system, we say it’s exactly the same except that there are so many more factors here than they are in these cases where the board has granted the exemption. 
    I would like to have just a moment to make a comment on the board’s alleged reasonable and uniform standard. 
    The board’s standard is actually changed between 1967 when the decision and direction of election here was made and its brief today. 
    We state that under the original standard of the board and under the revised standard that this district is administered by state appointed officials if we go by the board standard. 
    The board standard now says that the exemption is applicable if it’s administered by persons responsible to public officials. 
    Apparently the board feels that we may be able to persuade the Court that the utility district commissioners are state appointed that is appointed by a county judge. 
    But that they would be held not to be responsible to the publicly -- we say they are responsible to the publicly elected officials too. 
    And even with the changed standard between 1967 and the brief today, the utility district does exempt.

    Who fixes the range?

    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    The utility district commissioners but they are limited by statute. 
    Your Honor only two recover enough, to cover the costs of operating the district. 
    They cannot operate at a profit and if they get a surplus funds by statute, they must make a rebate to the persons who enjoy the services in the district.

    To the customers.
speaker="eugene_greener_jr" startTime="3664.652" stopTime="3669.504">
    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    This is by a statute as strictly a non-profit entity.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3669.504" stopTime="3687.703">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Since you couldn’t conceivably -- the commissioners couldn’t conceivably anticipate precisely their income and their out go, I suppose we can assume that there is some moderate surplus each year which is rebated.
speaker="eugene_greener_jr" startTime="3687.703" stopTime="3710.932">
    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    Your Honor that is theoretically the case. 
    This particular district has been in a deficit position in almost from the beginning but they have increased their rates with the hope that they would have a surplus and would be in a position to make a rebate. 
    They had to borrow funds in order to build, to extend the lines out into the rural areas which is their purpose for being and they have not have a surplus.

    Mr. Eugene Greener, Jr. 
    The deficits have remained unpaid. 
    They will increase their rates in order to do so. 
    Thank you sir.

    Thank you Mr. Greener. 
    I think your time is consumed Mr. Manoli. 
    Thank you gentleman. 
    The case is submitted.
