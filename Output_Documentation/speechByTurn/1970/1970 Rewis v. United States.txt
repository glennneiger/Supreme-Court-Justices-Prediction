    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    This is not involved here, Your Honor. 
    I’m aware of the fact that Congress had just recently passed such a statute in anticipation --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="103.181" stopTime="134.333">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, in other words, if we disagree with you as to the statutory construction, it could be involved. 
    We could say, yes, the statute as we read it, does mean that the travel by the players from Georgia into Florida is sufficient to make your clients guilty of a defense under the statutes as it’s written, then there it becomes the question, well, could Congress have the constitutional power under Commerce Clause to do so. 
    You don’t go though that far?

    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    Well, tangentially that in the recently passed act, Congress did declare that gambling was a matter of interstate commerce per se, that it affected Interstate Commerce and attempted to regulate it. 
    I submit and this is not in the brief, nobody's brief had raise it, but that might even be additional factors to consider a comparison with that statute and the Travel Act is what Congress could have done, if it had wanted to.

speaker="albert_j_datz" startTime="179.578" stopTime="477.470">
    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    The petitioner, James Rewis and Mary Williams were convicted in the Middle District of Florida of the crime involved in the violation of 18 United States Code 1952, known as the Travel Act, that is of traveling and causing travel in Interstate Commerce with and intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on and to facilitate the promotion and management, establishment and carrying on of a gambling activity. 
    Now, the gambling activity involved was a lottery known as Cuba. 
    And in this particular case, Cuba is called Cuba because at that time, the winning number was picked through the national lottery in Cuba. 
    It was picked around 2 o’clock on a Saturday afternoon each week and the people in the State of Florida who were actually violating the laws of the State of Florida and running this “Cuba activity” would wait and get the winning number from Cuba and that of course would determine the winning number of anybody who had played. 
    Now, this lottery, so far as this case is concerned was operated from the home of Mary Williams at a small community between Jacksonville, Florida and Fernandina Beach, Florida known as Yulee. 
    This home was about a half a mile from the main highway U.S. 17 which led to Georgia. 
    Georgia was about 15 miles north of Yulee. 
    The game was a relatively small game as pointed out in the briefs. 
    I believe that the take on the particular Saturday which -- in which it was rated was about a $125.00 although concededly that Rewis who we’ll see as the pick up man or operator of the game, had over $1500.00 in his pocket. 
    But significantly, the winning number fell on the Saturday afternoon and most of the players would pick their numbers on Friday night and Saturday morning. 
    Undoubtedly, Mary Williams who was operating a selling establishment there from her home was the seller of the numbers. 
    Rewis was the central figure who picked up the business each Saturday, around noon, before the winning number would fall. 
    Now, the issue at the trial as here was whether or not travel by some customers who were from Georgia at least 15 miles to the north invested the operation with this travel in Interstate Commerce required by the Travel Act. 
    However, the theory of the Government at the trial and the theory in the appellate courts is different. 
    At the trial, the Government contended and the District Judge agreed that the travel of the customers themselves invested this illegal activity with the interstate character necessary for conviction and that the customers or betters themselves could be convicted under the Travel Act. 
    Now, after the conviction, the Fifth Circuit disagreed with that concept. 
    Originally, there were 11 people indicted. 
    One was Rewis’ wife who was excused because of illness. 
    Four had directed the motions for judgment of acquittal granted by the trial judge. 
    Two were acquitted by the jury and finally, two who were convicted, their convictions were reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on the theory that the only evidence against them was that they were these gamblers, that they were the betters, the customers and that the Travel Act itself did not proscribe the conduct of the better, only the operator of the business enterprise as defined by the statute itself. 
    Subsection B of the statute, Section 1952 describes the unlawful activity as a business enterprise and they -- short look at the legislative history of that statute shows without any doubt that the intent of Congress was to proscribe the activities of the business enterprise and we submit that the reverse is true that it did not intend to proscribe the activities of the better. 
    Now, the Government has not contended otherwise here, but the Fifth Circuit in reversing as to the two customers, affirmed of conviction as to the Rewis and Williams, the last two remaining defendants, on the theory that by placing this game, this lottery within 15 miles of the Georgia border, that they had attracted, sort of an attracted nuisance theory. 
    They had attracted these betters from the State of Georgia to Florida and thus the interstate character was bestowed upon this gambling operation.

    What would you say if the gambling establishment had been 15 feet inside the line from Georgia?
speaker="albert_j_datz" startTime="487.130" stopTime="514.586">
    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    I would say the same thing that the -- it did not violate the statute, this particular Travel Act anyhow. 
    Now, we might get into another area on the question of use of interstate facilities to promote, manage etcetera a gambling operation because as an example, suppose, they put up a big billboard right at the border and say, “Come over to Florida and participate in our gambling operation” then there would be some question of interstate facility but not travel --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="514.586" stopTime="519.543">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would that be different if they had a sign --
speaker="albert_j_datz" startTime="519.543" stopTime="520.342">
    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    I don’t believe so.

    -- the other way saying, “Come in and have fun just before you leave Florida.”
speaker="albert_j_datz" startTime="526.510" stopTime="568.637">
    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    I don’t -- I don’t -- if the operators had traveled in Interstate Commerce to put that sign up and they would have had to that do either themselves or through some agent, then of course, they would be guilty because they are the operators. 
    They are promoting, establishing, maintaining and carrying on this operation, the exact word the statute condemns. 
    But the mere placing of the sign at the boarder would not be sufficient or placing the game 15 feet from the boarder would not be sufficient. 
    But here we have 15 miles and the Court of Appeals said that this attracted these players across the state line and invested the case with the interstate character necessary for conviction.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I guess you wouldn’t blame the Court of Appeals that they’re wrong in saying that beyond 15 miles from the boarder, on those good roads, they would’ve attracted the players?

    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    I would tend to agree Your Honor that it might have had some attraction although and we might discuss this at this moment, the Government says that the predominant people involved were Georgia. 
    We submit the record would show otherwise that these people came from Georgia for several reasons. 
    One of the witnesses was bringing sewing to the Mary Williams house, her mother was ill and she brings sewing back in forth. 
    Other witnesses would come at Jacksonville to buy fish to take the pedal up in Georgia and stop by the game to bet a number.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="622.147" stopTime="624.009">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And others came by down to gamble?
speaker="albert_j_datz" startTime="624.009" stopTime="692.072">
    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    Yes sir. 
    Others came for the specific purpose of gambling, but it wasn’t the predominant travel involved. 
    This is – as an example there were 14 different successive Saturdays involved in the Government’s surveillance of this Mary Williams home. 
    They made a count in the indictment for each one of those Saturdays claiming interstate travel. 
    Now, they joined Mary Williams and Rewis, the petitioner Rewis in each of those counts and they would say that one or more people from Georgia would travel on those particular Saturdays. 
    On those -- this is alleged now even though the trial judge direct -- entered a judgment of acquittal as to four of these people and the jury acquitted the two on the theory that they weren’t even customers because at that time, the trial judge’s theory was that the Government’s theory was that if they were customers, they were guilty. 
    But on five Saturdays they say one person came from Georgia. 
    On three Saturdays, they say two people came from Georgia. On four Saturdays, they say that three people came from Georgia and on two Saturdays they said that four people came from Georgia.

    A lot. 
    Well, now this is the point. 
    The -- you have to see the movies which we introduced in evidence of the trial to know this and for this reason, I hesitate to take advantage of the Government, but there were a lot of people from Florida going. 
    This was not a predominantly Georgia-type of operation and this may become significant in connection with the theory that the Government offers about the purpose of the travel predominantly.

    They would take the -- they would take this surveillance from 9 o’clock on a Saturday morning to 1 o’clock Saturday afternoon. 
    They would then say, the agents of the FBI testified that they only took movies of those people they thought would be pertinent to the investigation and this was late in the investigation where they were concentrating on Georgia people. 
    On one Saturday, four hours of surveillance produced three minutes of movies. 
    On another Saturday, it produced eight minutes of movies, on the next nine and on the last, seven minutes of movies out of over four hours of surveillance.

    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    Because simply that the Government takes the position that we can expound a new theory here and in spite of the language of the statute that says the travel must be to promote the game, that the defendants could be guilty if you apply a combination of the Mail Fraud Statute and the Mann Act and say that if the defendants reasonably expected out of state people to travel to their game for the specific purpose of participating in that gambling operation, then the Government says, “we can now, based on this case, hold them guilty of the offense.” 
    We submit that that would be contrary to the intent of Congress, from a simple reading of the statute, much less, a study of the legislative history involved.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Datz, help me out on one respect.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would you mind telling me if you can as briefly as possible, what you understand to be the difference between your position and the Government position? 
    I don’t quite get it in the briefs or the argument of today.
speaker="albert_j_datz" startTime="881.952" stopTime="983.220">
    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    Our position, if it please the Court, is that travel required by the statute cannot be imputed under any circumstances by the simple travel of a customer to a gambling game. 
    The government maintains that it can be imputed to the gambling game if the operator could reasonably foresee that a better would come to the game and cross state lines in doing so and they carry it further. 
    A better would do so for the specific purpose of gambling in that game. 
    Now, the reason for that limitation is this. 
    Otherwise, and we submit even if that theory is accepted, the whole expanse of the Travel Act would be broadened to the point where the FBI and the Federal Government would be in the minor police court case business. 
    Every -- this case simply was again 15 miles from Georgia because as the Fifth Circuit said, the operator should reasonably have anticipated that people would come from Georgia to play. 
    But what of the tourist resort, where people are crossing state lines all the time, Miami, Los Angeles, and New York. 
    Certainly, every hotel operator can look at his register and see people come across state lines, does the bathroom, card game come within the federal jurisdiction. 
    Does the prostitute who entertains a guest knowing that he comes from across the state line come within the federal jurisdiction? 
    The vast number of case increase would be fantastic to accept the Government’s theory under these circumstances.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="983.220" stopTime="1000.972">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is the Government’s theory that anybody who travels along the highway which happens to cross a state line and wants to go to a gambling house subject to jurisdiction of the Federal Government to try for gambling?
speaker="albert_j_datz" startTime="1000.972" stopTime="1010.986">
    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    Not the person who traveled along the highway, but the man who runs the house would be subject to federal jurisdiction, the man who runs the gambling house would then be subject to federal jurisdiction.

    I submit that it is. 
    They tried to limit it in what we submit is not a very pragmatic way and says the traveler must have traveled for the specific purpose of gambling or participating in the unlawful activity.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1028.958" stopTime="1033.279">

    Now, this attraction theory limited to the facts of this however becomes even more expansive because here, we have a game that the only -- the only attraction is the fact that it’s 15 miles from the state line.

    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    No, Your Honor because in this case there was no allegation of use of facilities in interstate commerce. 
    That was eliminated from this case. 
    The only allegation in the indictment was the travel. 
    Now, there was an allegation in the conspiracy count that a violation of Section 1953 which is carrying gambling paraphernalia but that was stricken by the trial judge because there was no evidence. 
    So, --

    Mr. Albert J. Datz

    We do not take a position one way or the other Your Honor because as indicated, there is some new legislation that Congress just passed a month or so ago which attempts to do and has a declared purpose that gambling has an effect on interstate commerce. 
    But I think it would be improper for me to try to anticipate a ruling and that is certainly going to come and that under that statute in this case here.

    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The way the statute avoids that is that it defines the “unlawful activity” as any business enterprise which is unlawful in the state where it occurs. 
    And since gambling is lawful in Nevada, this wouldn’t apply. 
    To touch very briefly, the Government seeks to analogize on the -- with the Mann Act and the language of Congress there was specifically condemning whoever would persuade, induce, entice or coerce a woman to travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution. 
    And when you compare that statute with the Travel Act, you can see that if Congress had intended the result which the Fifth Circuit reached, it could certainly easily have said so. 
    Likewise, they analogize in the -- with the mail fraud statute and say, well, the victim can supply the mailing under those circumstances but the statutes are entirely different. 
    The mailing there simply must be reasonably foreseeable in furtherance of execution of the scheme to defraud. 
    Well, all mailing to -- in furtherance to that scheme would then be proscribed by the statute but here not all travel is proscribed by the statute, only that travel, travel to promote the business enterprise.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well, it -- if -- let me just go to the facts and I think if I answer the fact, relate the facts, I think it comes a little easier to answer that question and answer in the abstract. 
    Now, the business that was operated in this case was operated in a private home of petitioner Williams. 
    It wasn’t a -- it was a private home in a small town and cluster of five private homes. 
    In other words, it -- the location was such that an interstate traveler wouldn’t just go there by happenstance. 
    A person would only be able to go to the Williams house and enter the Williams house for gambling purposes if he in fact knew gambling was going on there and if in fact, if the people knew that he was the type of person who they would let in. 
    Now, as a matter of fact, this -- there’s a little misconception in this case. 
    There wasn’t a whole group of people who went to the Williams house on the Saturday mornings in which the travel occurred. 
    There were just a small group of people who traveled each Saturday and as generally the same eight or nine people who traveled and the evidence showed that the people who traveled were repeaters. 
    In other words, the same people would come each week and some of the people -- some of the people who came, the evidence showed, they didn’t just go and buy a ticket in the Williams house, they came with a water paper and with money and the evidence shows that at least one of them put the money in their cigar box and cigar box was the place for the lottery tickets and the money were kept.

    They would stay about 15 minutes and then they would leave.

    It was really a numbers game, a numbers game, lottery in a broad sense, but specifically a numbers game. 
    Now, the evidence we submit warrants the conclusion that petitioners caused the travel of these people as we said before, you just couldn’t stumble upon this place. 
    You had to know when to come on the Saturday morning and this warrants the inference that there was prearrangement that the people came because they arranged with the operators to come.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    The indirect evidence is the location of the establishment. 
    The fact that the only -- the people who went there were habitual travelers. 
    That the people who went there were few in number or wasn’t -- just anybody couldn’t go and the fact that they came back over and over again, so you can warrant the inference that was implied invitation to come again and there’s also the fact that you had to know what time to go there. 
    In other words, the -- the people generally came on a short period of Saturday morning, had to get there before noon.

    He would take a risk. 
    He would take a risk, if he took the Georgia money, the Georgia better. 
    However, I don’t think that’s this case. 
    I think, this case, the circumstances are such to make it come within 18 U.S.C. 2 (b) which makes a -- makes it a, makes a person criminally liable when he causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him would be a federal offense. 
    In other words, 18 U.S.C. 2 (b) was added in 1948 to the criminal code to permit deletion of cause or procurer from the other criminal statutes and the reviser’s note makes clear that the purpose, the purpose of this provision was to make, remove all doubt that when a person causes the commission of an element of the offense, causes an innocent person to commit an element the offense, that constitutes a violation.

    Right. 
    In other words, the easiest illustration, the easiest illustration of how you can cause somebody to come would be a situation where there would be a direct -- suppose a narcotics case then. 
    There was a seller down in Florida and a purchaser in Georgia and they made specific arrangements for one person for the Georgia citizen to travel down to Florida. 
    There would be -- it would be clear that by the prearrangement, the seller was causing, causing the person to travel in interstate commerce. 
    The thing becomes complicated because generally -- generally, in a crime, for example, this statute makes it a crime to travel in interstate commerce to commit extortion.

    The Heart of Atlanta of course involved quite a different question.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well, it seems to us that the continuous business conducted at this establishment with awareness that people from Georgia were coming that the same people --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2665.348" stopTime="2670.247">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I would suppose that these petitioners were aware that their customers were from Georgia?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2670.247" stopTime="2706.040">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well, yes sir. 
    I would say that the proof did show that. 
    As to Mrs. Williams, she was related to one of the individuals that traveled and the other, there was another, there were two Williams in this case, and one Williams, Charlotte Williams was a close friend of her, so she was aware of that. 
    As far as Rewis is concerned, he would arrive at the place at a time when there were a lot -- when the car is parked there included Georgia cars. 
    So, --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2706.040" stopTime="2732.311">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I gather the Government doesn’t argue that (Inaudible) this petitioner was (Inaudible), because of any statement, but rather they are caught after traveling because of Section 2 provision, cause of an act which is performed by government in effect to that.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2732.311" stopTime="2765.164">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    That is correct, that is correct. 
    And under 18 U.S.C. 2, three or four Courts of Appeals have held that when an employer of a gambling operation employs individuals who live in another state and these individuals travel from say Illinois to Wisconsin that that violates the statute. 
    I would assume that that --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2765.164" stopTime="2780.899">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That had to be vague that an employee traveling for that purpose, why violates the statute and they are employees who cause that, do that travel from state to state, therefore principally under Section 2?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2780.899" stopTime="2815.807">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Yes, we would think it was under 2 (a) that he would be an aider or abater. 
    In other words, 2 (a) seems to apply to a situation where all the parties are clearly guilty of a violation whereas 2 (b) applies to the situation where the jurisdictional element or an element of the crime maybe committed -- maybe done by somebody who himself may not be guilty of an offense.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Right, the Bass case and the Zizzo case and I think the Barrow case. 
    Now, the problem of causation as I said before, when -- if you have an extortion where the extortion -- extortionist lives in one state and he extorts money from somebody in the other state and in the course of the extortion, that person travels interstate commerce or uses an interstate facility, I think it’s easy to see that the fear -- the fear induced by the extortionist causes the jurisdictional element which completes the offense.

    Well, I don’t think the evidence -- I don’t think the evidence was $75.00 a week.

    How do you hold Rewis?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3067.231" stopTime="3229.178">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    We hold Rewis under 2 -- when 18 U.S.C. 2 (b) was enacted, the revisers at least thought and this is set forth on page 12 of our brief that Section 2 (b) “removes all doubt that one who puts in motion or assist in the illegal enterprise, but causes the commission of an indispensable element of the offense by an innocent agent or instrumentality is guilty as a principal even though he intentionally refrained from the direct act constituting the completed offense. 
    In other words, even though you did everything, but one particular element but you got somebody else, to me the best case of the -- the best illustration of this case is the Kelly case which is cited in our brief. 
    And the Kelly case involved the use of telephones and the defendant there made an arrangement whereby the betters would use the telephones and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that this -- that , that violated the statute when that he causes -- caused the use of the interstate facility when the betters used the telephones. 
    Basically, to sum up, we think that just as if Rewis and Williams had advertised in Georgia or people who would come from Georgia to Florida and people who read their advertisement came to Flor -- from Georgia to Florida with a specific purpose to betting and they did so on the basis of reading this advertisement, “Come to Florida and bet,” that in such circumstances, we think Rewis and Williams would bring about or cause the travel of the better. 
    That that situation is similar to the situation here, but for, but for the conduct of Rewis and Williams in operating this lottery and making it possible for these people to come on a continuous basis to their operation, there would have been no gambling.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You have evidence that they caused them to come as I understand it. 
    It’s not the fact that they did come.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3366.632" stopTime="3397.219">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well, they did come -- they came on a regular basis. 
    They came at a particular time. 
    They could -- they came to a place where which was a private home and the only they came to a place that only somebody who was aware of the fact that this -- that you could bet, that betting was going on there, so from that point of view, we consider it all prearranged. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Albert J. Datz

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Datz, would it make any difference to your case or your position if the evidence showed they did a $100,000.00 worth the business every Saturday or a $100.00 business every Saturday?

    No sir.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The volume has nothing to do with the violation?
speaker="albert_j_datz" startTime="3410.962" stopTime="3417.213">
    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    Not under this Act. 
    Frankly, under the new Act just passed it does, but not under this act.

    Yes, to run concurrently.

    Concurrently, so any crime that is --
speaker="albert_j_datz" startTime="3430.083" stopTime="3466.920">
    Mr. Albert J. Datz 
    If any conviction is good, then it’s moot. 
    If I may point out briefly, the significant difference between the Government and our position as I see it here, is the interpretation of Section 2 (b) of Title 18. 
    Now, whoever causes another to do an act is limited. 
    Title 18, Section 2 (b) is simply an agency principal relationship. 
    You can’t create a new private John Doe who had nothing to do with this case, cause these people to travel from Georgia to Florida, he wouldn’t be committing a crime because the people themselves were not committing crimes.

    Was there any evidence from your view point from which it could be found that these people did cause these people to come to Georgia except that they came?

    No, Your Honor.

    Do you think that the fact that they came repeatedly and were known as -- has probative force?

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    I don’t believe that the record will bear that out. 
    That assumption of fact is actually of the 14 Saturdays of surveillance, the most repetition was one person came on four different Saturdays, but even if it were so, was so, then I submit, it would have no force.
