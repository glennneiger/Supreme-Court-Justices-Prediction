    Mr. George M. Scott 
    This case is unique I think in the annals of jurisprudence. 
    The question presented has never before been presented to this Court. 
    The question, does equal protection of the laws under Fourteenth Amendment mean majority rule in special elections to determine questions of public policy? 
    Put it in another way, does the 60% requirement, the extraordinary majority requirement of the constitution and enabling statutes of the state of West Virginia violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution? 
    The facts in the case are not in dispute, they're simple and they're brief. 
    In my home county, Roane County in West Virginia on April 1968, the Board of Education submitted to the people for decision, two issues. 
    The first question was whether or not to issue of a $1,800,000.00 in general obligation bond. 
    Second issue is whether or not to increase the rate of taxation for current expenditures beyond the constitutionally prescribed maximum for a period of five years. 
    On each of these issues, approximately 51.51% of the persons voting, voted in the affirmative and of course the issues failed the passage to canvas by the Board of Education because of the requisite 60% of the voters did not approve the issue. 
    Constitution of the state of West Virginia was adopted in 1872. 
    At that time the 60% requirement so far as bond indebtedness or any indebtedness extending beyond the current fiscal year was part of the constitution. 
    In 1932, the Tax Limitation Amendment was adopted which set forth maximum tax rates for each political subdivision and this limitation amendment provide that these rates could not be exceeded except by vote of the people and 60% voting in the affirmative. 
    In 1966, an amendment was presented to the people of West Virginia and the only question in that amendment was whether or not to amend and cancel the 60% requirement and substitute a simple majority requirement and the people voted by a majority to retain the 60% rule. 
    Despite this background -- in light of this background, the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of West Virginia decided at the instance of five citizens of our county, allegedly voted in the affirmative on each of these issues, that the 60% requirement, the extraordinary majority requirement was inherently discriminatory in that it diluted or debased the vote of the persons who voted yes as compared to the vote of the persons who voted no. 
    These issues --

    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice when it's submitted.

    Mr. George M. Scott 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    And we think that this -- and of course, this case doesn't present, a situation earlier was -- a discrimination based upon race or religion or wealth or place of residence or marital status or any circumstance that prevailed in any of the so-called one man, one vote cases. 
    There is I think no factual analogy between those cases and this case, and yet our court felt obliged by virtue of the language in the opinions of those cases, to hold that this 60% requirement was inherently discriminatory. 
    We think and its our submission that this is a monstrous misapplication of the one man, one vote rule and to support this submission, I have cited to the Court in my brief, articles which have appeared in Virginia Law Review and Georgetown Law Review. 
    I have also cited articles which have appeared in the Harvard Law Review, the Columbia Law Review, Houston Law Review, Vanderbilt Law Review, the West Virginia Law Review and there are others and the commentators are severely critical of this decision, I think without exception.

    Mathematically, the Court (Inaudible)
speaker="george_m_scott" startTime="400.308" stopTime="448.145">
    Mr. George M. Scott 
    Well, it's certainly beyond dispute Mr. Justice Harlan that 60 does not equal 40 and this is I think the basic error that the court fell into. 
    They treated this as a problem of arithmetic rather than a problem of definition or one of philosophy. 
    I think that –- and they reached this profound conclusion from the fact that 60 is to 40 is one-one-half is to one, but the rules of arithmetic I think must lead to an absurd result because if you say, speaking mathematically, that this provision is inherently discriminatory then mathematically speaking you have to say that a majority rule is likewise discriminatory and majority as to minority as more is to less and inherently unequal, so the rules of mathematics I think can't be used.

    Mr. George M. Scott 
    Only on the basis of comparison I think in a geographical sense and also in a all together a different context where the –- so many more people have the right to elect only one delegate as opposed fewer people in another area. 
    So mathematics does have a play there, but not in the sense that I want to present here, but it is the sense of equality. 
    It doesn't have to –- one doesn't have to equal one before there can be constitutional equality it seems to me.

    Mr. George M. Scott 
    Yes, before this decision I thought that's what the Fourteenth Amendment was all about. 
    There's one thing that I think is prevalent here, the essence I think of the Fourteenth Amendment in the voting situation is that everybody should have the equality of voting power, and I believe that the court below more or less conceded, the California Court and it's a scholarly decision, a 62-page decision, I think did concede, and I believe that my adversary here, I think we will all have to admit that whenever –- and in situation like this, when any man enters the voting booth, when all the voters first go to the poll, before the election is held, each has exactly the same opportunity, each has exactly the same power to affect the ultimate decision as every other voter. 
    Regardless of how he votes, he's got the same power to affect the outcome of the election when he goes in. 
    This wasn't the case in any of the one man one vote cases and those cases seems to me the state had told these people, regardless of how you vote, your vote as a resident of this populous county can have as much effect on the ultimate decision making process as the vote of the man who lives in the less populous rural area. 
    But here, the state has told the people you each have equal voice, you each have the equal power to affect the outcome. 
    The extraordinary majority requirement is merely a rule of decision. 
    It prescribes how many votes it takes to win, in other plurality not a majority but a 60% of the votes --

    Mr. George M. Scott 
    That's quite so Mr. Chief Justice and I think it's analogous to a mortgage of real estate. 
    It is and in fact the mortgage of property even a person is not born at that time of the election. 
    It might be so, people not yet born on property and have to pay taxes on it as minors before the bonds retire. 
    There are many reasons, many justifications I think for such a public policy of the state, but I don't think they have to get to a justification of this because I don't think it's discriminatory. 
    I think that the three-judge District Court in Missouri, I think the Supreme Court of Idaho reached the correct the conclusion that this is not discriminatory, this is –- every person stands equally before this type of provision.

    I think that's true where as here, the people have reserved to themselves certain legislative powers which they have refused to delegate to the public office, I think that's true and whether it's a 10% vote or a 90% vote, it can be prohibited entirely. 
    The state could prohibit, we could if we want to and our constitution says that under no condition shall a political subdivision borrow money. 
    If they can prohibit it entirely why can't we qualify it? 
    I think we can, so long as you treat everybody alike and I think this does, every man stands equally when they face this type of the requirement.

    Do you think that has any constitutional deficiency?

    Mr. George M. Scott 
    I think it must have in light of Clay versus Turner which this Court – it came up from South Carolina this past summer and was dismissed for lack of a substantial federal question when that argument was raised, a case which I cited in my reply brief. 
    I think it has a substantial constitutional deficiency. 
    I don't think as I said that when a person enters the polling booth that he loses, regardless of how he marks in his ballot, he loses any of the equality that he had before he went in. 
    And I think this is the basic error made in the California case, where they held and their entire 62-page opinion rested upon one thin thread when they said that it was classified voters and it was sufficient for the class to come into being at or after the election. 
    It was not necessary for there to be prospective discrimination, it was sufficient they came in to be prospectively, retrospectively there and I think that there is no such thing as a class. 
    There is not even an identifiable group if secrecy of the ballot is to be preserved. 
    I don't think you that can come in of course I suppose and say I voted yey or ney, but if the secrecy of the ballot is to be present, how could it be established we voted yes or no. 
    And I think this is the reason law is valid. 
    The law is neutral, the law is based on neutral principle that's addressed not to the voters and not to discriminate against people but against specific areas of government action. 
    It's addressed to specific questions of public policy, shall we become indebted or not. 
    It doesn't, I mean -- we didn't put the vote whether or not we're going to go ahead have them schools around the county. 
    The question was are we going to go ahead with the program that we have or were going to increase the expenditures in a certain way and every person who in the booth had a different reason for voting, either yes or no. 
    There's many reasons for voting one way as there are for reverse and if I have the time I'd like to refer briefly to the federal analogy.

    Mr. George M. Scott 
    I should certainly hope not Mr. Justice White and there is in my brief the arguments of the three-judge District Court in Missouri. 
    There is in my brief the argument that was advanced in Georgetown Law journal which does set out many reasons that could exist here to justify such a state provision. 
    There are just a couple of things about the provision. 
    I know that the in the allocation of senators, when used for college, of course necessary concessions are made at the time of the original (Inaudible) but we're dealing here with the Fourteenth Amendment and I think that if we recall that the Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains the Equal Protection Clause. 
    Our Court has said that the Equal Protection Clause forbids an extraordinary majority requirement and yet by Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, dealing with disqualification of officers specifically said, that Congress can buy two-thirds of vote and remove those disqualifications seems highly irregular to me to suggest that one Section of this amendment forbids an extraordinary majority requirement in the next section or the third section requires it. 
    And in 1967 the Twenty-fifth Amendment (Inaudible) getting down in more recent history provides for an extraordinary majority vote by Congress in determining whether or not the President does continue to disable -- not able to perform the duties in his office. 
    So, I think that -- to summarize my presentation that there's no specific language of a constitution which requires this result. 
    There is no specific holding of this Court which require this result. 
    There's no natural law or rule of reason which requires this result. 
    Our -- framework of our government is based upon a delicate balance of instances of minority veto such as we have here. 
    Bicameral legislatures, this doctrine separation of powers, doctrine of the judicial supremacy, the executive veto, all instances of minority veto and it seems to me that if majority rules, strict majority is to become the only acceptable way of political life in the state and local affairs of this nation. 
    We must recognize that we've embarked upon a new journey of uncertain duration down a new avenue of judicial activity. 
    This unique combination as I spoke of has been the very source of strength and stability of this great nation and I would regret to see it destroyed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Charles C. Wise, Jr.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1509.220" stopTime="1515.481">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you, Mr. Scott.

speaker="charles_c_wise_jr" startTime="1515.481" stopTime="1628.526">
    Mr. Charles C. Wise, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In our view, we're dealing here with a voting, an election case that of course does determine questions of whether or not bonds maybe issued or excess levies applied, but it also equally determines whether or not a school will be built for the use of students 20 years in the future as well as the issue of paying for it. 
    There is certainly no requirement to our knowledge that the West Virginia Constitution was required to submit to the voter an issue such as this. 
    But it is refreshing that it does do so on such an important matter, education and having done so it seems to us that as all roads once led to Rome, the well-established pass of the decisions of this Court and the denial of the vote cases and in the waiting and debasement and dilution cases as well as discrimination of subject matter as found in Hunter versus Erickson are applicable here because there is in effect no doubt, but that the person who because of his conviction on the issue of whether or not bond shall be issued, determined whether or not his vote is to be counted 50% more than that of another of opposite conviction.

    This Honorable Court sir ultimately and we think that within the framework of those decisions, it is almost inescapable that when we are dealing with an election on an important issue on a county-wide basis, when a citizen has so little opportunity now of direct participation in an important result that their may be more reason for applying the Fourteenth amendment to this than in the election of a representative where the citizen's interest is certainly not quite as direct --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1719.446" stopTime="1741.257">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, there's no question in fact whether or not the Fourteenth amendment applies to West Virginia, of course it applies to West Virginia. 
    There's no question about whether or not we're going to apply the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, and I don't of course say that it applies the Fourteenth Amendment to each of the 50 states. 
    The question is what does the Fourteenth Amendment require, if anything, in this area?

    I think it would be a grave error policy to make that type of requirement because we have had a Constitution for 98 years with practically no change and efforts to amend it.

    That is correct and of course as this Court pointed out in the Lucas case against the General Assembly of Colorado, the mere fact that there has been approval by the voters of an apportionment prior does not in any ways take the proposal away from the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And we think also that the Hunter against Erickson case where there was a very sophisticated method employed in depriving certain interested groups of an opportunity to get equal protection of the laws in Akron, Ohio, dealing with local housing. 
    That that is equally applicable here because those who are in favor of a proposal of the kind voted on in this case are certainly disadvantaged by reason of the 60% requirement and that is the effect of the well reasoned opinion as we say in California and also the West Virginia Supreme Court which took the invitation of this Court in the Maryland case, (Inaudible) against Maryland of attempting to apply what it understood to be the rules of this Court to that situation.

    We do have a provision for calling a constitutional convention which has not been done for 98-years when the 1972 Constitution was involved, but basically Your Honors, it is our position and we think it goes back even beyond Gray. 
    Mr. Justice Black in Colgrove against Green in 1946 in a dissenting opinion pointed out that no one would argue that if you gave the one voter one-half of the weight given to another voter, you would have an invalid situation. 
    Gray certainly makes that clear and as we see at all of the equality cases go to the point that the same weight substantially must be given to the view of each one. 
    The most invidious discrimination of all as we conceive it is a discrimination based upon the view of the outcome of an issue that a voter may have.

    Mr. Charles C. Wise, Jr. 
    But it comes about it seems to because of the provisions of the constitution dealing with the effect of legislative appropriation and the fact that in our checks and balance system of government, we give to the executive an opportunity to veto. 
    Now, whether it is wise I don't know, but as far as we're aware that has not been the subject matter of a decision here and a determination that --

    Yes sir.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2491.816" stopTime="2498.078">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    One is good, one is bad, is that your position?
speaker="charles_c_wise_jr" startTime="2498.078" stopTime="2691.042">
    Mr. Charles C. Wise, Jr. 
    We think sir that both are bad but we aren't sure that the other one is subject to the application of the Fourteenth Amendment. Certainly, the Court will not be called upon at any time to go 100% by saying that majority rule shall control every aspect of life. 
    We believe that majority rule as a rule is really involved here except in the sense that the result of applying to each voter equal weight in his vote does result of course in a -- and that there must be a majority to carry a preposition, a majority of those fully. 
    But that as we understand it doesn't evolve the application on even theoretical grounds of going to the point of destroying the traditional balance of power between the three branches of the government and that would be the last thing that we would urge here. 
    But we do say that under the Gray against Sanders and all of the cases that follow it, those that deal with local issues as being subject to the application of the Fourteenth Amendment like Avery against Midland, the cases that have recently been decided in 1969 and 1970 such as Cramer and Cipriano and Phoenix which go through a question of the issuance of bonds and the requirement for example in Cipriano that it is impermissible for Louisiana to require by legislation a 50% vote and a 50% in amount result to uphold. 
    And in the case of Phoenix as well as Cipriano of course the Court vary properly pointed out that you cannot make the voting classification on the basis of whether or not you are a real property taxpayer. 
    Well, in our view Carrington against Rash, the Erickson decision make it even more invidious if the discrimination is based upon the views that a man hold as to the outcome of an election. 
    Having granted him a right to come in to participate in an important issue, he should have the right to have his vote counted equally with that of the man who is convinced that an opposite result should come about.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2691.042" stopTime="2716.494">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I find that difficult to follow Mr. Wise and blatantly preposition that you and I seem to agree on with reference to 50%, a majority of all registered voters being required because then a man who stayed home might have a vote which would -- a non-vote which would carry more weight than a man who took the trouble to go down to the polls and vote.
speaker="charles_c_wise_jr" startTime="2716.494" stopTime="2866.786">
    Mr. Charles C. Wise, Jr. 
    That is perfectly true, but I think we are going to have to risk that and encourage them to get out and vote their conviction. 
    Philosophically there is an inconsistency there Mr. Chief Justice that we would recognize of course. 
    We also submit that if it is applicable here Mr. Justice White that there is no compelling state interest that would preclude or make it proper to permit this provision to stand. 
    Section 8 of Article 10 of our Constitution, another Section of the very article that is involved here has an absolute limit on bonded indebtedness and on excess levies. 
    In no event, even with the 60% votes in successive elections and for a period of time can you go beyond 5% of the assessed valuation. 
    Of course that constitutes the best way to prevent extravagant government. 
    As was pointed out early in connection with our provision of the Constitution involved here, the hope was expressed that this would have something to do with preventing that (Inaudible). 
    Well as a matter of fact, the 30 odd states that have no such provision in their constitutions or laws seem to be able to be just as economical and handle these matter just as effectively as the 16 or 17 which clearly do contain provisions of this kind either in their organic law or in their statute. 
    As a matter of fact, there has been a great body of sophisticated knowledge respecting bond issues and taxes that has grown up in recent years, the rating services and matters of that kind which go –– do much better job that respective legislative or constitutional provisions do in attempting to prevent the local governmental bodies from going overboard and making extravagant expenditures. 
    On that basis, we respectfully submit that the West Virginia Supreme Court correctly decided this issue as did California. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of George M. Scott
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2866.786" stopTime="2873.916">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Wise. 
    Mr. Scott, you have about five minutes left.
speaker="george_m_scott" startTime="2873.916" stopTime="3057.739">
    Mr. George M. Scott 
    May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    By way of rebuttal, I would like to respond to two of three things. 
    Mr. Wise has made the point at the last that 30 odd states that don't have this rule, don't seemed to be spendthrifts and getting alright, but I think it is also well to remember that the 20 odd states which do have, at least a great percentage of them as far as we know are getting all right in the fields of education. 
    This does not seemed to have been great hindrance to them in that area. 
    The question that Mr. Justice Black asked was very intriguing, who decides where lines are to be drawn in this case and of course I would love to argue that this is political question, non-justiciable and if there was anything left in that political non-justiciable political question in theory, I think this would be a classic example for its application. 
    I would like to remind again also that we're dealing here not with the question of minority rule, but the question of minority veto. 
    It seems to me that minority rule would be much more constitutionally impermissible than minority veto, and yet we elect the officers everyday. 
    I understand the last election, elected senators from the larger states by 39% or something like that of the votes cast. 
    We elect governors, we elect members of the legislatures and we elect -- as I recall in this of course is not in the record but the last man elected to the board of education of Roane county received less than 30% of the total vote cast in the election. 
    So they have many instances of minority rule which I think are much worst than this, and this is of course just minority veto. 
    I do not see anything wrong with protecting minorities as I said earlier, I think that is what the Fourteenth Amendment is all about. 
    Then the use of this word, wait, I think it might have caused some of the -- what I considered to be confusion on the part of lower court. 
    I am not suggesting that I could have used a better word, I am not sure that I understand what it means. 
    It does have a mathematical connotation when we should I think are dealing with philosophical definition of this word equal. 
    And I recall that the lower court quoted opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas In Gray versus Sanders in which he -- it was stated that only -- the only essence of weighting of votes sanctioned by the constitution was in the makeup of the senate and used for electoral college. 
    But they emphasized the world only, if the only essence of weighting a vote sanctioned by the constitution of those two then of course the next ordinary majority requirement wouldn't be in essence of weighting a vote because there are certainly several constitutional areas where extra ordinary majority votes are required.
