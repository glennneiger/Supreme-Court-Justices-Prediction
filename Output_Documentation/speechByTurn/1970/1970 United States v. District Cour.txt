United States v. District Court in and for the County of Eagle
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="11.274">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- in United States against District Court of Eagle County, Colorado. 
    Mr. Kiechel, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="11.274" stopTime="430.741">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case comes from the Supreme Court of Colorado and presents two questions important to the proper administration and conservation of the water resources of Colorado and nationally. 
    First, whether Congress by enacting so called McCarran Amendment codified at 43, United States Codes 666 intended to consent to a suit against the United States for adjudication of its water rights in one of 70 water districts of the State of Colorado. 
    And secondly, whether in the absence of any expressly stated intent to subject ?reserved rights of the United States? to state court adjudication. 
    such intent can be implied. 
    I plan to discuss preliminary and briefly the nature of water adjudications of the west and specifically that proceeding here involved in Colorado then address the threshold question of the application or the rule in this Court's opinion in Dugan v. Rank in 372 U.S. holding that the consent applied only to general adjudications then discussed the legislative history of the consent statute and lastly, the nature and extent of reserve water rights and the ability of the state courts of Colorado to adjudicate them. 
    Historically, water rights were judicially determined in the western states by flat Title action initiated by one or more water users. 
    The other claimants to water rights on the stream system were joined. 
    Each party affirmatively presented its claim and contested the claims of others. 
    This proceeding resulted in a determination by quantity and priority of the rights of the parties inter se say that has developed in most to the western states, statutory modification of this procedure or by the state engineer or some other official initiates the proceeding and presents the evidence in the first instance, but it instance remains the same. 
    A determination by the Court of the rights of all the parties on the Supreme System inter se say. 
    This proceeding was initiated in 1967 in the Water District 37 which at that time was one of 70 water districts of the State of Colorado. 
    These districts were established on water shed lines. 
    Water District 37, being the water shed of the Eagle River, the Eagle River being a tributary of the Colorado River. 
    This was a supplemental proceeding, there being a number of adjudications in Water District 37 over the years. 
    First one, over eight years ago and the last one as recently as in 1966, the year before the instant proceeding was initiated. 
    Now, a significant attribute of a supplemental proceeding under Colorado law is that the earliest priority decreed in such an adjudication must be later than the last priory date decreed in the preceding adjudication. 
    Or stated otherwise, all rights awarded in a new supplemental proceeding such as one before the Court are necessarily junior by operation of Colorado law to those decreed in previous adjudications. 
    This supplemental proceeding was initiated by the Colorado River Water Conservation District which adds before adjudication a decree of certain of its claimed water rights. 
    Other claimants appeared and the Conservation District sought to join the United States as a partner. 
    The United States moved to have itself dismissed, asserting among other things that this was not the type of proceeding that the Congress has consented. 
    The motion was denied by the District Court of Colorado for Eagle County and the United States sought a writ from the Supreme Court of Colorado to prohibit the District Court from asserting jurisdiction over it. 
    The Supreme Court of Colorado determined that the motion to dismiss was properly denied and rendered an extensive opinion in which have held first that Congress had intended to include the water adjudication procedure of Colorado among the suits to which it had consented. 
    Secondly, the Colorado Supreme Court held that notwithstanding this Court's interpretation of the consent statute in Dugan v. Rank that the statute permits joinder of the United States in a supplemental proceeding involving only a tributary water shed. 
    With respect to Reserved Water Rights of the United States, the Colorado Supreme Court strongly suggested that the United States had no water rights in Colorado except those arising under state law. 
    The Court said that the decisions of this Court, including Arizona v. California in 373, U.S. were not determinative. 
    Indeed, the Colorado Supreme Court said that the only decision that might be determinative of this question was one of its own and that if the Colorado Supreme Court determined that the United States has reserved rights in Colorado streams then that decision would or that determination would require the overruling of its previous decision. 
    And in that previous decision upon which the Colorado Supreme Court relies and it refers to in the course of its opinion, the Colorado Supreme Court had said that by admitting Colorado into the Union with a provision in its Constitution declaring on appropriated waters within the state to be the property of and subject to appropriation by the people of the state, that the United States lost any right to assert water rights in Colorado except those required by appropriation subject to a state law. 
    And in its ultimate holding here for review, the Colorado Supreme Court held that whatever water rights the United States has, such rights, including reserved rights, can be recognized and adequately adjudicated by the Colorado District Court.

    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    Yes Your Honor if the -- with respect to the congressional intent of the application of the consent statute, it is necessary to decide whether those rights were included within the waiver of the sovereign immunity that Congress enacted in the McCarran Amendment.

    As a matter of construction of the McCarran Amendment?

    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor and --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Some of these water rights are rights of appropriation, are they not?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="480.074" stopTime="482.144">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    Yes Mr. Justice Douglas that's quite correct.

    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    It is indeed.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Roughly what percentage every --
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="486.945" stopTime="522.217">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    I wouldn't know the percentage. 
    The record of the case shows that many of the water rights of the United States arise on national forest and those are claimed as reserved rights. 
    Others are appropriative rights by other agencies of the federal government. 
    I suppose that the great majority of the water rights claimed by the United States in Water District 37 are reserved rights.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="522.217" stopTime="531.889">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    But insofar as the statute is concerned (a) (2) would seem to explicitly cover rights obtaining by appropriation, wouldn't it?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="531.889" stopTime="542.298">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    Yes indeed. 
    That is our position that the statute was intended to cover the rights acquired under state law, that was the specification of the terms of the statute.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="542.298" stopTime="548.254">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    But I understand that you're saying that even so the state court has no jurisdiction?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="548.254" stopTime="583.095">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    We say that because with respect to rights acquired under state law, this is not a general adjudication in the terms of this Court's rule in Dugan v. Rank. 
    In that case, Your Honor please, it involved part of the San Joaquin River of California and there the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had dismissed the United States as a party, United States having been joined there under the authority of the consent statute, 43 U.S. 666.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="583.095" stopTime="586.001">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    And that's just a matter of who is necessary party?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="586.001" stopTime="639.437">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    No sir, it's -- the matter of the scope of the proceeding to which Congress consented that United States be joined. 
    The Ninth Circuit had said, I'm quoting from this Court's opinion 372, U.S. on 618, 617 pardon me, ?This Court stated that we go directly to the question of joinder of the United States as a party. 
    We agree with the Court of Appeals on this issue, and therefore, do not consider the contention at length.? 
    Now, the Court of Appeals had said that the type of suit Congress had in mind was a quasi public proceeding, known as a general adjudication of a stream system, one and which the rights of all claimants on a stream system has between themselves are ascertained and officially stated. 
    And --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="639.437" stopTime="643.498">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What's wrong with this particular proceeding under that view?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="643.498" stopTime="644.803">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    It is --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="644.803" stopTime="648.422">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think it is because it concerns only the Eagle River?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="648.422" stopTime="659.153">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    In part Your Honor; it's neither a river system or a general adjudication geographically nor is it a general adjudication with respect to having all parties before the Court.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="659.153" stopTime="665.919">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume that the Eagle River was a river system, but you don't think it is.
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="665.919" stopTime="668.253">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    Not within the contemplation of the consent statute.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="668.253" stopTime="676.548">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but even with respect to the Eagle River, do you think this is not a general adjudication?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="676.548" stopTime="723.774">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor Mr. Justice White that the reason that I say it is not a general adjudication is that not all of the parties are before the Court having rights. 
    Further more, the Colorado law which bars the assertion and decree does not just bar the assertion, but it bars the decree of any earlier rights. 
    That is the rights earlier than the supplemental proceeding precludes a general adjudication. 
    It prevents a party joined in the supplemental proceeding in 1967 from asserting its priory of 1905 as many of the rights of the United States are in this case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="723.774" stopTime="733.284">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's just put aside reserved rights. 
    Let's just talk about United States' appropriative rights in the Eagle River.
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="733.284" stopTime="734.835">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="734.835" stopTime="736.654">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Would you still take the same position?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="736.654" stopTime="755.609">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    The Supreme Court of Colorado says that their lower courts held the plenary power to accommodate the award of earlier priorities as to asserted in a supplemental procedure.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="755.609" stopTime="758.271">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In appropriative rights?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="758.271" stopTime="760.265">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    Well, they said as to both --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="760.265" stopTime="760.608">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, just put aside --
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="760.608" stopTime="839.170">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    -- but your question is addressed to appropriative rights and I am responding to it so that if the Supreme Court of Colorado is correct, but they gave no specific construction or direction to the lower court, they just said that, that the lower court can accommodate somehow and modify or re-write this provision of the Colorado law which says no priority earlier than the supplemental proceeding. 
    Then, if Water District 37 were a river system in the terms of the statute then the state acquired rights or the rights acquired under state law could be adjudicated in my opinion assuming that all parties who had rights were joined, all parties on that river system and this is not the nature of this procedure Mr. Justice White. 
    I think that outside of the Colorado conservation district, there is one of the interveners a Zinc Company and several other claimants, but certainly it's far from having before the Water District Court -- the court of Eagle County, all of the water claimants of the Eagle system.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="839.170" stopTime="855.220">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that pretty well makes a shambles out of the whole statute, doesn't it in terms of consent? 
    Can you imagine one that -- where at the outside you could guarantee that every single party known the man can't quite possibly be there? 
    If they miss one --
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="855.220" stopTime="904.125">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    That is, yes I can imagine Mr. Justice White. 
    That is the traditional adjudication, that is the way in which water rights of the west have been historically determined to have all the parties before it. 
    I say that that was the type of adjudication, the proceeding to which Congress -- that Congress had in mind and this is very clear from the senate report which is referred to in the Court's opinion in Dugan v. Rank. 
    The senate report 755, which was the report by which the Senate Judiciary Committee reported favorably to McCarran Bill and that report shows unmistakably that it was this general adjudication in which all parties were present and that was the type that the Congress had in mind in their consent.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="904.125" stopTime="912.201">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you're going also to argue that I suppose that this isn't a general adjudication because the Eagle River is just a tributary?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="912.201" stopTime="913.740">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    I do argue it Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="913.740" stopTime="921.655">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So to qualify under the statute, you have to have the entire Colorado River system?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Specially, if somebody is claiming at earlier date that to have all them too?

    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    If they are claiming rights to use water of the Colorado River or its tributaries in the state of Colorado, yes. 
    I believe that, that is within this Court's decision in Dugan v. Rank.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="964.224" stopTime="967.295">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    There wouldn't be a courtroom large enough to hold the lawyers?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="967.295" stopTime="983.015">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Justice Douglas water rights adjudications are by nature are prolonged, cumbersome and multi-party. 
    This is nothing new. 
    The Congress had this certainly in mind when they enacted consent statute.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="983.015" stopTime="1007.593">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But when some state comes along and attempts to perhaps modernize the statutes and its adjudications to make some sense out of them. 
    Don't you think Congress' consent is to end, it's consent for one single type of adjudication and that's it?
speaker="walter_kiechel_jr" startTime="1007.593" stopTime="1022.672">
    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    Well, when you use the word ?one single type,? I would agree that it is the general type, the historic type of determination judicially of water rights to which Congress was consenting.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1022.672" stopTime="1027.342">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you don't suggest that present Colorado system is unconstitutional, do you?

    Mr. Walter Kiechel, Jr. 
    I'm not making any argument ti that effect, no sir. 
    But I was answering your question as to the congressional intent and I think that not only the senate report, the discussion on the floor, all of those things with respect to the legislative history of the McCarran Amendment show that Congress had in mind the traditional type of water adjudication, have in mind state a right acquired under state law.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1057.936" stopTime="1080.223">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if the United States claiming water under state law appropriative rights and wants to assert those rights, you nevertheless say that the United States can just sit back and use the water and until and unless it wants to go into a court and establish those rights there is nothing anybody can do about it?

    No, there would be no contemplation of establishment. 
    They are by operation of the doctrine and the rule of law established by the creation of the reservation, but as far as the quantification, considerable effort has been done to an inventory and catalog of those rights and they are determined by amount and location.

    No, the proposals of Department of Justice which are reflected in the Public Land Law Review Commission report shows that an administrative determination which would be subject to judicial review, but it's not within this consent statute. 
    I would want to make one qualification of an earlier question which I do not change that they can be quantified, but there is always a certain open endness or flexibility to a reserved right because of the nature of it. 
    Inherently in that right is the need or the requirement to meet the ultimate -- to meet the purposes, to fulfill the purposes of the reservation and that by definition includes a certain flexibility and the right.

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    My client, the Colorado River Water Conservation District is an state organization by statute obligated to protect the waters of the Colorado River for the State of Colorado -- that is the waters for the Colorado River and its tributaries within the state and it was in this pursuit of this goal that I as counsel for the district in the adjudication proceedings and in Water District number 37 caused the United States of America to be served. 
    Because as is indicated they not only have substantial what I would call rights acquired under state law, but substantial rights that they denominate as reserved rights. 
    Now, this Water District number 37 encompasses the entire Eagle River and its tributaries and it's a rather substantial stream though you might say small by comparison to Colorado as a whole, nonetheless is a compact adjudication and administration unit. 
    It is incidentally included within the area that is involved in the second case number 812, the division 5 case by reason of subsequent Colorado law amendments.

    Mr. Kenneth Balcomb 
    I view the main and principle issue in this case Your Honor to be whether or not the state courts in state adjudicating -- adjudicatory procedures have jurisdiction over the United States if they comply with the service requirements of the McCarran Amendment.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1961.544" stopTime="1962.908">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Question of jurisdiction?
speaker="kenneth_balcomb" startTime="1962.908" stopTime="2001.726">
    Mr. Kenneth Balcomb 
    Yes sir, which we deem was granted by the McCarran Amendment over the United States upon compliance with that Act as to whether you have to break this out and I do not believe you do until a distinction between the classes of rights to the United States says it claims. 
    We do not believe it to be necessary because once you're over the jurisdictional problem, it looks like to me it was intent of the Act to catch all rights. 
    Otherwise, there was no point in joining the United States at all. 
    They only have to bring in part of their bucket of water, the balance of the bucket water still being hidden the whole purpose to McCarran Amendment is lost I believe.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2001.726" stopTime="2004.985">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Your claim rests on the McCarran Amendment?
speaker="kenneth_balcomb" startTime="2004.985" stopTime="2192.773">
    Mr. Kenneth Balcomb 
    Claim with jurisdiction does, yes sir. 
    I would like to touch kind of briefly in at least partial response to some of the questions asked by Mr. Justice White on just exactly what an adjudication is under the Colorado law and if I correctly understand the laws of the other involved states primarily the 17 western arid and semi-arid states, Colorado has a really somewhat difference system of the balance or had at least under the 1943 Act and that was purely judicial, without any involvement of a state officer. 
    But nonetheless it was a state sponsored or what the Pacific Live Stock case decided by this Court said was a quasi judicial proceeding sponsored with the public, quasi public. 
    At the time that the McCarran Amendment was passed, I would say, though I don't know this precisely, that of the 70 water districts referred to by counsel, probably all but two or three had already had not won the original proceeding but possibly a half a dozen others or more denominated supplementary adjudications. 
    And I just do not believe it can be possible that the Congress intended in passing this law, knowing full well at all of the states as it recognized, that long head this type of system intended to waste its times by passing an amendment which would not allow the enjoinment of the United States because the proceeding is very denominated as in this case supplemental. 
    Now, the subject matter of an adjudication proceeding is not people, it is the river itself that raises the water and it is a kind of an action in rem and it is a continuing action because its purpose is to establish, in the order priority, the rights of those persons and entities claiming the right to use water out of the particular stream involved. 
    So though you use supplementary when you start an action similar to the one that was started in Eagle County as involved here, nonetheless, it means it was in addition to a continuation of the original proceedings commenced in that county great many years before and serves as the method and the means of not only quantifying the water right, but putting it on the water rights ladder in its proper order. 
    And that is all, if I correctly read the Pacific Live Stock case that any western water adjudication proceeding does, it's established under the appropriation doctrine. 
    It attempts to establish a comprehensive, expeditious, economical scheme to provide for the fixing of water rights and their distribution and determines who is first who is last. 
    It provides all the way through it, for at least if not initially, and a final appeal to the Court to establish all these rights.

    Mr. Kenneth Balcomb 
    I would say, if Your Honor is asking me to make a strict guess out of that, I would say no. 
    I might observe that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2378.597" stopTime="2379.379">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well why not?
speaker="kenneth_balcomb" startTime="2379.379" stopTime="2573.739">
    Mr. Kenneth Balcomb 
    This problem is raised by the United States itself and not by anyone else and citing the previous Arizona versus California case to Supreme Court of Colorado, they said we have never been a part in the action. 
    The Supreme Court of Colorado says you can't -- the United States says you can't bind us until we have been properly a party and therefore the prior proceedings cannot cut off the right of the United States. 
    And as I understand the discussion of this problem by Mr. Justice Groves of the Colorado Supreme Court, he was reciting in effect the position of the parties. 
    He only really made one decision for the court and that was that Colorado Courts are capable of adjudicating the water rights of the United States just like anybody else. 
    He didn't reach the question of whether or not they could andante prior decrees, but indicated they probably could. 
    A variety of questions he mentioned in passing, but he did not necessarily reach them. 
    Now, I would like to if I could touch very briefly upon some of the cases in which in one way or the another, the United States is been involved, effecting the water rights on particular streams in particular states and whether or not they took this attitude that they are now taking in this case. 
    If I correctly understand the Washington brief and I believe that I do, Page 10 of the Washington brief in in In Re Chehalis Creek, Okanogan County is cited and it is the case to which counsel referred that it is just one of nine streams in which the State of Washington has caused United States to be joined and their names would indicate to me that they are certainly no larger or more prominent than the Eagle River, in Re Bonaparte Creek, in Harvey Creek creek, in Re Magic Creek and this got a matter and in only one of those did United States raised the question of whether or not a river system was involved, raised this before United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington and apparently lost the matter on remand. 
    The other case mentioned by counsel involves Utah, there have been several there. 
    The most principal case involving this particular section was the In Re Green River case decided by Judge Chilson. 
    The question there was whether or not the United States Federal District Court had jurisdiction to conduct the adjudication for the benefit of the United States rather than this question of a stream system being involved. 
    Now, we have kind of I believe exhaustively briefed this problem with regard to what the statute intended to cover at the time of its passage. 
    We think it very clear as has been indicated by answers to questions here that it was intended to be allowed if the United States had one appropriative right on a stream to join United States in the action. 
    Certainly as a minimum, this is what the McCarran Amendment was intended to reach.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Balcomb, I don't believe I heard either counsel as yet speak specifically of the language of the McCarran Amendment and I have in mind a language reading water rights by appropriation under state law by purchase, by exchange or otherwise. 
    I'm interested on those words or otherwise unless you tell me that they are have no significance whatsoever?
speaker="kenneth_balcomb" startTime="2606.177" stopTime="2653.175">
    Mr. Kenneth Balcomb 
    I believe at the time Your Honor that this particular Act was passed, this question about, I mean, utilization of the word ?reserved? in the connection of the water rights was not in too common parlance, not even by the government itself. 
    It had be come up only as an implied reservation in connection with Indian reservations and was not considered to be particularly serious. 
    I do think that it was the intention of the Congress in passing McCarran Amendment and utilizing it or otherwise was to avoid a long listing, it can cover such things as condemnation or right as subject and certainly was not intended by use of that word to exclude reserved rights, because I believe it intended to catch everything.

    Yes sir and they certainly did at the time in the mind of the Department of Interior witnesses who testified as well as the Department of Justice who testified and pointed out that this language that you're using is a general waiver and if we are brought into the Court, we'll have to prove up on all of our rights, our Indian rights, our military rights, things of this nature and they then did not call them reserved rights, they were specific by naming those rights. 
    And I think that the letters from justice and from Interior Department show very clearly that they were concerned that the waiver was too broad and in both letters made the suggestion that the waiver should be confined to state appropriated rights and as the committee report 755 notes, they considered this and rejected it, considering that the --

    Mr. Kenneth Balcomb 
    As I understand the legislative history Your Honor, it was a combination of apparently of circumstances, an inability in Senator McCarran's home state to properly administer a little stream called the Queen River which had some 75 rights adjudicated out of it, three of them of which the government had purchased. 
    There was the two pending cases in the United States District Court. 
    One of them which is not yet in judgment, concerning the Truckee and the Carson Rivers and the rights of the Indian for the recollection project there which apparently had involved there. 
    There was the Fallbrook cases that counsel for the government mentioned that were bothering then Senator Nixon and Senator Nolan. 
    There was a variety of these kind of things, even the Colorado senators mentioned the problem that existing in connection with the Blue River which was then pending in United States District Court for the District of Colorado.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is that it?
speaker="kenneth_balcomb" startTime="2826.337" stopTime="3050.143">
    Mr. Kenneth Balcomb 
    You'd have to have a district attorney in every county in western United States. 
    I might say -- it has been suggested of course, well, why doesn't this Court give the justice department and the other federal agencies time to make a list and put it somewhere? 
    Well, in 1952, this was part of the legislation in rejecting and they have, 18 years since then, the time this suit was really going and they haven't made a list yet until they were brought into court. 
    But when they were brought in the court as the appendix indicates, they were able to detail in particularity their uses, not only appropriative but also reserved uses within the area of the Eagle River. 
    I wanted to touch, if I might, briefly upon some 11 to 12, 13 cases, at least that we have been able to find as reported decisions that relate to or refer to this particular Section 666. 
    Counsel has mentioned the only one I believe it is been this Court for a direct decision on it, there were two count cases at the time, that's in Dugan versus Rank. 
    And I would like to call the Court's attention to the fact that every time this Court or the Circuit Court for the Ninth Circuit or for practical matter any other court has held that 666 did not confer jurisdiction, that it was not a quasi public suit that was involved. 
    It was request for declaratory relief, injunction, sometimes denominated a class action and court said in every circumstance that is not what's involved because it is not the quasi public proceeding called a general adjudication in western states. 
    And the only case the really reaches this point is the very first one on the list and that's the In Re Green River case that Judge Christensen decided in Utah. 
    And he thoroughly discusses the legislative history, finds that it was intended that United States be joined, does not concern himself with the difference in kinds of rights, but merely said, go back to the state court, they have the machinery. 
    I've noted that sometimes the adjudications in Utah, they go on for years and there is thousands of people involved and the federal court just doesn't have time to take care of this. 
    This got to go back to the state courts that has appropriate machinery. 
    I'd like to touch on another point and it is this attitude of the government today and the attitude as changed over the years of various times that brings I think monumental confusion for the other departments of the government. 
    They don't know what to do. 
    The four sets of regulations concerning what they ought to do change time and again. 
    It ends up that if United States is not held into this action. 
    There is only one kind of right that must be barred according the state law and that would be your reclamation rights by reason of Section 8. 
    I think that the principle problem is not whether or not a reserve right exists, but if it does in fact exist when -- what occasion, when it was reserved --

speaker="kenneth_balcomb" startTime="3385.909" stopTime="3408.796">
    Mr. Kenneth Balcomb 
    I think I can answer the question this way Your Honor is that about 1897, I believe that the Organic Act setup the forests and largely, they were timber reserves and there were specifically for the purpose of timber. 
    Now, I would say in that original withdraw, this was the purpose for which the water was drawn and whatever the United States could show it needed for this purpose it's be entitled to reserve.

    In 1960, I believe it was the act concerning multiple use of federal land went in when they dumped all these other things and on top of it as a purpose for the forest. 
    And it might be the court would -- a court would hold that as to some of these rights that the United States claims they would have to come and clear up to 1960.
