    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The issue raised by this appeal that a three-judge District Court sitting in Phoenix, Arizona by its decree of May 19, 1970, abused its discretion and committed error by refusing to assure a preliminary injunction to enjoin the operation of the admittedly unconstitutional reapportionment plan and the reapportionment was before the court enacted by a special session of a state legislature and signed into law on January 22, 1970. 
    As in all prior apportionment statues before it, it stubbornly clung to the idea that reapportionment should be brought about on the basis of voter registration and not on the basis of people. 
    Now, the use of voter registration as distinguished from the use of population, of people in Arizona has a particularly invidious discriminatory effect. 
    It probably would in any place because of poor people and certain minorities don’t register as much other people, as much as effluent. 
    It is particularly so in Arizona. 
    The northeastern part of the State of Arizona which is one-sixth of a very large state, contains the highest concentration of Indians of any area in the United States. 
    There are about 70,000 American Indians, Navajos and Hopis and some Apaches. 
    The average sized district, the legislative district in Arizona is 54,000 people. 
    The 70,000 people in the northeastern part, 70,000 Indians in northeastern Arizona are still under this reapportionment plan dominated by their white neighbors to the south. 
    In South Phoenix of this, a very poor area, it is mostly poor black, poor Mexican-American, poor white. 
    In the legislative district in South Phoenix and it’s just one, there are 70,000 people in an area in northeastern Phoenix, an area which all white, an area which is affluent. 
    There are 27,000 people, more than twice as many people in South Phoenix in a district as in northeastern Phoenix. 
    Now, this discrimination of course is invidious, of course it’s horrible and so we complain that Court committed error, it clearly abused its discretion by refusing to enjoin it. 
    The voter registration as the basis of the apportionment of Arizona has along history. 
    As matter of fact, it’s the only way we got the reapportion of legislature, at least the lower house, beginning with the adoption of the Arizona Constitution in 1913 which is the basis of -- which was the original statement of the apportionment arrangement. 
    The lower house, the House of Representatives is a portion with a basis of a voter registration. 
    The upper house, the State Senate was then apportioned on the basis of county representation, two members from each county. 
    Now, this suit was failed by Gary Peter Klahr, then a third year law student, in April 1964. 
    The law at that time seems quite clear. 
    This Court had seem to -- made it simple and flat and direct statement, “there should be one man, one vote.” 
    Nevertheless, the Court did not act on the complaint and did not hold hearings on it until about a-year-and-a-half, more than a-year-and-a-half later. 
    It was waiting patiently, the legislation to the job for the reason that I’m sure the Attorney General is going to say here today that the legislative should be given an opportunity to do to remedy the wrong. 
    Now, legislature more than a year after the suit was filed, enacted something called Senate Bill 11 which provided for a terribly malapportioned State Senate and it didn’t deal whatever with terribly malapportioned House of Representatives. 
    The -- after a hearing on that Bill, the Court by its decree and it was first decree issued in this case, the decree of February 22, 1966, held that the constitutional arrangement of both houses was unconstitution -- that is the Arizona Constitution arrangement was unconstitutional under U.S. Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And also that Senate Bill 11 was unconstitutional and went on to impose a Court plan what it in its decree called a temporary plan, temporary provisional plan, that was based on voter registration. 
    At least, it was based on voter registration in the urban areas of Phoenix and Tucson and outside of the counties including Phoenix and Tucson, the rural counties, a portion was based on county, 1966 counties, census of following respecting county lines. 
    Now, the malapportionment resulting from the use of this system, that is to say voter registration in the cities and respecting county lines in rural areas was gross. 
    They were -- the deviation was plus 16% to cent I believe to minus 6% and that’s just in the county areas. 
    There’s no way of computing how gross much more gross the malapportionment was under that plan in the urban areas where voter registration was used. 
    Nonetheless, this temporary provisional plan, so-called was used in 1966 and again in 1968, the legislature still having failed to act in a valid way. 
    The legislator did enact, try its hand then again in 1967 and it was declared unconstitutional and then it came back in 1969. 
    Now, the arguments, physical arguments on part of the respondent is not that the plan is in effect, the new temporary provisional plan, not that it’s constitutional. 
    It’s grossly malapportionment. 
    It’s a gross case of malapportionment. 
    The argument is that well the Court ordered that this plan be used in the elections of the November 1970, and therefore, it loses its affect, loses its sting after that. 
    And the reason that we came here to complain was the history does not show that the malapportionment plan loses its sting the day after the election and that it goes away. 
    The decree of February 22, 1966, set up a plan which was used not only in ‘66 but in ‘68 and why isn’t something done. 
    The fact is the Court can insist on sitting back and waiting for the legislature to act which is very nice and they should give them a reasonable a chance, but seven years is a far too long.

    We want to get the figures and put on a census map and get a fair apportionment plan and have the Court order it and have that become a law of the state until such time as the legislature does as good or a better job.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Then what really the issue you were telling was that the Courts waited long enough for the legislature to act.

    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    Again Mr. Chief Justice, the Court said that we may then petition to say, but the reason that we’re upset is that the Court had in April of 1970, had all the population figure, the best population figures around, had a plan before it. 
    We could have had population in the 1970’s elections. 
    We could have had a fair plan by the 1970’s and we’re not so confident now, but first of all, we’re very doubtful that malapportioned legislature is going to reapportion itself. 
    So, it is very leadership is decimated. 
    We can’t really expect that. 
    It hasn’t happen in the past and we can’t expect it again. 
    We can’t expect the court, we're not terribly optimistic about the Court fashioning proper relief. 
    When we come to our hearing in 1972, after filling a petition on November 1 and November 2, we can’t be so optimistic that the Court would then presented with another population plan is going to do anything different than it did in April of 1970.

    Well first of all – well, there’s a double-edged question. 
    First of all, there’s the time and secondly there’s the fact that the Court has not said that it would impose a plan. 
    So what we'd like is to -- for this Court to say open your doors right away and when you open the doors, if a constitutional plan is submitted to you based on population, impose it.

    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    Yes, so it’s a seven-year case now.

speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="966.774" stopTime="968.588">

    You mean the court is showing the --
speaker="philip_j_shea" startTime="968.588" stopTime="1062.609">
    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    The Courts and the legislature. 
    The courts have been too indulgent and too patient we believe with legislature. 
    We have no reason to think that the legislature is going to all of a sudden has some inner resurrection and get religion. 
    It hasn't in the past and it’s -- the legislature is malapportioned as ever. 
    It seems amazing since I have been in this, the sense of territory that legislators have, it’s like animals. 
    They belong to a sense of territory, I mean territory is the area from which they are reluctant. 
    And they’ll go kicking and screaming before they change it and that’s particularly true when you have legislatures we now have with a control by the majority party from these people that are from Northeast Phoenix, where they have 27,000 people. 
    And when they start reapportioning, half of them have to go or a good number of them have to go. 
    We can’t really quite say that legislatures -- it has been my experience in the past, they don’t just do that. 
    So we are very -- have no optimism whatever that the legislature is going to do the right thing and we don’t have any optimism that the -- that the court is going to say we’ll do it or run at large or bring us a plan so that we can do something and we’ll order it in effect. 
    So for this reason we’re seeking the order of this Court to order the three-judge court to open its doors to us right way, or to any party right away and to impose a plan in this Constitution.

    Mr. Shea, if the Court adopted a plan now based on the 1970 census figures, the Court heard you and the Court adopted your plan and put it into effect and then the legislature had a special session and adopted its own plan.

    I think that Mr. Justice White really on the basis of experience again that these nice decisions are going to be made by the legislature when the next legislature -- right after a properly, a legislature is elected on the basis of a properly apportioned plan. 
    You’re not going to have a nice constitutional plan come out of a terribly malapportioned legislature. 
    I don’t think it’s going to be before -- until after the election of 1972, that we get a legislative plan that cuts the mustard, and then only if we have reapportionment before 1972, that’s all Your Honor. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John M. McGowan, II
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1254.616" stopTime="1258.488">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Shea. 
    Mr. McGowan?
speaker="john_m_mcgowan_ii" startTime="1258.488" stopTime="1637.558">
    Mr. John M. McGowan, II 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would like to briefly review for the Court some of the history of this case. 
    As Mr. Shea properly stated, it was filed in April 1964 at -- no action was taken in the legislature because at that time this legislature was in adjournment. 
    It said we’ll not meet again until 1965 and at that time, it made some passing attempts at legislation. 
    Then, in a special session,in October 1965, it passed that -- one house passed a Bill, the Senate passed a Bill. 
    That was then before the Court in the hearings we had in November of 1965, and lest there be a feeling that the present majority was the majority then, the Senate was elected in 1964, had two republicans and 26 democrats, had 35 republicans and 45 democrats in the House. 
    That was under the old Senate before reapportionment. 
    In 1965 we had a three-day hearing before then Circuit Judge Pope, the judge Welsh and I can’t recall other justices –judge was there. 
    Then in February 1966, the decree was issued and the parties were told to agree on the two populous counties for the division of Maricopa and Pima County, an agreement was is in effect reached and the Court changed a few precincts and the agreement was reached between the major in effect the parties, I mean the political parties. 
    At that time, the plaintiff intervener was not in the action, it was between Mr. Klahr and the Governor, that time there was a democratic governor and the legislature. 
    The hearing, the decree was established the fact that we had 30 districts in the states and each senatorial district had two House Members. 
    The counties were kept together as units except in the two major counties and there they were subdivided by a formula that the Court approved. 
    That the Court in effect suggested and that was bringing the 1960 census figures up to date by ratio of the voter registration in the county to the precinct involved because in Arizona, the rapid growth patterns, if we use census tracks which if you've ever read the census tracks, they say up to a telephone poll in effect over a creek and down to an old minings --there’s no legal descriptions in the sense that we use in any other legal works and avoiding the census tracks. 
    So we used precincts in the 1966 division. 
    In the election of 1966 in the Senate, there were 16 republicans elected and 14 democrats, 33 republicans in the House and 27 democrats. 
    For the first time in history, Republican Party had a majority in ether House or both houses. 
    So I say that to you for this one reason that the present leadership of the House in Senate are the beneficiaries of reapportionment. 
    If it was not for reapportionment, they would still be in the minority, and not only do they act in good faith in an attempt to reapportion, it is to their own enlightened self-interest because they would not be there without reapportionment. 
    In 1967, there was a special session in which another attempt was made to have a legislated enacted reapportionment to replace the court decree. 
    That special session was in the Spring of -- in May of 1967. 
    At that time, the matter was referred to the people and our Constitution says that 5% of the voters may refer to the people any Bill. 
    No Bill becomes a law for 90 days. 
    So prior to its effective date, this was referred to the people by 5% of the electorate which meant it went to the ballot in 1968. 
    The people approved it in 1968, and we had a hearing in January of 1969 in which the Court struck down House Bill 1 it was called, because it did not follow -- it did use registration figures only because in the meantime, the Kirkpatrick and the Rockefeller case had come down. 
    At the time of the first decree in 1966, the Court was laboring under the thought as Mr. Frank reminded them in our hearing last Spring of a so-called Seller Amendment which was then pending in the Congress that we could have a 15% variation in figures. 
    That as -- following this Court’s decision in Kirkpatrick no longer of course is the case. 
    In the hearing we had in last April on the present plan in which they were elected, the plaintiff intervener's witness, a Mr. Cohen Pelt (ph) who were testified before the ad hoc House and Senate Committee, testified that the Senate -- that the census tracks would not be available until August of 1971, that is on page 168 of the transcript.

    Well, that is to say that the 1970 population figures by county is published in a little pamphlet that you buy for 35 cents, it doesn’t mean it's the only figures available.

    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    I’d get them from the United States Department, the Bureau, the Census in Washington, D.C.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You get attendant figures then in August, they put out a new set of figures without the reapportionment again. 
    There are only one set of figures that have any bearing on this Court to the Census Bureau that they are certified, to go and to see along, am I right?
speaker="philip_j_shea" startTime="2240.902" stopTime="2254.713">
    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    I am frankly not familiar with the process of the certification of figures.

    What you say Mr. Shea, I gather yo do not share Mr. McGowan’s optimism at all on the changes that have occurred in the legislature up to now and their likelihood to accomplish this objective in the special session which he assures us will be held. 
    You don’t share that feeling.
speaker="philip_j_shea" startTime="2277.215" stopTime="2280.862">
    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    Mr. McGowan and I are in complete disagreement on that.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why?
speaker="philip_j_shea" startTime="2282.304" stopTime="2293.394">
    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    Because my experience is that a legislature does not reapportion itself, so as to disseminate its leadership and that’s what's going to have to happen.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2293.394" stopTime="2306.115">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But the last reapportionment created a new leadership as Justice Harlan suggested, a new set of interest has come into being. 
    Do you agree with that?
speaker="philip_j_shea" startTime="2306.115" stopTime="2323.367">
    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    Yes, they did. 
    Now that those new set of figures are going to have to disappear, because they all can’t get returned if the right thing is done. 
    That’s the problem with going -- of temperizing with unconstitutional plans.

    You don’t think the polite but rather clear suggestion on the three-judge court is going to have any impact on the legislature?

    No.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    It’s true that the Court did not order that the states obviously, according to Mr. McGowan’s representation, has treated the Court’s polite suggestion as though it had done an order, a mandate?

    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    Although I take his word for, in other words, their leaders set around in a room and they say well, you know the Court said by November 1 --

    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    No, he says that they intend to act before November 1, 1971 because they regarded it some kind of a moral time limit.[Attempt to Laughter]

    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    Right, and that’s what I dispute too.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    This was certainly, I do not read this as a dilatory action, but as a representation made to this Court by responsible counsel, that these figures will be available by June perhaps, but within 60 days thereafter and that the legislature will be in a special session. 
    Do you challenge that?

    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    Well, he makes the statement in all good faith and he’s a man who is close to the leadership and I am sure he is accurately reporting what he advices them what they say they will do. 
    I have no doubt that they’ll get some figures and go into a special session though I have every doubt in the world that they are going to, as I said, decimate their leadership.

    Do you think then that it just have to be tried out again in the Court?

    Mr. Philip J. Shea 
    We’re going to go back to Court, I have no doubt about that. 
    We go back to Court, it will be 1972, and then they’ll say it’s too late to appeal again and then nine years ill pass. 
    So I think that what we'd like to do is have it straighten out now.
