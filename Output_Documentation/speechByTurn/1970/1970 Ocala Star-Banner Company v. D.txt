Ocala Star-Banner Company v. Damron

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in number 118, the Ocala Star-Banner Company against Damron. 
    Mr. Wahl, you may proceed.
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="33.488" stopTime="275.011">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen of the Court. 
    This is a right interesting libel case. 
    The trial judge actually directed a verdict for the plaintiff on compensatory damages and told the jury that the only question was how many dollars they were going to give the plaintiff on compensatory damages? 
    As to punitive damages, he told the jury that they can only give those if malice were proven and the jury brought in no punitive acts. 
    The attorney for the plaintiff was successful in urging upon the court and the Florida courts have consistently held, in this case, that the New York Times doctrine and I quote from the opinion of the District Court of Appeal on review, only applies “to official conduct of a public official.” 
    The time of this case was April 1966 at the height of the civil rights controversy in the South. 
    The locale was rural Citrus County, population 9,268 without even a daily or weekly news or semi-weekly newspaper of its own. 
    Plaintiff Damron was a small town politician and garage man. 
    He was Mayor of the Municipality of Crystal River, population 1,523 and a candidate to succeed himself. 
    He was also practically a full-time candidate for county tax assessor, politicking for that job while his brother James Damron ran his garage. 
    In the middle of the election campaign for county tax assessor, and of course, he was continuously running for re-election as mayor and was subsequently defeated. 
    The defendant Ocala Star-Banner, the daily newspaper in a nearby Marion County, ran the offending article. 
    In the article, it was stated, erroneously, that Leonard Damron rather than his brother had had a case continued which was an indictment for perjury in the federal court in the civil rights case. 
    Now, if there was anything that was of more public interest in the rural South in April 1966 than civil rights, it was an indictment for perjury of a Damron in a civil rights case. 
    Now, the article was written by a man named Myer, who just recently come to this position with the Ocala paper. 
    He had never even met the plaintiff, but he had written a number of articles about the political goings on in Crystal River where there two factions and the plaintiff was the head of one of them. 
    And when the story was phoned in to him, the reporter phoned in the correct name of James Damron, but the area editor had heard so much about and had written so much about this politician brother that throw an error, he just automatically wrote down the wrong name and that's how the name of Leonard got in rather than James. 
    Leonard then brought a suit for libel and he specifically alleged and I quote from his complaint “that he was a public officer being elected to the office of mayor of Crystal River and a candidate for the office of tax assessor of Citrus County.” 
    Then, he charged that the words of the article imputed perjury and again I quote his exact words “to the electorate of Crystal River and Citrus County.” 
    He then went on to allege that the article was published in the middle of the election campaign and cost him the election and he concluded by claiming damages to his reputation as a “public officer and candidate for public office.” 
    He didn't even alleged malice in his complaint. 
    The word malice doesn't appear in it, even though the Court did submit the issue of malice on punitive damages.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What's the significance of your position there? 
    In Florida pleading must they allege --
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="282.686" stopTime="369.592">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Malice in a libel suit, yes sir, certainly, under New York Times, you'd have to allege malice. 
    The newspaper moved to dismiss the complaint because of the failure to allege malice and moved to strike the public figure damages where he was claiming damages to him as mayor and as candidate for public office. 
    Both motions were denied. The case came on for trial and the Court, as I say, actually instructed the jury to bring in a verdict on community -- on compensatory damages, the only question being the amount of dollars. 
    Plaintiff testified that he had been defeated for county tax assessor. 
    He gave the salary of the office. 
    He further testified that he was defeated for re-election as mayor. 
    His trail witnesses repeatedly testified as to the effect that this article had had on his standing with the electorate and that that was what it cost him the election. 
    Motion for new trial and judgment non obstante veredicto was filed. 
    It expressly urged the New York Times cases, the motion was denied. 
    The Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed on the judgment on the directed verdict, holding that the New York Times doctrine only applied to “official conduct of a public official” and that this alleged libel wasn't a libel that he had done as a public official. 
    The Florida Supreme Court refused to review the case and this Court has granted certiorari.

    Mr. Wahl, the salary of the office to which your -- to which this gentleman was an aspirant was $9,000.00 a year.
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="376.680" stopTime="385.929">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    And our understanding and it's pure hearsay, is that the jury verdict was made of two-year salary, $18,000 and the extra was a little bonus, that's where the verdict came from.

    Sure --
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="393.543" stopTime="410.783">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    But the whole thrust of the case, Mr. Justice Stewart was that this article was published right in the middle of the election campaign, when it was too late for me to do anything about it. 
    I am mayor, I'm trying to continue to be mayor. 
    I'm a candidate for county tax assessor and this article is what has cost me the job. 
    Now, I can say all that, he said it.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="410.783" stopTime="418.525">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would you think a jury could reasonably find that he lost the election because of the article?
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="418.525" stopTime="419.104">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Well, it's all that he did --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="419.104" stopTime="420.642">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Setting aside all of the factors?
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="420.642" stopTime="422.804">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Yes, because there isn't any question that we made a mistake.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Could they reasonably find it?
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="424.224" stopTime="441.052">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Yes, I don't think there's -- that was his whole theory and if you erroneously accuse a man of being indicted for perjury under civil rights case, under rule of Florida in 1966, well he's goner, short of being elected to public office, there isn't any question about that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="441.052" stopTime="447.842">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Was there any evidence of injury to him in addition to or except for this public office?
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="447.842" stopTime="625.060">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Oh, yes. 
    He intermingled the two. 
    He said that he had lost business in this garage shop that his brother, the one that was indicted was running for him and then of course, he said, he felt bad and it made him feel bad with his neighbors and so forth, had been accused of this thing and that sort of thing, he brought that in. 
    But the real thrust of this case was that I have been defeated for county tax assessor and I lost my job as Mayor. 
    Now, clearly New York Times applies to a situation of this kind where the plaintiff made his own bet. 
    I didn't try the case, but the lawyer who tried the case didn't come in and say that he was a public figure. 
    The plaintiff brought his suit and specifically alleged that he was a public figure that he was the Mayor running for re-election, that it one stand, that he was the candidate for tax assessor, and that he's been damaged as a candidate and as Mayor. 
    Now, we say under those circumstances that this case should not be sent back for another trial to have more expense, but that this Court should direct a verdict for the newspaper. 
    Now, he had ample opportunity in this case to prove this malice because he was seeking a half million dollars in punitive damages in his complaint and he brought in everything he could on malice to sustain his punitive damages, so has had a chance to prove his malice. 
    The only thing that he showed on malice were three innocuous articles, written not by the man who wrote this story, but by somebody else in the past about him, one of which said, that he had walked out of council meetings and he said, well, I had differences to the council, but I had never physically walked out. 
    Another one said, he had clashes with the council. 
    He said, well, I had differences with them, but I didn't have any clashes and the other one he says gave an erroneous salary for the city attorney. 
    Now, certainly those articles were not sufficient to establish malice and that's all he has. 
    As I say, the man who wrote the article made a mistake. 
    There isn't any question. 
    The reporter phoned it in and she had the right name, but this man, the plaintiff was so much in the public eye, he was even keeping clippings in regard his own testimony of all the stories that Ocala paper read about him. 
    He was an actor on the public stage. 
    He was trying to get people to know about him. 
    He was seeking publicity and because of those public activities, because of he was seeking the public eye, this new newspaper editor who had this job about a month had heard of him and he just automatically assumed when they read the name Damron over the phone. 
    They were talking about the public figure and so he put the public figure's name in the article and wrote the article about the public figure rather than about his brother.

    As I understand it, right square in the middle of it and I agree with you that the man who wrote this story was in error. 
    He was careless. 
    He was negligent, but he certainly wasn't guilty of express malice or a calculated lie with an intent to harm. 
    He just plainly made a mistake.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="670.938" stopTime="673.585">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What did they do about it, if anything?
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="673.585" stopTime="738.480">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    The next day, the newspaper ran a retraction and said, “We're sorry. 
    We made a mistake. 
    We got the wrong man.” 
    The next day or a few days later, the plaintiff wrote a letter into the paper and again, said I am Mayor, I'm candidate for tax assessor, this has hurt me. 
    You got it wrong, I wasn't the man. 
    They published that. 
    A few days later, one of his supporters wrote a letter to the newspaper and said, you've done a grave injustice to this man. 
    He's a mayor. 
    He's candidate for tax assessor. 
    It hurt him with the electorate. 
    You're a bunch of terrible people to run this. 
    The newspaper ran that. 
    So, three times, the newspaper corrected it, but what I say is that the New York Times doctrine applies because this man made his own bad. 
    He's the man who filed a complaint and said he was a public figure. 
    He's the man who said he was hurt was made. 
    He's the man who said he was hurt as candidate for tax assessor and having made bad, he's bound by it. 
    Now, as --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="738.480" stopTime="741.668">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You mean he is bound by New York Times, that's what you mean?

    That's right.

    He's gotten in bad with the New York Times doctrines, yes sir, he can't get out --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="749.107" stopTime="752.481">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="752.481" stopTime="869.912">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Oh, no. 
    Certainly not, but I'd say that he's pleaded himself and proved himself within the New York Times doctrine. 
    Now, it's true that the story didn't say Leonard Damron, Mayor or Leonard Damron, a candidate for tax assessor. 
    It barely described him as businessman or garage man or some of that kind, but the only reason that Myer put his name in that story because Myer thought that it was a public figure, so he wrote a story about a public figure. 
    Now, Garrison makes it clear that you can't separate private reputation from public reputation. 
    And two are so intermingled here that there's no way for him to get a verdict for damage to his private reputation when he has rejected his public reputation. 
    Now, as our Former President, the Honorable Harry Trumann said, “If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.” 
    Mr. Damron instead of staying out of the kitchen of politics, he got in with all four feet. 
    He sought publicity. 
    He even kept the record of his clippings. 
    He was in one office trying to run this little town, trying to stay home. 
    He was trying to get a paying office in the county and since he is in the kitchen, he can't complain because of comments. 
    We respectfully submit that under the circumstances here, the New York Times doctrine applies because of his own allegations, and his own proof, and that we should not be put to the expense of another trial since he has had a chance to put on all of his evidences. 
    This isn't like some other case where maybe he can't get it all in. 
    He was trying to get a half million dollars in punitive damages, so he put in all the malice he had and that the Court should be directed to enter a verdict --

    Well judge, the whole theory of the case was that he lost the election, that's what all the witnesses testified. 
    That's the whole theory on which the case was tried. 
    That's what all his trial witnesses testified about. 
    He even gave the salary of the job that he lost. 
    That was the basis on which the case was tried and the whole theory of his damages as primarily as he alleged in his complaint was that he was a mayor, a candidate for re-election and that he suffered damage in that capacity.

    Mr. Wallace Dunn 
    Yes, sir. 
    I like to point out some various salient features in this case. 
    I will concur with Mr. Wahl on one thing, it is an unusual case. 
    The original complaint, and I filed the original complaint, was filed in 1966, but this case was not tried until January 1968. 
    As pointed out in my brief, just prior to the trial of this case, the trial attorney admitted liability on behalf of the defendants and we tried this case strictly on the question of damages. 
    However, in working --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Wallace Dunn

    The fact -- the only place in the record that you can -- that has a direct reference to it, sir, is the comment of the judge at the time he directed the verdict. 
    In other words --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Where do we find that in the appendix, I don't have it my --

speaker="wallace_dunn" startTime="1119.252" stopTime="1688.723">
    Mr. Wallace Dunn 
    Yes, sir. 
    I had made my application for a directed verdict at the conclusion of the evidence and the Court at the point of discussion pointed out why I think liability as to compensatory damages is admitted in this case, not proven that the word admitted was used and this is exactly what happened and that is a reason for the candor in which this was tried. 
    Now, the record goes on to show that the defense attorney made no objection to this statement. 
    He was only asking the Court to define what type of damages would be returnable by the jury and what findings the jury would have. 
    Now, in this connection, I would like to also point out that we have a very little statutory law in Florida relative to the trial of a libel action. 
    The statute in Florida only has to the -- directed to the award of punitive damages and provides that if a retraction is printed of the same size, type and general location in the newspaper, punitive damages will not be awarded and the jury was so instructed. 
    As a matter of fact, they were instructed twice as shown bu the record. 
    However, I would like to point out to the Court that there's more to this case as shown by the record, although we did try it on the question of damages only and I refer the Court to page 75 of the appendix, relative to the testimony of Mr. Fred Myer who was the area editor and in his testimony starting about a half way down the page, in answer to a question, “now, at the best of your recollection now what word did she actually used when she called in. 
    Mr. Myer, “Oh, the only word I caught was Damron and I automatically put on Leonard.” 
    “Why did you do that?” 
    “He was the only Damron I knew. 
    It was probably a minimal abrasion. 
    I just assumed that it was Leonard Damron. 
    I didn't hear Leonard on the phone. 
    I can't swear that I did. 
    I just heard the word Damron.” 
    And the next to the last question on the page and in his capacity as mayor of Crystal River, he had been writing articles about Leonard Damron. 
    We turn over to page 76 and here's where the unusual part of this case begins. 
    Starting on the middle of the page, question, “Well, tell me Mr. Myer, having written as many stories about Mr. Leonard Damron,” this is on cross examination incidentally, “weren't you aware that Mr. Damron was in Crystal River?” 
    Answer, “Yes.” 
    “Mr. Myer, would you look at the dateline on the story which was published in error and answer me what is the dateline in that particular story?” 
    Answer, “Inglis.” 
    Next question, “You had a mental aberration?” 
    Question, “A man, you have been writing stories about in Crystal River, Florida and you suddenly give a story about him in Inglis, Florida and you make this change without checking. What happened?” 
    “It so happened I did” and his next statement was “You'd spend 37 years in the newspaper business.” 
    I refer the Court now to page 70 of the appendix, which is the testimony of Ms. Lucy Weir who was the reporter who called in the story. 
    On page 70, she reads into the record the first story that was printed about James Damron in January of 1966 which is substantially correct. 
    Starting on page 72, that story incidentally is reprinted in part as appendix as on 85, it was attached. 
    Now, here's where the -- we really get to the reckless disregard and the malice in this case. 
    On page 72, second question. 
    This has been received in evidence as defendant's exhibit number three referring to the prior story. 
    Now, what procedure, talking to Lucy Weir, “what procedure do you follow in writing a story and transmitting it to the Star-Banner, Ms. Weir?” 
    Answer, “Well, I use one of two procedures. 
    If the story is not of particular news interest, I generally type it and mail it in since the mail service is one day. 
    If the story is of a particular news value, I'll phone it in early in the morning.” Question, “Alright, what procedure did you follow in transmitting the particular story, “Damron cased passed over in next U.S. term,” this is the article sued upon. 
    “What procedure did you follow in transmitting that story to the Star-Banner for publication?” 
    Answer, “I typed it first at home. 
    I read it over the phone the following morning, the same morning to Mr. Myer.” Next question, “And what is this? 
    What is the story?” 
    Answer, “The story is essentially the one that I called in, the only change being that the city was changed,” referring to the dateline Gainesville where the federal court was sitting. 
    And she fills on to state, “When I phoned in that morning, I had a Gainesville dateline which was where the action had occurred. 
    I was informed that our editor had given instructions that any story appearing on this page was an area page and should have and coming out of the area concerning the area of people, should have a dateline of the city that the people were concerned with because people read datelines rather than the text of the story. 
    Question, “Who did you telephoned it to?” 
    Answer, “Fred Myer.” 
    Now, it doesn't take a great deal of logic for a man to understand when Fred Myers said he had a mental aberration that this was not a true statement. 
    The details shown in Lucy Weir a discussion of how that story went to the newspaper. 
    First of all, this was actually a reprint of a prior story. 
    The standing of the prior story is shown by the make up in the appendix on pages 84 and 85 for comparison. 
    On 85 is a first story, on 84 is a story complained of. 
    We go back to Lucy Weir, she says that she found out about this story, typed it up that night and for some reason, unexplained, she called it in the next day. 
    But in her conversation, we got -- they got into a big discussion about the dateline, a story being changed from Gainesville admittedly by Mr. Myer that this city was changed from Gainesville to Inglis. 
    He had written many stories about the plaintiff who lived in Crystal River, was the mayor of Crystal River and he knew was in Crystal River. 
    As I say, this whole text of this testimony shows conclusively when you refer back to the testimony of the plaintiff on page 30 of the appendix, down at the bottom of the page, this was a testimony of the plaintiff put on in chief. 
    “Mr. Damron, have you ever had in the case, called Ocala Star-Banner regarding this news publication?” 
    Answer, “Yes, I've called the Ocala Star-Banner.” 
    Question, “When did you call them?” 
    Answer, “Back somewhere in 1965, I believe it was about October, if I am not mistaken.” 
    Question, “Who did you talk with?” 
    Answer, “I talked to Mr. Louis Phillips.” 
    Question, “Do you know who Mr. Phillips is?” 
    Answer, “Yes sir.” 
    Question, “Or was at that time?” 
    Answer, “Yes, sir. 
    He was the vice president publisher and that's the one I asked to speak to and I asked to speak to the general manager, Mr. Dunn, and they got me on the phone and got him on the phone.” 
    Question, “What was the substance of your conversation with Mr. Phillips?” 
    Answer, “I asked him to send someone to Crystal River to publish a news as it happened, true facts and not editorial on the subject they write on.” 
    Question, “What prompted you to call the Ocala Star-Banner?” 
    Answer, “So, many mistakes in the paper.” 
    The newspaper publisher had been informed that his publications were coming out erroneously. 
    This is the -- this as I see is a classic case. 
    Based on the evidence in the record, we have to go no further than to that, to show that it was malice in the publication of this story timely in the middle of an election, unlike a story which the evidence also shows was at the passing over part occurred 13 days before the news story was broken. 
    It was a re-publication of a prior composition of the same newspaper, published timely right in the middle of an election.

    Yes, sir. 
    The jury then and as pointed out earlier also Chief Justice Burger, we have this Florida statute that prohibits the award of punitive damages unless if the publication has been retracted and the jury made this determination that it was properly retracted.

    Mr. Wallace Dunn 
    That's what I was trying to explain sir. 
    At the time this case went to the District Court, the only point that was urged on the District Court was New York Times versus Sullivan.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But if the New York Times issue was out of the case because they admitted, they had admitted their liability, now why would they -- why would the Florida Court even deal with the issue?

    Mr. Wallace Dunn 
    Your Honor, I mean Mr. Justice White, I'm sorry I cannot read into the minds of why the judge wrote that opinion they did, but it's obvious because the way in which they went over the directed verdict aspect of it, they didn't even get consideration --

    The format of the art -- of discussion with the Court at this particular point was whether the Court was going to tell the jury and I believe this is what Mr. Aires was after.

    I still am being puzzled by the acts of the Florida Court of Appeals. 
    It seems to me that if the Florida Court read the record and certainly it should be authoritative on how to read that record for purposes of the Florida law. 
    If Florida court had read the record as indicating that the newspaper had admitted liability in the sense that New York Times applies but we have published maliciously. 
    Why would the Florida Court ever have affirmed on the basis, not on that basis, but on the basis of the New York Times rules has no relevance to this case?

    Mr. Wallace Dunn 
    The reason the position wasn't taken, we went out in the left field of a ball park about that time and got off on New York Times versus Sullivan and it was at foreign language to me at that time and I was taking the position at that time that he was trying to say, yes, maybe we admitted liability, but we feel that these are the keys as governs, that's attack it to him. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Harold B. Wahl
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="2553.072" stopTime="2565.721">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    May it please the Court. 
    I wasn't in the trial of this case and I'm in the same position that you gentlemen are. 
    I have to rely on the record and the record absolutely shows that there was no concession of liability. 
    Now, to answer your question --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2565.721" stopTime="2576.499">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What do you say that Mr. Aires meant when he said at page 5 of the opposition to cert, he still has to prove his damages?
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="2576.499" stopTime="2580.903">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    That's because the Court had ruled against us. 
    Now, as I gather what happened, Mr. --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2580.903" stopTime="2590.393">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Did he say, when the Court -- when the Court announced, I think liability is admitted in this case, did he say anything?
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="2590.393" stopTime="2624.790">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    I don't know what he said. 
    The record, we have a small town court reporter and I don't know how accurate his reports are. 
    All I knew is what may have said as told me that he didn't concede any liability, but I can't tell you why he didn't raise it on the District Court of Appeals. 
    In the District Court of Appeal, I had Mr. Aires with me and Mr. Aires was there to stand up and defend himself, had there been any accusation that he had waived. 
    Mr. Aires participated in the appeal to the District Court of Appeals, signed brief and was in on that appeal and he could have defended himself, had there been any charge.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2624.790" stopTime="2633.159">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, are you suggesting that the Florida -- an appellate court in Florida would have taken some testimony on the subject at that stage of proceeding?
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="2633.159" stopTime="2635.770">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Well, it wasn't raised. 
    Now, let me --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2635.770" stopTime="2638.290">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Wouldn't the Court rely on the record?
speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="2638.290" stopTime="2715.175">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    And that nobody ever suggested to the District Court of Appeals that this point had been raised and it haven't been raised, I mean, it had not been waived as the record itself would show. 
    Why on earth would the Court look at page 17 of the appendix, look at the order. 
    When I got into the case that moved for a new trial or judgment non obstante veredicto on New York Times, read the paragraph two. 
    The Court specifically says, the decisions of United States Supreme Court and so forth relating to public officials or public figures in the official conduct of their position or office are not applicable to this cause of action and so forth. 
    Now, why would the judge have entered that. 
    He would have simply have said well your motion for new trial is denied because your trial counsel admitted liability and then when it gets over to the District Court of Appeals as Mr. Justice White says, why would the whole opinion have been on the basis that we agree with the trial court that New York Times has nothing to do with the case if trial counsel had admitted liability. 
    It's just something I don't blame my friend for bringing it up but it is unsupported by the record and all I can tell you is that, the more you tried the case, though he didn't concede liability.

    That's all there is to it, isn't it.

    That's correct.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2744.023" stopTime="2752.529">

    Were it not for the holdings of this Court as exemplified by Beckley, it doesn't make any difference to how bad a man's prior counsel makes of the case, Beckley versus Hanks.

    Beckley versus Hanks which is cited in our brief.

speaker="harold_b_wahl" startTime="2903.960" stopTime="2917.460">
    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    I don't think so because the issue wasn't raised then in the first place and I don't think you can go back. 
    I would certainly argue strenuously, I'm sure the Court would agree with me that he can't come up here and then go back and say, “Well, now I forgot to raise something here and now I want to raise it,” I don't think so.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2917.460" stopTime="2923.122">

    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    It was raised in the trial court and when I came in to the case and the first thing I did was to file a motion and under Florida procedure at that time, you can raise these points and filed a motion and not only had a motion, but cited the cases by name. 
    That --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2938.540" stopTime="2940.817">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Harold B. Wahl 
    Yes, I certainly do. 
    And there's no intimation and the Florida appellate courts felt that wasn't correct and the District Court of Appeals assumed that the issue was -- had to be properly preserved and wrote its entire opinion upon the one issue where they erroneously said that, official conduct of a public official was not involved, therefore, New York Times doesn't apply. 
    But I'm rather surprised what you gentlemen said about Beckley because you held in Beckley versus Hanks; In that case, the newspaper lawyers themselves had requested the own instructions. 
    And you said that these constitutional issues were of such importance that even though they haven't raised the issues, since they had in a motion for new trial raised the question as to whether suspicion in evidence was there that you would pass upon the question. 
    And here, I filed a motion for a new trial and went at all these issues and cited the cases and I wasn't at the trial but I say that this --

    Well, he says that the people didn't treat him as nice as they used to. 
    They kind of looked down at him when he passed by, and that he wasn't feeling so good anymore, and he'd lost some campaign contributions, and people said a man like that shouldn't run for office, that's all and the fact that he claimed that he lost some business in his garage that was run by the fellow who was indicted. 
    But New York Times, my own surmise to what happened is, is that trial counsel was not down so hard when he filed his motions to strike the New York Times damages as a public figure and moved to dismiss for one of malice. 
    He was thrown down so hard then that he didn't want to antagonize the judge and prejudice himself with the jury by raising more stuff before the jury or at the trial on which he was going to get nothing down again. 
    That's just mu own speculation as to why my friend Aires didn't say more, but this record does not support a concession of liabilities.

    The trial counsel was so concerned with the punitive damage issue, he did and the fact there was no question that we did run the article, that we did run the mistake, that there had to be a concession that we had run the article and that we had made a mistake.
