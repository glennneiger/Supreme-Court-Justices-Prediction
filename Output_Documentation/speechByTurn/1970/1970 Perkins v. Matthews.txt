    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Acts of 1965 of a three-judge court in the Southern District of Mississippi, a fourth such appeal in three terms of court. 
    First three having decided by this Court, reversing the lower court in the case of Allen versus State Board of Elections. 
    I believe the question on the merits here is quite simple and I plan to devote about a small portion of the argument in demonstrating the court below was wrong on all three of the questions that it faced. 
    The vital question in this case is a question for relief and that question goes to the heart of whether Section 5 of the Voting Rights Acts of 1965 is to be permitted to occupy the critical place that Congress intended for it in 1965 and reaffirmed in the strongest possible terms when it extended the Act in 1970. 
    To advert very briefly to the facts, the City of Canton in Mississippi for its municipal elections in 1969 adopted three changes from the procedure that it had governed the prior municipal election in 1965. 
    They went from individual board elections to at large elections in a town in which there are two wards that are very heavily black. 
    They moved the polling places, in one case from the town square to an old jail and in another case from the middle of the black neighborhood and heavily black ward to a point just adjacent to a newly annexed white neighborhood, and third, they extended the boundaries of the town in such a way as to add several hundred net additional white residents, that is several hundred more white residents than black residents.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Which are the black wards?
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="129.401" stopTime="211.036">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    wards, Mr. Justice Blackmun, are 3 and 4 and my brief gives, I believe the record too gives the registration figures for all the wards. 
    All these changes are familiar ones. 
    They are all changes of the type that had been submitted by other jurisdictions to the Attorney General as can be shown by looking at page 309 of the house hearings. 
    They are all changes of the type that Congress mentioned many, many times in the debates in 1969 and 1970 on the extension. 
    The best example of that is perhaps Congressman McCulloch who was perhaps the leading minority member in the House, involved both in the 1965 Act and 1970 extension. 
    He was in each of these three kinds of changes as types they were covered by the voting by Section 5. 
    Judge Nixon, the single judge, on the basis of the boundary extension alone granted an injunction against having the election. 
    The case then went forward and was decided by the three-judge court which held without quite saying ever, without saying actually that any of these changes that was not covered by Section 5, it went into the motives of the changes which this Court has conclusively held are to be decided only by the Attorney General or by the District of Columbia Court and pronounced these changes did not violate Section 5.

    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    Yes, of course we do. 
    What I am saying, however is that, that is not a question to be decided in this case. 
    This Court in the Allen case made it clear and I think Justice Harlan asked that precise question there that that is not a question we have to decide now or have to prove. 
    All we have to prove is, if there was a change and there is an adequate procedure set up by Section 5 to determine what the good faith or lack thereof was.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="239.700" stopTime="251.048">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But if it has the effect and that has the effect of altering these lines invidiously in these balances, then you don't ever get to the question of motive, or you don't need to, is that right?
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="251.048" stopTime="283.349">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    That's right. 
    In fact, it doesn't even have to alter these lines invidiously. 
    All it has to do is alter these lines and at that point Congress says that is a matter that you cannot take up any place, but with the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
    That ends the matter in a Section 5 case. 
    The court below had only to decide as Judge Nixon said when he granted the temporary restraining order, I have to decide, was there a change? 
    The answer is, yes. 
    Was it submitted? 
    The answer is, no. 
    At that point the matter is taken out of my hands and the election cannot go forward on this basis.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="283.349" stopTime="289.793">

    What I meant by using the term invidiously is that the question never arises anywhere unless someone thinks it is an invidious --

    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    Certainly, we wouldn't be suing on meaningless cases.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="293.450" stopTime="299.396">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    If I am correct in my assumption, the three-judge court did not cite Allen?
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="299.396" stopTime="370.207">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    I believe they did not cite. 
    They were certainly aware of it, it in fact having come from -- well three of those cases having come from that same court. 
    So I say that the merits are easy question. 
    The vital question is what is the relief to be given in this case, and on a very simple plain, that is an easy question too. 
    The very simple plain says there must be a new election, and we maintain there must be a new election and that there can't be any question about that. 
    The law is clear in election cases, in the cases such as Hamer versus Campbell in the Fifth Circuit, United States versus Barbara County, a case in the District Court. 
    Cases such as Hadnott versus Amos for that example, that if you assert you remedies in timely fashion in a voting case, particularly, in a Fifteenth Amendment case, but certainly equally well in a Fourteenth Amendment case such as a property tax cases or more recently apportionment cases, then if it develops after the election has being held -- that you didn't get the relief and election is held. 
    If it develops thereafter that you are entitled to have an injunction, that you are entitled to have the election set aside. 
    I think this court --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="370.207" stopTime="373.693">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Have we done that in reapportionment cases?
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="373.693" stopTime="382.365">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    I am not certain that this Court has done that. 
    This Court has certainly indicated that could be done and lower courts have done it. 
    I know that Fifth Circuit has done it in the case coming from Monroe County, Mississippi.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="382.365" stopTime="384.463">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, this Court has refused to act on it.
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="384.463" stopTime="452.709">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    This Court has refused to do it. 
    In Allen, if you are talking about this case, this Court said specifically that these Section 5 question, coverage questions involve complex issues of first impression. 
    Issues subject to rationale disagreement. 
    The state enactments were not so clearly subject to Section 5 and so forth. 
    Therefore, we give only prospective affect to our decision. 
    I think that was a clear indication as clear -- perhaps as clear as the indication as the explicit language in the tax cases that thenceforward, jurisdiction would have been on notice that if they didn't submit the proper remedy was a new election. 
    And that is a traditional, as I say, basically it's come to be a traditional equitable remedy in election cases and I think that the ordinary rule there would be that there should a new election unless there are special circumstances. 
    There were special circumstances in Allen as they are often are when a court, and this court especially decides a case involving a whole new body of law. 
    There are no special circumstances in this case and there is no reason that the City of Canton has advanced or could advance for why it should not be governed by the general rule.

    What are the terms for beyond the case?
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="455.057" stopTime="474.091">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    The terms are four years. 
    They were to have begun in July of 1969. 
    They will close in July of 1973. 
    The election in this case did take place in October, the primaries and the general election in October, 1969. 
    The basic question, and this is the --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="474.091" stopTime="489.343">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now how can you, just as a practical matter how can you have, if you had an election, how can you compel these people who have refused to have their property used as a polling places, to have their property used as polling places? 
    That's private property.
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="489.343" stopTime="490.693">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    As to that particular --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="490.693" stopTime="492.433">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Particularly, the property of bank I think was --
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="492.433" stopTime="534.257">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    Right, but a couple of them were public places. 
    I think two of them -- at least one of them was in a court house and the other one was also the public place. 
    I certainly admit that there would in some cases have to be an impossibility exception indicating that there might have be a change and if that was so, if the city could come forward and show that it was totally impossible, not simply impractical or inadvisable, but impossible to hold an election in a certain place or impossible to do a certain thing, then they could submit that to the Attorney General, get a quick approval and put that change into effect. 
    I would limit that to the very barest minimum in impossibility cases.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="534.257" stopTime="559.042">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, now you have three -- there are three factors here about which you complaint. 
    One is the changing of the polling places. 
    The other one is changing to an at-large election of the ward, who had previously been elected by wards, and the third is the annexation of a territory and its people to the city and then the new election, these people have been annexed to the city without be allowed to vote?
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="559.042" stopTime="564.320">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    That's precisely the difficult question facing this Court and that's precisely the answer I give, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="564.320" stopTime="565.440">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They would not be allowed to vote?
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="565.440" stopTime="587.346">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    Not be allowed to vote. 
    In other words, we say that the new election must take place immediately or within 30 or 60 days. 
    Only as much time as is required to prepare ballots and do the things that are necessary for a election, get out notice and so forth and that election must be conducted under the rules that applied at -- under the valid rules that applied at the time the election should have taken place.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="587.346" stopTime="595.055">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And with respect to the second one I mentioned there should be at-large -- there should be a ward election, even though that violates the state law?
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="595.055" stopTime="617.417">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    That is correct, and if I may just take a few moments, I will explain precisely why I take that position. 
    The short answer, why that position must be taken is if any other position is taken, there will be no Section 5 in the Act. 
    Section 5 will have become almost totally meaningless. 
    The only change it will have resulted in is a significant change, yes, shifting the burden of proof in some of this cases.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="617.417" stopTime="621.058">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well it'd be at least as good as a declaratory judgment, wouldn't it?
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="621.058" stopTime="987.084">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    At least as good and no better and the declaratory judgment doesn't give us a new election. 
    Quite frankly, I think in this case what we have is the advantage of a Congress that in 1969 and 1970 debated extensively, several 100 pages of a congressional record and at least 1200 to 1500 pages of hearings of reports, what should happen to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
    I think it's a fair statement, that the bulk of that debate aside from question such -- involving new question such as the general banning of the literacy test and the 18-year old vote and the residence and absentee provision, the bulk of the argument dealt with Section 5 and the debate is replete with discussion over the importance of Section 5. 
    Basically the history is quite clear, a Bill was introduced which I believe the record would show had administration backing, the justice department testified for it, a Bill was introduced which would have abolished the pre-clearance procedures of Section 5. 
    This Bill was supported in critical testimony by the Attorney General and especially by Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Norman. 
    In his testimony, it appears at pages 500 and following of the senate hearings. 
    At those hearings, both the Attorney General and Mr. Norman testified explicitly that section -- that there was no need for Section 5 because in fact all Section 5 did was to provide the following remedy. 
    This is explicitly stated by Mr. Norman, Section 5 provides only the remedy that if you win a Section 5 case, then the jurisdiction that didn't submit the matter to the Attorney General or the District of Columbia Court must then submit it. 
    I think the congressional debates and the outcome of what happened in Congress is as clear reputation of that position as is possible to take. 
    And if I might just, at this point discuss very briefly the legislative history, and I might say that much of this is not specifically cited in the brief. 
    There were numerous statements in Congress dealing with the importance of Section 5. 
    There was no report from the Senate Judiciary Committee or from any Subcommittee because the Bill had been submitted, the extension Bill had been submitted under rule requiring a report or requiring to be reported out by April 1st, there was no time for a report. 
    There was however a joint statement signed by ten senators who constituted the majority of the 17. 
    This report is in the congressional record and is at pages 2756 and following. 
    It's a monthly report, discusses Section 5 in great detail and has three italicized sentences throughout the whole report, each of which italicized sentences refers to Section 5. 
    As an example, this section, it's on page 2756, this section in effect freezes election procedures in the covered areas unless the changes can be shown to be non-discriminatory. 
    There were other even more explicit statements representative Corman (ph) in discussing the differences between the two Bills said, the key point is whether or not federal power can effectively stop the states from changing their voting laws for discriminatory purposes, that is the only issue. 
    Best of all Congressman McCulloch, put it in a nutshell what the importance of the Section 5 was and how it had to work. 
    There was a lot of discussion about whether there had been a great deal of compliance or a small degree of compliance. 
    There had been at that time some 400 enactments or changes submitted to the Justice department. 
    Congressman McCulloch said, it's on page 12136, the pre-clearance procedure, and this is critical, serves psychologically to control the proliferation of discriminatory laws and practices because each change must first be federally reviewed. 
    Thus, Section 5 serves to prevent discrimination before it starts. 
    That psychological effect, the idea of creating an incentive to jurisdictions to comply was repeatedly stated, Senator Kennedy said it, Congressman Ryan said it, Senator Bayh said it, Senator Tydings said it. 
    If the court wishes, I can supply these citations, but it is combed through the hearings and combed through the debates on the floor. 
    I submit that there is no conceivable way to carry out that affect, that is to create that incentive and to make it strong, unless Section 5 carries an advantage for obeying it and a disadvantage for disobeying it. 
    And I think its clear and Congress, I think certainly meant this to be the case that if all you do when you lose a case is go submit it to the Attorney General, you have not suffered a disadvantage and there is no conceivable incentive created to submit laws in the future. 
    It's clear that in this situation Congress meant Section 5 to be as effective as possible. 
    Senator Hart made it very plain. 
    He said, “We don't have enough successes around here to be wasteful of them. 
    Condition of this country argues very strong that we manage to develop an instrument effective to enable us to deliver on promises of long standing, we had better not dilute it.” 
    The question of the remedy is inseparable from the question of the meaning of the statute. 
    Congress meant Section 5 to carry with it a remedy that would make the hopes of Congress in passing Section 5 fully effective. 
    The only possible remedy is a remedy that says, “If you do not submit, you do not have a valid law.”

    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    No, as Your Honor, has made quite claim in two previous decisions, it applies to the states covered under the formula which happened to include your state, I am afraid. 
    I would like to refer specifically to the colloquy between Mr. Norman and Senator Bayh in the senate hearings. 
    The critical portion is at page 520 of the senate hearings.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1393.199" stopTime="1394.551">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You haven't quoted this in the brief?
speaker="armand_derfner" startTime="1394.551" stopTime="1560.522">
    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    This is not in the brief, I am afraid. 
    And basically Mr. Norman at that point was saying -- had just said, “All you win, if you win a Section 5 case is that the city or state or what have you has to go submit the law to the Attorney General.” 
    Senator Bayh said -- he was talking about, “It is an easy case to prove, it would be a more difficult case to prove actual discrimination.” 
    Mr. Norman says, “In the example that you gave, if indeed a court would enter an order based on my proof that we objected, that is objected to the enactment, that is all the proof that would be put in, that would be an easier burden of proof than proving discrimination, that is correct, but I do not think a court would do that." 
    There I think it is clear that Mr. Normal is talking about a court not being willing to give any relief beyond requiring submission. 
    Senator Bayh says, “Is it necessary for me to read the words of Section 5 to take issue with our distinguished witness as to whether the court would be violating the words on the intent of Section 5 if it held the courts that you suggested.” 
    Mr. Norman said, “No, if we went to court and filed the paper and said we objected to this, they threaten to use it anyway, please enjoy them using it. 
    It is not inconceivable to me that a court would say, that was right, why did you object? 
    What was wrong with it?” 
    Talking about requiring this thing to be submitted. 
    Senator Bayh says, “But the law says whether the court makes the inquiry or not, if that ruling or regulation or change has not been submitted to you on its face, it is invalid.” 
    Now, that is what it says right here in the words of Section 5, I won't bother to prolong the hearing by reading that, but that is what it says. 
    I think the position -- the lines are quite clearly drawn, they were quite clearly drawn in the debates over -- overextending the act. 
    The Justice department took the position that the only relief to be allowed was requiring submission. 
    The senate and the house quite clearly understood that, that would gut the act and they quite clearly rejected that position. 
    Now, I think it takes no great difficulty to see that if the only relief to be gained is requiring submission to the Attorney General, if the only thing that the appellants in this case can gain by spending $3000 or $4000 and how many hours on a lawsuit is when they win two years later to have the city submit its changes, there aren't going to be any private suits. 
    Justice Coleman has already indicated there aren't going to be any Justice department suits for simple violation of Section 5. 
    I think Congress recognized all of those things. 
    I might add there were a number of other references in the debates, references to the Hadnott versus Amos case and to a more recent case filed by the Justice department called United States against Democratic Executive Committee of Wilcox County in which --

    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    Not, but it did hit the -- it did say that diluting a person's vote or effecting the strength of his vote is covered by changing in that case from ward to at-large or beat to at-large. 
    There is -- it seems to me clear for example that drawing in the boundaries to cut out black votes would be covered and I think the Allen case very readily reads and has been so construed by both Congress and the administrators to mean that if you add X number of white voters and therefore dilute the effectiveness of any given voter, especially black voter who is already in the city that you have affected his right to vote and you have denied his right to vote under Section 5, within the meaning of Section 5.

    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    I think you should take the figures that can be gained from the record and the exhibits at the very back of the appendix show how many people were actually counted there by the city's enumerator. 
    They had a man go out Mr. Smith, who was a witness at the trial. 
    Go out and count houses and count people, and based on that, you can figure out exactly how many people were there. 
    District Court made it quite clear it was talking about how many people had been brought in at the time of annexation, not how many people would be affected at the time of the election. 
    I think the time of the election is the critical part.

    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    The general margin in the general election was some 800 votes for most of the offices. 
    It was somewhat less than that in the primary elections. 
    If you take together the annexations and the moving of the polling places and I think by the way if you take a look at the turn out in ward three, you will see that it's significantly below than the turn out in the other wards, ward four is also below. 
    If you take the moving of the polling place plus the annexations, I think you will find that there is enough of a probability that a change would have taken place, so that this Court should -- so that a new election would be fair, would be equitable, because we're not talking about a situation in which a change in the results was a (Inaudible) talking about and remember that in some cases as in Bell against Southwell, you do not need any effect on the results. 
    We are talking though about a situation in which the results could well have been changed.

    Justice Byron R. White

    Frankly, Your Honor, if -- when I had been here in Allen and when Mr. McIlwaine had been here in Allen, if we had thought that's -- that the court meant that to apply beyond the Allen case, we would not have brought anymore Section 5 cases, and there wouldn't be anymore Section 5.

    We are here to defend the actions of the city of Canton which are under attack by the appellants and that attack is three-fold; first upon the annexation, second upon on the polling place changes and third upon the elections at large. 
    Now to clarify a question that Mr. Justice White asked about the net change in the number of potential voters because of the annexations, perhaps we were narrow, but it was my understanding that three-judge court said as not only the trier of the fact, but to make the decisions in regard to the law, at the hearing in the lower court. 
    That court found that there was a net gain of 94 potential white voters and found that as a fact.

    Mr. Robert L. Goza 
    Yes, we have -- there are other two factors which, of course, they contend did effect the election, we contend did not. 
    Just for -- I know that the Court has read the briefs, but just to clarify the point I made, I point out that these expansions were three. 
    There were three separate expansions. 
    They were done in 1965 in which an area including all black voters -- all potential voters was annexed.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2043.954" stopTime="2046.842">
    Unknown Speaker 
    94 the date of the Civil Rights Act?
speaker="robert_l_goza" startTime="2046.842" stopTime="2302.152">
    Mr. Robert L. Goza 
    No sir, it was after November 1, 1964 but it was in August of 1965, I believe. 
    And then the other two alleged, one in 1966 and one in 1968 and stipulation shows that these were done pursuant to a long range plan of the city of Canton for its road and development. 
    It was not something that cropped the path to the enactment of the Voting Rights Act. 
    The statute under which these expansions were made of course has been in existence long before the Voting Rights Act was never dreamed of and the state law under which the city proceeded. 
    The second thing is that the 1962 statute which permitted elections at large was also of course in existence prior to Voting Rights Act, and it was true that city had not followed it or did not follow in 1965. 
    Those were the two things which I would like to point out in view of the statement by counsel opposite that these things were post Allen. 
    They actually were not post Allen. 
    They were done prior to or about the same time that the Allen decision was handed down by this Court. 
    The point that appellees would like to urge is this and the question before the Court as we see it is this. 
    “Does the Court wish to extend or expand the interpretation of Section 5 as laid down in the Allen case to the extent which appellants urge and reach the appalling result that 95% of any Municipal enactment or administration of an enactment would have to be submitted to the Attorney General of the United States or to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia before its effective or should the Court put the bit and bridle of reason of the common sense on Section 5 and confine it within that practical bounds which will carry out the intent of Congress that the election processes shall not be discriminatory and at the same time ensure a municipality the authority and the power to conduct the management of its affairs in an orderly fashion. 
    Because to do of what the appellants urge you to do and to hold these annexations to be void for the purpose of elections which I don't see how you can do that, it's either got to be a valid annexation or an invalid annexation. 
    You cannot have the people in the city paying taxes and not able to vote. 
    And so the things that, that will happen are these. 
    You question the policing power and jurisdiction in these areas and since 1965 in one case and 1966 in another and since 1968 in another, you have people who have paid municipal taxes for period of five years, some of them in these areas. 
    You have to consider the affect on zoning, housing codes, plumbing building codes, on just about every facet of Municipal Government in the annexed areas. 
    It occurs to us that Section 5 interpretation should be limited to the election processes which we could summarize as this, the qualifications and eligibility to register. 
    The registration process itself, the physical act of casting ballot and the right which this Court has indelibly inscribed on the American couches of having your vote, or the vote of each elector cast with the same value and the same weight as all other votes cast in that election. 
    And unless some enactment or administration of an enactment would affect one of these four phases of the alleged processes then it should not come within Section 5. 
    Of course if the enactment or the administration of the enactment remotely affects and can be shown to have a discriminatory purpose or effect, inadequate rights prevail under the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, as the case might be. 
    We just urge upon the Court, these annexations should not be construed as coming within Section 5.

    Now at first blush, you might think that that's an easy thing to do, but it's not necessarily so and you have to take a place with adequate facilities, taking into consideration parking, the effect if it rains, shelter for the voters and that sort of thing and it's not the easiest thing in world to do. 
    We did the best we could in those particular cases, the polling places had to be moved. 
    And we picked the --

    Mr. Robert L. Goza 
    Your Honor, it would seem to me that that is the only logical conclusion to reach. 
    That if it can be shown, that these polling places were moved for a discriminatory purpose or that if they had a discriminatory effect that the adequate remedy would be under the Fifteenth Amendment, and that to compel the City of Canton to conduct brand new election, simply because the two banks would no longer permit them to use their lobbies. 
    That has been our contention all the way through, As a practical matter, it could be held and we think the record adequately shows why we did it. 
    We tried to make a full disclosure to the three-judge court and if that new election is ordered to -- excuse me sir.

    Well, I think even more important than that this Court should decide whether or not to change the polling place with no discriminatory purpose or effect is a change within the meaning of Section 5, or is it and one of the congressional hearing said, the distinction between voting machines and paper ballots. 
    We also went to voting machines in this election and had been using paper ballots up to now, has as such a change as to warrant the holding of a new election or is that progress.

    No Sir that's true and they didn't argue about the 1965 annexation that took in all the black people either till we brought into the case ourselves. 
    But the point that I am trying to make is this. 
    Are all changes regardless of the degree, such changes come within Section 5 and if it's violated, require new election? 
    Or should we stick to the things which effect registration, the actual voting and the right to have your ballot counted equally.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Yet the Court didn't decide it?
speaker="robert_l_goza" startTime="2589.951" stopTime="2709.082">
    Mr. Robert L. Goza 
    I don't recall whether it's in judge Coleman's opinion or not, but we contend that the distinction between the Allen case as we did before the three-judge court is this that in Allen case what the Court decided on was it diluted the black vote by extending it into all five beats of the county when in effect what it actually did was it put the influence of the white majority into the two black beats. 
    In this case there is a majority of black voters in the city of Canton. 
    What we did when the election was called at large was to extend the black majority through all four beats instead of confining it to two beats. 
    Beats three and four; this extended it to all four beats and in effect if there is such a thing as a polarization and the black vote, in effect gave the black majority the opportunity to elect all municipal officers. 
    That was not true in the Allen case, but the black majority prevails in the city of Canton. 
    And they had an opportunity to vote in wards one and two which if the appellant's contention is accepted by this Court they will not have. 
    We contend that could not possibly be discriminatory even though it is a change. 
    Now, the reason I believe Mr. Justice Brennan asked why the 1965 elections was not held in accordance with the 1962 statute. 
    The reason is it was a my mistake. 
    We were not aware of the 1962 statute when the 1965 elections was held and therefore was not followed. 
    At the time of 1965 election, there were some 200 black voters in the city of Canton and it was certain -- no one intend to discriminate against them at all it was just a mistake on my part, even though that's not in the record, that's what happened.

    It cannot be that every single act that the city performs, because everything you to do affects the people in the city. 
    Every time you affect people, it could have a remote affect upon voting or elections. 
    There must be a line drawn to whether the effect must be direct rather than indirect.

    That's what we really felt we were doing and because we understand that there was either reapportion of the wards or elect the officers at large and electing at large seemed to be the fairest way to do it and that's what we did.

    As I recall it, yet it's for me, constitutional convention is to give Congress the right to veto the law of its citizens and it was defined, if that is the case you suppose that it would be asking too if asked for the statute not be too broad to construe that attempted to veto, that attempted to delegate the power to Congress? 
    The Congress itself did not resist -- the Attorney General veto to send it all, you say that were some argument --

    Mr. Robert L. Goza

    Mr. Robert L. Goza 
    Your Honor, anything that did not pertain to qualifications and eligibility to register. 
    The registration process itself, the physical casting of the ballot and the right to have your ballot counted with equal weight as all other ballots cast in elections. 
    If it did not come within those four things and I don't think that Section 5 should have anything to do with it. 
    Because if it didn't come within those four things and certainly these three things they are complaining about do not, then any remedy should be under either Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment.

    Mr. Armand Derfner 
    It would be appropriate for me to just state a brief, like we stated in response to questions posed in slightly different force by Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Harlan. 
    Basically the question was how can you expect or how were the apportionment fair under Reynolds against Sims or how were the ward elections and Mr. Marshall's question was relating to the expansion of boundaries. 
    I think basically what Section 5 had said is that -- is that the certainty that these are valid under the Fifteenth Amendment, that these have been passed in good faith is so important that Section 5 must be enforced that way. 
    But these are not questions to be considered, nor even that we have to make any proof on in the record below and that as to the apportionment, a slight dislocation in the question of proper apportionment of one election is not of such consequence, will not dislocate the law as much as allowing a change to pass without proper clearance under Section 5, which if it happened, would create every incentive for every jurisdiction, never to submit another change under Section 5.
