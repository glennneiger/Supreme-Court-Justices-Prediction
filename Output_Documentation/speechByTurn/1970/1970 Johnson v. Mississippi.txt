Johnson v. Mississippi

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in 5485, Johnson against Mississippi. 
    Mr. Porter, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="15.516" stopTime="99.285">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    My name is Stephen Porter of the law firm Williams &amp; Connolly, seated in counsel table is Richard Rugo of the law firm Hogan &amp; Hartson. 
    We are co-counsel for petitioner in this matter. 
    This case arises out of the conviction and sentencing of a Mississippi civil rights worker under circumstances which would appear to ignore every pronouncement and every limitation and every cautionary statement that this Court has over the years ever made on the issue of the use by a trial court of the power, without the ordinary requirements of due process to punish allegedly contumacious behavior summarily. 
    The salient facts briefly reviewed are as follows. 
    On January 27, 1969, petitioner Robert Johnson was summarily convicted by Grenada County, Mississippi Circuit Court Judge Marshall Perry for a remarked allegedly made in Judge Perry’s Court more than two years earlier. 
    Judge Perry sentenced petitioner for four months in jail although the maximum sentence is one month to which the Supreme Court of Mississippi later reduced the sentence. 
    The conviction resulted from an incident which occurred on January 24, 1967 in the judge’s courtroom. 
    At 9 A.M. that morning, prospective jurors of the January term occupied benches near courtroom doors, a section normally reserved for the public.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is this one month sentence was stayed?
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="102.570" stopTime="103.142">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="103.142" stopTime="103.516">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    With serious evidence?
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="103.516" stopTime="139.246">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    Yes. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    This one month sentence has been stayed. 
    The most direct route to seats reserved for defendants in pending cases before the term involved walking in front of these jurors. 
    Judge Perry announced that anyone entering the Court while in session would be required to use an aisle in the rear and this announcement was made approximately five or ten minutes before Robert Johnson appeared in Court. 
    When petitioner Johnson arrived, he walked via the most direct route to the seats reserved for the prospective defendants and as he did he walked in front of the jurors.

    And he was --

    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    And he was required --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="150.339" stopTime="153.223">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    A defendant in one of the cases that the Court was going to try during that term.
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="153.223" stopTime="177.177">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Petitioner Johnson was apprehended by the Deputy Sheriff who ordered him to walk around to the rear. 
    This point, according to the state’s show cause petition, Johnson there upon said in a loud and offensive voice, “What the hell do you mean, go around to the rear?” 
    That is the sum total of any allegation of contumacious behavior on petitioner’s part.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="177.177" stopTime="187.109">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What would be your view if the judge then and there or upon the adjournment of Court that had imposed the sentence of 30 days for contempt of Court?
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="187.109" stopTime="196.949">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    Your Honor. 
    First of all, I think that that would be a far different matter than what he did do and --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="196.949" stopTime="198.048">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Yes. 
    Obviously, what happens --
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="198.048" stopTime="234.373">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    And I think even then, the behavior of petitioner Johnson who was alleged is far less than the outrageous behavior which is present in many of the decided cases to this Court on this subject. 
    Furthermore, I think there's another issue which ought be raised and faced, and determined, that is the question of whether a judge ought involved a summary contempt power against a person who is not then involved in a proceeding before the Court or whether or not the ordinary fuller hearing ought be required.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="234.373" stopTime="243.461">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What difference does it make whether it’s a spectator, a tourist, a defendant, or a member of the bar of the Court?
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="243.461" stopTime="244.458">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    Well, I think Your Honor that there are --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="244.458" stopTime="250.110">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And except that it might be a higher degree of culpability on the part of the lawyer of course.
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="250.110" stopTime="307.725">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    Leaving aside the question of a lawyer for the moment. 
    I think the difference is this, is that in the case of the defendant before the Court, it is possible -- it’s much more difficult to invoke a summary punishment because it involves the possibility of prejudicing the case, possibly prejudicing the jury, and possibly interrupting the proceedings. 
    There is a lesser remedy available in respect of a spectator. 
    He can be removed from the Court. 
    The Court can proceed with its business and still take care of in due course charging the contemnor with the responsibility for his act.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is the judge on the bench at the time this --
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="311.685" stopTime="315.049">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The judge was on the bench. 
    Although, --

    What was going on in the courtroom? 
    Was a trial then in progress or doesn’t the record show?

    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    The record does not show what was going on whether or not if it was going on -- it appears the petitioner arrived in Court shortly after the judge was making his opening announcements with respect to a -- I don’t believe it, a trial was going on because I don’t think jurors had been chosen yet, with respect to any of the pending cases.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="343.567" stopTime="344.848">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just some preliminary matters at time.
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="344.848" stopTime="351.243">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    It’s a preliminary matter -- I believe that’s correct, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="351.243" stopTime="371.907">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You haven’t indicated your view of the matter but you don’t need to, the view of the Court’s power summarily to deal with utterance of that kind in the courtroom, do you question the Court’s power to deal with that kind of an utterance in the courtroom by any person?
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="371.907" stopTime="429.756">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    I don’t question Your Honor, the power of the court to deal with an utterance of that kind in a courtroom. 
    Although, I think traditionally, it would have to have been the kind of behavior which would have disrupted the proceedings. 
    The state’s show cause petition alleges that the chair from his deputy brought petitioner before the judge and related to the judge what had happened, indicating that the judge had never heard the disruption which had taken place. 
    And again, I think that although the Court that has the power to dispose off a disruption in the Court, questions of whether or not, it should deal with it in a summary proceeding, where some other method would be appropriate and still reserving the possibility of a prosecution for contemptuous behavior is a reasonable and proper result.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You mean, staying in front of the courtroom he says, and to judge, look to him and say -- and say, “Go to hell.”

    Mr. Stephen W. Porter

    He could put him in jail for 30 days right then and there, could he?
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="452.855" stopTime="457.269">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    I think he could probably put him in jail for 30 days right then and there. 
    Although,--

    Legally?
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="457.753" stopTime="468.027">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    Yes, Your Honor, legally. 
    He could put him in jail for 30 days right then and there, if the judge saw and heard the -- this is the old distinction between direct and indirect contempts.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="468.027" stopTime="473.726">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And if the Sheriff heard it and told the judge that that’s different.

    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    There is a state statute that covers contempt of -- direct contempt of Court punishable by one month. 
    It empowers the judge to sentence a contemnor to one month in jail in a direct contempt under Mississippi statute.

    This charge later indicated the, Your Honor, two years -- after two years had gone by that he did hear it himself. 
    Although, he had in the intervening of time schedule a show cause hearing. 
    Twice scheduled a show cause hearing and then he canceled it.

    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    Your Honor, I think it may begin inconsistent in this respect and that is --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, he perhaps didn’t say, “Well, I have heard it by myself so you don’t need to tell me.” But he let him tell him.
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="538.261" stopTime="548.072">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    And then he scheduled a show cause hearing and which would be the proper procedure under Mississippi statute for an indirect contempt.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="548.072" stopTime="551.946">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It wouldn’t be improper for the direct one, would it?
speaker="stephen_w_porter" startTime="551.946" stopTime="704.584">
    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    No, it would not be improper to provide a fuller hearing, that’s correct. 
    The judge ordered the show cause hearing -- a show cause petition be filed and within the two days of the such order, petitioner filed a motion that Judge Perry disqualify himself from the pending show cause hearing alleging personal prejudice and further alleging that since the judge had ordered his arrest, he could not fairly decide the action. 
    On February 1, 1967, approximately a week after these events, petitioner filed a petition for removal to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. 
    It was not until some 21 1/2 months that elapsed that the United States District Court remanded the prosecution to the Grenada County Circuit Court holding that petitioner’s remedy in the federal system could lie only after he demonstrated that he had been deprived of his constitutional rights by the state courts. 
    On January 22, 1969, prior to any action in Grenada County on the contempt charge and two months after, the federal court had returned the prosecution to the state system. 
    Petitioner and others filed an action in the United States District Court, the Northern District of Mississippi wholly separate action to restrain trials of Negroes and women until such time as those persons were not systematically excluded from juries in violation of the U.S. Constitution. 
    Judge Perry was named as one of the defendants in that action and served with the process on January 23, 1969. 
    On January 24, 1969, a summons was issued directing Johnson to appear in Judge Perry’s courtroom on January 27th, to show cause why he should not be punished on the old contempt charge. 
    On January 27th, petitioner and his attorney did appear in front of Judge Perry for the show cause hearing at which time the judge canceled the hearing instead reading a contempt conviction sentencing petitioner to four months in jail. 
    Bail was set at $2,000.00 and subsequently reduced to the statutory maximum of $300.00 for the Supreme Court of Mississippi. 
    Later that same morning at the second appearance before Judge Perry, in an effort to obtain the judge’s signature on a bill of exceptions, the judge refused. 
    And when the petitioner’s attorney prepared the bill of exceptions, the judge summarily, and charged hearing contempt, a conviction which was later reversed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi.

    I've no idea Your Honor. 
    It’s not in the record. 
    From its earliest decisions, this Court has recognized that the use of summary procedures to convict must be carefully controlled since they do not encompass the ordinary procedural safeguards incorporated in our system of justice, the right of an accused to be apprised fully of the nature of the charges against him, the right to put on defense, the right to counsel. 
    Generally, the Merrill area within which summary contempt proceedings have been permitted is where the trial judge has observed the contumacious conduct and then acts swiftly by conviction of the contemnor rather than by an alternative remedy in order to quell a disturbance threatening to upset the sanctity of the courtroom. 
    Other remedies have been held constitutionally permissible in dealing with an obstreperous defendant. 
    This Court recently in Illinois v. Allen mentioned at least two others restraint and removal from the courtroom. 
    Other non-summary conviction procedures suggests themselves, contempt procedures suggests themselves were appropriate such as a civil contempt. 
    A postponement of the proceedings in a proper case or by the judge, informing the defendant that charges will be preferred against him for contempt after the conclusion of the trial and refer to another judge. 
    In light of these other possible remedies and in light of these Court’s recent holding in Mayberry versus Pennsylvania which we stripped to the use of a summary conviction after a trial’s conclusion. 
    Since at that time, immediate restoration of order is no -- or vindication of the authority of the Court is no longer the primary requisite. 
    Petitioner’s conviction and its affirmance by the Supreme Court of Mississippi must be reversed for the follow --

    His second attorney, the attorney who represented him at the time of the second show cause hearing or the time the second show cause hearing was scheduled was also cited for contempt and that contempt conviction, that summary conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi on the grounds that it was not direct contempt before the judge and that the summary procedure did not apply.

    That lawsuit -- according to the record was won by petitioner of the federal District Court, issued an order enjoining the judge and the other defendants from any further acts which would violate the civil rights of the plaintiffs and members of the class. 
    As a matter of fact that order, Your Honor, was issued and Judge Perry and others were enjoined prior to the time that the judge canceled the show cause hearing.

    Mr. Stephen W. Porter 
    I think something far different has happened here. 
    There was no finding of contempt by the judge. 
    First of all, it’s not clear that this was a proper case in which there could be a finding of contempt by the judge without a hearing. 
    Secondly, even if this were the case, that power was not invoked by the judge. 
    He did not specifically find petitioner in contempt. 
    He instead ordered a show cause hearing. 
    He ordered two show cause hearings and he later canceled those hearings. 
    And we’re suggesting that once the judge has elected to use another procedure, unless there is intervening obstreperous behavior, there may not be a cancellation of the due process hearing and a return to the summary procedure because at that point, two years down the road or 30 days or even one day down the road, there's no longer any need to call the disorder in the courtroom that summary procedure has historically been reserved for just that purpose, to quell a disruption and if the judge elects not utilize it for the purpose of quelling the disruption, he ought not have it later.

    Sir. 
    The power to punish summarily in any event if this Court is to permit its limited -- in limited instances its continued use, should only be sanctioned or all else is proved unavailing. 
    Otherwise, the defendant stands confronted with the conviction, never having had a chance to assert a defense but the only protection remaining between him and the jailhouse door an appeal in which the record is often scanty at best and non-existent at worst. 
    Such an appeal even if ultimately successful, might be long arduous and expensive and might have been completely avoided if all the facts had been examined in unbiased fashion at the trial level. 
    In summary, we have before us and I think is an outrageous case which amply demonstrates the perils of the misuse of the power to punish summarily. 
    His power was here employed with the state’s own petition admits the alleged misconduct do not occur within the second hearing of the judge or an alternative remedy had been selected or swiftness was not a prerequisite and whether was ample evidence of possible bias. 
    Finally, there is wholly absent from the record in this case, the unusual exceptional or flagrant nature of behavior which is ordinarily a condition precedent to the invocation of summary procedures.

    It could have been both and like here is a question of counsel. 
    But I might add this, even though, the punishment was not summarily imposed which he had a right to do for direct contempt in his presence and he directed the prosecution at time to file an information on show cause order, if it occurred out of his presence or out of his hearing, it would have been constructive or indirect and he wouldn’t had have to start the day maximum stays on. 
    He could got six months for example and I liked this thing you mentioned the way Justice Harlan did, I forgot the word you described the last show cause order of a hearing, nothing every opportunity was given to this man and his counsel to file some sort of response to show something in mitigation, something to purge himself, nothing was ever done.

    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    No, sir. 
    And to me, it gets back. 
    I don’t know what the aspects the usual contempt in Mississippi is unique, and I didn’t have the time to research it from other states with this tremendous task. 
    But I agree thoroughly with the rationale of Mayberry and other similar cases that if summary punishment is not immediately imposed at that judge ought to get some other judge to hear the thing. 
    Hear the evidence and defend on whether or not, first, it is contempt and what the penalty ought to be. 
    Some judges are unstrung by the contemptuous conduct or unbiased, unprejudiced, and unattached. 
    But I suggest this, I mean I have been through the court, I felt it like a sort of thin ice in this case for a while and I tried to get counsel to agree, in spite of the fact I think Rule 37, being find on submissive through that argument. 
    I tried to get them to agree to submit it. 
    But instead in the thing and the statute on appeals from contempt convictions, I found an interesting thing I've pointed out in my virtual brief that that statute accomplishes, I think to greater degree what would be accomplished by having one single judge hear this thing at a later date when summary punishment not imposed. 
    That statute on appeal from contempt conviction provides that the Supreme Court of Mississippi, nine judges will review the thing on a record and decide one. 
    Was there a contempt? 
    Then, if they determined that there was a contempt from that cold printed record uninfluenced by courtroom atmosphere and what not they can do one of four things. 
    At the time when the statute said, whether the appellant was guilty of contempt and the sentence or decree or order of the court below maybe affirmed, reversed, annulled or modified. 
    According to the judgment of the appellate court, that of course was a reason I have attested Boston opinion as an appendix to the brief, to show just how our State Supreme Court has handled these things. 
    Now, there was a case where the same Judge Perry found a man in Boston who was a lawyer on Winston County, Mississippi. 
    They ran against Judge Perry, the Circuit judge in contempt and they appealed to their Supreme Court and they completely annulled the conviction. 
    They didn’t reverse, remand, vacate, or modify. 
    They completely annulled it as you see from that appendix.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I have two problems with your argument and I may say so unless you can straighten it out Mr. Lyell. 
    About your argument as to the Mississippi statute that gives the Supreme Court reviewing power. 
    In this particular case in its opinion, the Supreme Court of your state said, “Upon appeal with this Court from a conviction of direct contempt, the statement of the substantive facts set out in the judgment of the trial court will be taken as true and correct.” 
    So that’s pretty far away from any sort of factual review that I had understood you were suggesting. 
    And secondly, since there was no hearing, there really wasn’t anything to review in this case if they took the findings in the trial court's judgment as true and correct. 
    And if the trial judge didn’t conduct a hearing on the show cause order. 
    There was just no review at all.
speaker="g_garland_lyell_jr" startTime="2176.096" stopTime="2211.552">
    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    Well, I think what they mean by the statement Mr. Justice, as I understood is this, that they had to accept as a fact from the finding of the trial court, what this contemnor did? 
    There was -- as Mr. Justice Marshall asks this, there's never been any denial of the fact that he did what he did.

    Now, there's never been a denial of this or is there ever been any opportunity for a denial. 
    As I read the statement of the facts in the petitioner's brief, it boiled out to the fact that at nine o’clock in the morning on January 27, 1969, Johnson with his lawyer appeared before Judge Perry and denying Johnson’s request for a hearing. 
    Judge Perry read the order, judging Johnson in criminal contempt and sentencing him to four months in prison.

    These are the proceedings and so it’s stated here before Judge Perry at nine o’clock in January 27, 1969, here, it’s cited that Martha M. Wood requested a hearing. 
    Her request was denied. 
    She then objected to the denial and this appears, Judge Perry stated that he had intended to give respondent a hearing under the contempt charge as the Court files ordering him to appear in a show cause proof. 
    But that since respondent had the audacity to go to federal court, and whether Judge Perry meant by that the original removal order or the affirmative jury suit or both is not clear, he was not going to give him a hearing?

    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    Well, they never. 
    I can only get back this, they never even intimated that this event did not transpire.

    Counsel in the appendix or anywhere else, do we have any record, any account of what took place when Johnson failed to appear in response to the first order to show cause as you said, he failed to appear?

    Would the failure to appear in response to in order to show cause at a fixed time and place, be in itself a contempt under Mississippi law?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What happened was there was a petition for removal in the District Court in response to the first order to show cause, was there not? 
    To the federal court, do I misunderstand that?
speaker="g_garland_lyell_jr" startTime="2984.105" stopTime="2986.400">
    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    I understood that. From my understanding, that’s correct.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That’s what happened and that could hardly be contemptuous --

    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    It was remanded. 
    No sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2990.346" stopTime="3019.244">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No. 
    It was a petition to remove the case to the United States District Court and the Court held that petition for a matter of several months as I understand it. 
    And has been added it to the state judge and there followed the second order to show cause, wasn’t that it? 
    And then, they came to the Court in response to that and according to that what this record shows, they asked for a hearing and they were denied a hearing. 
    Now, aren't those facts and if not, what are they?
speaker="g_garland_lyell_jr" startTime="3019.244" stopTime="3024.007">

    You wouldn’t, I gather is contempt to remove his --

    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    When he asked such a complete review by the State Supreme Court on any conviction contempt and to say on whether that type of statute is unique in Mississippi or wide spread but to me it’s --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3042.339" stopTime="3052.113">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But if you go and say that they could not consider disqualification on the trial judge where it's not in his presence. 
    As if Mississippi Supreme Court is correct.

    Yes.

    Where as if it had been tried before another judge, you could have petitioned the Court and sought to disqualify?

    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr.

    Yes sir.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, isn’t that additional reason, why it should have gone to another judge?

    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    Well, as I say Mr. Justice Marshall, we all have a different ways of doing things and I think if this have been transpired, he should have been summarily punished but I still I think he was better off when given an opportunity. 
    And with the sheriff, the judge could’ve said, “Mr. Sheriff, take this man outside and (Inaudible) contempt take him up to the jail. 
    He didn’t do that, he gave him a show cause hearing, an opportunity and he didn’t take it back. 
    Then he removed at federal court.

    Mr. G. Garland Lyell, Jr. 
    Nothing because this petitioner removed the thing to the federal court.

    Which he had a perfect right to do.
