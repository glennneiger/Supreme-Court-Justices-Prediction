    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    At issue in this case, is the ability of the agency which is charged with administering a local Aid to Families with Dependent Children program to verify information which an applicant or a recipient is concededly obliged to furnish for eligibility purposes and to verify it as meaningfully as possible by a visit to the home by an agency caseworker. 
    Or put another way, the question is whether the adult AFDC client has an absolute right to refuse access to her home and still receive assistance, no matter what her conceded obligations maybe, and even if a refusal is entirely arbitrary. 
    Essentially, we submit that since AFDC assistance is premised on the care of children in homes which would otherwise be unable to provide for them, that the request for access to the home is a reasonable one. 
    In addition, since that request is denied the result is neither entry nor a contempt proceeding nor automatic termination of benefits, but a hearing. 
    The home visit apparatus does not infringe any Fourth Amendment right. 
    No warrant procedures required to validate the home visit, nor could any such procedure more fully protect the AFDC client against the arbitrary exercise of the party than the one that we have now.

    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    There is a policy in New York City that it be given. 
    The affidavits do indicate that it was not given in those cases. 
    I would think that, that could be an issue which could be resolved at a hearing which is held.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="141.433" stopTime="143.737">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But in any event in this case it's conceded that there was an advance notice?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="143.737" stopTime="406.970">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    In this case, there definitely was advance notice for approximately a week. 
    The adult appellee in this case Barbara James first applied for assistance in April 1967, pursuant to the state regulation, requiring that a home visit be made to initial applicants for assistance, such a visit was made, the apartment was seen and various aspects of eligibility were discussed. 
    The worker was not then or afterward persuaded the appellee's eligibility, but recommended that the case be open because of the imminent birth of her child. 
    Thereafter, there were regular, periodical contacts with appellee, also as required by regulation. 
    These contacts took the form of additional home visits to attempt to verify eligibility and to attempt to deal with appellee's many demands, the greater number of which were seem to be invalid. 
    During these visits, no worker went behind close doors or poked or probed into any closed area and at each visit the child was seen. 
    Ultimately, she notified a caseworker who had sought to make an appointment by letter a week in advance that under no circumstances and at no time would the worker be admitted to the home. 
    On May 27, 1969 before any termination of benefits, a hearing was held by the department at which appellee and counsel were present and at which counsel represented that although his client would talk anywhere, she would not talk at home because that would violate her right of privacy. 
    The referee found that refusal to comply with the policy of contact by home visit justified the case -- closing the case, pointing out and I quote from his opinion, “The home visit which Mrs. James refuses to permit is for the purpose of determining if there are any changes in her situation that might effect her eligibility to continue to receive public assistance or that might affect the amount of such assistance and to see if there are any social services which the department of social services can provide to the family.” 
    He, therefore, affirmed the decision to close the case. 
    Appellee did not proceed as she could have to a state fair hearing. 
    Instead a complaint was filed in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the termination of benefits for refusal to consent to a home visit without a warrant. 
    A statutory three-judged court was convened and its majority opinion, the court held that a home visit without a warrant is an invasion of the constitutionally protected right of privacy. 
    That alternative methods are available to verify eligibility and that should a home visit be deemed required to consider a certain aspect of eligibility and the applicant or recipient refuses to allow the visit, a suitably restricted search warrant may issue to force the client to disclose the terms of his eligibility. 
    The majority rejected any idea that the home visit could legitimately ascertain the wellbeing of the child, although I think somewhat inconsistently it also provided in its alternative possibilities for verification of the wellbeing of the child. 
    The first point to be made, I think, is that the home visit as presently structured is a reasonable and necessary investigative tool in AFDC cases. 
    There can be no doubt that it serves valid purposes, it provides information on a need for and the extent of assistance, and it provides information on the extent to which the assistance is being used for and is working for the only purpose of the program, that is the care children in their homes and in this connection it also serves to identify immediate areas of service. 
    It is conceded --

    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    There is an HEW -- if you mean Mr. Justice, is there a regulation specifically requiring home visits, there is only for a quality control sample of cases, but there is such a requirement for an investigation of a selected sample and I think, it's important to note in this context that the appellees apparently don't challenge the fact that you can make home visits to this selected sample.

    It's not that I know of specifically designated in the regulation, but each household is a potential member of that sample and it seems to me that constitutionality doesn't rest on a number of homes that you include in the sample. 
    If the sample proves inadequate, you must increase it. 
    And in this case, what's essentially happened is that it's increased to a 100%, but there is that core of sample cases and --

    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    I think there is no constitutional significance to it Mr. Justice, as far as whether or not there is a significance in the fact that they may deemed this adequate. 
    This is a policy question, they may or may not. 
    The states are free unless there is a specific proscription to provide for such testing of eligibility as they deem appropriate in their own programs and New York, of course, has just about the most extensive, I think, it does have most extensive AFDC program in the country and it presents a great number of problems which the state is just trying to cope within this fashion and nothing in HEW regulations proscribes this.

    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    Well, no. 
    A sample, a full field investigation of eligibility including a home visit. 
    This is seen -- I am more familiar with what's happening now in the simplified declaration experiment which is presently going around -- being tried out around the country. 
    In that case each state was required to set up districts or experimental districts within the state, not the entire state. 
    To try to see if eligibility could be determined on a simple affidavit process. 
    To check that, a home visit was required as part of a full field investigation again in a selected sample of cases and the results that have come in from that so far are inconclusive.

speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="664.685" stopTime="688.016">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    It's eligibility and continued eligibility in a full sense. 
    That is, that the person is in need and that would respect to continued eligibility that the assistance which is being given works for the benefit of the child and if it doesn't work then that is an aspect of eligibility for the program.

    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    The home visit can verify of course first the residence.

speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="749.321" stopTime="762.179">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    It has to do with the possibility of resources and this is in terms on initial eligibility I am speaking now.

    How does the home visit contribute to that?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="766.322" stopTime="789.582">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    By seeing what is in the home, the worker maybe able to have an idea of whether or not the conditions which the claimant -- which the client has stated exists, do in fact exist. 
    And in terms of the functioning of the household in relation to the child a home visit can tell more than an office visit.

    Under the --

speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="836.354" stopTime="861.767">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    Well, but the ground -- if the ground -- the ultimate result is a neglect proceeding which the statute specifically provides, the Federal Social Security Act provides must be done if there is a danger to the child. 
    That would in effect terminate eligibility. 
    It maybe that services will have to be, mandatory services will have to be provided for the child to keep the child in the home.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="861.767" stopTime="888.059">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, let's see, does that mean the example of an investigation is closed. 
    The mother with her single child is an alcoholic, and all of the money she gets goes into the purchase of liquor and she doesn't -- and none of it goes buy food for the child or something like that. 
    That then means, eligibility maybe terminated, so the child gets nothing?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="888.059" stopTime="1065.752">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    No, Your Honor, Mr. Justice, it means that steps must be taken to protect the child even if it means either introducing another person into the home to care for the child or removing the child from the home. 
    But these are, this is a purpose of the program. 
    It's a statutory congressional policy that not only the technical criteria of eligibility, but the home conditions of the child are relevant to maintaining the child in that program. 
    If the child cannot be maintained in their home then he must either be removes or steps taken to improve the home, but that's as important an aspect of the program as the other. 
    We are aiming at the child, and seeing the home in this respect is as important as the technical eligibility factors. 
    In my reply brief in this Court, I cited two instances which I think illustrate -- one illustrates one of these factors and the other illustrates the other. 
    The first one referred to was an example from the selected sample in the declaration system and it was a woman who had applied for assistance and been accepted for assistance on the ground that her husband had deserted her and assistance was given. 
    However, a spot check was made and the worker discovered the husband in the home. 
    It was quite as simple as that. 
    The result of that was a support hearing, a payment of rent arrears, a reference to a marriage counselor, but an ineligible family was not put on the rolls and that was purely technical eligibility factor. 
    The other case was far more drastic in what happened and far less precise in what the worker could determine. 
    This was a recertification visit under New York Law and in non-experimental area, under the present system, and the worker walked into the home and knew that the family consisted of the mother and three children. 
    And she walked into the home and she saw the mother and the oldest child and not the other two children and the home atmosphere quite simply disturbed her. 
    She was told that one child was with his maternal grandparents and that the other child was with some neighbor, but she wasn't sure which and that's all she did. 
    But she was disturbed and she went back to her center and she called the maternal grandparents and they had not heard, they did not have the infant and they were not aware of where the infant was. 
    The maternal grandparents --

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="1068.708" stopTime="1112.679">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    The maternal grandparents who apparently were more aware of the disturbed nature of the mother than the other, than even the center, went immediately to the home. 
    And it was discovered that the younger two children in fact were dead and that the oldest child was brought into the center. 
    But there was no precise element in that home for which you could a warrant or on which you could base any kind of determination and yet it was the responsibility of the agency which must provide for the care children in the home only so long as they can be cared for in the home, to find out what happened to those children and that was the way they did it.

    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    The administrative steps are established by regulation Mr. Justice that a visit must be made. 
    Well, a contact is supposed to be made in AFDC cases every three months. 
    This had been -- it had been the policy to make the visit every three months and this would be on a regular schedule devised by the center itself which was sending out the case workers. 
    The case loads have made every three months impossible in New York city and it has been reduced to every six months at this point.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1155.954" stopTime="1172.739">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    From the caseworker, in the interval, between the scheduled visits, the caseworker gets an idea that she/he would like to go and just take a look at the house more than the regulations prescribed, can they do that?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="1172.739" stopTime="1216.384">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    They have no authority to make a recertification visit for that purpose. 
    I think that eligibility itself, technical eligibility is only in those set slot periods. 
    Now there maybe instances, there are in Mrs. James case where home visits were made other than recertification times, but in those instances it was basically two verify information at the request of the client. 
    Certainly, at the request of the client it can be made and I think that the agency would have discretion where factors warranted to make a visit outside of the certification period.

speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="1232.754" stopTime="1303.693">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    I think that the suggestions for the warrant the District Court made which are no other alternative available, limited to a specific element which you may not be able to find out about until you make the home visit. 
    This is particularly true with preschool children to whom there is otherwise no access until something happens to them. 
    It's simply unworkable and it would require on an individualized case basis who would have to setup the kind of body of case law that we have now for criminal Fourth Amendment cases. 
    I think one of the crucial distinction is between the Camara decision of this Court and the reliance placed on it by the District Court is just this distinction, because what the District Court does in mandating a warrant procedure is to restructure the home visit, to make it no longer reasonable, to make it on a periodic basis and yet it clearly is and it is related so closely to valid purposes that it clearly is reasonable.

    In fact, Mrs. James in this case proscribed areas such as the bedroom, when she said, you may not -- the door was closed. 
    She said, you may not enter; the worker did not enter.

    The average warrant would authorize greater intrusion into more areas than the worker. 
    There is no charge in any of these, either by this appellee or by any of the other people who submitted affidavits that that is their problem in this case. 
    None of them has ever charged that kind of abuse by a caseworker. 
    I would like briefly to say that as I have said that the warrant procedure really would restructure the home visit and that it is reasonable as it stands that the reason if the home visit is to be allowed as it presently stands than the warrant would serve no useful purpose. 
    In Camara, it served the purpose of creating a relationship between the client or the householder and the authority which sought to make the entry, but that's not necessary in this case. 
    The relationship is established and no -- the limitations are established and no warrant is necessary and finally, we have in the warrant, pardon me in the home visit situation, we have a pre-termination hearing which protects against any arbitrary use of authority before benefits can ever be terminated and this protects a client more so than in X party warrant procedure which would permit invasion, and would not permit the client to state his side of the case and would not protect against the kind of abuse that is suggested, the asking of the relevant questions, looking --

   Argument of Jonathan Weiss

    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I should like to attempt to focus the argument on two crucial factors to present this case. 
    They are, the place involved, the act involved. 
    What's at stake here is an unwanted intrusion into the home. 
    The act is intrusion against the will into a person's private home. 
    There is no claim on behalf of the appellees that all homes visits are always bad when welfare recipients want welfare workers, or friends or caseworker at their home, no one has any complaint. 
    What's at stake here is the forcing, the insistence of a visit by a welfare caseworker, a person who is hired to check certain elementary facts in certain mechanical way, who has no training and no experience, a social worker who insists, however, of going into the home. 
    The facts of this case, I think, illustrate all the various dangers involved in such a forcing of a visit.

    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    No, there is much more that happens. 
    What happens as in this case, they have prior hearing as mandated by this Court in the case of Goldberg versus Kelly at which point a hearing officer who is not empowered to reach constitutional issues, who is not a lawyer, informs the welfare recipient all the regulations as in this case and then they terminate aid at that moment. 
    With that termination of aid, that was imminent that compelled the District Court in this case to issue a temporary restraining warrant.

    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    Yes, that's precisely what happened in this case and then aid was terminated. 
    At the hearing where Mrs. James is represented by counsel the Welfare Department informs it would give any information, any sort, any place, but that home but she did not want the you to visit. 
    The Welfare Department said the regulations means that because it's refusal, your aid must now be terminated, and it was terminated.

    How do you satisfy the requirement of probable cause for warrant in this context?
speaker="jonathan_weiss" startTime="2141.943" stopTime="2205.647">
    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    Your Honor, it's our contention that there is really is no need for warrants in the case of welfare clients. 
    All the purposes served by warrants are gotten by warrants from other statutes. 
    If in fact you are worried about somebody misrepresenting, whether they are eligible, what resources they have. 
    If in fact they are doing that, they are liable under the statutes of fraud and a warrant could issue to ascertain that upon probable cause. 
    If we are dealing with specter of neglect and abuse which is not specter only for welfare clients, who suddenly become abusing, neglecting parents because they need money from the state for all people, if that specter arises, we proceed, we do for all families, that is, warrants issue under the Family Court Act. 
    There are warrants to cover every single possibility for the purposes of statutes. 
    There is no purpose in the welfare statute that I think, would require a warrant.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2205.647" stopTime="2213.285">

    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    That's correct, Your Honor unless --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    You can't get a warrant because there is no probable cause and be -- and you can't go in without a warrant, because of the Fourth Amendment?
speaker="jonathan_weiss" startTime="2224.309" stopTime="2265.218">
    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    The intrusion at home is defined, the strictures are definable generally and specifically. 
    Generally, the assumption is and the whole historical meaning of the cases and the tradition of the Fourth Amendment are that no one should go into home except for matters of public safety, which would involve damage, for example, the children on neglect statutes, crimes, public menaces on their health, that is a category under which this Court deploying the Fourth Amendment, permits intrusion into the home. 
    That sort one of the intrusion, that's what general warrant for intrusion, you need a specific warrants on probable cause.

    On the other hand --

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2267.468" stopTime="2279.210">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- the issue seems to be then whether the state should be permitted to verify eligibility information by home visits?
speaker="jonathan_weiss" startTime="2279.210" stopTime="2280.553">
    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    There is a statutory scheme --

    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    That's one of the issue. 
    There is a statutory scheme which allows for double-checking when there has been an misrepresentation just as we have for example again in the Internal Revenue Service. 
    If the Welfare Department has reason to believe that somebody has misrepresented their eligibility, then they can refer to the criminal branch to get a warrant to check whether it has been actual welfare fraud.

    -- but there are establishments of foster homes. 
    There are permanent placements.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2527.956" stopTime="2543.640">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Then I come back to my question. 
    Do you say that the State of New York in pursuance of its program of foster homes for the children cannot make an inspection of these foster homes in the conditions without a warrant?
speaker="jonathan_weiss" startTime="2543.640" stopTime="2571.544">
    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    I would say that you make inspection up to the point at which there is a permanent placement in the family establishment. 
    At that point, that family is like any other family, and they may not make the visits. 
    Now it seemed to be also a logic of our position in this case that once you have an established family, no matter what/how the state deals with it, be it that they take taxes, be they give welfare, they may not insist upon intruding against the will into those homes.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2571.544" stopTime="2616.208">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, let's take an analogy then you referred to the income tax problems. 
    Suppose a taxpayer takes off and shows $8,000 in interest payments on loans during a given year, and $12,000 in contributions, and then in due course on an examination, the agent writes or calls and says, I would like to see your records and your canceled checks to support these payments, and the taxpayer says no. 
    No, these are private records, private papers, a man's most scared possession, you can't look at them, what do you think the Internal Revenue Service is going to do?
speaker="jonathan_weiss" startTime="2616.208" stopTime="2622.684">
    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    I would say within the dictates of cases such as Silverthron, they would probably issue some sort of process.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2622.684" stopTime="2631.236">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Don't you think they just disallow, disallow the deduction in very short order?
speaker="jonathan_weiss" startTime="2631.236" stopTime="2647.816">
    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    Under the Internal Revenue Service, of course, the presumption is upon the taxpayer to prove certain types of deductions and they might do that on the grounds that they didn't have to come forward and show proof but that will not allow the Internal Revenue Service to go into that home.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2647.816" stopTime="2656.570">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The consequence of not going into that home or the private files would be peremptory disallowance of those claims, couldn't it?
speaker="jonathan_weiss" startTime="2656.570" stopTime="2692.408">
    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    The consequence of not coming forth with evidence, not the consequence of refusal of entering into the home. 
    If the Internal Revenue Service said, to verify deductions, we must come to your home sometimes with notice, sometimes without notice. 
    The ability to compel the presence of your child, the threat of cutting off all your tax privileges and in fact attach your salary. 
    I would assume that this Court would find that type of insistence as unconstitutional, I hope we'll find the type of insistence now before for the Court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2692.408" stopTime="2722.994">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now you seem to make a distinction Mr. Weiss. 
    You said the Internal Revenue Service places a burden on the taxpayer to do certain things in the statute. 
    Suppose the State of New York if it does not now do so, places a burden on the recipient of welfare aid as a condition to continue the receipt of that aid that they must allow inspections, wouldn't that be a parallel to the Internal Revenue illustration you gave me?
speaker="jonathan_weiss" startTime="2722.994" stopTime="2748.557">
    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    No, because the inspection, the intrusion of home is different than the request or demand for the proffering of the information. 
    There is nothing ingredient in the presentation of papers or facts. 
    They must be necessitated being in a home, but what's crucial about a home is how the people living in that home regard it not whether the government wants it as a convenience.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2748.557" stopTime="2755.357">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    There are two answers. 
    One is, it's not clear you can establish with a visit, it's only possible to have three children there at certain times and I sleep here, I sleep there, I sleep there, and that will be true. 
    You have the same problem of verification of that phenomenon when you do it to any other. 
    You can ask, I suppose if that doesn't intrude into privacy, neighbors, you can ask them to prove it, you can see whether the children are registered at school, you can take all types of testimony you can for that.

    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    No, I think you go about trying to verify that fact to do any other fact. 
    You can't prove it to a certainty of, they sleep over one night, they sleep over five nights, ten nights or hundred nights somewhere else, when they does it end, when do they not live in there. 
    It's not clear, but in any event the fact that you insist upon going to the home at a certain point, and they claim that they give notice and sometimes they do, that is not going to prove anything at all.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2938.727" stopTime="2939.939">

    They did give notice --
speaker="jonathan_weiss" startTime="2939.939" stopTime="2963.347">
    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    They gave notice in this case and not given notice in others, and as their affidavits bear out, it's up to the case worker to decide when notice is appropriate, but leaving the notice issue aside, there is problem with verifying any claim any person makes about how he lives in his home.

    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    That would be not be probable cause, I would think cases such as Gouled versus United States suggest that probable cause involves the use of an element to be admissible at a trial for the proof of something that goes to the statute, and I would think you would have to find, if in fact, warrants were necessary in the welfare area, certain specific items that were necessary to be found, only be found by a search in order to fulfill certain purposes of the welfare statute. 
    But the welfare statute as it now is, all they need to know is how is it claimed, and the fact of how many children are dependent upon that person, just as the Internal Revenue Service needs to know how many dependents are there when you fill out your tax forms.

    Well, what it seemed -- as the amicus brief in this case points out, the practicality goes the other way, of course that lack of staff means you shouldn't make home visits, that's what the union of social worker say that. 
    Assuming they did, administrative convenience can never be an excuse for unconstitutional intrusions. 
    If the police department were to say, we are having trouble locating people who steal, we don't have staff, therefore we are going to make a blanket search of say, the area near 14th and Park Road here that would clearly be unconstitutional, so too is unconstitutional here, if they were, as it cannot be a claim that's more practical and more easy to make home visits to verify the simple questions of the size and nature of the family composition.

    Could you sum up those --
speaker="jonathan_weiss" startTime="3560.945" stopTime="3624.191">
    Mr. Jonathan Weiss 
    The HEW regulation says that nobody should demand entrance, they should not go into homes without prior consent. 
    Yet that is what they seek to do here by saying, if you do not let us in, we will call off your welfare. 
    That of course was held to be unconstitutional coercion in the confession case of Lynumn versus Illinois, so to here this coercion and therefore not consent, I would say, waiver against the HEW regulation reflects, I believe a constitutional mandate. 
    In sum, I would say that what the welfare department seeks to do is send improper people into an inappropriate place to achieve results irrelevant to welfare statute which in fact violates fundamental constitutional rights. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Brenda Soloff

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Weiss. 
    Ms. Soloff, in the case, I believe your time is expired. 
    Unless you have any factual matter that you want to make a correction of the record above.
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3636.840" stopTime="3640.498">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    I would just like to say that, I would address myself to Mr. Justice Brennan's first --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3640.498" stopTime="3641.566">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Could you please just speak a little louder?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3641.566" stopTime="3688.130">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    I am sorry. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan's first question to Mr. Weiss in respect to what can happen at a hearing. 
    It would appear that Mrs. James' assistance was terminated because of her refusal, but in point of fact as I said the referee did set out what the refusal was supposed to, what the visit was supposed to accomplish, and Mrs. James did not set forth any reason why the visit should not be made. 
    In fact her refusal was completely arbitrary. 
    We don't have another case in which -- at least there is none that has come to anybody's attention in which, assistance has been terminated solely for refusal to permit visit.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3688.130" stopTime="3702.988">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well I thought that is what Mr. Weiss said, the termination hearing amounts to nothing more than an inquiry, it was a refusal, and if it's found that it was refusal, then automatically an order is entered, terminating benefits. 
    You say that it's not so, so --
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3702.988" stopTime="3720.205">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    I say that we have no other case but this one, Mr. Justice and what happened in this case was that no reason was advanced why the visit should not be made and so that the flat face of the record appears to support that the position whereas it's not least bit necessary.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3720.205" stopTime="3743.860">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But suppose that it had been said that, I can give you this information, whatever it is you want, without you making a home visit, this is the way I will supply it or whatever, that tender was made. 
    What would have been the result if the tender had been a satisfactory tender of evidence upon which it could be concluded no home visit was necessary?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3743.860" stopTime="3761.401">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    Then I think it is up to -- again we're talking somewhat in the dark, that she did not go to a state fair hearing, but I think that the result would be up to the referee to determine if the department was correct that the option was unacceptable, that the alternative was unacceptable.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3761.401" stopTime="3766.878">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Doesn't the either a statute or a regulation require a home visit regularly?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3766.878" stopTime="3788.182">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    The statute requires an initial home visit. 
    The regulation, pardon me the state regulation. 
    Thereafter it requires periodic contact which maybe by home visit, office visit, or another method. 
    It does not explicitly require that in all cases for a continuing eligibility there would be a home visit.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3788.182" stopTime="3789.529">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So --
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3789.529" stopTime="3793.624">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    So that the referee would have some latitude in this respect.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3793.624" stopTime="3810.697">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean the policy of New York as stated in the statute or in the regulation, does not -- is in fact that there must be a home visit in order to assure the welfare department of continued eligibility.
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3810.697" stopTime="3811.559">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3811.559" stopTime="3816.900">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So they must think that there is some other ways of doing it or that they just don't care actually.
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3816.900" stopTime="3834.501">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    It's not that they don't care, it's that there is the possibility, but that is alternative means, but that it's also possible that alternative means will not work. 
    In fact that home visit has been the traditional means of verifying.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3834.501" stopTime="3841.442">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What are that means whatever, worked in verifying just the fact that three children are living in the home?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3841.442" stopTime="3860.467">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    I can't think that another one would work as effectively. 
    I mean that's the answer, that's the closest we can get, whether or not the state would allow or the Federal government would permit it to accept other evidence. 
    It's not constitutionally required to do so.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3860.467" stopTime="3875.998">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I suppose if you had unlimited funds, you could put a 24 hours surveillance on the house and if for 30 days no children were seen coming or going, that might lead to an inference that they were either very ill or that there weren't any children there.
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3875.998" stopTime="3916.369">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    I suppose that, that is possible Mr. Justice. 
    What's happening here is the welfare programs are changing. 
    We are trying to reconcile the recognized dignity of the individual with the need to have a workable welfare program. 
    The home visit is changing in this respect too. 
    It is being adapted to the new programs and we are trying to see if the new programs work, and we simply don't know, and what what they are asking for that a declaration system or something very closely akin to it, be established as a constitutional variety at a time when the evidence simply is not in that works now.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Does the record show how many children they are and what are their ages and how much they draw?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="3926.211" stopTime="3941.975">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    Mrs. James says one child. 
    He is now, I guess, about three years old and I do not have the figure for a family of two under the revised standard of need in New York city at this time.

    I don't remember what her last -- her last rent that I recall was in the neighborhood of $100 a month, but I don't remember precisely because she has moved a number of times.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Ms. Soloff, if you have heard my hypothetical, a factual situation I presented to Mr. Weiss about the foster homes. 
    If you know, if you are familiar with the regulations and the procedure, does New York state or its subdivisions conduct periodic visitation to foster homes where they place children for time to time?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="4007.002" stopTime="4013.012">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    I believe it does, but I can't cite the section of the law in which that happens, it would be under the family law, I think.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4013.012" stopTime="4021.896">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But certainty, it'd be astonishing if they place children in home and then made no check on them to determine whether they were being properly cared for wouldn't it?
speaker="brenda_soloff" startTime="4021.896" stopTime="4025.975">
    Ms. Brenda Soloff 
    They do. 
    I am quite sure they check foster homes, they check the adopted homes.
