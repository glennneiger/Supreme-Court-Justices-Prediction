Bruno v. Pennsylvania

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in Number 205, Bruno against the State of Pennsylvania. 
    Mr. Quinlan.
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="43.104" stopTime="156.733">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    John Harry Bruno was born and raised in the Borough of Norristown which is about 20 miles west of Philadelphia and the records in this case show that he attended public school. 
    It was elicited to the various hearings, habeas corpus hearings, suppression hearings, insanity hearings that he had never been in trouble. 
    Low and behold, he was drafted by the United States Army in November of 1961 and at some point during his basic training, abbreviated as it was, it was determined that John was unlike the other draftees that he was sick and he was transferred to Fitzsimons General Hospital in Denver, Colorado where he was in a psychiatric ward. 
    He was discharged by the United States Army in May of 1961 and sent home by himself. 
    Now prior to that, a murder had taken place in October of 1961 in Norristown, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, husband and wife were killed. 
    Subsequent to John's discharge from the army, he held jobs in Norristown. 
    He was not in any trouble that anybody knows of, although the records does show that subsequent to December of 1963 when two other people were murdered, John was interrogated by the county detectives and/or the District Attorney's Office and now it's 1964 and given a lie detector test.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Quinlan, how is this background relevant to the question whether he can be held in custody pending trial --
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="165.718" stopTime="166.298">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="166.298" stopTime="173.575">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- while he is -- while he is under a finding that he's incompetent to be tried, that's the real issue of the case, isn't it?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="173.575" stopTime="188.994">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Yes, sir. 
    From the very beginning, Mr. Chief Justice, I entered my appearance within a week or 10 days the district attorney -- the District Attorney petitioned for a Sanity Commission, alleging that John was insane and --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="188.994" stopTime="192.372">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Against his background, wasn't that almost imperative?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="192.372" stopTime="204.076">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    No sir. 
    All they had -- all they had to base their petition on was the confession that they elicited from John Bruno when they held him for 26 hours without a lawyer.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="204.076" stopTime="206.020">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But they -- didn't they know his medical history?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="206.020" stopTime="207.859">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    No sir, they did not. 
    They subpoenaed his medical --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="207.859" stopTime="210.533">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Does the record show that they didn't know it?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="210.533" stopTime="212.513">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    At that point they didn't know it.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="212.513" stopTime="213.646">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Does the record show?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="213.646" stopTime="273.342">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    I believe it does, Mr. Chief Justice, yes. 
    The records of his medical records were not brought into the picture until the Sanity Commission actually sat in 1967 and they subpoenaed them by the order -- the record also show that one judge tranquility signed all of the orders in this case. 
    Now, I resisted the appointment of the Sanity Commission, at the same time I filed a petition for habeas corpus hearing to find out what they did have against John Bruno. 
    As Mr. Justice Roberts said, at that first appeal in the State Supreme Court, “How in the world can they can take an illegal confession and hold it here, and say, if John Bruno did these terrible things for the reasons that he gave for doing them, then he must be crazy.” 
    Now, if the confession is inadmissible in a courtroom, it should not have been used for them to determine that they should proceed sanity.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="273.342" stopTime="297.230">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In order to maintain that position, you would in effect be saying that a psychiatrist confronted with the statement that he did or may have committed these crimes, and that this was his explanation, would a psychiatrist would not say that this man should be subject to a further psychiatric examination?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="297.230" stopTime="300.147">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and that's just what they did.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="300.147" stopTime="302.632">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Shouldn't they have done so?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="302.632" stopTime="366.387">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Not in my opinion. 
    This man was arrested, indicted and held under open charges for having killed five people. 
    I think the plea of insanity is up to him. 
    We never entered a plea of insanity in this case and all of the psychiatrists had at the hearing, was John's confession and the army medical records. 
    And the army medical records were November and December of 1960, January, February, March, April of 1961. 
    The Sanity Commission hearings were not held until 1967 and I was there and the record will show that the Sanity Commission hearing consisted of all the police, the county police, detectives, state police, two police departments of municipality, saying we were in there with the total of over 12 or 15 policemen interrogating John. 
    And he admitted doing these things and he gave us his reason for doing it, that his father told him that these people had put evil eye on them.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That's standing alone, wouldn't that alert any doctor even if he were not a psychiatrist to at least a strong suspicion that there was something mentally wrong with this man?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="376.697" stopTime="388.581">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, except with the test for the man's competency to stand trial in Pennsylvania is whether or not he understands the nature of the proceedings against him, and does he have the ability to confer with counsel.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="388.581" stopTime="402.003">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Yes, but doesn't this put them on notice that they should make that further inquiry about his capacity to cooperate in his own defense? 
    If it doesn't then the laws of all other 49 states are wrong Mr. Quinlan?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="402.003" stopTime="409.430">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    I don't think that it can be used to commit him to an institution for the criminally insane.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Quinlan, how long have you had this Sanity Commission procedure in Pennsylvania? 
    Is this a long, established routine in criminal cases?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="419.091" stopTime="458.118">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    The Act I believe is 1951. 
    The Act has since been repealed. 
    I initially contended that the District Attorney was not a person under that Act entitled to initiate the proceedings. 
    The trial court overruled me. 
    The State Supreme Court said that the issue was interlocutory and on appeal, if Your Honors please, this case was argued in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January of 1968 before an opinion came down Justice Musmanno died. 
    The Chief Justice, Chief Justice Bell ordered it back on the arguments and Justice Pomeroy, who had been appointed in Justice Musmanno's place, sat with the Court and the decision --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="458.118" stopTime="469.158">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Let me follow through on my inquiry. 
    You say you had it since 1951. 
    To what extent -- well, let me ask this, do you have a procedure for civil commitment?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="469.158" stopTime="469.655">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Yes sir.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="469.655" stopTime="470.527">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    In Pennsylvania?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="470.527" stopTime="471.529">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="471.529" stopTime="475.645">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    How do the two procedures differ?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="475.645" stopTime="516.169">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Well, I wouldn't profess to be an expert on it, but basically in a civil proceeding, all you would, up until recently, all you needed is certification of two doctors. 
    Now, in Pennsylvania, there must be a hearing in front of a common police judge with civil commitment. 
    This was a civil procedure, the Mental Health Act and they had sections in it basically which said, that if a man who's in custody or in prison or serving time was found to be incompetent, he could be transferred to an institution for the criminally insane. 
    There were no cases Mr. Justice Blackmun in Pennsylvania where this had ever been done before.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="516.169" stopTime="523.777">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, do I understand that the sanity hearing and the civil commitment procedure are or are not different in Pennsylvania?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="523.777" stopTime="527.049">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Well, basically now, it would be the same.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="527.049" stopTime="531.226">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    At the time with this man, were they the same at the time?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="531.226" stopTime="533.907">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    No, they were different.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="533.907" stopTime="545.283">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    One further question; would he be likely to end up in a different institution under the sanity hearing than he would if he were civilly committed?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="545.283" stopTime="604.858">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    The net result, would be -- probably would be the same and that's why I presented the arguments to the District Attorney's and I think Mr. Chief Justice Bell and I know that the trial judge, Judge Heinemann said, that I am taken advantage of this fellow whereas I'm not because the realities of the situation are is that all they have the confession, they have a gun that they can't use and if we went to trial, based on over 20 years of experience, I don't think they would get beyond the (Inaudible), but if they did get beyond the (Inaudible) and John was convicted, what would he get? 
    He would not get the electric chair because of the reality of the situation is once a man is convicted, I put him on the stand and nobody would sentence him to the electric chair, so the most he would get would be life. 
    Now, he's already been condemned to life in an institution for the criminally insane which is far worse than Farview, they can call it a hospital but it's an institution for the criminally insane.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="604.858" stopTime="610.150">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, now is he likely to end there, had he been civilly committed in the same institution?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="610.150" stopTime="618.202">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Under present law, if he was -- yes sir. 
    The institution could transfer him and there wouldn't be a thing I could do about it, but at least he would have his trial.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="618.202" stopTime="624.967">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Now, one further question and then I'll stop. 
    Are you familiar with the federal procedure under 18 U.S.C. 4244?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="624.967" stopTime="626.618">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    No, I'm not sir.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="626.618" stopTime="638.277">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, my question is and I'd be interested in your reaction ultimately, is whether if you prevail here, the federal system is placed in jeopardy, constitutionally?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="638.277" stopTime="641.660">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    And I can't answer that question because I'm not familiar with that.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="641.660" stopTime="660.464">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Could I then just ask you, I take it that when -- when your client was committed here that the commission that was convened found that -- not only found that he was unfit to stand trial, but that he had criminal tendencies, is that right?

    Yes, sir.

speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="669.175" stopTime="673.263">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Yes sir and he'd be -- there's a procedure and he'd be committed to Norristown State Hospital.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="673.263" stopTime="689.362">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you mean the commission -- the commission that is -- enough has already drawn -- enough has already happened in terms of proceedings and findings to warrant his confinement even if there were no criminal charges pending?

    Yes sir.

    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, but if he were tried and found innocent, he stays exactly where he is?

    I --

    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    I misunderstood what the phrase “stand in the same place”, I mean he would be confined. 
    Now, if he was tried --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="743.125" stopTime="748.989">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    There are enough findings already made to justify his confinement somewhere?

    Yes, sir.

    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    I could have, but my evidence would have necessitated putting John Bruno on the stand. 
    Now, subsequent to the adoption of the Sanity Commission's report, Judge Heinemann who was the judge who appointed the commission said that under the act, I had a right to a hearing and I didn't ask for a hearing because I would have had the hearing in front of a judge and I would've had to put John on the stand. 
    So, I simply filed exceptions to the Sanity Commission's recommendation. 
    Now, he had two psychiatrists, the judge did and a lawyer who's a very distinguished senior member of our bar, but he doesn't practice criminal law and hasn't for at least 15 years and that lawyer received an order, this is on the record from the judge, “You admit John's criminal army medical records by order of the Court?” 
    And that's all they had to decide. 
    Well, the army said, he's schizo and John says he killed five people, he must have criminal tendencies and the record will also show that I say and that I offered to (Inaudible) that in my opinion is a lawyer. 
    John did understand the nature of the proceedings against him. 
    He knows very well that he's been charged with killing five people and that he could confer with counsel and this is one we're not interested.

    I think his competency whether or not he's going to plead insanity is up first over him. 
    I don't see how in the one hand does Mr. Justice Roberts said in his dissenting opinion as most recently. 
    “How can the commonwealth arrest somebody, imprison him, this man has been confined now since April 1966” to say that he signed this confession and they have to prosecute him and in the next hand as soon they realized why we have a confession that we can't used, we have a gun that we can't use, now there has been a fact. 
    I don't see how they can be both and that's what they've done. 
    And I said in my brief, I think its right that they can arrest the person and hold him for 25 or 26 hours and then say, he signed this confession. 
    He said he killed five people and to do it for the reason he said he did it, he must be crazy and especially since we can't prove it because we can't use this confession, we're going to ship him off to far place and that's just what they did. 
    The record will show that I fought every inch of the way simply to protect the record and about the only round I won, I guess so far is when this honorable Court granted the writ of certiorari.

   Argument of Milton O. Moss

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you, Mr. Quinlan. 
    Mr. Moss.
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="1210.507" stopTime="1308.001">
    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I think there are certain factors that have been presented to the Court by my opponent that should be clarified. 
    I think that Your Honors will accurately find within the record a complete safeguard of every constitutional right of this defendant in the procedures that were taken against him by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through the District Attorney's Office of Montgomery County. 
    We have heard from Mr. Quinlan that the only piece of evidence that the commonwealth had in the prosecution for five murder cases was in fact an alleged illegal -- illegally obtained confession. 
    It should be noted Your Honors, that this defendant was operated -- was arrested in April of 1966. 
    On approximately May 13, 1966 or one month prior to the Miranda decision that negated the validity and admissibility of the confession, the District Attorney of the County of Montgomery filed a petition with the court having full knowledge not only of the defendant's present state of mind and incompetence, but also his prior psychiatric background. 
    As a result of his knowledge and I suggest to the court, his obligation to the court and law generally and as a quasi-judicial officer, it was his obligation to protect --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1308.001" stopTime="1309.330">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is that the prosecuting attorney?

    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    Pardon me.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1310.104" stopTime="1312.181">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Who was the he you're talking about, the prosecuting attorney?
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="1312.181" stopTime="1313.374">
    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    The District Attorney, yes sir.

    District Attorney, keep going.
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="1314.627" stopTime="1378.123">
    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    Petitioned the court on his motion as I felt he was required to do to empanel a Sanity Commission under the Mental Health Act at that time, and this was opposed by defense counsel. 
    Previous to that issue, Your Honors will find in the docket entries of this case that a suppression hearing was in fact held. 
    Evidence presented to the Court and a ruling given as to the admissibility of evidence other than the confession. 
    Namely the admissibility of a gun that was located and found, pursuant to a valid search warrant issued by the court, at the room occupied by the defendant. 
    Subsequent to the obtaining of the gun by the police, the confession was obtained from the defendant, setting forth his involvement with the five murders starting in 1961 and ending in 1966.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1378.123" stopTime="1382.460">

    How -- how was that gun linked up to the defendant?
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="1382.460" stopTime="1403.475">
    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    The gun was stolen from a Sears and Roebuck store Your Honor, back in 1960 or 1961. 
    It was found in a drawer secreted under a table, in a box that was obtained by the defendant and retained in that box along with various shells for use.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1403.475" stopTime="1405.080">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Now, with any?
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="1406.419" stopTime="1468.769">
    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    -- it would bear out the fact that this gun, in fact, was used to kill as I recall at least three of the defendants. 
    Now, in addition to the gun, Your Honors, there was additional evidence that was introduced by the Commonwealth to the Sanity Commission and that was a list of seven names that had been retained by the defendant, during these prior years to 1966, of seven names that he alleged and held responsible for the psychotic condition of his mother. 
    And it was his purpose in life to murder and annihilate all seven on that list, in order to relieve the “evil eye, hex voodoo and witchcraft” that these individuals, all of whom were friendly with the defendant's family had imposed upon her and subjected her to this type of life.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1468.769" stopTime="1472.168">

    Now, Mr. Moss, in addition to that, the confessions were introduced and --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And there was a sanity hearing and as I understand it, your -- the petitioner doesn't quarrel with the procedural due process aspects of that hearing. 
    But his claim is that once his client was indicted, until or unless he raised the issue of his client's insanity or incompetence, it was your absolute constitutional duty to bring him to trial at a criminal court, a speedy and a public trial, that's the issue here, isn't it?

    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that that is the pinhead of this case. 
    It's the essence of the legal issue that brings us before this honorable Court. 
    And I think that this, as the Court has held, in previous cases is not an absolute right. 
    We cannot subject an incompetent individual to a speedy trial when he is incapable and unable to confer meaningfully with his counsel to exercise all of the constitutional rights that he must do personally in the course of a trial when he is unable to do so.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1546.364" stopTime="1547.986">

    Well, his point is --
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="1547.986" stopTime="1549.234">
    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    To do this would subject him to an unfair trial.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That our procedure in this country and in Pennsylvania and each of the other 49 states and in the federal system that our procedure for better or for worse is an adversary procedure, an adversary system. 
    So that until or unless, he as the defendant raises the issue of incompetence or insanity, you have a single constitutional duty, having indicted him, having chosen to proceed criminally against this man, having him charged with murder and indicted him for it, and required him to plea that you have an absolute constitutional duty to bring him to trial.
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="1586.545" stopTime="1587.174">

    This is not as it has been referred, a confinement facility. 
    This is a hospital, part of the hospital system of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and he would be there primarily because of the maximum security and protection for society that is necessary from this individual.

    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    No, under a Sanity Commission, this defendant has a right to pursue a writ of habeas corpus at any stage of the proceedings when he is or at least represents that he is competent to be released, remanded back to the trial level to stand trial on the charges. 
    This has not been pursued and as a matter of fact, there is a letter of the defendant's current status. 
    He is evaluated periodically to determine his competency to stand trial and answer the criminal charges. 
    This has not been pursued in the last three-and-a-half years since his commitment by order.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But he went to the common police court with a petition for writ of habeas corpus, he would have to sustain some burden of showing what you contend he cannot show and therefore, the common police court would likely be somewhat influenced by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's holding, would they not?
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="2041.300" stopTime="2060.705">
    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The counsel indicated that he did not elect to follow that course originally. 
    Is there any reason to believe on the habeas corpus proceeding, he would be anymore inclined to put in the testimony of a psychiatrist?
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="2074.239" stopTime="2115.707">
    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    If the contents of this defendant's psychiatric reports, periodic reports, and evaluations by Farview State Hospital are as they are, as of September 28, 1970, he would not have any success in any release. 
    This man is convinced of his dedication in life to annihilate the seven on his list and in the event this brings no relief to his psychotic mother he will find and search out other people in the community whom he feels is responsible for his mother's condition and this is so stated in the record.

    Perhaps you've already said it, but did the findings that the commission made satisfy the civil commitment standards?

    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    Yes, sir.

    What is the civil commitment had to conclude to confine a person?

    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    Whenever a person is believed to be mentally disabled and in need of care or treatment by reason of such mental disability and examination of person has been made by a physician or physicians or for any reason, the examination of such person cannot be made, a petition maybe presented to the court of common police of the county in which the person resides or his for his immediate examination or commitment to an appropriate facility for examination, observation, and diagnosis. 
    And they thereafter adopt the same type of mental disability standard by which the individual would be committed.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2177.601" stopTime="2183.740">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, under the civil proceedings he wouldn't even have to found to be -- to have criminal tendencies?
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="2183.740" stopTime="2202.640">
    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    That is correct, Mr. Justice White. 
    We have an exaggerated case here of an individual who was terribly psychotic, has in fact murdered five people and is destined to murder others if released upon society.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2202.640" stopTime="2209.264">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of course, if he's psychotic he didn't murder them, he killed them maybe but he's not guilty of murder?
speaker="milton_o_moss" startTime="2209.264" stopTime="2216.406">
    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    That is true. 
    I think the commonwealth in any proceeding would acknowledge the defendant's incompetency and insanity.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2216.406" stopTime="2220.431">

    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    And if we were to do this sir and a court would precede the trial regardless of the verdict that would be entered.

    If this man were brought to trial as he urges, in your view, would it be the obligation of the prosecutor to bring his medical history to the attention of the court if he failed to do so, on his own behalf?

    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I've weighed that very problem and I have kicked it around in my own mind as to whether or not it is my obligation. 
    I suggest to Your Honor that this would be my obligation in the event that the defense counsel gave no indication of raising an insanity defense.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2265.507" stopTime="2275.247">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I think the American Bar Association standards for the prosecution, incumbent to the prosecution, would say that you had an absolute duty to do so.

    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    I believe that, I think my inclination was consistent with the standards of ethics, but I feel that it is the obligation of the prosecution to interpose any favorable type of evidence that is in our possession and as a matter of fact, it's in the possession of the defendant as well and at no time, other than today have I been aware of Mr. Quinlan's assertion of his knowledge of that insanity defense. 
    I think we have a counsel for the defendant in this case who may not be counsel throughout the entire proceedings on this case and we are not assured of the defendant's full protection by his being speeding to trial when he is unable to really comprehend the charges and it would only take a moment --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Could I -- would you still be making the same argument if all the commission had found was that he is incapable of understanding the situation, with -- with which he is faced and he's incapable of cooperating with the counsel and the commission had not gone on and found that he had criminal tendencies?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because that's the more interesting -- simply more interesting question which is perhaps, you can't reach here because the commission also found the criminal tendencies, but would you say Pennsylvania could continue to hold a person for the rest of his life without a trial just because you found that he was incompetent to stand trial and he would never get any better?

    Mr. Milton O. Moss 
    Yes, sir. 
    We suggest to the Court that we do have a conflict between the right of a fair trial and the right of a speedy trial. 
    There are numerous reasons why we would not want to subject the defendant to the speedy trial. 
    The Court has definitely that to proceed and prosecute a defendant who was incompetent violates due process and we are not violating the right to a speedy trial. 
    We are merely differing it until such time that the defendant can exercise in conjunction with his counsel, the personal constitutional rights that he must decide upon during the course of a trial. 
    We feel that the standards by which the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania proceeds in matters of this type afford him every protection and we therefore suggest to this Court that this defendant is not competent and not able to proceed for trial, in spite of the recommendations or assertions of his defense counsel. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Daniel L. Quinlan

    Thank you, Mr. Moss. 
    Mr. Quinlan, do you have anything further.
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="2555.174" stopTime="2581.839">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I reserved the ten minutes in rebuttal because I'm afraid I'm not making my point here. 
    I say, by what right does the Commonwealth arrest a man and indict him and then say, “No, we're not going to put him to trial because the Sanity Commission says he has criminal tendencies and the only thing in the record before the Sanity Commission for them to conclude that he had criminal tendencies was the illegal confession.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2581.839" stopTime="2595.243">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But Mr. Quinlan, there the basis -- the basic finding they made was that he's not competent to stand trial that he cannot understand and cooperate, doesn't understand the nature of the charges, that's why he's being held --
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="2595.243" stopTime="2595.704">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan

    But they --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2595.704" stopTime="2597.953">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- not because of his confession?
speaker="daniel_l_quinlan" startTime="2597.953" stopTime="2620.985">
    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    With the only criminal tendencies, he didn't testify, so all they had in front of them was that he said he killed five people for these crazy reasons and they had no right to conclude that he could not confer with counsel and didn't understand the nature of the proceedings because I was there and as his lawyer, I said he does understand them and he has conferred with me and I'll swear to it. 
    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2620.985" stopTime="2625.447">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why didn't somebody have a right to conclude the five killings was enough?

    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Mr. Justice Black, this man and the record shows this was taken into custody with his father, help for 24 hours. 
    Before the justice of the peace says, his rights having been explained to him three times and this is in the record, the then District Attorney swore under oath and all this is in the appendix that John Bruno's rights were explained to him and he understood what he was being held for, he swore to all these when he filed the answers to my motions to suppress answers to my petitions to dismiss the Sanity Commission. 
    He said, John Bruno's rights, constitutional rights have not been offended because we explained everything to him and he understood it. 
    Now, they can't have it both ways.

    -- if you had taken the stand, if you had taken the stand in this hearing and testified to all that you have been suggesting to us outside of the record about his capacity, his understanding, perhaps that commission would've found that he was competent to stand trial and we wouldn't be here.

    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    No, sir and as I say, I'm sort of a volunteer in this case, but the case -- and I think the transcript of the docket entries will show it, it sort of deteriorated into whether or not Mr. Quinlan was going to force a trial on this case and whether the District Attorney was going to able to sweep under the rug the fact that he had announced publicly that five murders had been solved and he solved them with this staff, but now I'm not going to put him on trial. 
    Now, three times under oath, the man says, the District Attorney says, I explained all his rights to him. 
    Now, how could he do that? 
    This confession was illegal under Escobedo, he didn't need Miranda for this.

    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, there was a very solution to this whole case which I proposed under our rules that a jury could've impaneled and the commonwealth could have put their psychiatrist on the stand and without any other testimony the trial judge could've said I declare this man not guilty by reason of insanity and this fellow would've been committed to an army hospital in Coatesville, Pennsylvania with maximum security. 
    Before I sit down, I'd like to suggest by analogy, one frightened thing that could happen because of this type of procedure. 
    There's a youngster who lives in my community who is now 20 or 21 and he's mentally unbalanced. 
    He's constantly talking about girls and I would like a girl and this and that. 
    The neighbors complained. 
    He's never been in trouble. 
    When and if there's a sex crime in this community, he's going to be the first boy the police pick up. He's going to sign anything they want him to sign which is just what happened to John Bruno because the record shows, “Once you signed this John, we'll take care of you and taking care of John might go into a hospital.” 
    They can take this forward to the court house, say he signed a confession that he committed all these terrible crimes and if he did it, he's obviously mentally incompetent and we ship him off to Farview and if they can do this John Bruno, I respectfully submit they can do it to anybody.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Quinlan, suppose instead of that route that Justice Blackmun suggested, suppose the state now, decides to give up and they put -- bring your man into the common police court for trial. 
    Against this background have you any doubt that this -- that the common police judge is going to first conduct a hearing to determine for himself whether your client is competent to stand trial by the standards of the common law, isn't that what he's going to do?

    Yes, sir.

    And then if he decides that he's not competent to stand trial, he's put right back where he is now residing, isn't he?

    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    Yes sir, except for this though. 
    The common law as outlined in the decision of law and this is all in all the dissenting opinions of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, that's why I didn't cite any cases in my brief, if Your Honors notice, I rely on the Constitution and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reviewed all the cases on this subject.

    Mr. Daniel L. Quinlan 
    It's been my role in this whole case and we've lost over time that -- as I say, if they can do this John Bruno, they can do it me on my home when I cross the county. 
    They can pick me up, hold me for 24 hours, come on television the next day, announce to the press, Quinlan admitted that he committed certain sex crimes and he did it because he hates his mother. 
    And anybody who will do that because he hates his mother is crazy and knowing that they can't prove it, they ship me off to Farview. 
    Maybe this has happened a lot of times. 
    I don't know, I just sort of stumbled into this case.
