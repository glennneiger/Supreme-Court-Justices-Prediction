    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court. 
    My name is William F. Thompson. 
    I am the Assistant Attorney General for the State of Indiana. 
    This morning or this afternoon I will -- 
    Arguing on behalf of appellant, the Governor of the State of Indiana. 
    I am accompanied this afternoon at counsel table by Theodore L. Sendak, Attorney General for the State of Indiana, and Richard C. Johnson, his Chief Deputy. 
    In our brief in this case we presented this Court with six issues. 
    This afternoon the State will concentrate its argument on two of those issues. 
    The first issue is whether the constitution permits or requires that a racial/socioeconomic group be proportionally represented in the State Legislature by representatives elected from that group. 
    Secondly, whether the constitution requires all state legislative districts to be the same size. 
    If time allows, the state will discuss the remaining issues. 
    I would be glad to, would be pleased to answer any questions this Court may have regarding them. 
    This action began as an action for declaratory injunctive relief in the District Court. 
    It was brought by Negro residents of Marion County, Indiana. 
    Marion County is one of 92 counties in Indiana. 
    The plaintiffs below challenged the constitutionality of the Marion County multi-member districting scheme. 
    Marion County provides for the at large election of 15 members of the House representatives and 8 members of the Senate. 
    This action does not involve congressional districting, is limited solely to state legislative districts. 
    Following this Court's decision in Baker v. Carr, Indiana began the long road to reapportionment. 
    In 1963, it reapportioned, in 1965 it again reapportioned. 
    The 1965 Act was declared unconstitutional by the District Court in the case of Stout v. Bottorff, that's the first District Court case. 
    A special session of the 65 legislature was called, and they again enacted an Apportionment Act, that was the Apportionment Act of 1965 and that is the subject of this litigation. 
    It is interesting to note that one of the plaintiffs in this action was the member of the 1965 legislature, that enacted the 1965 Act, that he voted for that Act and that he now attacks that Act. 
    There were six plaintiffs in the Court below, one was a resident of the Lake County, another County in Indiana, five of the plaintiffs were residents of Marion County. 
    The District Court found in favor of only one of the plaintiffs' from Marion County, only one plaintiff in this case was found by the District Court being entitled to relief. 
    That was Mason Bryant, Mason Bryant was the resident of an area, within Marion County, which the District Court denominated as the Center Township ghetto. 
    He was the resident and voter of the Center Township ghetto. 
    The Center Township is one of the nine townships of Marion County. 
    It's approximately in the center of the County, the other townships are ranged around it. 
    The Center Township ghetto is approximately the northern half of the Center Township. 
    The area designated by the Court as the ghetto is predominantly populated by Negroes who are poor and less well educated from the rest of the County. 
    I might point out that the term ghetto is the term used by the appellees and by the District Court. 
    The area to which this refers is not regarded in the community as a ghetto, it's not called that in the community and to a certain extent it's non-descriptive of the area involved. 
    From the rest of the County, the District Court selected an area, Washington Township and compared the number of legislators who were residents of Washington Township to the member of legislators who were residents of the Center Township ghetto. 
    An absolute numbers are Washington Township had more Senators than the Center Township Negroes. 
    The Court computed ratios and found that Washington Township ratio was greater from the Center Township ratio. 
    On this basis the District Court declared that the vote of the Center Township Negroes was diluted and canceled out by the Marion County multi-member district. 
    Rather than limited relief to merely sub-districting Marion County, the District Court ordered the reapportionment of the entire state. 
    Although, the Court appeared to rely upon a straight “one man, one vote” analysis of Reynolds, the true basis for requiring the reapportionment of the entire state was the testimony of John Banzhaf. 
    John Banzhaf is an Associate Professor of Law at George Washington University and has written some articles regarding multi-member districts and testified at this trial at the hearing to this case. 
    He testified that apportionment plans providing for districts of different sizes, a mix system of multi-member districts and single member districts, created inherent inequities and was unconstitutional per se. 
    On this basis and on the basis of clerical considerations, political factors which the District Court found to exist within the County, the District Court required that when the state reapportioned that all districts be the same size. 
    On July 28th the District Court declared the 1965 Apportionment Act unconstitutional as to the multi-member districting provisions relating to Marion County. 
    The District Court gave a stay till October 1 to reapportionment. 
    The legislature was not in session at the time that the Act was declared unconstitutional. 
    We had at that time biennial sessions. 
    The district or the legislature would not reconvene until January 1971, accordingly the State did not reapportioned. 
    On October 15, the Court reconvened and invited plans from the parties, the plaintiffs, the defendants, intervening defendants, legislative leaders and interested parties in general. 
    On October 17, the District Court announced the minimum guidelines, the 1960 census data would be used. 
    Single member districts would be preferred over multi-member districts. 
    Town, County and Township lines would be crossed when necessary, contrary to the provisions of the Indiana Constitution and that the District Court would take cognizance of the existence and location of the Center Township Negroes. 
    The plan adapted by the Court was the Court's plan supplemented by the plans submitted by the appellees in this case. 
    The appellees submitted a plan pertaining only to Marion County. 
    The Court's plans as adopted did rely on the 1960 census, did cross some county and township lines, did take cognizance of the existence and location of the Center Township Negro area. 
    It is interesting to note in this regard that one of the plans submitted by the intervening defendants had variances that were substantially the same as the variances in the plan provided by the appellees. 
    The District Court rejected that plan because in its estimation it did not take cognizance of the Center Township Negro area. 
    On December 15, the District Court announced that its plan would be the plan, would be the apportionment scheme for the 1970 election. 
    It enjoined all state election officials permanently from enforcing the provisions of the 1965 Act. 
    It mandated all state election officials to conduct the 1970 election in accordance with the Court's plan. 
    Furthermore, the District Court retained jurisdiction, permanent jurisdiction apparently to pass on any future claims that the plaintiffs' might have regarding any future plan of apportionment which the legislature might draft, sort of a super legislative veto. 
    The State of Indiana appealed. 
    On January 6, the Governor moved the District Court to stay its judgment. 
    The District Court refused. 
    The state on January 20 -- 
    The next day, the Governor applied to this Court for a stay, the judgment of the District Court, and on February 2, this Court granted the Governor's application for a stay. 
    The 1970 election was conducted under the 1965 Act. 
    This is the Act that was specifically submitted to the District Court in the second Stout case. 
    The District Court specifically approved the constitutionality of that Act. 
    The District Court in that case specifically found that the 1965 Act met the standards laid down by this Court. 
    Turning to the first issue, the state submits that constitution does not in fact require racial, socioeconomic groups to be proportionally represented in the state legislature by representatives elected from that ethnic group. 
    The District Court's judgment in this case that the residents of the Center Township area -- 
    That the vote of the residents of the Center Township area was canceled out, was based on two erroneous assumptions. 
    First, that the Center Township Negro area was proven on this record to exist as a distinct from cohesive area apart from the rest of the County. 
    The second erroneous assumption upon which the District Court based its judgment is that fewer legislative persons resided in the Center Township area, than in the Washington Township area, the adjoining area.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Did the District Court reapportioned all of the state?

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, that (Inaudible) to that present situation [Inaudible].
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="805.340" stopTime="901.214">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    Well, that's a matter of some speculation, Your Honor. 
    The primary holding in this case -- 
    well, first of all you have the District Court's decision in 1965 which had already passed on the constitutionality of the 1965 Act under the “one man, one vote” principles of Reynolds. 
    Now, along comes this case, about four years later. 
    The Court looks at it and says, well, first of all this Court has changed the standards, secondly, we now have a new theory, the Banzhaf analysis that multi-member and single-member districts are inherently unconstitutional. 
    The Court went from the finding that these defendants, these plaintiffs were invidiously discriminated against, it went from that finding to the conclusion that the entire state had to be reapportioned. 
    It is just -- 
    There is a complete gap in there as to why the whole state had to be reapportioned. 
    The District Court specifically said that when once Marion County, it sub districted, there would be unallowable variances, but that's patently absurd. 
    Either it was malapportioned -- 
    well, you have legislators for persons in there, it's going to be the same after you reapportion as it was before, either it was okay before or it wasn't, but the District Court already said it was.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="901.214" stopTime="919.461">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Was this theory that as illustrated by the Marion County situation, multi- member districts where the Court concluded were constitutionally invalid, and that is what led it to reapportioning entire state, isn't it?
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="919.461" stopTime="921.978">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    Yes, that's exactly the way they went.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="921.978" stopTime="928.473">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Began by seeing the effect of the multi-member Marion County district, the effect on this ghetto area?
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="928.473" stopTime="929.058">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="929.058" stopTime="948.577">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that led it to the conclusion, the District Court's conclusion that multi-member districts generally were constitutionally invalid, and that in turn led it to look to the rest of the State and it found that in Lake County and elsewhere there were multi-member districts, and that is what led it to state-wide reapportionment. 
    Wasn't that [Voice Overlap] reasoning or am I wrong?
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="948.577" stopTime="952.522">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    I think that's a reasonable explanation of what happened. 
    I think that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="952.522" stopTime="992.440">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I thought the court would have reached the same result and redistrict the whole state even if it had not found that looking at Marion County alone, that the multi-member district canceled out to voting power of some group. 
    I thought the court would have said that, the multi-member districts as multi-member districts give multi-member districts too much power compared to single-member district. 
    So, they could have reached this reapportioning the whole State result, without identifying any particular group within Marion County as having been disenfranchised?
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="992.440" stopTime="1006.015">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    That would have been a reason to reapportion the entire State. 
    That would not have been a reason to sub-district, necessarily a reason to sub-district, while I guess it follows that Marion County would have to be sub-districted because it's the largest district in the State.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1006.015" stopTime="1010.231">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    All multi-member districts would have had to – (Voice Overlap) upon.
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="1010.231" stopTime="1011.683">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    One of the problems in --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1011.683" stopTime="1013.170">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Did the court go that route or not?
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="1013.170" stopTime="1198.985">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    I think they did, I think they did. 
    An interesting part of that preposition is that the court only found in favor of Mason Bryant who was a member of the multi-member district. 
    There was no member -- 
    The court didn't, if the court is going to find that someone's rights have been violated, then it has to have the man before it who's right has been violated. 
    Mason Bryant under the court's analysis was over represented. 
    The court had no one -- 
    well, the court filed in favor of no one before it in terms of having being under represented, the court went both ways. 
    In the invidious discrimination argument, breaking up the Marion County district, the Court found that Mason Bryant was under represented. 
    Applying the Banzhaf analysis, the Court found that Marine County was over represented. 
    They tried to have it both ways. 
    To reach the court's decision in this case as the Marine County multi-member district, it had to first find -- first had to section off a distinct area then had to compare -- divide some meaningful basis to compare that area to another area. 
    To do that, it conducted what it called a statistical analysis, which I won't to treat here because I feel that I have adequately treated it in brief, but I feel that the statistical analysis the court applied amounts to gross speculation, that the Center Township Negro area amounts to a separate distinct area within the county. 
    The second step which the court used was to compare the ratios, the ratio of legislator per person of the Center Township Negro area to the Washington Township area. 
    To do this, the township lines, the township boundaries; these two -- these areas that are being compared have to have some political significance. 
    Implied in the court's decision is that somehow legislate -- residents in Washington Township are better represented, but a legislator from Washington Township doesn't represent all the legislators in the County, but somehow he only represents the residents in Washington Township. 
    Somehow the residents of Washington Township are specially benefited by having legislators elected from there. 
    That somehow Washington Township legislators did not represent residents of the Center Township Negro area. 
    The record refutes those conclusions. 
    One of the plaintiffs' in this case Mr. Chavis was a resident of Washington Township. 
    He testified that when he was in the Legislature he represented the interest of the Center Township Negroes. 
    The record in this case shows that a legislator living outside of the Center Township Negro area can represent the interest of the Center Township Negroes.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Was there any testimony before the Court contradicting Mr. Chavis' testimony?

    No, Your Honor. 
    Not at all, that was a --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1209.338" stopTime="1214.910">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is there any evidence in the record discriminatory (Inaudible)?
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="1214.910" stopTime="1215.423">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    None.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1215.423" stopTime="1216.973">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Racial discrimination?
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="1216.973" stopTime="1344.295">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    No discrimination, Your Honor. 
    As a matter of fact, the record in this case, Mr. Chavis testified, that in these two areas the laws were perfectly inadequate, in the areas of welfare and unemployment compensation. 
    He said, the laws are adequate. 
    The problem is with the attitudes of the people that are administering those laws. 
    That's not a problem of discrimination. 
    That's not this kind of problem of discrimination, that's another kind of problem. 
    Our concern here is whether these people are represented in the legislature. 
    The record –- okay -- in the same regard Chavis also testified that the interest of the Center Township Negroes were shared -- were common with the residents of the rest of the county, with the residents of the rest of the State, that's it was counted with Negroes living in areas outside of the Center Township area. 
    The significance of this is that, if the interest of the Negroes living in the Center Township are not being fully pushed along, fully been taken care of, that neither the interest of citizens in other areas of the State. 
    In the same regard, we have only to look at the statutes of the State of Indiana, their welfare laws -- 
    We also have consumer protection laws, unemployment compensation. 
    Any interest that you can think of that the plaintiffs in this case claimed they had, there is a law providing for that, there is a law provided for that. 
    I think that's an example of the fact that their interests have not been ignored in the legislature.

    Well, the District Court says, that the Center Township Negroes have compelling interests in things like urban renewal, and welfare, legislation, law and order, schooling, education, health, so on and so forth. 
    These were the compelling interests of the Center Township Negroes. 
    They are piece of the interest that we share with those people in common. 
    It's an interest we have in common. 
    And there are laws in the books that attempt to regulate or in some way take care of these interests and I think this an example of fact that their interest are not ignored.

    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    I'm sorry, I didn't fully understand your question.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1451.272" stopTime="1467.720">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, would you say that the control was of different kind, or of different character that than control that Congress exercises over the execution of laws. 
    I'm trying to get the general point of view. 
    Different in what respect?
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="1467.720" stopTime="1634.183">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    I wouldn't say is it's the difference, Your Honor, I would say it's the same sort of control that Congress would have, only probably less so because of the fact that, I apparently mean (Inaudible) there are no, there are a few standing committees, but the characteristics between the two, I think they are parallel. 
    One other example of fact that the, one other fact to show that the legislative interest of the Center Township Negroes are not ignored, is the tax money that's appropriated for the very things that the District Court said they were most interested in; urban renewal, schools, education, health, welfare, unemployment compensation. 
    The tax money that's appropriated, that goes into this areas is disproportionately large as the money that's going into the rest of the county. 
    The remedy correct the delusion which the District Court found to exist in Marion County was the subdistrict of Marion County. 
    The State submits that this a retreat to the separate but equal doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson. In requiring that the districts -- that the Center Township Negro areas be separately districted, District Court was saying, let's make them separate but equal. 
    If it is -- if the decision of the District Court is allowed to stand, districts must be drawn to separate and segregate citizens on the basis of race, color, creed, economic conditions, and other special interests. 
    It wouldn't be unreasonable to carry that out a step further and if we are going to have ethnic or proportional representation, perhaps the next suit will be a suit against the State to increase the size of its legislature so that these interests can be represented with some degree of precision. 
    In the final analysis, I think what we're dealing with here is a special interest group. 
    The Center Township Negroes in this case claimed to have special interest. 
    Well, we all do. 
    As a lawyer I have special interest. 
    As a citizen my interest may differ from someone else, but I have special interest. 
    Taken to its logical conclusion, the District Court would require that every special interest have its own representatives, may it be a lawyer's representative or a school representative. 
    Heretofore we have called these people obvious but we haven't given them a representative to represent them in the legislature.

    Are the legislatures that you refer to parties to the action?

    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    No, no, they were just legislative leaders. 
    That's one of the committees or -- 
    I can't really say how it is that these people came together to submit this plan, but they did, but the legislature was not in session.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1703.689" stopTime="1708.043">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But it's -- the record is perfect and clear as if they were not parties to this action?
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="1708.043" stopTime="1711.085">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    Oh yes! 
    Quite clear.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1711.085" stopTime="1713.751">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Were they ordered or requested to --
speaker="william_f_thompson" startTime="1713.751" stopTime="1884.972">
    Mr. William F. Thompson 
    Well, as the action started out it was initiated against all the legislators. 
    But then the Governor was added, and the legislature was dropped and the Governor was left in the action. 
    The Governor is the only defendant appellant now left in this action on behalf of the State. 
    In conclusion with respect to this proportional representation issue, the designation of the Center Township Negro area implies the singling out on the basis of race and color. 
    You can't single this area out without looking at the race of the people living there, their economic condition and so on. 
    Separately districting Marion County -- no separately districting the Center Township Negroes is a singling on the basis of race and color. 
    You can't draw the lines around it -- around this group, unless you look at them and determine in advance before you draw those lines what is their race, what is their color, what is their creed, so on and so forth. 
    This Court has uniformly condemned all such attempts, and should do so in this case by reversing a decision on the District Court. 
    The other issue I want to hit upon briefly is the Banzhaf issue, the striking down, finding all multi-member districts unconstitutional per se. 
    It has always been thought, it's been implied and accepted that although a voter in a multi-member district had an advantage because he had more representatives from which to --for whom to vote, that this advantage was offset by the fact that he was a part of the larger electorate competing with him to vote for these individuals. 
    This has been challenged by John Banzhaf and others. Banzhaf analysis briefly is that voters in the Marion County multi-member district were over-represented vis-à-vis smaller multi-member districts and single member-districts within the state. 
    There was an inherent disparity and it was based on rather complex mathematical equations which he devised. 
    It was on the basis of this that the Court required, the District Court required the State to reapportion the entire state. 
    The problem with Banzhaf's theory is that first of all as it relates to this case, no independent study was made of Indiana. 
    The figures and maps, exhibits, and so on and so forth used by Banzhaf in this case where those supplied to him by the plaintiffs.

    Immediately after the complaint was filed, request for admissions 118 in number were filed. 
    The complaint itself with the 69-page document which is set forth full in the appendix and the request permissions were likewise lengthy. 
    Before the trial, all of these request permissions which covered every aspect of the complaint were admitted and at the trial, the admitted requests were admitted into evidence without objection. 
    Also during the trial, numerous other documents from the state library were available, and the court had an abundance of evidence before it, all of which was admitted and was un-contradicted and as we will outline did present a full case under Fortson v. Dorsey, and Burns v. Richardson justifying the sub-districting of Marion County, Indiana, but something else took place before the trial of this cause. 
    The Kirkpatrick v. Preisler decision was rendered, and with the result that at the very beginning of the trial and it appears at the page 133 of the appendix, Justice Turner, the presiding judge took -- stated that the court was taking judicial notice of the fact that the State of Indiana is malapportioned and thus the court had little choice what to do. 
    As it developed that the State of Indiana's districts, one of which was before the court, or at that time malapportioned so bad they had greater divergences of population that even the dissenting in opinions, in Kirkpatrick v. Preisler indicated would be allowable.

    Mr. James Manahan

    They were not scheduled to begin a new reapportionment until this coming January, next month and they were scheduled to hold an election as they did in the meantime.

    Mr. James Manahan 
    Yes, there was only more election to be held before there would be a reapportionment, or a attempted reapportionment in normal course. 
    The State of Indiana also has notable record for having a great deal of difficulty for its legislators to agree upon apportionment. 
    In this case they gave the State of Indiana and adequate length of time to hold a general assembly session and reapportion itself, before they acted.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Manahan, in the posture that this case now presents itself to us, I was wondering why it hadn't become moot?

    Mr. James Manahan 
    Yes, it was Your Honor.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And like you just told us that in the early next year there is going to be and will be a reapportionment based on the 1970 census?

    Mr. James Manahan 
    Early next year there is scheduled to be, an attempt for --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2250.785" stopTime="2271.794">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As we know general elections in Indiana I guess till -- until that has become effective, so this thing is just in limbo, and has no applicability to any elections, has it? 
    It did not apply to the 1970 election, it will not apply to any elections after early next year.
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="2271.794" stopTime="2275.133">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    The court's plan would not conceivably ever apply to any election.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2275.133" stopTime="2277.936">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Any election, so why isn't this moot?
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="2277.936" stopTime="2292.134">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    The court, the lower court has stated that there will be -- that the Marion County, Indiana must be sub-districted to have constitutional plan. 
    It also has -- that there is a presumption.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2292.134" stopTime="2298.751">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Court didn't need to state that. 
    We all know that any enforcement has to conform to the United States Constitution?
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="2298.751" stopTime="2328.299">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    Yes, but sub-districting, Your Honor and sub-districting is not allowable under the Indiana constitution except under the Supremacy Clause. 
    And so it was necessary for our Federal Court to find or for the State Court -- for a Court to find under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause that Marion County, Indiana must be sub-districted otherwise it will not be sub-districted in the next apportionment and the entire case which we have tried will be there again.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2328.299" stopTime="2346.771">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I see so that the significance of this this three-judge District Court decision is that if it is affirmed or remains undisturbed, the Indiana legislature will be obligated not to create any multi-member districts.
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="2346.771" stopTime="2370.247">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    They can create all the multi-members, definitely. 
    The District Court's opinion only states there is presumption favoring uniform districts and did cite the Banzhaf theory as well as other matters to show that a natural “one man, one vote” violation does result from having multi-member districts of differing size. 
    But the single member districting is in no way called for by the lower court's opinion.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2370.247" stopTime="2375.949">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, then why isn't this moot? 
    If it doesn't even have that much of effect, why isn't it moot?
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="2375.949" stopTime="2391.332">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    The lower court says there must be uniform districting and there is anything but uniform districts in Indiana and it says, they must be small enough such that the vote of the ghetto area which they found to, just as a fact, would not be diluted or canceled out.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2391.332" stopTime="2398.036">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well you mean by that, that in such districts they must have single representatives?
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="2398.036" stopTime="2405.109">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    Not single. 
    They must be small enough in number, and the court indicated that three-man districts will be small enough in number or perhaps even four man districts.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2405.109" stopTime="2450.744">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I want to see how far this goes. 
    Suppose you have an area where it was demonstrated that an area just is big as the one you have here, same size, same shape. 
    Same people who were preserving, let is say Germanic culture, essentially spoke German, they had bilingual services in Churches, both Catholic and Protestant and preserve many, many indicia of their own tradition and culture. 
    Would this Court's orders say that they must (Inaudible) around these people of Germanic origins and let them elect their separate representative?

    And what's it's based --

    Mr. James Manahan 
    Well, the difference --

    -- distinguish that from there --
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="2455.594" stopTime="2512.046">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    Your Honor we didn't -- well, greatly we have a difference. 
    We did prove, we did submit proof in six elements which we believed were necessary under Fortson v. Dorsey, and Burns v. Richardson to require a sub-districting of a large multi-member district. 
    We did in this case prove the existence of a minority group of the type you described, (Inaudible). 
    We also proved that they were, that they lived in a contagious compact area so that a difference in districting could make a difference. 
    We also proved and we think the proof was very substantial that they were sufficient in population in these areas to affect the election or non-election of representatives of them, if there were an impartial districting of smaller districts, not the district drawn calculated to enhance their vote, but simply impartially drawn smaller districts. 
    Finally, we also proved that they had substantiative interest.

    Does the smaller district -- is the smaller district drawn to identify a particular group?
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="2517.372" stopTime="2555.324">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    Absolutely not. 
    The District with the support group did nothing of a kind, near squares which totally ignore what they found to be the "ghetto area” and at the back of the appellee's motion to dismiss or affirm does appear an illustrate of what was found to be the "ghetto area” and the district line which the court drew. 
    There are in no sense -- the district lines are no sense coterminous with the boundaries of the ghetto area. 
    They are a series of squares and near squares which cut through the ghetto area ignoring its existence. 
    As the District Court said in its original opinion, distinct lines must be drawn with an eye that is color blind.

    The District Court did render declaratory judgment to the effect that there is in Marion County, Indiana based on 1967 and a later statics a ghetto area with a minority group residing therein which has substantive interest which diverges significantly from those as a county as a whole and then in response to those interests engages in a vote in pattern, which diverges significantly from that as a county as a whole, and that the size of the county, the size of this multi-member district is so great that it dilutes and cancels out that significant vote by that there was a significant substantiative interest. 
    That declaratory judgment was rendered by the lower court, and it is very significant what type of districting will be drawn in the forthcoming general assembly whether or not that declaratory judgment is upheld in this Court.

    Because it is a redistricting case as opposed to a reapportionment case.

    It would be a great problem under Kirkpatrick v.

    The court finds that the only practical remedy for such unconstitutional deprivation of voting strength is the elimination of the large multi-member House or Senate districts in Marion County.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It maybe a good reason, but the fact is you are suggesting that the holding was that if I get what you just said, the legislature is still free to construct multi-member districts so long as there are a smaller number of members in each district?

    But when they came around however constructing their own plan and for Marion County?
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="3314.978" stopTime="3317.559">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    No, for the entire state, they did single-member districts.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3317.559" stopTime="3320.097">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So single-member districts under the Court plan --
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="3320.097" stopTime="3320.873">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    Is what they drew, yeah.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3320.873" stopTime="3323.149">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And you say there is an explanation for that?
speaker="james_manahan" startTime="3323.149" stopTime="3535.454">
    Mr. James Manahan 
    Yes, they want to set up rules in advance so that different groups could participate for both plans. 
    They needed a rule such that a comparison could be made between plans. 
    So they made a least political decision, just said, well all single-member districts and we'll take the plan that's best that has the least population deviation which is what they did. 
    The population deviation turned out to be less than 1% throughout the state, and that was the purpose of it. 
    And I would like to turn immediately to the question of uniform districts and why we believe they are constitutionally required in Indiana. 
    There was a very strong presentation in the lower court. 
    It was un-contradicted and both sides affirmatively presented affirmative proof that when they are in the Indiana general assembly, multi-member district delegation, at least that went from Marion County vote in bluff at the behest of the party organization and that they do not vote on their own, and there was very few matters. 
    It also was proven that they are elected in bluff that during the past 40 years, only twice has a member of a party which lost generally in an election been elected to the Indiana general assembly from Marion County, Indiana. 
    During the other elections, with those two exceptions, either one party slate or the other was elected. 
    The evidence also showed that there during all primary elections in recent memory, the official party organization slate was nominated to run for the Indiana general assembly and persons not supported by the organization slate, were not nominated in such primary. 
    The evidence also showed that those persons who became, on the organization slate were throughly controlled by the central committee of the party organization. 
    And so in effect, this multi-membered district delegation which is and has historically been elected from Marion County is a unit rule delegation controlled at one source. 
    This has two results. 
    This demonstrates that parochial interest such as those of a ghetto area could not realistically be represented, and Pat Chavis, the plaintiff who had been the sole black senator in the Indiana general assembly during the past 10 years, represented that he could not effectively represent his people because he had to do in each vote what his county chairman wanted him to do. 
    And we presented evidence showing what present and past members have done on role call, voting constantly in bluff. 
    This is pertinent to the dilution of black people and the ghetto area of Marion County, Indiana and is also pertinent to the district court's finding that multi-member districts of different size can be inherently unconstitutional. 
    What – what it amounted to was that the proof showed that the multi-membered district allegations are the same as if you have weighted voting because they voted as one in Marion County, it's the same as having one representative with 15 votes, and one from Lake County with 11.

    No. 
    The history is that we have never had single-member districts and have never broken up any county for any districting of any kind in the general assembly in the history of the State of Indiana.

    It has been my impression that in the absence of rational discrimination as such, our cases have held that the sort of considerations that entered into the District Courts' decision were not only -- not required by the constitution, but that they were prohibited by the constitution. 
    I am thinking of cases such as Carrington against Rash that said that you couldn't regulate the franchise depending upon your prediction as to how people are going to vote. 
    I am thinking about Wells against Rockefeller that said New York couldn't constitutionally try to justify a three apportionment scheme by showing any community of interest, but it had to be all the matter of mathematics. 
    Am I mistaken in my reading of those cases?

    Mr. James Manahan 
    No those cases say and Fortson v. Dorsey and Burns v. Richardson say what they say and we've brought this entire action based upon what those two majority opinions of this Court and almost anonymous opinion in one case said, and those are the two decisions we are specifically relying on. 
    Their language and what they said would count as a good redistricting case.

    Number two, 65 -- the state has been permanently enjoined from enforcing the 1965 Act.
