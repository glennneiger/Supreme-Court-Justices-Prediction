Coates v. City of Cincinnati

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We’ll hear arguments next in number 117, Coates against the City of Cincinnati. 
    Mr. Lavercombe, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="45.257" stopTime="205.817">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    Thank you sir. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This appeal concerns a Cincinnati ordinance which is called the loitering ordinance, but which is really more an unlawful assembly type piece of legislation. 
    The ordinance provides that when in the company of two or more other people, one so conducts himself as to annoy persons passing by, a crime is committed, unless that conduct takes place at the public meeting of citizens, in which case, it is not crime. 
    Hamilton County, Ohio includes Cincinnati and the number of other municipalities and several of them have also had ordinances using similar language. 
    In the 1940, the common police court for Hamilton County which has county wide jurisdiction held that the language used made the legislation unconstitutional. 
    All over Ohio, the courts reached the same conclusion through the years and in 1968, the appeals court for the Cleveland area wrote in detail at length and with emphasis how the lack of ascertainable standards made the annoyance test in the Cleveland ordinance cause it to represent an unconstitutional exercise of the police power, and it was therefore void for vagueness. 
    That opinion is quoted at length at pages 5 and 6 in our jurisdictional statement and was written by the same judge who in 1970, he wrote so strongly to the opposite effect in a 4 to 3 decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in this case of Coates versus Cincinnati. 
    But at least between 1940 and 1968, the annoyance test was considered to be void for vagueness. 
    Indeed in 1962, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that a dog barking ordinance which used the annoyance test was void for vagueness. 
    But in 1967 during the summer, Cincinnati along with many other areas had racial disturbances, and the police and perhaps more significantly, other city officials frequently found themselves irritated or provoked, annoyed by the conduct of those who complained and those who disturbed. 
    And members of the city Government including police were not able to charge many of those who irritated them with trespass or assault and battery or profanity or disorderly conduct. 
    So the officials and the police who were beset by annoyance which Webster’s collegiate dictionary in the 7th Edition defines as a wearing on the nerves by persistent petty unpleasantness, they arrested those who provoke them and hold them away and that ended the annoyance for a very short time, because that use of that legislative language making annoyance a crime, directly results in contempt for our system of law and order, or I think more properly law and order with the justice.

    The only -- I believe Mr. Nichols can correct me, I believe the facts -- I have to correct myself -- I believe the facts were presented to the trial court to some degree but no effort was made to incorporate them in the Bill of Exceptions and they have not going to part of the appeal.

    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    Yes, yes, I certainly do. 
    But I maintain this statute is so broad and I’ve attempted to cite the cases that illustrate that the cases -- decisions of this Court. 
    I maintain that that annoyance is so broad that even though there maybe factual circumstances which could properly be used for a valid conviction, we can’t take a chance on that. 
    It’s too dangerous to allow this annoyance thing and the inconvenient --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But where -- they were charged under the statute and let’s assume the evidence at the trial showed the conduct which anybody would know was covered by the statute, there couldn’t be much doubt about it?

    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    I have to disagree, Your Honor. 
    I don’t see how anybody can just find what annoyance is. 
    I’m sure you and I would have difference standards of annoyance.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="331.612" stopTime="337.082">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, your answer really is that there is nothing, no conduct that you can think of that would be annoying?
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="337.082" stopTime="344.322">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    I think we have to apply a certain degree of reason there. 
    I’m sure that you and I or anyone in this room could designate certain conduct as annoying.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="344.322" stopTime="349.009">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, let’s assume your clients gathered on the street and engaged in precisely that conduct?
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="349.009" stopTime="357.428">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    Right. 
    Then, they should have been -- that conduct would then have also been as I understand the basic idea of criminal law only those acts which in legislation are crimes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="357.428" stopTime="367.878">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I agree that it may -- that conduct may have violated some other statutes, but the question is whether it violated this one?
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="367.878" stopTime="368.287">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    Right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="368.287" stopTime="372.492">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And that conduct you concede that anybody would say was annoying?
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="372.492" stopTime="373.176">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    Right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="373.176" stopTime="383.115">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And so, there wouldn’t be any doubt in the minds of someone engaging in that conduct that it was the kind of conduct that was clearly proscribed by the statute?
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="383.115" stopTime="387.720">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    Right. 
    I agree with that. 
    But I say that that does not of itself granting which Your Honor says --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="387.720" stopTime="389.050">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well then how could -- oh, go ahead.
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="389.050" stopTime="400.655">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    -- granting what Your Honor says. 
    I say it is too dangerous to allow that broad general characterization of conduct to be a tool in the hands if you will of lazy policemen, who were still on the level of official.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="400.655" stopTime="426.498">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that’s the different -- that’s a -- I understand that argument. 
    What you really saying that is that even if, even if this defendant knew precisely and had plenty of notice that his conduct was covered by the statute, nevertheless the contours of annoyance are so vague in general that the statute should be stricken down and the state should not even be able to prosecute under the statute?
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="426.498" stopTime="427.164">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    I think I’ve to --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="427.164" stopTime="430.552">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Those people whose conduct is clearly covered by it?
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="430.552" stopTime="452.741">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    I think I have to agree completely with what you just said, yes sir. 
    And in that connection, there are number of decisions of this Court over the years which go in two different areas. 
    One is the area that you have just alluded to, and the other is the area where there is a permissible interpretation, and that those cases are far more sophisticated than the argument I’m attempting to present here. 
    I’m trying to state the single issue you phrased.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="452.741" stopTime="458.074">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why didn’t you bring the -- why is it, why does that the record have the facts in?
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="458.074" stopTime="520.625">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    I find that a very difficult question which I’ve been anticipating for some months. 
    It’s easy for me to say Your Honor that I didn’t get the hold of this case until the Supreme Court of Ohio decided, but candor compels me to indicate that I’ve a -- it seems to me that if this ordinance, not statute, these are ordinance, if this ordinance was ever to get an authoritative interpretation, it had to come up on the law alone and not on the facts because for years, the local officials have been running people and holding them and turning them lose and the local -- the lower courts have been finding them not guilty on the facts. 
    The perfect example is the Lathan Johnson case which is in appendix to my brief here. 
    It’s a very short opinion and that’s the one who started all this. 
    It arose out of the 1967 racial disturbances, and I tried that case and the state Court of Appeals said when they reversed, they said, this is probably unconstitutional this ordinance but we don’t have to decide that and you see by doing that, they --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="520.625" stopTime="523.455">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That’s the ordinance that it didn’t reach the facts then?
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="523.455" stopTime="575.795">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    No. 
    We have the facts there and they said there weren't any facts to support the conviction. 
    I tried that case -- it came up on full Bill of Exceptions. 
    But you see, that’s the pernicious part of this thing by having that weapon and having lower court judges who are disposed to leave that there, everyone knows is a practical matter that after the this fellow is hauled away from the area where he’s annoying somebody is either going to get dismissed in the police court the following morning or be it as it more worried about a full trial, he’s going to get dismissed eventually or if a trial court judge is so imbued with this ultra strictness that pervaded our community at the time these decisions were coming down, then the Court of Appeals is going to reverse. 
    And the only way this case ever got to the Supreme Court of Ohio were to our intense surprise, it was held constitutional was by not having any facts that they’re not. 
    I’m bothered but that’s the answer I must give you. 
    I don’t like it, but that’s the way it --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="575.795" stopTime="583.842">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You think the state court’s opinion reflects on the easiness to the fact that it had no facts before? 
    What the underlying --
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="583.842" stopTime="600.870">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    The state court’s opinion by the majority, the four -- four-judge decision complaints I would say rather bitterly Your Honor about that. 
    The dissenting opinion says they don’t need any facts. 
    They said it’s solely a constitutional question on the language of the face of the ordinance. 
    It’s a four to three decision there.

    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    I’m embarrassed to say I don’t know what it says in there. 
    I’ve read it for several weeks and I just don’t know Your Honor. 
    The only facts that I’ve attempted to present is that the appellant Coates was a student demonstrator and the other appellants were pickets in labor dispute.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun

    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    There’s a reference to that in my appendix. 
    The judge in passing sentence referred to that in the -- in our brown appendix Your Honor, but it doesn’t’ reach a conclusion. 
    He says well, there may have been traffic flow, and if there was as I recall his statement, there may have been traffic flow impeded and after was, they should have charged him under -- they could have charged him under that.

    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    I’ve been trying cases for so long that I’ve to discipline myself not to speak outside the record. 
    Of course, I know what happened Your Honor. 
    I know what happened. 
    I know where Coates is marching up and down on main street in the city of Cincinnati on the flag with a bunch of student demonstrators and they were dirty, unkempt, unshaven any college demonstrators. 
    I know that, and I know the rest of these appellants. 
    I’ve never met them, but I made inquiry. 
    Obviously and I know that they were at a labor dispute. 
    I’m quite sure was the General Electric plant in one of the suburbs of Cincinnati, and the employer, the – management got mad at him and have him arrested for loitering. 
    I’m sorry to misled Your Honor. 
    I’ve difficulty transposing from what’s on the record and what’s not on the record.

    What is different, what is different about the situation you just alluded to that is what some policeman evaluates at a particular time in this context and the policeman who stops a person for speeding and it’s his opinion version of the speed against the drivers, or he arrests him for weaving in traffic and changing lanes, is there anything really --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Yes, clearly defined, but is there any difference -- any difference on this key thing that you emphasize, namely that it comes down to what annoys a policeman and why is that any different from what the policeman thinks is weaving in traffic or speeding?
speaker="robert_r_lavercombe" startTime="898.142" stopTime="912.468">
    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    Surely, because what annoys a policeman is not susceptible to same definition for all policemen. 
    But what is speeding in traffic is 35 miles or an hour or 38 miles an hour and that is susceptible to exact definition and weaving, I submit to you as virtually the same, accordingly the weaving doesn’t --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="912.468" stopTime="929.351">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The definition is quite is true, the definition, but I’m talking about the evaluation process that leads the policeman to making the arrest and almost invariably then in turn leads to a conviction because there are only two witnesses, the driver and the policeman.

    It's for you to decide whether this is on one side or the other, the dividing line. 
    I think and I’m urging that annoyance is too far, too far from the center or too far from a clearly definable dividing line within the context of the attempt on making to answer your question.

    Would you agree or not that in shaping ordinances of this kind, in this general area of behavior which can’t be precisely defined, that the public authority, the legislative body is trying to make an accommodation between having conduct which is identified as subject to a penalty in order to prevent any victims in this case, the person’s annoyed or upset or aggravated from taking the line with their own hands and engaging in a street riot --

    Mr. Robert R. Lavercombe 
    I’m very strongly in favor both emotionally and -- in this case with the principle of accommodation in balance. 
    I do not think that this test is annoyance test is properly within a goodwill application of that concept for want of a more thought out phrase. 
    I don’t think a legislature can or the court should approve a -- an attempt to accommodate that is -- that leaves that much up to guess work. 
    Who would know in advance -- Mr. Justice White was asking about this atrocious event? 
    Well, let’s get --for a moment, let’s get away from the atrocious of event. 
    Let’s get to one that’s almost atrocious. 
    Well, who knows in advance when he’s going down the street, whether -- if you’re a policeman, whether you’re going to find that annoying or whereas a different policeman who had a different set of circumstances when he left home that morning or a different degree of comfort -- comfort would be equally annoyed? 
    That’s the area that I pursue to be the danger here. 
    And by doing that, you see, that leads me to the what I consider to be one of the most important points here, that leads me into what I conceive to be this contempt that this thing develops and promotes contempt for the law.

    That involved a so called loyalty oath which people refused to take and all we had there was the language of the statute. 
    Now, the case that comes to mind in a quite a different area, the First Amendment area, is Times Film against Chicago where deliberately again, counsel very deliberately kept all the facts away from the courts all the way through up to and including this Court and we just had the language in the statute that involved prior restraint of the motion picture film.

    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    The failure of the appellant here to present facts has been a problem for us as well in this matter, and with the permission of the Court very briefly, the broad statement that Mr. Lavercombe made with regard to the activity involved, is correct. 
    What happened was on December 7, 1967 with regard to the defendant Coates, he and several confederates gathered outside the United States Federal Building in Downtown, Cincinnati, which is directly across Main Street from the post office and courthouse. 
    And there Coates and his confederates where demonstrating against the Vietnamese war and the selective service system. 
    Their demonstration went so far as to block the doors to the federal building so that --

    This is what -- as I indicated Your Honor, this is one of the problems that we as appellees have had with regard to this case. 
    On the face of the ordinance, which is the complaint that brings this case to this Court, we don’t think that Section 901-L6 of the Cincinnati Code of Ordinances is vague nor is it overbroad.

    Either; correct.

speaker="a_david_nichols" startTime="2038.686" stopTime="2182.667">
    Mr. A. David Nichols 
    I don’t think so or I don’t think we could try, that we can set a defender up and shoot him down like that if you will with the variety of charges, such as we often times find in the traffic area where over zealous police officers quite candidly, set somebody up with driving one of the influence of alcohol, reckless operation and a myriad of other things. 
    This is totally wrong. 
    I don’t think in this case that we could charge, nor could we try individuals engaged in that conduct for both disorderly conduct and loitering. 
    If I may respond just a bit further with regard to this ordinance. 
    This ordinance was drafted and passed on September 3, 1856, that’s about a 125 years ago. 
    At the time this ordinance was passed, of course, our constitutional was 60, 70 years old. 
    This ordinance historically seems to be the compilation out of Blackstone and Hawkins approach to unlawful assembly which I think Mr. Lavercombe alluded to. 
    It was people gathering on the street, so as to put fear in the hearts of for early stout individuals within the community. 
    This was the opportunity for the community to protect itself against unlawful conduct; a conduct which was annoying because this was a river town. 
    This was a town we had a lot of individuals coming down the Ohio and becoming sometimes irresponsible in our community. 
    This was -- this is an ordinance which has continued since its passage and to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that it’s reached, certainly this Court, and this is the first time to the best of my knowledge that I think it’s been tested in the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio. 
    I don’t think there’s anything difficult about the term annoying as used in the ordinance which Mr. Lavercombe and his clients make their initial thrust against. 
    They say annoying, we don’t understand what that means. 
    Examination of dictionaries used in our high schools, colleges, grammar schools indicates that annoying means to trouble, to vex, to impede, to incommode. 
    This is the same definition of the Ohio Supreme Court applied.

    What we’re talking about with regard to this law or any law Your Honor is common sense approach to law. 
    We’re not -- I don’t think that this ordinance or any statute or any law or any regulation with regard in control of conduct should be drafted so that you have to be a student of the Harvard Law School before you understood what was involved, and I don’t think that this ordinance requires that.

    We’re here what three, four courts removed from the trial court.

    I think, this is one of those statutes. 
    I think that under the circumstances that we have to reach down and redefine annoying, and then we come up with a definition of annoying, and then that has to be redefined, and then we come back to the court to redefine that. 
    Pretty soon, annoying which is perfectly good term to describe conduct is no longer understandable because it’s been defined four or five times.

    But in those cases, though the term annoy was specifically under consideration, and in Fernandez versus Clinger, this Court denied certiorari in about 1966. 
    In that case, the court said the highest court for the State of California said with regard to term annoy and the citation is 346 F.2nd at page 212, “the words molest or annoy have accepted community meanings and are appropriate standards for a criminal statute.”

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let me ask you this question on this matter of vagueness. 
    I suppose as long as you got the half a million people down Cincinnati, you must have an ordinance about changing lanes in traffics so as to endanger the flow of traffic, that’s the way to put some times or changing lanes so as to create conditions for an accident. 
    Do you think that informs the drivers anymore than or any less than this ordinance informs people?
speaker="a_david_nichols" startTime="2757.395" stopTime="2899.250">
    Mr. A. David Nichols 
    Responding to Your Honor’s first question Mr. Chief Justice, yes, we have such an ordinance, and I think that ordinance like this ordinance says to the operator of an automobile or one who wishes to harangue his brothers on the street, you must do so as a reasonable man. 
    You must operate within the limits of your demonstration. 
    You must operate within the limits of the reasonable man using due care with what you’re about. 
    There are -- I don’t know if I’ve totally respondent to you -- to your question Mr. Chief Justice other than to say that throughout the law, there are those areas which can’t be uniformly and minutely defined because when that happens, then nobody knows what the law is. 
    Judge White who is sitting as a district judge in a Northern District of Ohio, Western Division rendered in a decision on December 18, 1970 which I think carries some very good language with regard that what where about here today. 
    And in that case which is Steinberg versus Rhodes which has not been reported yet, but his case number C-70 289, December 18, 1970. 
    The case involved construction of language with regard to an abortion statute in the State of Ohio. 
    Judge White said on -- with regard to the approach of the plaintiffs in this case, he says that it appears to us that the vagueness which disturbs the plaintiffs herein results from their own strange construction of the language used, coupled with the modern notion among law review writers that anything that is not coached in numerous paragraphs of fine spun legal terminology is to imprecise to support a criminal conviction. 
    He went on to say the words of the Ohio statute in this particular case have over a long period of years proved entirely adequate to inform the public, both way and professional what is forbidden. 
    We think both of those points --

    Mr. A. David Nichols 
    This is the first time the highest court in the state, the Supreme Court of Ohio has ruled on this or any similar ordinance of its particular type. 
    There was one other case, that’s Beecher (ph) versus Columbus which was the loud dog barking case which did come up, and the court in that case held the law unconstitutional because it didn’t establish a vicinity of annoyance, that your going to have a barking dog on the East side of Columbus, somebody on the West side, get an affidavit that it was totally unworkable. 
    That’s not our case.

    Mr. A. David Nichols 
    That’s correct. 
    If -- judgment, I think is perhaps an element here and this Court, Judge Holmes in the matter of Nash versus the United States which is not in our brief, but a case I ran across when preparing for argument here, that’s recorded in 229 United States 373. 
    It’s 1913 antitrust criminal case. 
    And in that case, this Court was faced with a determination as to whether the term unduly was a term that was so broad and vague that a man could act to his peril and face imprisonment because his activities were such that they unduly restrained trade. 
    And judge -- Justice Holmes said, the law is full of instances where a man’s fate depends upon his judgment. 
    And he went on to say that a man must estimate rightly, correctly, and that is as the jury subsequently estimates that conduct. 
    And that if that individual fails in judging his conduct by contemporary standards, he may not only suffer a fine or imprisonment, but he may lose his life. 
    What we’re talking about here is the judgment of an individual in the intercourse social activity within his community based upon contemporary standards, and I submit that if we constantly have to redefine each and every term, which is a term of I think common understanding as the court in Fernandez versus Clinger and People versus Harvey thought it was, then, we’ll have even more problems across this land because people will say does annoy really mean what Webster’s says or it does means something else or what’s it all about.
