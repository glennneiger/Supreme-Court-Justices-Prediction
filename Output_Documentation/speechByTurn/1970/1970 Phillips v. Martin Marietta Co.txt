    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This case is before the Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    The case involves a question of statutory construction of Section 703 (a) of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
    The question before the Court is whether Section 703 (a) permits an employer to refuse to hire women with pre-school-age children, while hiring men with pre-school-age children. 
    The bona fide occupational qualification standard or exemption to the Act under Section 703 (e) is not involved in this case.

    Yes sir, I will. 
    Petitioner Mrs. Ida Phillips is the mother of 7 children, who range in age from 3-15 years, when she applied to work with respondent Martin Marietta Company. 
    In September, 1966, petitioner applied for a job with respondent as an assembly trainee in response to its advertisement of 100 such positions. 
    Petitioner had a high school diploma, which was the only stated qualification for the job. 
    However, respondent told her, that it would not consider her for the job because she was a woman with pre-school age children. 
    Thereafter, petitioner filed a timely charge, alleging discrimination because she was a woman with pre-school-age children with the EEOC. 
    The EEOC made a finding of reasonable cause to believe that the refusal to hire her because she was a woman with pre-school-age children, constituted a violation of the Act. 
    When the Commission was unable to obtain voluntary compliance, the Commission authorized her to file a suit, which she did. 
    After petitioner filed the suit, respondent filed a motion to dismiss, which the District Court treated as a motion to strike and struck from petitioner's claim -- from petitioner's complaint those allegations claiming that she was discriminated against because she was because she had pre-school-age children. 
    Thereafter, respondent answered the complaint admitting that its receptionist told petitioner she would not be considered because she was woman with pre-school-age children, but denying that they discriminated against her solely on the grounds of her sex. 
    Thereafter, respondent moved for summary judgment, which motion the District Court granted based on statistics that 70, approximately 75% of the people hired as assembly trainees were women.

    The theory of striking there was as a matter of law, discrimination against a person because of their sex-plus, as she being a woman with pre-school-age children did not constitute a violation of the Act.

    Remember, we can't be that sure that the traditional branch is necessarily in that category, I suppose?[Laughter]
speaker="william_l_robinson" startTime="376.906" stopTime="702.199">
    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    Yes sir, you are right. 
    Petitioner appealed the District Court's decision to the Fifth Circuit which affirmed and rather clearly announced a sex-plus exemption to the Act of which we find here. 
    The Court held that a per se violation of the Act can only be based solely on one of the categories of the Act and the petitioner had not been subjected to discrimination on the grounds of sex, because here there was a two pronged qualification, that is she was a woman with pre-school-age children, or in other words sex-plus. 
    Thus the lower courts in judicially engrafted on the Act a further exception based on sex-plus and we submit that this doctrine should be rejected for several reasons. 
    First, it conflicts with the basic purpose of Title VII. 
    The basic purpose of Title VII is to ensure that women, and other protected categories are not excluded or otherwise hindered in their employment opportunities on the the basis of stereotypic assumptions or prejudgments about their desirability as employees. 
    Rather the Act requires that an employer consider each person on an individual basis or present a bona fide occupational qualifications defense. 
    This is of course the defense that the statute provides. 
    In this case, the lower courts permitted respondent to exclude petitioner based on an unsupported assumption about differences between the normal relationship of working fathers and working mothers to their pre-school-age children. 
    It would seem that these differences are, that the father goes out and works, the mother stays home and takes care of the children. 
    This we submit is exactly the kind of stereotypic assumption, that Title VII is intended to prohibit. 
    It is of course true that many women do indeed stay home to take care of the children, on the other hand many don't. 
    The point of the statute is that they should be treated as individuals, rather than as members of a broad category. 
    The second reason we submit that the decision below should be reversed is that it conflicts with the language of the Act. 
    Section 703 on its face would seem to prohibit the policy of refusing to hire women with pre-school-age children while at the same time hiring men with pre-school-age children, the Act declares that it shall be an unlawful employment practice to fail or refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of such individual's sex. 
    The Court of Appeals attempted to avoid this plain language of the Act, by asserting that the Act only prohibits discrimination based solely on one of the categories. 
    However, the Senate by Roll call vote specifically rejected an amendment which would have inserted before each of the enumerations in the Act, the word sole. 
    In speaking against that amendment, Senator Case, one of the joint floor managers said that such an addition would completely vitiate the Act. 
    The sex-plus doctrine enunciated by the courts below in this case, clearly illustrates why that is so. 
    Restricting the sex-plus doctrine just to the notion of women with pre-school-age children. 
    It would exclude, based on a recent study done by the Department of Labor, 4.2 million women currently in the labor force from the protection of the Act, and allow solely on the grounds that they are women with pre-school-age children, their employers to discriminate against them. 
    This would go far toward vitiating the Act, but of course the sex-plus doctrine can easily be extended just as to women. 
    For example, an employer could, under this doctrine, announce a decision to refuse to hire based on sex-plus marital status or sex-plus an age requirement i.e. refuse to hire women who are 26 years of age or over, or refuse to hire women who are over 32. 
    Thirdly, if the Act permits discrimination on the basis of sex-plus, it would also seem to permit discrimination on the basis of race plus, religion plus, or nationality plus. 
    For example, an employer could then refuse to hire Negroes with chunky hair, or on the other hand Negroes with straight hair.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="702.199" stopTime="709.226">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you think that would follow automatically from the Court of Appeals' opinion?
speaker="william_l_robinson" startTime="709.226" stopTime="716.335">
    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    It would not follow automatically, but it is certainly a logical, rational application of the very doctrine.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="716.335" stopTime="719.413">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But would require quite an extension of that doctrine?
speaker="william_l_robinson" startTime="719.413" stopTime="801.413">
    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    No. 
    I don't think so at all. 
    The doctrine itself that is a factor, one of the enumerated categories plus another factor, is exactly the doctrine announced of Fifth Circuit. 
    The Fifth Circuit did note, and this might be what Your Honor is getting at, that when an enumerated category of the Act is added to -- another factor is added to an enumerated category of the Act that the Court must look to determine whether or not there is discrimination. 
    I suggest that, that is not a substantial qualification to the blanket doctrine. 
    The blanket doctrine, sex-plus removes this seemingly, facially -- discrimination on its face from the Act. 
    And I think that's for the reasons I have stated before directly contrary to the intent of the statute and the language of the Act. 
    Congress engrafted the exception that it sought to put onto the Act and when there is something which on its face discriminates against one of the enumerated categories, then the initial inquiry should end right there.

    That of course is correct, Your Honor. 
    No, if he wanted to refuse to hire women who are pregnant or on the basis of any other physical disability that has to do with sex, he could present his bona fide occupational qualification. 
    But, if indeed women who are pregnant can adequately perform his job, there is really no reason why he ought to be permitted to exclude.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

speaker="william_l_robinson" startTime="928.825" stopTime="954.252">
    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    I suggest that whenever there is sex-plus, you got to from the prima facie case of discrimination, it is on its face discrimination on the basis of sex. 
    And Congress has said that, if you want to avoid or defend successfully a charge of discrimination on the grounds of sex, then you have the defense of the bona fide occupational qualification, but that's all.

    I would note however that the Fourteenth and the Fifth Amendments to the Constitution cover government employment, and would thus prohibit the government from discriminating in its employment.

    He cannot however contend that he just doesn't think it's proper for women to dig ditches. 
    Congress has taken that prerogative from the employer, that is to make pre-judgments and to make moral decisions or decisions about what is proper on the basis on sex.

    And I think in interpreting the statute as lawyers and judges, we should interpret the sex provisions just as we do the others irrespective of when it was added. 
    In summary, so that I can reserve the rest of time for the rebuttal, I would like to say that Title VII is one of a number of congressional acts that seek to eliminate irrational all the factors from being utilized as a basis for employment and require that employment policies be based on rational factors.

speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1657.643" stopTime="1705.792">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This is the first case under Title VII, the Equal Employment Opportunities provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to be argued before this Court. 
    And for that reason as well as reasons reflected in the statistics about working mothers, reproduced in our brief, the United States believes the case to be an important one. 
    Before proceeding to the merits, I would like to make one correction of the brief that we filed in the case last April. 
    We stated in that brief that a petition for rehearing was filed in the Court of Appeals.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1705.792" stopTime="1707.077">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1707.077" stopTime="1736.855">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well, we stated it both on pages 2 and 3, and again on page 4, but we are informed by counsel for the parties that no such petition was filed. 
    We regret our error about this which resulted from the fact that the Court of Appeals under its own rule treated the request by one of the members of that Court for reconsideration of the panel decision as a petition for rehearing.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1736.855" stopTime="1739.782">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That's the common practice in all the Circuits, is it not?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1739.782" stopTime="1832.925">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    To my knowledge, but there is a specific rule about it in the Fifth Circuit, and the denial of the rehearing en banc, you will note in the record that denial begins with the statement on page 42 A of the record. 
    The petition for rehearing is denied and the Court having been polled at the request of one of the members of the Court and a majority of the Circuit judges not having voted in favor of it, rehearing en banc is also denied. 
    Now, I mentioned this correction because of the respondent's contention that the petition for certiorari is untimely. 
    We believe along with the petitioner that the petition is timely for reasons -- substantially for the reasons stated in the petitioner's reply brief and if the Court is satisfied, I would like to proceed to the merits of the case. 
    As already recounted, the summary judgment in this case was based on the factual parenthesis, partly assumed by the District Court that the respondent excludes men but not women -- excludes women but not men, I am sorry, that the respondent excludes women but not men with pre-school aged children from employment as assembly trainees.

    And that a higher percentage of women than of men who apply are hired for the job and that is essentially all the record there was, other than the complaint and the answer and the district judge's assumption that Martin Marietta did hire men with pre-school aged children for this job. 
    Since this is the first case under Title VII, I might say for purposes of clarity that in our view and the lower Federal Courts have quite uniformly agreed with this, a suit of this kind of a De novo proceeding completely. 
    The only record is the record made in Court, this is not a review of administrative decision, and there is no administrative record being reviewed in this kind of a suit, even though the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had investigated this compliant, and had --

    It doesn't benefit the children who depend on her for support either, that they are willing to hire other women. 
    She needs the job and that’s with her complaint was to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and that’s what her complaint is in Court.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is it contended and I heard somebody use the word rational, that a decision of that guy not to employ women, who have children in pre-school age, is irrational?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1989.238" stopTime="1994.257">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    We don’t contend that it is irrational, we contend that it’s illegal. 
    Congress made a judgment --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Somebody used the word, I was trying to get it (Inaudible) that connection.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2000.997" stopTime="2158.757">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Many things that are illegal may not be irrational. 
    Now in our view, the Courts below erred in holding that what had been alleged and assumed here was not a discrimination on the basis of sex. 
    It was a qualification for employment applied to members of one sex and not the other. 
    And therefore, on its face which is all that we have here, there was no attempt to justify it, the requirement is no less a forbidden discrimination then would be a state voting qualification requirement, that said that men with pre-school age children could vote, the women with pre-school age children couldn’t vote. 
    Could there be any doubt as to whether that violates the Nineteenth Amendment. 
    In other words, the error to us is a very basic one of not recognizing what it is that constitutes a discrimination. 
    You don’t have to exclude all women in order to be discriminating against women, when you exclude some of them on grounds that aren’t used to exclude men. 
    That’s in essence what this case is about, and as a matter of fact, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has itself apparently recognized that its sex plus standard is not a viable age interpret the Act. 
    In a recent decision of theirs, which to our way of thinking backs away quite considerably from this Phillip’s decision and this is an addition that we should make to our brief. 
    On page 12 of our brief, we refer at the end of the lengthy footnote on that page, this is page 12 of our brief, to a District Court decision in the Southern District of Florida called Lansdale against the United Airlines Company. 
    And there after the Court of Appeals decision in Martin Marietta, quite understandably the District Judge held, he was sitting there in the Fifth Circuit that it was no violation of the Act for the airline company to fire its stewardesses when they got married, even though it continued to employ its male stewards after they were married. 
    It was sex plus and the Fifth Circuit, it said it doesn't violate the Act.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    They are not -- [Attempt to Laughter] they have been appointed by the President.[Laughter] 
    Not only has the Fifth Circuit in our view backed away from the rationale of this decision, but as we read its brief in this Court the respondent doesn't itself contend that the broad holding of the Court allow should be sustained on the merits, and it’s suggests instead that a more fully developed record might show that its refusal to hire the petitioner didn't violate Title VII. 
    Well, it seems plain to us that what prevented development of the record was the erroneous granting of the summary judgment prematurely, and that a reversal and remand of the case that called for and on that premise, I would like to comment briefly on how some of the respondent's suggestions about development of the record seemed us to bear on the issues to be resolved on remand. 
    One suggestion is that, what the receptionist told the petitioner may not have accurately reflected the company's policy. 
    Now, that possibility might affect whether an injunction should be granted or what the terms of the injunction should be, but it would not in our view, be a defense to the charge of discrimination against the petitioner herself. 
    Her right to relief under the Act does not depend on whether there has been a pattern or general practice of discrimination. 
    Section 703 of the Act, which is set out in our brief on page 2, on which she relies, specifically forbids discrimination against “any individual” on account of sex. 
    And if that probation is to be effective employers must be held responsible of the acts of their agents, who have apparent authority to reject employment applicants. 
    Petitioner's only contact was with the receptionist. 
    There was no other spokesman of company policy for her and the company never undertook to resend the receptionist rejection of her employment application. 
    So, the practical, sensible way to apply the statute in our view is to look at the situation realistically from the standpoint of the person and upon whom the statute confers the right not to be discriminated against. 
    And that is precisely what this Court did in applying a similar right not to be discriminated against, under the Interstate Commerce Act, in Boynton against Virginia, in Volume 364 U.S. 
    The Court there held, that there is a statutory right to nondiscriminatory service in a bus terminal restaurant, even though the record did not show whether the restaurant was owned or controlled by a carrier. 
    It was enough that the terminal and the restaurant operated as an integral part of the carrier's transportation service for interstate passengers and in those circumstances the Court said, “an interstate passenger need not inquire into documents of title or contractual arrangements in order to determine whether he has a right to be served without discrimination” and it seems to us that the same general approach should be applied here. 
    Now, respondent's other suggestion that there may in fact, be no disparity in it's treatment of men and women, or that whatever disparity exists maybe justifiable, raise somewhat more complex issues. 
    We recognize that the Act does not prohibit discriminations between parents and non-parents, or between married and single persons so long as those discriminations fall equally on persons of both sexes, and of all races, religions and nationalities. 
    But, the Commission and the Government have contended with some success in the lower courts, that when the burden of a discrimination based on a non-statutory factor, one of these so called neutral factors, such as seniority or educational background, in fact fall substantially more heavily on persons of a particular race or sex, or on etcetera, the discrimination is prohibited unless it is justified by reasons of business necessity. 
    Now that is the issue to be explored in the case of Griggs against Duke Power Company, Number 124, which will be argued in a few says, and in which we have also filed a brief. 
    The Commission has been reluctant however to see their approach and their possible justification extended to discriminations applied directly to the categories of person specified in the Act, such as discriminations between men and women. 
    Now, on the other hand the Act itself, in Section 703 (e), which is quoted in our brief, the bona fide occupational provision, expressly authorizes the restriction of certain jobs to persons of a particular religion, sex, or national origin, although, not interestingly to the persons of a particular race in instances where this is reasonably necessary to the the normal operation of the business. 
    But, the legislative history indicates that this exception was intended to be a narrow one, confined to the need for employees of a particular nationality religion or sex, to perform a particular job. 
    Examples given by the Act sponsors were French Chef for a French restaurant, or male baseball players for a male baseball team and the Commission accordingly has been reluctant to see this exception extended to cases such as the present one, in which it is admitted that women, as well as, men can and do perform the job of assembly training. 
    This explains why --

speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2798.593" stopTime="2886.994">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well, they are trying to justify their discrimination against men, on just that ground, under this statute. 
    The Commission has opposed their justification of it, but that is an issue in the lower courts now. 
    But, what I was trying to do was to explain why in it's first brief in the Court of Appeals, in this case, the Commission argued that there could be no possible justification under the Act for the kind of discrimination involved in this case. 
    And that any requirement of work attendants or rather legitimate business requirement, must be applied by the respondent to it's assembly trainees neutrally, without regard to sex. 
    But after the unfavorable decision by the Court of Appeals Panel, the Commission took a more moderate position in it's second brief in the Court of Appeals and our brief in this Court also recognizes that in light of the express Congressional judgment, that there should be some accommodation to legitimate serious business needs. 
    The possibility should be left open, that a sufficient shelling of overriding business necessity might me made in a particular case to warrant the exclusion from particular jobs of a subcategory of one of the classes if the person is protected by the Act, such as women with preschool age children.

   Argument of Donald T. Senterfitt
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3097.972" stopTime="3105.415">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Wallace. 
    Mr. Senterfitt.
speaker="donald_t_senterfitt" startTime="3105.415" stopTime="3399.279">
    Mr. Donald T. Senterfitt 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Martin Marietta Corporation does not have and has never had any such policy of discrimination as has been suggested here. 
    And this respondent does not concur in the language of the opinion of the Court of Appeals, which had been denominated the Sex Plus Doctrine or the coalescence principle. 
    The statement attributed to a receptionist, does not and did not reflect any sort of company policy of discrimination. 
    Rather the record, in this case, shows that the respondent did not practice discrimination against woman or anyone else in its employment practices or procedures. 
    This is highlighted by the the documentation in the record which reflects the company's absolute policy of non-discrimination and equal employment opportunities, which is consistent with its particular reputation as an equal employment opportunity and a substantial government contractor, particularly sensitive to the pronouncements of the government in this field. 
    We do however, vigorously defend the correctness of the result reached by the District Court and the judgment of the Court of Appeals which affirm it. 
    We consider it to be elementary, of course, that a correct decision shouldn't be reversibly because it may have been reached through an avenue of erroneous reasoning. 
    We would suppose that a court reviewing a correct judgment with an incorrect opinion, might have a duty to enunciate the appropriate reasons for the decision while affirming the judgment itself. 
    The facts in this case simply do not justify escalation into a cause. 
    The petitioner and her amici have invited this Court to decide far more than is necessary for an appropriate disposition of this case. 
    There is but a single issue and the resolution of which can appropriately determine the question of affirmance or reversal and of the judgment of the court below. 
    That question is of course, very simply and obviously whether the District Court's order for summary judgment in favor of the respondent was correct. 
    And the sanction of course to the determination of that question is a review of the framework of the record upon which the District Court's summary judgment order was entered. 
    The essence of this petitioner's complaint or efforts to charge the respondent with a violation of her rights under Section 703 (a) appears in the two sentences where she said first, that when she gave her application to the receptionist, she was told, she a woman was told that her application -- that the defendant was not considering applications from woman with preschool age children. 
    She followed this by the general and rather conclusionary charge that the defendant refused to employ her solely on account of her sex. 
    We think it appropriate to observe here. 
    It'd be difficult to imagine a more normal or natural term for the receptionist to use in addressing herself to the petitioner, who was a woman than to use the word women, in speaking to her. 
    Deluding any innuendo which it had otherwise might have add, the petitioner annexed to her complaint a copy of the decision of the EEOC which made no finding or affirmative assertion that the respondent treated women with preschool age children differently than it treated men similarly situated. 
    In fact, it twice referred to the respondent's non-consideration of people with preschool age children. 
    To the complaint, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to strike, a motion to strike has no relevancy to this issue and the court while not granting the motion to dismiss as such, the District Court's order struck the allegation based on a refusal to hire the petitioner because she had preschool age children. 
    Now this --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Donald T. Senterfitt 
    We think, Your Honor, that the record in this case does not show that it did not and it does not show that it treated women with preschool age children any differently than it treated men with preschool age children and that there was nothing in the record before the District Court for to enable him to rule otherwise than as the way he did.

    Mr. Donald T. Senterfitt 
    We have admitted Mr. Justice Marshall, in our answer that the receptionist made the statement that was alleged. 
    There has been, we might say appropo (ph) to Justice's inquiry. 
    There has been, there was, as we would develop in the recounting of record. 
    A request for an admission was filed shortly before, just a few days before the hearing of the motions for summary judgment, in which the petitioner requested that we admit that we, now this for some two years later, that it now employs men with preschool age children. 
    Now aside from the irrelevancy of the time period involved because the two, the relevant time of the application was on two years prior and the request says now, aside from that however, time for responding had not expired at the time for the entry of the motion, at the time of the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. 
    We can advise the Court in all candor that the answer to it, if we had answered it, would have been yes. 
    But also, that if they had asked whether we hired women with preschool age children for the same job at the same time, the answer would likewise had been yes.

    Mr. Donald T. Senterfitt 
    We think, Your Honor, that it was a perfectly natural thing for the receptionist in talking to a woman, not to say we don't hire men or women with preschool age children, but simply to say, we don't hire woman. 
    Now I cannot, I am not undertaking to suggest that we have a policy of not -- I don't -- I am not able to explain the act, any reason why this young lady said this. 
    We have admitted that she said it because we were unable to prove that she didn't, but we -- certainly I am not in any position to say why.

    As advocates we were -- we filed a motion and we won it. 
    It was appealed and we won that and that seems to me our only problem here. 
    The skimpiness of this record doesn't provide a real basis for determining whether or not this woman was actually refused employment. 
    We do have, in the record, the affidavit of the manager of the employment department who was there and said that no discrimination was there at the relevant time and said that no discrimination was practiced and the record reflects that every possible effort in the world had been made to disseminate the requirements of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to every person that we could conceive in the company could possibly have any -- and the record shows this, having in answers to interrogatives.

    Mr. Donald T. Senterfitt 
    Not unless if it were considered, if it were a -- shall we say per se violation and unfortunately the case became confused in that framework at a point. 
    Unless the comparisons were made with men similarly situated with similar custodial problems, there were -- the record doesn't show what the status of Ida Phillips was, with the respect to custodial problems. 
    The records shows nothing on that. 
    Well, we don't know what the term with pre-school-age children meant. 
    Perhaps, in that common experience we might assume it to mean what this petitioner apparently assumes it to mean, that is what could mean though, simply the mother of a child which is under school age regardless of whether or not this mother has the custody. 
    It is simply is nothing in this record to show this. 
    If it gives any further light on our position in this regard, we have conceded that sex-plus as a concept is really.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Only under the statute -- well, then I would infer perhaps for some tactical reason you want to -- probably agree with me and I don't except you to, but by the inference I gather from your argument is that you pretty well agree with your advisory that this judgment ought to be set aside and the case remanded for a trial on the merits?

    Mr. Donald T. Senterfitt 
    We thank Your Honor that of course is one way to develop -- that is a way to develop a fuller record. 
    We think however that the record as it stood before the District Court where there were two questions before it at that time and the framework within which the record had been constructed where the petitioner had elected to stand on the per se issue and not to produce any counter veiling affidavits or to introduce into the record anything to show any discrimination or to show that men similarly situated with her custodial situation were treated differently than she. 
    Since she elected to stand on the per se issue, it left the District Court with no alternative, but to enter a summary judgment on the record as it stood at that time.

    We would simply reiterate that our position on this part is that there was simply nothing in the record before the District Court, under which or upon which it could rule any other way than it did on the motion for summary judgment. 
    On our point on the matter of jurisdiction of this Court, we would simply say that for the reasons that are amplified in our brief, we suggest that the petitioners failed to comply with the jurisdictional requirements of the statute with respect of the timeliness filing of a petition for certiorari and we would thank the court.

    Well, I have assumed up to this time Mr. Senterfitt that reason you have 75 or 80% women is that, again something I take judicial notice of from many years of contact with industry that women are manually much more adapt than men and they do this kind of work better than man do it, and that's why you hire women.

   Rebuttal of William L. Robinson
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4551.564" stopTime="4582.739">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The department of justice I am sure doesn't have an male secretaries. 
    This is an indication of it. 
    They hire women secretaries, because they are better at it. 
    You hire women assembly people, because they are better and you link the distinction between women who have small children and women who don't, so it appears on the record. 
    I think there is two minutes remaining Mr. Robinson.
speaker="william_l_robinson" startTime="4582.739" stopTime="4678.425">
    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    Thank you sir. 
    I think I will only need two minutes. 
    I merely wanted to point out a couple of things. 
    First, I agree with Mr. Senterfitt that the record is very cloudy, but I suggest that we cannot simply accept on the basis of this record the suggestion that the company does not in fact discriminate, because this company after all did not conciliate the case with the EEOC and it would seem that there was no discrimination present, it would be a classic case for successful conciliation by the Commission. 
    Then I would like to go on to suggest that the legal issue here is in fact squarely put. 
    The District Court rejected or struck those portions of our complaint which completed the legal theory that is sex-plus pre-school-age children having struck that as a matter of law that squarely puts the legal issue, but moreover in granting the motion for summary judgment. 
    The court specifically assumed for purposes of the record that they hired men with pre-school-age children and held that immaterial. 
    As a matter of law it had nothing to do with the material proposition of law in this case. 
    This squarely puts the legal issue on it and it should give us the opportunity to develop through discovery that legal issue and the evidence with respect to it.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4678.425" stopTime="4685.947">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You concede of course that Martin Marietta is not discriminating against women on this record?
speaker="william_l_robinson" startTime="4685.947" stopTime="4721.772">
    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    Yes sir. 
    What we have involved in this case Your Honor is, a subgroup of the group women who are also of course as a subgroup of the larger classification of women protected by Title VII. 
    One further remark, mere statistics alone Your Honor I suggest will not -- mere statistics alone with respect to an absentee rate will not establish it be a (Inaudible). 
    There would rather have to be statistics with respect to an absentee rate coupled with a strong showing.

    You know that in deciding this case the District Court specifically excepted the fact or assumed the fact, he assumed it, it was not a fact. 
    I mean, there was no evidence. 
    Well, it's an assumption the basis of which -- on the basis of which he decided the case.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="4784.970" stopTime="4788.469">

    On what basis that was (Inaudible)?
speaker="william_l_robinson" startTime="4788.469" stopTime="4808.239">
    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    The basis of his assumption was his belief the law didn't prohibit an employer from the differencing between men with pre-school-age children and women with pre-school-age children and that's what squarely puts the issue Your Honor. 
    It means that we should have an opportunity to develop that legal theory below.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4808.239" stopTime="4827.732">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now you are suggesting Mr. Robinson that, it wouldn't be enough as a defense for the employer had to show statistical data indicating significantly higher absentee rate or accident rate for women with pre-school-age children as distinguished from other men and women?

speaker="william_l_robinson" startTime="4833.607" stopTime="4850.513">
    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    Yes, particularly, that is the comparison, unless the company can also show that the normal operation of their business prohibits them from absorbing that rate of absenteeism. 
    It's not merely that there was difference, Your Honor. 
    It's that there is a difference which is necessary.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4850.513" stopTime="4861.071">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It has a significant impact on a business operation such as that an assembly line operation is significantly hurt by absenteeism or something else?
speaker="william_l_robinson" startTime="4861.071" stopTime="4870.710">
    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    Not just significant hurt, it can no longer be normally operated, that's the narrow way that Congress intended this exemption to be applied.

    Mr. William L. Robinson 
    I don't know Your Honor. 
    I frankly would rather doubt it, because I would imagine if the company is admitting here today that they already hire women with pre-school-age children that they are not going to seek to demonstrate that women with preschool age children can't do the job.
