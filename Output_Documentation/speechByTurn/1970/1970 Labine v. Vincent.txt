    Mr. James J. Cox 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case involves the Equal Protection rights of an 8-year-old Negro girl from Lake Charles Louisiana who was the daughter of the decedent Ezra Vincent. 
    Ezra Vincent died without having left a will but he bequeathed upon his child a formal proof of the child’s ancestry by a formal active acknowledgment before a notary public which was recorded in the division of public health statistics along with the child’s birth certificate which corroborated proof of parentage of Ezra Vincent of the child Rita Nell Vincent.

    Well, I mean as a matter of statute? 
    Statute expressly provides that the acknowledgment as the consequence of establishing legitimacy but Louisiana statute --

    Mr. James J. Cox 
    Does not Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I think this is the crux and the real issue of the case. 
    It’s not a question of whether or not of a state as was so aptly put in Justice Harlan’s dissent in the Levy and Glona cases has the right to require a formal burden of proof standards or criteria which are meaningful and relevant in determining the question of the state's application of its laws but in this case, no matter what burden of proof is met by this particular child, because of the fact that the child is saddled with the stigma of illegitimacy, this child can inherit nothing and in fact as what in effect is a different standard of requesting support from the decedent’s state. 
    This particular child had much better proof of her relationship to the decedent Ezra Vincent than did the brothers and sisters of the decedent who came from Washington DC and other far away places to claim the decedent’s estate and were granted the decedent’s estate by all of the Louisiana Courts. 
    These brothers and sisters could produce no marriage license to show that their parents were married. They could produce no birth certificates to show they were children of the same parent as the decedent Ezra Vincent. 
    Their reputation proof was extremely sketchy. 
    None of the witnesses other than family members, the brothers and sisters themselves could recite the names of the brothers and sisters of the decedent and yet the Louisiana Courts because of its faulty burden of proof situation and because of its traditional prejudice against illegitimates rather awarded the estate to the brothers and sisters than to the little child.

    Mr. James J. Cox 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun, the question of burden of proof and standards of proof are questions which would be more appropriately resolved by judicial declarations and statutes, statutes from the stand point of setting reasonable burdens and judicial declarations if the burdens are unreasonable. 
    Here, we have a case where its -- there’s an impossible burden. 
    Either the parents of the child would have had to marry in order to satisfy the statute or would have had to adopt the child or would have had to go through a procedure whereby certain (Inaudible) would have had to observed. 
    That is, they would have had to state it in the declaration, we intend to legitimate the child.

    Or draw a will. 
    On the other hand, the state in our contention Justice Blackmun and we respectfully submit to Your Honor, the state can’t presume a discriminatory intention which the state has done in this case. 
    In fact, the state of Louisiana has filed an amicus curiae brief stating that illegitimate children are the proper subjects of the sort of legislation and inferring that robbers can be classified, why cannot be illegitimates be classified and we realize that --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="415.228" stopTime="429.473">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, I just want to be sure that your due process argument wouldn’t carry all the weight to benefit any other illegitimate child once paternity was established. But I take it you’re drawing the line between the two.
speaker="james_j_cox" startTime="429.473" stopTime="526.143">
    Mr. James J. Cox 
    As a matter of standing before the Court, as an officer of the Court, I would say that to draw the line a formal acknowledgment would be perhaps an inappropriate line. 
    The uniform probate code recommended by the uniform commissioners on state laws, recommends that any child shall be treated as legitimate if proof of paternity is established during the lifetime of the parent or the father or thereafter by clear and convincing proof. 
    Ours is not that hard a case although I think that this perhaps as good legislation. 
    Ours is a case where the proof of paternity is so clear and unequivocal that we have to look at the state’s intentions in discriminating against the child. 
    Admittedly, we stand before this honorable court asking that not centuries but thousands of years of discrimination against illegitimates be set aside, but this Court has never hesitated in the past to confront issues wherein clear and convincing proof of discrimination against the particular class is shown no matter what the historical antecedents may have been. 
    In fact, in Levy and Glona, the fact of discrimination against illegitimates has been held to be unconstitutional in the context of wrongful death actions which involves property rights as well.

    Show some effort for that --
speaker="james_j_cox" startTime="594.646" stopTime="800.245">
    Mr. James J. Cox 
    -- differentiations are made in the brief of the American Civil Liberties Union written by the eminent writer in the field primarily professor Harry D. Krause joined by Mr. Melvin Wolfe and Mr. Dorson, he points out that I believe in perhaps at least 16 states, if I’m not mistaken but I don’t have the figures before me Your Honor. 
    Under various conditions, this is at page 12 of his brief. 
    For example in Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, and I do know Your Honor that North Dakota has changed this law as a result of the in re estate of Jensen case which would make a fifth or sixth state in which this particular case would not – needs have arisen before this Court. 
    In re estate of Jensen, in the state of North Dakota after the Levy and Glona cases, the North Dakota Supreme Court rightly applied Levy and Glona to an inheritance case and said that the North Dakota statute was an unconstitutional discrimination against illegitimates and allowed an illegitimate to inherit. 
    Not only did this illegitimate child not inherit her father's estate but the Louisiana Courts felt that because she was receiving a $100.00 per month in social security and VA benefits that she was not entitled to support because of the standard which the statute establishes for support for an illegitimate which is to prove actual necessity. 
    This is a heavier standard and a recognized child has to establish. 
    The child’s needs were shown to be a $192.30 per month, but because of the fact that she is illegitimate, she must continue to live in a condition of destitution. 
    As we view it Your Honors, the real issue in this case is the denial of inheritance rights to illegitimates, promote a genuine state interest in family unity and if it does so promote it, can this be promoted in a haphazard fashion. 
    We would concede that family unity is something that is very much of concern to states and something which to be well promoted for instance, the state of Louisiana could well legislate a bonus for parents who remained together and care for their children. 
    To the contrary, the state of Louisiana has passed a statute legislating against parents who stay together for welfare purposes. 
    If parents remained together and they have dependent childrenintestate succession laws, in their destitute, they’re ineligible in the State of Louisiana for welfare. 
    This appears in Louisiana revised statutes 46:231. 
    Therefore, Louisiana certainly pursuing the most peculiar course if it’s genuinely trying to promote family unity in the field of legitimate relationships between parents and children. 
    Furthermore, --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="800.245" stopTime="810.173">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that’s true everywhere, isn’t it? (Inaudible)
speaker="james_j_cox" startTime="810.173" stopTime="885.961">
    Mr. James J. Cox 
    Yes Your Honor. 
    By the same token, some states in applying this type of statute have tried to go further against illegitimates by invoking the substitute father doctrine which is that if there were an illegitimate father in a household, he would be presumed to be the parent of all of the children therein and therefore that illegitimacy situation would exclude all of the children from benefits. 
    Now, this Court had no trouble with that type of statute in Arkansas. 
    In Smith versus King, this Court struck this down as a denial of Equal Protection of law and Due Process of law. 
    Furthermore, if the State of Louisiana is to be consistent in pursuing the doctrine of family unity and promoting legitimacy, they should -- we feel, pay some attention to the recent statistics. 
    According to the trends in illegitimacy in the United States 1940 to 1965 which was published by the National Center for Health Statistics in February of 1968, Louisiana had more illegitimate births per capita in states which did not follow this particular and repressive approach to illegitimacy.

    I would like to take those grounds in my argument. 
    Blackstone’s commentaries which might be used as the historical president to show that this is not an unusual bit of legislation, specifically mentions the reason is these fraudulent claims. 
    And for thousands of years in both the civil and common law, we have this situation but with an over broad zealousness and diligence in pursuing this illegitimates who have nothing to say about their status. 
    Here, this little child could do nothing about her situation.

    The state presumes an intention on the part of those who don’t draw wills in Louisiana to exclude illegitimates and this is an unconstitutional assumption of state power and derogation of Equal Protection rights.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1162.482" stopTime="1191.940">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I would suppose perhaps that the state would assume an intention on the part of a decedent who do not draw a will that his property should go under the state laws of descendant distribution? 
    The father of this child could have drawn a will and left all of his property to the child? 
    Since he did not draw a will, wouldn’t the natural assumption be that he intended his property to go by the Louisiana laws of descendant distribution, i.e. to his brothers and sisters?

    Mr. James J. Cox 
    I would say Mr. Justice Blackmun in answer to that question that it would depend upon the way that this Court rules. 
    I don’t believe it because a particular standard is unconstitutional, that every standard under other circumstances would be unconstitutional. 
    I can only appear before this honorable Court with a case in which a clearly unconstitutional standard has been placed upon a child under which Equal Protection has been denied to this child.

    Mr. James J. Cox

    This particular child was discriminated against solely because this child was illegitimate. 
    And we don’t mean to go as far as the briefs that were filed amicus curiae which raised the question of racial discrimination here. 
    We don’t think that the state intends racial discrimination, that we think the state intends a discrimination between legitimates and illegitimates which is a class of discrimination which has gone on for centuries in which has been en route -- have been made in other cases. 
    But when it comes to this particular child, the fact that others in other states and the Supreme Courts of other states have said that these were unconstitutional enactments, this has not helped this child because our Supreme Court says it’s perfectly constitutional. 
    So we’re forced in a position of having to ask readdress from this Court.

   Argument of James A. Leithead
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1683.036" stopTime="1684.217">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Leithead.
speaker="james_a_leithead" startTime="1684.217" stopTime="1744.338">
    Mr. James A. Leithead 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This matter factually doesn’t present any question. 
    These people did merely came in after Ezra Vincent died and said they were the brothers and sisters and wanted to open his succession in Louisiana under the intestate laws, if a person dies leaving no children, then you look to the interstate laws to see which classes of persons inherit his estate. 
    Louisiana has legal heirs in connection with the intestate succession. 
    In this particular case, since Ezra Vincent didn’t leave any children, he left brothers and sisters and he left and acknowledged illegitimate child. 
    Under the laws of the Louisiana intestate succession laws, the brothers and sisters are the class inherited before the acknowledged illegitimate child. 
    Now, you might ask --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1744.338" stopTime="1748.715">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The acknowledge illegitimate child come anywhere in the hierarchy if there had been --
speaker="james_a_leithead" startTime="1748.715" stopTime="1795.692">
    Mr. James A. Leithead 
    Yes sir. 
    The acknowledged -- you might ask why did he acknowledged his child. 
    First, here in Louisiana you have an illegitimate child which is the lowest you can get, then you have an acknowledged illegitimate child and that acknowledged illegitimate child is raised in his status as being able to inherit, he can inherit from his mother just after her legitimate children. 
    He can inherit from the father just after the wife which were just before the state. 
    He doesn’t have as high an inheritance position in the state of his father as he does in his mother because Louisiana recognize the natural law that a child is closer to its mother than it is to his father but he doesn’t -- he does have inheritance right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1795.692" stopTime="1812.921">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If this decedent had died living no surviving brothers and sisters and no issue of any siblings, would this appellant have inherited?
speaker="james_a_leithead" startTime="1812.921" stopTime="1828.265">
    Mr. James A. Leithead 
    This child would have inherited because the law states that if a man dies leaving no legitimate children, no mother and father and no surviving wife, then his acknowledged child would inherit.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1828.265" stopTime="1831.008">

    Mr. James A. Leithead 
    Proof of motherhood is very easily made, mother knows as usually witnesses, a midwife or something as to the birth of the child but the children, natural children of a mother come in just after her legitimate children. 
    If she had no legitimate children, they would inherit to the exclusion of all other persons under the intestate laws of the state.

speaker="james_a_leithead" startTime="1901.134" stopTime="1923.048">
    Mr. James A. Leithead 
    Yes, the state of Louisiana has a state policy preferring legitimacy over illegitimacy and in connection with that policy, it’s obvious that they prefer legitimate heirs to illegitimate heirs and their policy is a -- it is to promote marriage and discourage illegitimacy and also for the protection of their land titles.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1923.048" stopTime="1931.611">

    Is to promote the marriage of the illegitimate child or his mother but the illegitimate child is the one to suffer?
speaker="james_a_leithead" startTime="1931.611" stopTime="1955.978">
    Mr. James A. Leithead 
    That is correct, but if the parents wish to, they could prevent the illegitimate child from suffering by doing some other things and that is they could legitimate the child by informally acknowledging the child before or after a marriage if they could marry, they could adopt him or they could leave a will.

    Mr. James A. Leithead 
    Yes. 
    And my comment on the facts of this case, in the Levy case, Justice Douglas stated that the Court assumed that the minor children there had a family relationship with their mother. 
    That is the mother supported them, that’s is where the illegitimate children sought under Louisiana wrongful death statute to recover damages for the death of their natural mother, that there was a family relationship, the mother supported them, she took them to church, she took them to school, she cared for them, she lived with them but there’s none of those facts are in the record of this case. 
    This case shows -- does not show that Ezra lived with the child 
    .In fact, the evidence is just to the contrary. 
    If you’ll notice the acknowledgment papers and the birth certificate, it’ll show that the address of the mother was something on Belton Street in Lake Charles Louisiana, whereas Ezra and his family lived in a little town called Moss Ville which is 10 -- across 10 or 12 miles away. 
    Now, the fact that there was no marriage certificate between Ezra’s father and mother is due to the fact that there were no marriage records in (Inaudible) parish where this man lived prior to 1910. 
    And his brothers and sisters all were born prior to that time. 
    So there’s no marriage records nor were there any birth certificates. 
    So, we had to prove the marriage relationship of Ezra’s mother and father by their reputation in the community. 
    And in so doing, we found out that this interest in this property that Ezra Vincent left was real property, he had eight brothers and sisters -- seven brothers and sisters. 
    1/8th of it constituted the bulk of this succession which amounted to proximate $15,000.00, that was a family home and Ezra and his brothers and sisters lived there, they formed the property, they went to the Baptist church together. 
    His grandfather was a Baptist minister. 
    Their reputation in the community was such as to be the highest. 
    They were recognized. 
    His family was recognized as prominent citizens. 
    So there was a family relationship between Ezra, his brothers and sisters and their parents, whereas, this was not shown to be the case by the evidence as presented in this case. 
    Now, in common law, an illegitimate was known as a non-person, he was not entitled to inherit anything. 
    Louisiana law as I have stated permits them to inherit but not as high upon the ladder as legitimate relations. 
    The civil law has historically treated illegitimates more favorable than illegitimates by letting them inherit from their mother. 
    The most modern statutes now permit illegitimate children to inherit from their mother but prohibit or deny them to inherit from their father. 
    Now we get down, we’ve been talking about the child in this case. 
    I think the Court should also give some consideration to the decedent. 
    Now, when he died, the laws of the State of Louisiana, the intestate laws were -- was that his property, his family property would be inherited by his brothers and sisters. 
    Now, at that time, Ezra had a choice to make. 
    He could say now look, I want to leave this child something. 
    I want to make a will. 
    He could have done that or he could have said I want to marry the mother of the child, there was no impediment to the marriage. 
    Or he could have adopted the child. Anyone of those things would have changed the course of these events. 
    Now once Ezra died, he no longer can exercise any choice when die was cast. 
    This Court cannot revert this case back to before his death and say now, Ezra, you have the choice, what do you want to do because what he did indicates what his choice was.

    But as I say this may appear to some to be a hard case factually, but I’d like to remind the Court of a speech that made by Chief Justice Burger, while then a United State Circuit Court Judge when he delivered and address at the conference of judges in Columbus Ohio on September 4, 1968 from which the following is an exurb and I think its pertinent. 
    This copy was given to me by Mr. Ben Miller from Baton Rouge 
    .The Chief Justice said "these hard cases usually come to the Court over the narrow record of but one case which frequently presents emotionally appealing situations that confuse and blur the bedrock consequences of a broad holding." 
    The address was published in the Ohio bar volume 41 number 46 dated November 23rd 1968 pages 1440 and 1441. 
    Now, in my opinion, Pandora’s box would be open by any holding that federal law as declared by federal courts and not even by Congress and not by state law would govern succession rights in all of the 50 states and overrule a states law on inheritance of property in that state particularly recent state.

    Mr. James A. Leithead 
    May have been and may have been just the opposite and the state shouldn’t contribute so much money from it. 
    Considering some of the bedrock, I mean some of the analogies to this case and some of the bedrock consequences which may -- we may get into by a broad holding and this Court, this case before the Court in the area of adoptions, their rights and obligations. 
    Most states permit a married couple to adopt the child, some states say that an unmarried man and an unmarried woman may adopt, others say just an unmarried woman may adopt. 
    Some states may wish to deny inheritance rights to an adopted child or some may want to give the adopted parents of the child some rights in the child’s estate, but what would happen if a state would suddenly declare that they would change their policy only prospectively and deny adopted children inheritance rights, and in real property in the state. 
    If that is to declare it unconstitutional as a discriminary against the innocent child in some other hard case who believed that he was the child of his parents but later was decided he was the adopted child. 
    The child would come out without anything.

    Well, I’m just giving you those in my words. 
    It could be less or more than five words but you wouldn’t have to express his intention because this does not in itself express his intention to allow the child to inherit from him. 
    I might say another analogy to this case is that Louisiana code prohibits divorced spouses from marrying his or her concubine.

    Mr. James A. Leithead 
    There’s never been any question as to whether or not the -- no sir, that question has never been raised in Louisiana. 
    Whether or not that is a constitutional problems of the state in its policy decision, whether or not, not to recognize common law marriages and to require that people married and living together should go through a ceremony. 
    That question has never been risen. 
    But if would be risen, would arise would that be constitutional for the state to pass such a statute. 
    The implications of this case are maybe far reaching. 
    Far more reaching than what the narrow issues that are presented before this Court, once this Court decides that the Supreme Court of the United States is going to pass upon the dissent and distribution of laws in the 50 state, in my opinion, the Court would have to legislate on many items and make decisions and decide many points in succession law which will be most complicated for instance. 
    In this particular, in Louisiana, these are some of the things the Court would have to decide whether or not an illegitimate child, whether the illegitimate child would inherit from its father equally with a legitimate child. 
    You see, this makes a difference because in Louisiana, we have the forced heirship in some of the other common law states, it may not make any difference. 
    Will and adulteress and illegitimate child inherit the same as an illegitimate child who is not an adulteress illegitimate child, there should have been a distinction made. 
    Will an illegitimate child who is informally acknowledged inherit just as well as one that is formally acknowledged? 
    Will that make a distinction if the father have an illegitimate child and later the mother and the father married, would that make any difference as to the rights of inheritance. 
    Would the illegitimate child of the father of the father’s concubine inherit his one half interest in the community property of the father with his legitimate wife? 
    Will illegitimate children inherit to the exclusion of the decedent’s parents who are forced heirs if there are no other children or would the illegitimate child, no matter how it would be acknowledged, would he be considered a forced heir. 
    These are all many questions that would have to be answered and the Court would be legislating in my opinion, if they would attempt to decide that the intestate laws in this -- that are before this Court for decision are unconstitutional, we submit that the court below, the decision of the court below should be affirmed. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of James J. Cox
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3267.862" stopTime="3278.853">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Leithead. 
    Mr. Cox, you have three minutes left, I think I’ll hold my question until you finish so as not to use your time for you.
speaker="james_j_cox" startTime="3278.853" stopTime="3352.121">
    Mr. James J. Cox 
    Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice Burger. 
    I think that at the outset I should answer the most important question raised by Mr. Leithead and that was the question of the confusion that would result in property law if this illegitimate child were considered to be a child of the decedent. 
    The answer is that if this Court ruled that as it has in Levy and Glona that is invidious to discriminate against an illegitimate and that this child should be treated as a legitimate since the burden of proof standard has been met here, then this child would simply inherit like any other child and his relationship vis-à-vis the parents vis-à-vis collateral candid would be just like any other child, there would no uncertainty in Louisiana’s property laws result of such a ruling. 
    It was cleared up in North Dakota by the North Dakota Supreme Court by stating that for all extents and purposes, a child who has the burden of proving his parentage shall be treated as though legitimate. 
    Now, I think that the other question that is the chaos that might be created in land titles.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3352.121" stopTime="3355.293">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    On what ground did North Dakota based that holding?
speaker="james_j_cox" startTime="3355.293" stopTime="3498.025">
    Mr. James J. Cox 
    Oh, the Court of North Dakota and in re estate of Jensen, based it on the grounds of the North Dakota constitution and the United States constitution granting Equal Protection of laws to all of its citizens. 
    It’s not strictly relevant but the Supreme Court of that state of Italy under its post war constitution, some 10 or 15 days ago according to an AP dispatch, decided that in Italy, the equal protection of the laws under the post war constitution demanded that a child who bore the burden of proving within a narrow framework, his relationship to his parent could inherit just like a legitimate child and this is the only issue this before this Court, not some sort of disruption of the orderly legal processes of the nation. 
    Simply, the granting of equal protection of the laws within a narrow framework, to children who have nothing to say except through this Court about their status, the innocent victims of discrimination, Levy and Glona are the laws of the land and to repudiate Levy and Glona because of the fact that land titles might be involved is to deny to a particular person or a particular case or controversy, equal justice under the law. 
    Now, in the famous case of Moscrat versus United States, it was held that actual cases are controversies with the things that were presented to the Court. 
    Declaratory judgments about other people’s rights would not be entered upon by this Court. 
    n US versus Wade and Gilbert versus California, the Court ruled that the new standards which were basic standards of Due Process and those cases, that is the right of an accused to have an counsel in a lineup where this – lead to prejudice to this case, would be applied to Wade and Gilbert but not to those who had lived before Wade and Gilbert or who had transgressed previously. 
    If this Court rules in favor of the little child in this case, it would apply to her case and to subsequent cases and lawyers will have ample opportunity to make their wills and provide under the laws for their clients. 
    But under Levy and Glona, this child is entitled to the most profound consideration of her equal protection rights by this honorable court.

    Mr. Cox, I live in Virginia which permits a testator to make a will, I think anyway he wants to do it, he cut off his children, I suppose that’s true in 49 of the states. 
    Suppose, I make the will, leaving nothing to my children, do they have a claim that because Louisiana, if they lived in Louisiana, I could not have cut them off but they are thereby denied Equal Protection?

    Mr. James J. Cox 
    No because, here we have a question of class, a class of people Your Honor. 
    In this particular case we have a class of people illegitimates just like a class of people, Chinese in which this honorable court in cases has said that in an alien land loss cases, said we couldn’t discriminate against Japanese.

    You got a class, suppose I had some children -- well, children in Louisiana can inherit and children in Virginia and the other states can’t.

    Mr. James J. Cox 
    I see no reason.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You don’t see any Equal Protection problem there at all.

    Mr. James J. Cox 
    I see no reason why children in one state should not be able to inherit and children in another state according to the state’s legislative wisdom can inherit only if their parents say they can or cannot, but I do see something invidious in one state saying that under -- or any state saying that a -- that Japanese as was this case in Oyama versus California, that the child of an alien cannot hold property because it’s presumed to be the alien’s property and I would join with Justice Black who wanted to go further and say that not only could that child hold property but his parents should be able to hold property. 
    This is a discrimination against the class of children Your Honor, not a state trying to carry out a state purpose.
