speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="35.978" stopTime="172.184">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think it's fortuitous that the morning ends with the case that involves a different kind of speech. 
    We have here a criminal contempt case arising from Pennsylvania which is in my research unprecedented in the law of criminal contempt. 
    We have a defendant who was on trial in 1966 under two very serious charges for prison breach and for holding hostage, in the course of a prison breach, charges which had a potential of life imprisonment under the second of those charges. 
    The trial lasted 22 days, 22 trial days, it stretched from November 7 until December 22 on a calendar. 
    During those 22 days of the defendant and two co-defendants were representing themselves on these very serious charges. 
    At the conclusion of the trial, after the jury verdict had been brought in on 22nd day, the trial judge opened the next session of Court on Monday morning and excoriated all three defendants, summarily convicted them of criminal contempt and held that as to 11 separate days, although, there were multiple incidents involved, that petitioner Mayberry had been guilty of criminal contempt. 
    On each one of those 11 charges as he recited the facts as he recalled them, he imposed a sentence of a minimum of one year and a maximum of two years in state prison. 
    After each one of those sentences following the first, he directed that each one of those sentences be served consecutively. 
    So that the first of his impositions of sentence was a sentence in aggregation of 11 years at a minimum and 22 years at a maximum for criminal contempt.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="172.184" stopTime="183.738">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now, clarify for me if you will Mr. Reitz the relationship of these sentences collectively to the sentence on the substantive charge.
speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="183.738" stopTime="201.440">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    He then proceeded Mr. Chief Justice to sentence on a substantive charge and he gave a sentence for prison breach of 10 years which was the maximum. 
    Five years minimum, 10 years maximum which was the maximum permitted by the statutes of Pennsylvania for prison breach.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="201.440" stopTime="202.822">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now, is that consecutive?
speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="202.822" stopTime="313.651">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    That was also consecutive. 
    He then imposed a sentence of 30 years maximum, 15 years minimum for the charge of holding hostage. 
    The aggregate of all of that was 40 years on the substantive crimes, 22 years for criminal contempt or a net sentence of 62 years with a 31-year minimum. 
    That was the sentence imposed that morning. 
    I'm told, although, I have not seen the documents itself that a few days later, he reversed the order of sentencing so that the -- although, he started that Monday morning with the criminal contempt sentence and then followed with the substantive crimes but he directed the sentence on a substantive crimes. 
    For 40 years, he served first and then the 22 years for criminal contempt. 
    But the net effect of the sentencing that morning was 22 years for criminal contempt, 40 years for substantive crime, 62 years total. 
    I am aware of no criminal contempt sentence which comes even within a long distance of that sentence. 
    There had been many studies made of criminal contempts over the years. 
    None of them reflected a sentence that is even one-seventh, who’s great for any kind of criminal contempt. 
    In that same session, the judge sentenced the two co-defendants also for criminal contempt. 
    On exactly the same methodology, he had it this per diem method and it was two years for each day on which he found a criminal contempt had been committed. 
    The sentences on the co-defendants were somewhat shorter, it were six days in the case of one defendant and seven days in the case of another.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="313.651" stopTime="323.464">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would say that their conduct was as aggravated as it was with respect to this petitioner?
speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="323.464" stopTime="379.711">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    In some instances, Your Honor, the conduct I would think would be substantially worse. 
    One of the co-defendants verbally threatened the life of the judge which never happened in the case of petitioner Mayberry. 
    Some of the obstreperous, disruptive conduct on the part of, one of the co-defendants, it seems to me that have been substantially worse from reading the records. 
    The 11 contempts found against the petitioner Mayberry involved nine counts, nine charges of what I have described as purely verbal epithets directed at the judge. 
    They were quite brief. 
    They're printed in total in the appendix. 
    They ranged in seriousness over a considerable variety of hyperbolic.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="379.711" stopTime="389.150">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I take it, if you would agree that these were very aggravated episodes of the conduct and utterance, would you not?
speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="389.150" stopTime="418.143">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    Oh, they would be conduct Your Honor, which from any attorney, I think, would have been thought of as very aggravated in the instance of a layman defending himself, not an educated layman defending himself in a very serious Court with the kind of background from which he comes and the life which he has led, I’m not -- I don’t think I would have put the label aggravated on the verbal contents.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Even after repeated, you wouldn’t concede this was aggravated?

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    The warnings were repeated Your Honor, but the incidents for example, late in the trial, one of the two-year sentences is imposed for the defendant more or less expostulating an anger after having been prevented from developing a line of questioning that he was not arguing with fools. 
    The judge inferred from that, I think, relatively properly that the defendant was referring to the judge as a fool. 
    For that, he got two years in jail.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="458.706" stopTime="469.154">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You would concede, I suppose that the conduct of the defendant throughout this trial was fully outrageous, would you not?

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    It is conduct which we certainly had not condoned.

speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="522.736" stopTime="624.431">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    May it please the Court. 
    Before we recessed for lunch we had explored a bit of the factual history of this case and had begun some discussion of the seriousness of the verbal conduct on which the trial judge in this case sentenced a petitioner to so many years in jail. 
    I think, it’s fair to say that it’s perfectly obvious that the judge himself took a very serious view of the conduct of petitioner. 
    Indeed, the sentence alone indicates that he viewed it as the most serious contempt case of all time -- confirms that. 
    Whatever adjective one might say is adequate to describe the conduct and I think that will depend on many points of view. 
    It is perfectly clear that the case was treated as a very serious case and I would not urge the Court that this conduct was either meritorious or even to be condoned. 
    What I do urge on the Court and I think this is the critical point and it is underscored by whatever view of seriousness one takes. 
    But the procedure employed in handling this case was grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime even if one views it as a rather petty crime. 
    The amount of procedural due process afforded to this petitioner in handling this case was nilled.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="624.431" stopTime="631.840">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But was it basically any different from the procedural due process that he had in the trial of the substantive charges?
speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="631.840" stopTime="643.013">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    Oh, indeed Your Honor. 
    On a substantive charge he had notice. 
    He had the right to counsel. 
    He had the right to make preliminary motions including a motion to disqualify the judge.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="643.013" stopTime="646.029">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But what he had done about counsel in the substantive case?
speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="646.029" stopTime="649.860">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    In the substantive case, he had waived counsel. 
    He had insisted on the --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="649.860" stopTime="652.647">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Although from that, is that he rejected affirmatively permanently, didn’t he?
speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="652.647" stopTime="700.817">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    He had indeed. 
    He insisted on his right to try himself in that case which he is permitted under the Constitution. 
    But he was afforded the right to counsel. 
    Counsel was offered to him and indeed despite his waiver, the trial judge appointed the public defender to serve as an advisor to him during the trial and he was present throughout the trial and available for resource. 
    There was a jury, there was evidence produced, at time for argument not only on the issue of guilt but on the issue of a litigation of sentence. 
    The full panoply of a trial was followed in the case of the substantive crime. 
    None of that followed in the contempt case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="700.817" stopTime="714.651">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    May I ask this Professor Reitz. 
    Is it your submission that the real vice here is the proportion in terms of procedure or the disproportion in terms of panoply?
speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="714.651" stopTime="843.754">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    MI think they go together Your Honor. 
    If the sentence in this case had been in the tradition of sentences for courtroom in de quorum a few days or a few dollars that happened in, for example, in the Fisher and Pace case, this Court reviewed many years ago, the amount of procedure that we traditionally have required in that kind of a case is rather slight, and indeed if the judge does as in the Fisher case impose or threaten to impose the sanctions during the course of the trial, the procedural requisites follow from the necessary situation. 
    In this case, we have an obviously much different situation of a very serious crime in the mind of the judge and it seems to me the nature of the penalty quite reinforces the total absence of any process. 
    There was no opportunity in this case to do many of the things that the commonwealth in the briefs suggest petitioner did not do. 
    He did not have an opportunity to challenge the judge. 
    He did not have an opportunity to waive counsel. 
    He did not even have an opportunity to ask for counsel. 
    He was suggested that he might have moved after the fact to modify sentence. 
    When one looks at the record as to what happened that Monday morning on December 22nd, after the judge had finished imposing the 22 years of sentence on the petitioner, he asked to be allowed to speak and the judge refused to hear a word. 
    At that stage, the judge would have none of his further participation in the courtroom proceedings. 
    So, the absence of his own advocacy at that stage to which the commonwealth alludes seems to me to be quite irrelevant. 
    In addition, --

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    It was a trial that lasted for 22 trial days for the last day being entirely sentencing, so it is a very long trial. 
    There was something in excess of 3,000 pages of stenographic transcript in the trial. 
    In addition to the fundamental due process argument, we make a separate argument which is in some ways even more basic and that was the opportunity -- petitioner was denied the opportunity to make any statement in mitigation of punishment in this case.

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    It might indeed had been ceremonial because of the obviously overwrought state of the trial judge with an impartial tribunal, I am not convinced that a fairly substantial argument could not have been made in mitigation of the severity of the conduct.

    How could you mitigate the conduct? 
    What explanation could possibly, even approach justification?
speaker="curtis_r_reitz" startTime="941.895" stopTime="1014.264">
    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    As you study the record Your Honor, I don’t think one would need to approach justification in order to find there were indeed issues of provocation or explanation that might in some way have tempered the fury. 
    The defendant in this case for example attempted several times to introduce evidence that went to his conduct, immediately after he was apprehended. 
    The prosecution in the case in chief had put on a witness who testified that after he was apprehended, he had still resisted very forcefully, the arresting officer and there was a fight that took place going down the stairs in the hospital in which he was apprehended. 
    Petitioner several times attempted to introduce evidence that would have contradicted that. 
    Witnesses who would’ve denied that he was then in that state of flagrant resistance. 
    Every time he tried to produce that evidence, he was afforded by objection on the part of the District Attorney without explanation and objection sustained. 
    In the face of this, --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1014.264" stopTime="1046.920">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Suppose that meant that the trial judge simply was taking position that there was no evidence that could bear by way of litigation or explanation of his conduct during the course of the trial. 
    I suppose if the trial judge had the benefit of Illinois against Allen at that time, he might well have removed this man from the courtroom, after his second outburst, but of course this was tried on before Illinois against Allen was --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Yes. 
    I wonder if our real problem in this case isn’t the severity of the sanctions and frankly that’s the way it seemed to me and I refer to that on that theory and then I maybe I've diverted from it?

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    No Your Honor, I have not the slightest doubt that there is an enormous problem here with the severity of the sanction. 
    It is so far out of keeping with any of the customary standards to which we have had look in the past for sentencing and contempt cases that it simply looms as an unacceptable judicial act.

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    Quite right. 
    This Court lacks the supervisory power. 
    It lacks the normal, very broad appellate review that the Court has exercised on numerous occasions in reducing what it felt to be mild excesses by comparison on the part of federal trial judges. 
    The 11 consecutive counts, concurrent counts, in the Yates case impressed the Court as being grossly disproportionate to the offense in that case and the Court was able through a supervisory power to deal with that problem.

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    I think Your Honor. 
    If this Court finds that the cruel and unusual punishment or the substantive due process argument has merits, some guidance would have to be created as to the outside limits that would be permitted for this type of sentence. 
    A remand of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which has already faced this issue and rejected it with one dissenting justice, is not likely to generate the kind of standards that one would need for a national Constitution.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, aren’t state courts capable of applying the federal constitutional provision or provisions that you rely on. 
    What is different about their approach? 
    I'm not speaking of the instant case in terms of the action. 
    I'm speaking of establishing standards. 
    Shouldn’t they be established in the state courts in the first instance?

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    There’s great virtue to that in some instances and many of the scholars of federal jurisdiction urged that in the ultimate, the only basic safeguard for all constitutional rights are state courts that all federal courts jurisdiction is subject to statutory limitation by Congress. 
    But in this instance, we are in I think such a brand new area with cruel and unusual punishment standards that unless the Court is able to provide some reasonable guidance to state courts, my expectation would not be that the results would be a very happy in the first instances.

    May I ask Mr. Reitz, does the Pennsylvania Supreme Court have a power comparable to our so-called supervisory power which I guess is what we used in the Yates case?

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    Justice O’Brien relies on a cruel and unusual punishment argument. 
    He is persuaded that in comparison with the statutory maxima for a whole raft of offenses including second degree murder being less than the sentence imposed on this defendant for conduct which bears no resemblance to the atrocious assaults and homicides that have very lesser statutory maximum that the sentence was impermissible.

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    I think an argument can be built on the basis of existing data that a maximum of six months is a customary standard that is now so well entrenched by statute and case law that it is the outside limit for a sentence in a contempt case absent a statute permitting a longer one. 
    All the statutes stop short of that. 
    Many as I've indicate stopped far shorter in terms of hours or days for such punishment.

    Mr. Curtis R. Reitz 
    Two years on each and that is still twice as long as the Yates case which was one year, 11 times concurrently and that is still in my judgment an enormously over broad sentence for the kind of contempt that this record contains. 
    It is only the because of the fact that the multiplier of 11 is added that the seriousness of that first sentence can be lost sight of. 
    A two-year sentence is itself, one of the most severe in the whole catalog of criminal contempt sentences.

    Suppose they had instead of sentencing him for contempt put the charge against him on the legislative enactment which provided that a person who had appeared before the Court in a serious manner as this man here had attempted to stop it, he committed a crime, and tried him, indicted, tried him before a jury, given him a lawyer, given him all the protection that could be afforded.

    No. 
    No, a trial Your Honor. 
    This Court has drawn the limit of jury trials for the moment of six months. 
    It seems to me that at least one can say that six months is the line that which one is now clearly entitled for trial. 
    I think that is a necessary almost a priori argument from the Bloom decision itself but it seems to me that’s way below six months before one can say that you have a penalty, that is so trivial, so much a reprimand, so much within the ambit of work. 
    Contempt has traditionally lane of discipline of lawyers. 
    If one looks at contempt cases, it’s the lawyers who are usually the defendants in contempt cases. 
    In those cases, the remedies are as the appendix in our brief indicates extremely short, a matter of one, two, three days and in that range I think, the custom is now well-established that a judge can impose that kind of sanction. 
    I would not attempt to persuade the Court to change that now but 60 days is well beyond that limit Your Honor.

   Argument of Carol Mary Los
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2202.544" stopTime="2206.538">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well. 
    Miss Los.
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2206.538" stopTime="2593.515">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    We were originally of the opinion that the entire trial transcript should be printed in the appendix for the Court because we felt that only by reading the entire trial transcript could this Court get some idea of the feelings, and the tensions, and the pressures that existed throughout this long five week trial. 
    Unfortunately, going through the trial transcript we realized that by the court's stenographer merely really taking down the words that happened that so much missed the Court’s stenographer or could not be taken down simply in the method of words that this Court could not feel simply from a cold record, the tensions, and the pressures that existed that day or the response that the petitioner was able to evoke, not only from his co-defendants or from the jury, but from the spectators who were in the courtroom at the time. 
    Apparently, it seems to me that the petitioner might be able to take advantage of this cold record in denying, first of all, that he is an extremely intelligent and articulate man. 
    And secondly, that he was not the ring leader or the instigator of all of these contempts. 
    If I may just for a few moments to recap some of the events of the trial that might not necessarily be printed in the trial record. 
    This was the second trial that had begun in these charges. 
    The first ended in the mistrial when the petitioner alleged that a prospective juror had seen him handcuffed to a sheriff, a mistrial was granted and the petitioner boasted at this time that he would never be brought to trial in these charges, that if all those failed, he would break out of jail. 
    He threatened the prosecutor and stated that prosecutor would never see him from the trial in these charges for prison breach. 
    These weren’t idle threats. 
    Mayberry had previously broken out of the Eastern Penitentiary in Pennsylvania, the Western Penitentiary in Pennsylvania, the Graterford prison he attempted a prison breach and during the course of this trial, he was able to break out at the Allegany County Jail. 
    This prison breach occurred almost in the middle of this particular trial. 
    At the time it occurred on a weekend, the petitioner and his two co-defendants as well as three other inmates of the Allegany County Jail broke out, kidnapped the city police officer, who was on duty at that time and were able to get a good distance from the city before they were captured. 
    It was only because the gun that they had secured from the police officer misfired that a police officer was not killed at close range. 
    As I say, this occurred during the course of a trial and does not necessarily appear as the matter of record. 
    But in any event, petitioner from the start was deemed to be a very dangerous individual. 
    The courtroom, understandably contained the great number of sheriff’s deputies. 
    Trial began before Judge Fiok and Mayberry as has been set forth before decided that he wanted to act as his own counsel and refused the help of counsel that was appointed for him. 
    Counsel, nonetheless appeared throughout the trial and was there at the sentencing for the contempt citations. 
    Mayberry requested from the trial judge that he permitted to come to sidebar, whenever he wished, the trial judge refused this. 
    First of all, I believe that because Mayberry was a very dangerous individual and a search of Mayberry’s legal papers during the trial revealed that he had placed sharpened razor blades inside of his legal pad. 
    Secondly, one of the co-defendants had been throwing pencils at the judge, during the trial. 
    So I mean, there’s a certainly reasonable grounds to believe that the judge himself might have feared that his life was in danger. 
    There was a bodyguard especially assigned to the prosecutor after the threats and the petitioner became so numerous across the counsel table. 
    These again are not recorded in the trial transcript because the court stenographer was not within the hearing range. 
    Nonetheless, the request for sidebar was refused. 
    Mayberry started a series of taunts to the judge which continued throughout the trial. 
    His attitude was this, “I want an explanation that satisfies me right now and if I don’t get it, I'm not going to continue with this trial.” 
    For example, a very good example I think occurs at the end of trial when he closes to the jury. 
    He is told that he will only be permitted an hour to close. 
    The end of the hour, he is given an additional 15 minutes, Mayberry decides that he wants just to continue his closing to the jury. 
    When he refuses to hear the judge’s warnings, he is taken out of the courtroom and another co-defendant is permitted to close. 
    When Mayberry is brought back in again, he gets off and starts closing to the jury again, he’s again taken out of the room. 
    So that the trial judge attempted on several occasions, various different methods, he had him taken out of the room at least 10 or 11 times. 
    When brought back, Mayberry proceeded the same way as when he had left off, when he was taken out of the room. 
    He was bound and gagged. 
    But unfortunately, he was able to shout through the gag and pound on the floor. 
    His shoes and the shoes of his co-defendants were removed. 
    He still raised such a ruckus that the trial judge was unable to charge to the jury. 
    Now, when Mayberry would direct one of his assaults to the trial judge, petitioner’s brief would have you believed that nothing merely happen except the judge said, “Continue on with your questioning.” 
    What happened precisely was this, Mayberry was greatly amused by the fact that there were loud gossips in the courtroom that the jury was shocked that some of the spectators were shocked. 
    He would burst out into this loud laughter which was followed by his co-defendant, who would hoot and howl, and applaud, and stamp their feet. 
    And in fact, the reason we say that Mayberry was the ring leader here was that when he would return to his seat, he would lean across to the prosecutor and say, “Now, watch this.” 
    And would stand up and repeat something.

    He would then after they had addressed something too rude to the trial judge, he would stand up and ask for a mistrial and when that was denied, he would ask for severance on the grounds that he was prejudiced in front of the jury about what his co-defendants had said. 
    There was also in the back of the courtroom, a small group of men who were later identified as being inmates, who were either out on bond, who were released from prison, who were known to Mayberry. 
    And after he would direct something to the judge, he would turn around in laughing manner toward them, they would again applaud and would stamp their feet and so it’s to create such a disturbance --

    Was there -- as much as it this is within authority of trial, was there any effort in the legislature to get legislation to reveal to this kind of business?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2752.141" stopTime="2831.879">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    I am not aware of any I know that of course that none in the interim period has passed. 
    I cannot say with any certainty that there has been legislation proposed. 
    As I said, binding and gagging didn’t do any good. 
    And at first the judge was leery in the sense of saying anything to Mayberry about his contumacious conduct in front of the jury. 
    I think, very honestly that he felt that he didn’t want to prejudice Mayberry in front of the jury presiding him for contempt and again, Mayberry was acting as his own counsel. 
    So, for the judge to have the jury leave the courtroom and cite him specifically might not have served the purpose or might only -- the end result had Mayberry so inflamed as to continue this course of conduct probably even in a more serious thing and eventually cause the trial to stop. 
    Now, we almost concede that we are concerned about the 11 to 22 years sentence. 
    It does in view of previous contempts, that have come before this Court, seem rather severe. 
    We maintain however, that the actions of Mayberry here were so outrageous and so outlandish as to far exceed anything that has come before this Court.

speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2842.638" stopTime="2855.435">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Yes. 
    That is, I think, the major difficulty before this Court doing anything to lessen the sentence. 
    I think the only course that can be entertained at this point if you feel that 11 to 22 years is cruel and unusual punishments --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2855.435" stopTime="2856.824">

    The habeas corpus?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2856.824" stopTime="2867.725">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    -- is to remand on a habeas corpus, Your Honor. 
    To hold a hearing, to determine all of the relevant facts that must come before this Court can determine that 11 to 22 years was unjustified.

    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Yes, that’s true. 
    We do have a vehicle to deal with this --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2878.024" stopTime="2887.673">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What do you suppose the purpose of giving these contempt sentences was? 
    Certainly, it wasn’t in control of the trial, was it?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2887.673" stopTime="2890.696">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    No, because certainly they were given after the trial. 
    I think the purpose --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2890.696" stopTime="2897.488">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Was it to deter Mayberry? 
    Whenever doing anything like this again, I don’t suppose?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2897.488" stopTime="2943.821">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Well, I think that might have been one of the ends. 
    I think, secondly though, because the case did have a great deal of notoriety. 
    Because of the fact that a lot of inmates penitentiary or prisoners who are out on bail or who rather bond or had not yet come for trial were watching this closely. 
    There’s evidence by a great number of people who came into the courtroom and then a number that had caused a commotion along with Mayberry. 
    I think the purpose was to show that a man cannot do this and get away with it. 
    And that’s the fact that there was so much notoriety, I'm sure the trial judge realized that the prisoners and those come into trial would watch very closely to see how Mayberry was dealt with.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2943.821" stopTime="2969.784">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why shouldn’t, Miss Los or do you think it’s at least bit of sensible to suggest that if a judge thinks that an act in the courtroom is so serous that it justifies the two-year sentence that he must not try it himself, that he is going to wait until after trial?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2969.784" stopTime="2993.286">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    I think the question here ought to be, “What should he have done in 1966?” 
    I think in 1966 under due process standards as the Court, the Pennsylvania Court interpreted them and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted them relying on In re Oliver, the trial judge had the absolute right to sentence the petitioner as the hearing judge.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2993.286" stopTime="3008.381">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But would you know that whenever -- isn’t it the rule that when it appears that a judge is so personally involved and so insulted by contemptuous act that he shouldn’t be the one to try the contempt?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="3008.381" stopTime="3012.698">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Certainly, if the remarks are directed personally to him. 
    It’s our belief --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3012.698" stopTime="3015.524">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That’s clear. 
    Somebody's statements were pretty personal --
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="3015.524" stopTime="3023.195">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    But yes, Your Honor. 
    But the purpose of them I think, and I think the trial judge was able to see this. 
    It was directed towards stopping the trial.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3023.195" stopTime="3030.917">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But when a judge reacts so strongly to having a personal remark directed at them that he gives a man two years for it?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="3030.917" stopTime="3041.171">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    But that’s an assumption we’re making Your Honor.

    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    No, Your Honor.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    We have no distinction of that sort. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    We don’t. 
    But my only answer to that really is and I honestly feel that the judge himself did not feel these were personal attacks upon his own character. 
    I think he understood them in the context of what Mayberry was attempting to do.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3072.690" stopTime="3086.298">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Let me ask. 
    Let’s assume that the trial was held today on the same events in Pennsylvania, let’s assume the same trial took place and the same events happened today?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="3086.298" stopTime="3096.975">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Then I think, we have a completely different ball game because we are then bound by ruling of this Court that if the sentence can exceed six months, certainly, --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3096.975" stopTime="3107.666">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, what's the reason -- what’s the reason for saying that the judge here -- if he wants to give more than six months, he has to have the jury. 
    What's the reason for that?

    I think the severity of the sentence Your Honor.

    Justice William O. Douglas

    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    I think because there, a man’s right to be tried by his on peers where a serious sentence is involved and a serious crime is involved overrides the administration of justice. 
    In other words, the (Inaudible) to the Court which should be dealt with by the judge himself, so --

    I was just going to say, we will not deny that this is a serious a offense.

    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    I don’t feel as if another judge would have to hear this case because it is my firm belief, that while certainly the phrase “a stumbling old dog” were directed toward the judge or “I'm not going to argue with fools”, meaning the judge. 
    I think the purpose was clearly understood.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Do you find any basis and you think that you discovered the case is saying that or a judge chooses to not to exercise his contempt power on episodes of the courtroom are heard or to postpone the holding after the trial in what he is dealing with in the absence of the state’s statutes, it is serious offense?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="3201.161" stopTime="3210.175">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    No, Your Honor.

    These were separate events and correctly separate citation.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3210.175" stopTime="3210.993">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Yes.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3211.572" stopTime="3219.270">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But they were not dealt with at the time by the judge during the course of trial, perhaps a very good reason.
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="3219.270" stopTime="3292.381">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    First of all, the sentencing was not given out until the end of the trial. 
    The petitioner and his co-defendants were warned repeatedly by the trial judge and in fact at one point, judge called counsel before him and expressly asked counsel to go through the possibilities of contempt and the actions of their clients because he felt that they should be well aware that their actions we contemptuous. 
    Now, the fact that he waited until the end of trial, I think, it was done solely to protect the petitioner and his co-defendant. 
    So that the petitioner wouldn’t become first of all, so inflamed and so enraged that he would stop the trial by means of letting the jury know and again, getting so out of hand that the trial couldn’t continue. 
    I think that since his purpose here was to protect the petitioner and certainly to protect the common laws right to see the case through to its just ends, the petitioner cannot, now say, well the judge couldn’t do at the end of trial what he could do in the middle of trial.

speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="3401.521" stopTime="3439.787">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    And that’s why, I respectfully ask, that if you feel this cruel and unusual punishment that you remand it for hearing, so that all the facts can be put before the Court because as the record stands, it’s a very cold record and as exerted, it appears as if Mayberry might have been justified for some of the comments that he made. 
    I think that it so distorts what actually happened to trial that this Court cannot make a determination as to whether or not that was actually cruel and unusual punishment without a complete hearing on what actually occurred.

    It is to me a shocking thing to hear in any Court, 1970 a suggestion that even in 1966.
