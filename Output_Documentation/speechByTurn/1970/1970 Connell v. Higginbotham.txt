    79, Connell against Higginbotham.

    Mr. Rosen, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I'm representing a woman who was ousted from her job as a school teacher in Orange County, Florida because she refused to take a loyalty oath. 
    Incredibly, the oath that was first tendered to -- to the appellant was the duplicate word for word, but the oath that was voided by this Court almost 10 years ago in the Cramp case. 
    Indeed both this case and the Cramp case arose in Orange County and individuals comprise in that county's Board of Public Instruction were defendants in both cases. 
    The Court will forgive counsel, he hopes if he confesses to a sense of déjà vu. 
    The feeling of having been here before is enhanced by the fact that just three years ago, counsel stood at the bar of the Court to plead the Whitehill case on behalf of another teacher who chaffed at the loyalty of. 
    From Cramp through Whitehill and James versus Gilmore, on seven occasions in the last decade, on relatively narrow grounds, this Court has invalidated all state negative loyalty oaths for public employees to come before it. 
    The affirmative or positive oaths have been left standing. 
    Now, we've come full circle, for we are back again to consider the oath and law that was reviewed by the Court in Cramp, the first case in this line. 
    As enacted, the Florida loyalty statute contained five operative phrases, test oaths, we submit each separately or all taken together. 
    In Cramp, this Court declared one of these phrases at least invalid. 
    In the present case, the Court below struck down two more. 
    Over Judge Simpson dissent however, it declared severable and then validated the remaining two phrases. 
    On the surface, one is negative and the other is affirmative. 
    Now, all teachers and all other employees are officials of the State of Florida must now swear an oath in the following form. 
    “That I will support the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Florida, and that I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government to the United States or of the State of Florida by force or violence.” 
    Appellant respectfully submits --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But you think it is unconstitutional for this Court to require as we did this morning, seven or eight men to take an oath that they will support and defend the Constitution?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="236.227" stopTime="411.030">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Your Honor, I'm not here to press the question of whether an Attorney maybe compelled to take an oath to support the Constitution of the United States. 
    I understand that question maybe before the Court right now in three cases. 
    However, I think the case of an Attorney maybe distinguishable, maybe different, really different in the case of a school teacher, a garbage collector, a subway conductor, a -- well, any number of potential public employees of the State of Florida or for that matter of any other state. 
    We are submitting that indiscriminate test oath of all public employees is a test oath, an unconstitutional oath for various reasons. 
    We could also suggest grounds upon which this particular test oath could be voided without the Courts reaching that question. 
    However, we would respectfully submit that it would be appropriate in this case for that question to be reached. 
    But taking the case of the Attorney, Mr. Chief Justice, one could suggest that an Attorney coming to the bar to operate within an system of law under a Constitution might well, at very least as a symbolic act of fidelity take an oath support the Constitution. 
    Whether or not such an Attorney would ever be prosecuted for perjury of course is questionable in my mind, but if cause came on subsequent occasion to think that the oath were taking falsely, we're not quite even certain what that mean of course, but we do believe that the case of an Attorney would be somewhat different from that of just an ordinary public employee. 
    In fact Your Honor, we make five arguments as to the oaths in this case. 
    None of which do turn on particular phrase at issue or whether it is cast in negative or affirmative terms. 
    We propose in this argument to take the high ground and hope to persuade the Court that the time has come at last to address underlying question of whether indiscriminate test oaths, regardless of how they maybe cast, invariably offend the Constitution. 
    Now, we would make five points in this case, two of them address the indiscriminate test oaths or all indiscriminate test oaths. 
    The first is that such test oaths violate the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 
    The second is by operating automatically in an area abutting essential First Amendment Rights, all such test oaths violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in this case or of to federal oath, the Fifth Amendment for lack of a hearing. 
    The other three arguments we would make pertain more specifically to the oaths in this case.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I'm not sure I follow you on --
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="413.426" stopTime="414.381">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    On the hearing, Your Honor?
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="414.381" stopTime="418.050">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- for lack of a hearing, hearing on what and at what stage?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="418.050" stopTime="631.602">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Alright. 
    The hearing might be on two points. 
    It's our submission that all test oaths had within them an element to vagueness and over breath. 
    None of them is quite clear. 
    A layman taking the oath and who takes oath seriously might well wonder what the oath means. 
    There's no provision in the Florida law nor in most laws for any clarification of the oath and the case before the Court is a particularly interesting one in this regard because as the brief demonstrates and the record demonstrates, this Court had in fact struck down one provision in the oath that was first submitted to our client, to the appellant. 
    Now it just so happened, the appellant went to an Attorney and was informed that the oath that she was given was in firm. 
    And then the public -- the school board attempted to cure that oath and we got into a litigation posture. 
    In the absence of a hearing opportunity, that clarification in this case would never have occurred or might never have occurred. 
    In addition, if the oath is it all vague the clarification possibility would never occur, if the person has conscientious reasons to believe that the oath is unclear. 
    Secondly, a large number of people have conscientious objections to the taking of oaths. 
    I'm not merely talking about whether they can swear or affirm, but they conscientiously scruple against taking oaths. 
    Members of the Society of Friends for example, might well not wish to take any oath, members of the Seventh Day Adventist sect. 
    for example, might well not wish to take any oath as this Court recognized in Torcaso I think. 
    So, the indiscriminate across the board automatically operating test oath as in this case provides no opportunity for a person who may have a good constitutional exception to the oath, at least in her case or his in case to assert that exception or it provides absolutely no opportunity for that person to explain his or her reasons for not taking the oath and to provide if that's necessary the kind of a record to demonstrate whether in fact they are a risk to the Government in an employment capacity. 
    Now, as I suggested, we will make three other arguments and have made them in our brief, addressed to the oaths at issue in this particular case. 
    The first argument will be that it is illuminated by the Florida Supreme Court on remanding the Cramp case, each of the phrases, each of oaths in this case is unconstitutionally broad in derogation of the First Amendment. 
    If not unconstitutionally broad, our second specific argument would be that each again is illuminated or perhaps obfuscated is the proper word by the Florida Supreme Court is unduly vague in violation of the Fourteenth and First Amendments. 
    And finally under the Florida tests of severability, given the gloss put upon the oath by the Florida Supreme Court in Cramp on remand, any surviving provisions of the statute must now fall. 
    Now, if Your Honors will, I'll take up each of the points in order. 
    The first point is that test oaths generally are unconstitutional.

    And certainly this Court in dictum, in Bond versus Floyd recognized that the State might well require of a state legislator, an oath that it could not require of a private citizen. 
    Now, it's important that Chief Justice Warren in speaking to the oath and Bond versus Floyd's used almost precisely those words.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Supporting constitution?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="780.282" stopTime="877.083">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Well, if this oath is illuminated by a gloss provided by the Supreme Court of Florida which is controlling on the meaning of the oath now. 
    In Cramp on remand, the Supreme Court of Florida said the obvious legislative purpose in enacting the subject statute was to prevent the election or employment of public officials and employees who are knowingly disloyal to the Government of the United States or to the State of Florida and who subscribed to the doctrine of accomplishing a change in Government by employment to force or violence. 
    We suggest the two words in that clause are unclear, unconstitutionally unclear. 
    We do not know what disloyal means and we do not know what subscribe means as used by the highest court of the State of Florida. 
    I took the occasion to look up the words subscribe again and I notice that the first three meanings have to do with signing a writing document or undertaking. 
    I'm not sure that that what's the highest court of Florida meant when it used the word subscribe. 
    I'm not sure how far they meant to go when they use the word subscribing. 
    Further, the word disloyal or disloyalty does confound me, that's as to this oath. 
    Now, that gloss where not present, if the Florida law merely said that all persons excepting office under the laws of Florida or of any political subdivision must take an oath to support and uphold or to -- well, support and uphold will do, the constitutions of the United States and of the State of Florida, then our position Mr. Justice Marshall is that oath would be unconstitutional as to mere public employees not in position of sensitivity.

    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Well, on that point the vagueness, we're not pressing that particular point to vagueness. 
    The point of vagueness we press is the Supreme Court of Florida's gloss on this particular affirmative oath when you're dealing with the affirmative oath. 
    But as to her, we would still suggest that the affirmative oath put to a school teacher or a sanitation employee or someone in that category is an undue invasion of their First Amendment Rights. 
    There is no good reason why the Government should require -- well, to start with the sanitation workers to take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. 
    We can see some reason why the Government might require civics teacher Mr. Chief Justice to stand up and say that she will support the Constitution of the United States. 
    However, we do not believe if the Government can meet the burden of subordinating interest and substantial interest has been set recently by this Court in Shapiro versus Thompson which must be met before you can invade First Amendment Rights.

    That's right. 
    Now, its interesting that the rule of this Court until recently was a rule that had to be executed in person.

    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Originally, I believe there was a difference. 
    I think the difference consists in two parts, well, one major part. 
    It seems to me the oath to affirm the Constitution is basically a symbolic oath. 
    It's a public gesture of fidelity to the Constitution to the basic system of Government and of law, and it's a useful symbol and tradition to have the President of the United States, for example, on the occasion of his inauguration or the justices of the Supreme Court or other high Government officers taking oath of fidelity to the Constitutions to the basic document. 
    I think it's very useful.

    I assume that each man who takes the oath for high Government office takes it conscientiously and believes he understands what the oath means and he intends to uphold and support the Constitution of the United States, but in terms of the basic values of the society, yes, I think it is basically symbolic. 
    I could hardly imagine that it would be enforced through a perjury prosecution for example and I do not see the symbolism of having a sanitation worker or even a teacher sign a piece of paper saying that she will or he will as the cost of the privilege of taking of our garbage or teaching our children uphold --

    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    In this case, this case you can not even worry about the affirmative oath question but of course in Cole versus Richardson which the Court remanded last year, the question has been refiled in the -- or Cole versus Richardson has been refiled before the Court and the question is being pressed upon the Court on a numerable occasions. 
    In this case, we're dealing with school teacher. 
    In Cole as I recall, we were not -- you were not dealing with the school teacher. 
    The woman was a laboratory technician which if the area of education is one that seems to give rise to a reason for sensitivity and for the symbolism of the oath, well certainly a lab technician in a biomedical facility may move away from the school teacher area toward the sanitation worker area. 
    But if you move into the school teacher area where surely the reasons for giving the oath or for requiring the oath may seem greater, you also find Your Honors, that the reasons for not requiring the oath are greater. 
    And numerable decisions of this Court have recognized the centrality of academic freedom to the First Amendment, indeed to all essential democratic rights in our society.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1300.912" stopTime="1310.820">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You think -- you think that school teachers are entitled to more freedom in that respect than the Supreme Court justices and lawyers to practice before the Court?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="1310.820" stopTime="1363.942">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    Yes, in that respect. 
    I am both a school teacher and a lawyer and I think that if I have to take the oath as a school teacher, it would bother me a great deal more than I have to take the oath as a lawyer. 
    I have taken the oath as a lawyer of course, but yes, school teachers according to the decisions of this Court Mr. Chief Justice are entitled to what appears at least on my reading of the recent decisions to be a higher protection of the First Amendment than most of the folk in our society because of the essentiality of academic freedom, because of the very, very tenuous and subtle and well, very fragile nature of the academic setting. 
    Our second point --

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Rosen, could I ask you, does the record disclose the grade at which your client taught?

    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    She was either in the first or to the third grade Mr. Justice Blackmun.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    You draw any distinction between teaching in the elementary levels as compared with teaching in law school for instance, so far as the oath is concerned?
speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="1388.033" stopTime="1508.685">
    Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen 
    No, we do not. 
    I can see that that such distinctions can be made, but we do not believe they make a difference. 
    The basic function of the oath is served in neither occasions. 
    To the extent that the State's interest maybe in avoiding indoctrination of either third graders or law school students in subversive concepts or subversive ideas whatever they maybe, I would submit the State has other means by which it can accomplish that end without requiring teachers to go to de novo in some cases, ends of having to subscribe a test oath. 
    The second point that we make in terms of the broad-based unconstitutionality of the indiscriminate test oath. 
    The oath given to all people who somehow come within the State's power either by way of employee or one who requests a benefit is that because of the automatic nature of the disability, the First Amendment Rights are even more greatly invaded or the danger to the First Amendment rights is even greater. 
    Therefore, at the very least if such oaths or such inquiry can be made, there must be provision for hearing as there was indeed in the New York cases, both in Adler and in Keyishian. 
    Some provision for a hearing at least whereby the oath or the inquiry can be clarified and the applicant or the one who is being asked to subscribe the oath may in fact state her reservations. 
    Now, the specific objections to the oath and the statute in this case, the oath of Florida and the statute of Florida really illuminate, we feel the defects of all test oaths. 
    In the first instant under the gloss provided by the Florida Supreme Court, each of the oaths in fact unduly invades First Amendment interests.

   Argument of Stephen Marc Slepin
speaker="stephen_marc_slepin" startTime="1824.401" stopTime="2167.447">
    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    Yes sir, thank you sir. 
    May It please the Court. 
    In employing a perspective slightly different from the perspective in which the appellee's brief was cast without abandoning any of the arguments in that brief, in the next few moments I just like to take account of appellant's argument within the somewhat per se context of a three-fold argument if I may. 
    The position that the appellees going to advance to the Court this afternoon are briefly stated these. 
    First, we think that the court below was correct in assuming and we think to that it was on operative assumption that oaths per se, we're not concerned for the moment with the content of the oath, are constitutionally legitimate running as they do, we think and as the Court pointed out through the very pith and marrow of the American experience. 
    Secondly, we think the Court was correct in advancing that assumption to a position that governmental employment as such maybe conditioned upon an oath under certain circumstances and we'll deal again with the content of the oath in just a moment. 
    Secondly, we're going to take the position that the Court was quite correct in upholding after certain judicial excisions, the instant oath which is now before this Court and in the context of that I'd like to deal with the due process arguments advanced by the appellant. 
    And then finally, I'd like to advance the argument that the court below was correct with respect to the doctrine of severalability in holding in effect that the doctrine is alive and is well, and then the case of Jackson and as well as in the Cramp case is alive, well and resident within this very chambers. 
    First of all, Your Honors, we're going to be somewhat less categorical than the appellant. 
    We want to speak to this case before the bar at this point and we will paint with a brush less broad than a comet's tail. 
    We want to take the position, Your Honors as this Court knows, that Article II, Section VII of the Constitution itself prescribes an oath and later, I want to point out that the oath which it does prescribe for the President of the United States is far broader, far vaguer if you will, far less specific than the oath with which were confronted in the instant case. 
    Article VI, Clause II of the Constitution requires that all executive, judicial and legislative officers of the United States and the several States must subscribe to an oath and as we noted in our brief, the first Congress in 1789 precisely prescribed an oath. 
    This morning, I stood before this Court and very proudly subscribed to an oath promulgated by this Court and imposed upon me by this Court pursuant to Rule V, an oath which I want to point out to the Court was a tri-part tied oath was far more expensive, if you will, far less specific than the oath attendant to the cause at bar at the present time. 
    In the case of Bond v. Floyd, this Court held very categorically it seem to me if somewhat off handedly, “A legislator of course can be required to swear to support the Constitution of the United States as a condition of holding office. 
    We do not quarrel with the State's contention that the oath provisions of the United States in Georgia Constitutions do not violate the First Amendment.” 
    And then finally, at page 247 of lawyers edition in Bond v. Floyd, “Of course a State may constitutionally require a note to support the Constitution from its legislators,” and then, as Mr. Rosen pointed out in the Hosack case, in the Knight case, and the Olson case affirmed by this Court, the so-called affirmative mode of the loyalty oath was exacted, it was sustained and this Court affirmed. 
    In Gilmore versus James, which was a case that had to do precisely with organizational membership and that particular oath or affidavit was struck down, nevertheless, the Court pointed out that the affirmative mode of an oath as such was hardly repugnant to the Constitution because the Constitution requires one in one place and prescribes it in another place. 
    And then lastly, in the case of Stewart versus Washington which again, is not on point because it dealt with subscription to Title V of the US Code was a far more involved case than the one at bar, nevertheless in dicta, Stewart versus Washington the, Court pointed out that the oath in the affirmative mode was part and parcel of our Constitution and our constitutional experience. 
    I suggest to the Court that the oath per se is constitutionally legitimate on at least two grounds. 
    Number one, the Constitution of the United States in two articles, admits of an oath and prescribes an oath. 
    And then secondly, this Court has held and I would cite the Court to the Mitchell case and I would cite the Court as well to Ex Parte Curtis that governmental employment maybe conditioned and maybe conditioned in such a way that the employee may claim an infringement of his First Amendment Rights, but that the Court itself will then determine not whether there has been an infringement because in the Mitchell case upholding the Hatch Act, the Court admitted an infringement of several provisions of the Constitution and rights derivative there from, but it will decide rather the permissibility or impermissibility of the extent of this alleged infringement.

    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    It was unquestionably done in this case. 
    The error is unblinkable Your Honor. 
    I have no knowledge that it has been done elsewhere. 
    It seems to me that it's a case of error, omission, oversight or delinquency and the case of Adams which is you know is to be before this Court and various portions of that record are included, was a case incidentally where some of the members of the University of Florida staff were employed for some substantial period of time before they were ever presented with an oath which is very much like Knight versus the Board of Regents pointed out if the oath was adopted 1934 and I think the Knight case is brought in 1967, several years after some members of that faculty of the Delphi had been employed not presented with the oath. 
    It was a delinquency in this case Your Honor and the Court moved very quickly to remedy that delinquency and to point out as did the Board of Public Education in Orange County after it was notified by counsel from Mrs. Kennel that that portion of the oath which this Court had dealt with in the Cramp case had no proper place being submitted to Mrs. Kennel and she was under no legal obligation to subscribe.

    But there's no question that that was an error and a delinquency on their part, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2288.997" stopTime="2300.778">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And you don't know whether or not it's the -- it was at least the practice -- their practice to submit this form generally or whether this was just an individual idiosyncrasy?
speaker="stephen_marc_slepin" startTime="2300.778" stopTime="2458.437">
    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    No sir. 
    No sir, that was the point of the question I suspect without any knowledge and I have no knowledge that this was adduced in the testimony below that the impermissible form with the excise phrase was generally distributed, yes sir. 
    And in fact in the Adams case, the Court will recall from those portions of the record which are included in the appellant's brief, there was remedial action taken by the administration, admittedly 10 years after the fact to withdraw the impermissibly enlarged oath and to submit a revised oath with the excise provision deleted, yes sir. 
    The position that the appellees wish to take before this Court is complicated somewhat Your Honors by virtue of our inability to follow this ariadne thread of the appellant. 
    The appellant seems to take the position that vagueness is applicable when a person is a school teacher, but vagueness as a constitutional challenge somehow is not applicable when one is a legislator. 
    To take the position that some of the arguments apply to sanitarians, but others don't seem to apply to teachers and I confess, though this is an admission which perhaps I'm not compel to make, that I'm not quite following that particular argument. 
    I am following the argument of this Court's statement in Bond, in the three cases which it affirmed and with respect to the oath, I took with respect to the two prescribe oaths that Government employment maybe conditioned upon the exaction of an oath. 
    And I might point out to the Court right now that I am persuative that the State of Florida and then the other state could exact from a doctor who becomes an employee of the State and who takes the position as an employee in one of the State Hospitals. 
    An oath making him disclaim, if you will, that he is suppose to intercept us, to making disclaim that he is an advocate of Euthanasia and its not beyond the realm or by the reason or experience that a man who favors Euthanasia or a man who was opposed to Dr. Lester's discoveries and who does not believe in antiseptic procedures, founds it upon either religious commitment or you if will, political commitment. 
    Morris Cone once said not who -- not all who rave or divinely inspired and it maybe that a man is misdirected, but nevertheless feels he has a First Amendment Right to believe in Euthanasia. 
    Yet, I think that an oath per se addressed to this individual is most eminently reasonable and ought not to offend constitutional rights.

    Our position is that there are two belief clauses and I think that's precisely what the appellant said. 
    The appellant said that the affirmative mode of the oath which reads as follows, “I do hear by solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution” is in point of fact he says. 
    A belief oath and its really a negative oath masquerading as an affirmative oath.

    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    The other requirement is “I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of Florida by force and violence” and we support that and I should like to cite to the Court at this point the opinion of the lower court in Olson versus Phillips affirmed by this Court at 397 U.S. 317. 
    The Olson oath was an oath Your Honor, to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Colorado. 
    In explanation of that oath, the Olson case went on to say and I quote, “The present oath is an affirmation of belief in organic law and disbelief in the use of force to overthrow the Government.”

    You do indeed, Your Honor and I'm urging upon the Court the reasoning of the Olson Court not the strict words which I'm -- which I certainly would not claim that this Court adopted per se. 
    The point I'm making is that if the affirmative oath means anything to uphold the Constitution, it seems to me could quite reasonably and I think its preeminently reasonable mean that one of vows a belief in organic law and the infinite mutability of the Constitution through the organic process and the avowal simultaneously a disbelief in the utilization of force and violence to overthrow the Government. 
    Now, the point that we wish to make in this regard is simply this: no hearing procedure is prescribed or allowed by the Constitution with respect to President of the United States nor with respect to myself and my four colleagues who stood before the bar this morning, nor is it allowed so far as I know to members of the executive legislative and judicial departments of the Federal Government of the several states.

    How can you place that [Attempt to Laughter]?
speaker="stephen_marc_slepin" startTime="2696.337" stopTime="2830.900">
    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    At any rate, the State does, as this Court pointed out, have a vital concern in maintaining the security of the State and the question is, What can they do in that regard? 
    Now, if I have to swear an oath and an oath which I would point out to the Court requires me, not merely to uphold the Constitution Your Honor, but an oath to conduct myself uprightly whatever that means, to draw upon the vagueness argument of the appellant, an oath to conduct myself according to law whatever that means to draw upon the scalpel use by the appellant, then it seems to me clear that its far more specific to require in the affirmative and the negative mode, these two avows of belief and disbelief and that's all the State of Florida is doing. 
    The question is, are oaths per se anathematized by the Constitution and the answer is no. 
    May the Government condition employment or office upon the exaction of the oath and the answer is sometimes depending upon the nature of the oath. 
    Is a hearing necessary if one requires an officer or employee to swear that he will uphold the Constitution. 
    None has provided the President, none is provided me, none is provided you. 
    We think it's not necessary with respect to an affirmative oath. 
    Is it vague to say that one swears to preserve, to protect, and to defend the Constitution as the President must according to Article II. 
    Certainly, it's far vaguer than saying, I don't believe in the violent overthrow of the Government. 
    Is it a prediction as opposed to a promise because appellant asks this Court to invalidate this oath on the grounds that it may well be a mere prediction. 
    One maybe predicting when one says, I do not believe in the violent overthrow, that violent overthrow will come as opposed to promising. 
    I should think that this was set to rest in the Dodge (ph) case when the Court says, that belief means a promise; not a prediction and if were not content with the Dodge (ph) case in light of subsequent cases, then I merely refer this Court to the oath prescribed by Article II which says, I will execute and surely the President is saying that he promises to execute, not that history will demonstrate that he did execute. 
    The meaning of these oaths Your --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2830.900" stopTime="2840.315">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But the whole problem about hearing as to the presidential oath, I don't know of any elected President as refused to take it?

    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    I most surely do not sir. 
    I see no need for a hearing and the very interesting argument, and I think the correct argument made in the Smiley and Olson cases is that a hearing has to do with the weighing and sifting and finding of evidence. 
    It has to do with the confrontation of the accusers and it has to do with cross examination, none of which applies to the instant situation.

    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    Yes sir. 
    As I pointed out and indeed as this Court has pointed out, State has very compelling concern it seems to me in the beliefs as a spring to action. 
    Surely, we're not so obstructionist that we want to be exceedingly careful as to belief that human belief is a relevant to human conduct. 
    And this Court has pointed out time and again that the State has a vital concern in education. 
    Indeed in the Brown case versus the Board of Education, it was noted that education the principle business today of Government. 
    This Court has noted in Shelton and Tucker and earlier Adler is concerned with the very sensitive minds of its students.

    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    No sir. 
    Unlike one or two of other cases with which this Court was concerned, principally the case of the California tax exemption, there is no weighing and sifting, no judgmental element which enters into this. 
    And that case is the Court recalls, the assessor was mandated to make factual determinations. 
    The swearing of this oath or the refusal to swear the oath is dispositive of the matter under Florida law and one -- yes, sir.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Slepin, let me -- somewhere along the line will you comment on the argument that the true subversive isn't going to be bothered by any loyalty oath in the first place. 
    I want you to touch on that before you get down to --
speaker="stephen_marc_slepin" startTime="2989.425" stopTime="3089.384">
    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    I'll comment directly upon it at this point if I may sir. 
    I think its probably true that one who is engaged in espionage or one who has an insidious purpose is not going to scruple at either lying or taking some other action which will avoid, placing them in the clutches of the law or which will at place him outside the area in which he would like to find himself to carry out his mission and while it seems to me quite clear and I should certainly be a fooling and diluting myself if I were to take any other position that the Florida loyalty oath like any oath is not a panacea in terms of security. 
    And that the Florida loyalty oath does not assure the school authorities that they're having present in their classrooms, competent, dedicated loyal people. 
    It is a measure number one, which we don't think is constitutionally impermissible and therefore, it is measure as are so many measures within the broad discretion of the legislator of the State of Florida. 
    And if the legislature of the state feels that this is one important symbol and the symbol which may have more or less utilitarian effect, then it seems to me so long as it is constitutionally permissible, the legislature of the State of Florida and her sister states must be granted that leave to impose such a symbolic oath. 
    And indeed we would seize upon the question put to counsel for appellant, it is in point of fact a symbolic oath and we feel it is a symbolic and it is important to note as was subscribed before this Court this morning, and as the Constitution itself requires.

    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    For University personnel, Your Honor. 
    For public school personnel, it's what's called a continuing contract, meaning that after they've taught for approximately three years, they then go on a continuing contract and may only be dismissed for cause and they are procedures outlined for that. 
    So, it's called continuing contract in the elementary and secondary schools, a tenure in the higher education area. 
    And let me just fleetingly refer to severability. 
    This Court stated the rule in Jackson. 
    It was stated by the Supreme Court of Florida in Cramp and it's quite clear that we have an affirmative, the negative mode requiring in a avowal of belief and avowal of disbelief fundamentally probably the same of avowals, if you will, and I don't think the Constitution, and I think the cases don't say that the Constitution anathematizes a grammatically negative oath irrespective of what the meaning of it is. 
    And I should think that this Court would not commit itself to the proposition that because an oath happens to be framed in the negative then there is some supervening commandment which says that negative oaths per se are objectionable to the Constitution. 
    Several --

    May I ask you is that oath as you interpret it means that the person who takes it has to swear that he will never under any circumstances or conditions, no matter how bad the Government maybe attempt to overthrow it?

    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin

    I think that it does not. 
    I think that it does not as I stated to this Court, Your Honor, and I trust that I'm on reasonable ground, thought makes me far less categorical in my statements than appellant who challenges all oaths under any circumstances. 
    It seems to me that we are concerned with this case at this time involving these parties. 
    We are not and I'm as grateful as Your Honor is living in the Third Reich at this point and we are not faced it seems to me, Your Honor, with the circumstance which faced Simon Wehre (ph) or some other revolutionary who is concerned with the Gestapo or who is concerned with the totalitarian state. 
    And if Your Honor asks me whether I would project this oath into the abstract, I can only tell Your Honor that I trust that the defend -- parties, defendant and appellees in this case are perhaps in their own way every bit is committed to the notion of individual liberty and freedom as are the appellants in this particular cause.

    Mr. Stephen Marc Slepin 
    Your Honor, I think that the Judge Leonard Hand put it, well, and it maybe very paradoxical. 
    As I recall he said, “the Government, any Government, and I assume he meant a totalitarian one juridically as well as our Government has the right to protect itself against revolution and any person oppressed by that Government who does not have available to him constitutional means of altering that Government has a moral right to do what he can to alter it.” 
    And I think that's the everlasting, living paradox with which any man in any state is caught. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
