Nelson v. O'Neil
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="21.528">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- next in number 336, Nelson against O'Neil. 
    Mr. Kirk you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="21.528" stopTime="143.720">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The central question in this case is Bruton there. 
    Was the respondent O'Neil, given the opportunity to cross-examine a co-defendant Runnels, who in a confession implicated O'Neil or to perhaps phrase it as the Court of Appeal did, was there an opportunity for effective cross-examination. 
    I think a central to the determination of this question is examination of the purpose of confrontation, and is this Court recently said in Dutton v. Evans and I quote, ?The decisions of this Court make it clear that the mission of the Confrontation Clause is to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth determining process in criminal trials by assuring that the trier of fact has a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.? 
    Now before looking to the options available, when the confessing co-defendant takes that stand as Mr. Runnels did in this case, let's see what this case does not involve. 
    This case does not involve a Pointer type issue where the witness never takes a stand and is never cross-examined, never available. 
    This is not a Douglas type issue where the co-defendant takes the stand, but by invoking the privilege against self-incrimination removes himself from any possibility of either direct or cross-examination. 
    So, when the Court of --

    Did Runnels on any ground attempted to remain silent and refused to testify?

    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    No, Your Honor.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    That is my viewpoint, Your Honor. 
    He had the full opportunity, he could have done so if he wanted, but he did not.

    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk

    Why wouldn't ? what wouldn't he want to --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    They were -- both had passed without -- 
    That's right. 
    This is precisely my point. 
    I think that the respondent confuses the technique of cross-examination. 
    What's the purpose of cross-examination? 
    The technique is assuredly to make the fellow develop some kind of conflict, if you want to or prove inconsistencies, if you want to. 
    But if that man is on your side, if that witness is on your side and fully supporting your defense --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="222.456" stopTime="239.065">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Ordinarily, a witness testifying in a way which helps the State against you, obviously you want to cross-examine him on that, testifying in a way which was to help state or it helps you --

    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    You certainly can. 
    This was --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="246.602" stopTime="258.461">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Having the story in your paper again? 
    It may -- you may call it a cross-examination, but you still get to tell precisely the same story, you get -- no I didn't make the statement.
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="258.461" stopTime="477.495">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    This is what -- 
    Mr. Justice White, this is precisely what happened when the state prosecutor cross-examined Mr. Runnels. 
    He went back and said, ?Well, didn't you talk to Officer Traphagen?? 
    And Mr. Runnels says, Sure, I did. 
    Didn't Officer Traphagen asked you a few did this and so? 
    Sure, he did and, didn't you say you did? 
    No, I didn't. 
    I never -- I -- once I found out that I had a right to attorney, I calmed up and didn't say anything further. 
    And the -- then the prosecutor said, well, didn't you really do this, didn't you really commit this crime and he said, no I didn't do any such thing. 
    This was -- these options where all available to Mr. O'Neil's counsel. 
    He complains that perhaps, he couldn't bring out the fact or that he couldn't bring up the fact that maybe O'Neil was have some kind of motive, have some kind of dislike for -- maybe Runnels have some kind of dislike for O'Neil because O'Neil had sort of told on him as Officer Traphagen had told Mr. Runnels. 
    But, he could have asked Runnels that he could have said do you dislike O'Neil? 
    Runnels would have said, ?No.? 
    Would your dislike for O'Neil could have caused you to make this statement? 
    I didn't make any statement at all. 
    I like O'Neil, we didn't do it. 
    This was available, but it wasn't done. 
    Now, so I think, I think that that you've really pointed out, perhaps the ultimate question, the better question here. 
    Why should O'Neil attack the statement at all? 
    Cross-examination is a tool, but you don't use tools unwisely. 
    You don't use tools if you don't need to and they didn't need to. 
    Now, I, myself have wondered how the Court of Appeals could say there wasn't any effective cross-examination in this case or wasn't any possibility? 
    The Court of Appeals didn't say and Mr. O'Neil has proffered a few explanations in his brief before this Court, and we touched on some of them with my answers. 
    Namely, he says that, ?You can only have effective cross-examination if the witness -- if you can bring out qualifications in his testimony of other things.? 
    Again, this is confusing the technique with the purpose of cross-examination. 
    I mentioned again, that there's not point to probe Runnels' anger. 
    He could have asked Runnels if he was angry at him, but he didn't. 
    He says you can't probe the statement for omissions or errors or inconsistencies. 
    Well, you don't want to. 
    This statement -- this statement, what more could he want? 
    Then what Runnels -- then what Runnels gave him on the stand. 
    As the dissenting judge below pointed out, ?the best O'Neil could hope for would be for Runnels to testify that the confession was false and that O'Neil did not commit the crimes.? 
    Here, Runnels gave O'Neil all that and more. 
    He denied that he confessed and said at O'Neil was not at the scene of the crimes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="477.495" stopTime="482.615">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I gather that Runnels did admit, having a conversation with the detective?
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="482.615" stopTime="484.155">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    He did admit --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="484.155" stopTime="490.944">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And didn't -- and just said he just disagreed is what the content was of the conversation.
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="490.944" stopTime="495.115">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    Yes, he did Mr. Justice White. 
    And not only that, but he said --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="495.115" stopTime="506.969">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the circumstances of the conversation were available for investigation. 
    I mean, under what circumstances did you have this conversation. 
    Was there any violence or threats, or promises or anything else?
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="506.969" stopTime="538.030">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    This was available for expiration. 
    In fact, this is one of the points that was brought out in the closing arguments. 
    I remember they brought in one witness who said, ?Well, I talked to officer Traphagen and he said that he was going to give Runnels five to 10 years, if the told me something and one year to life if he didn't, so I told Runnels and then Runnels confessed. 
    This kind of thing was all available for expiration, but it wasn't done.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let me ask you this question Mr. Kirk. 
    Suppose the State have not call Runnels at all.

    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    They didn't.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let me get the setting now of the cross-examination. 
    Suppose the State had called him, excuse me, suppose the State had called him and he simply relayed that he had conversations, but denied the content as it was. 
    What would the situation be in your view?
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="570.877" stopTime="573.147">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk

    No. 
    Admits having had a conversation with the policeman but denies the policeman's version of it?

    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk

    But on who's call?
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="583.727" stopTime="598.406">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    This is on the defendant on -- he was appearing as his own witness and at the same time as a witness for Mr. O'Neil. 
    It makes no difference as far as I can see, who calls him with this particular -- this is the result of his testimony.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="598.406" stopTime="606.176">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But it makes the difference in terms of the sequence of his testimony, and whether he is being cross-examined or not, doesn't it?
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="606.176" stopTime="626.511">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    Well, it depends insofar as who is cross examining him, that's indeed true. 
    In fact, although here, the cross-examination came by his co-defendant who was being tried at same time, so he still have cross examination by a defendant as opposed to cross examination by the prosecutor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="626.511" stopTime="640.811">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But if the defendant himself had called him, could he have said any -- could he have given any testimony more favorable to the respondent here than he gave as it appears in this record now?
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="640.811" stopTime="648.912">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    I don't think so. 
    There are certainly alternatives. 
    I mean, he could have said well, I said that but I was beaten.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="648.912" stopTime="657.216">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And that's one of the reasons why as Mr. Justice Brennan suggested that there was no occasion to cross-examine him.
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="657.216" stopTime="686.494">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    Because he had the perfect, the most favorable result from his direct examination came out. 
    I didn't say it and we weren't there. 
    This was the ultimate kind of response you can get from a witness as to these particular facts. 
    This is exactly what O'Neil got. 
    There was no reason to cross-examine him. 
    Now --

    It's -- there was availability to cross-examination. 
    If the trial were held today, I suppose the prosecution after Runnels had taken the stand, he is available for cross-examination could -- well, the evidence was inadmissible then admissible against the defendant, wasn't it on the merits?
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="737.169" stopTime="739.447">

    On the merits, yes.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I mean, the limiting instruction was no longer necessary?
speaker="charles_r_b_kirk" startTime="743.654" stopTime="905.364">
    Mr. Charles R. B. Kirk 
    Today, it would not be. 
    I think either under the decisions of this Court in Green, suggesting that this is available, a substantive of evidence, certainly under California law or in Harris v. New York where it could be used at least for the purposes of impeachment to -- against Mr. Runnels testifying in behalf of O'Neil. 
    This certainly militates against any claim of harm which assuming for purposes of argument you would even reach. 
    I don't have a great deal to add, but I would like to briefly touch upon the last argument which the respondent has categorized as a pro forma argument. 
    This is in relation to the concept of exhaustion. 
    Perhaps, it's a pro forma to respond and it certainly is not pro forma to us as a state. 
    It's a rather short argument because there is not really much to say. 
    When -- the point is this. 
    When new principles are announced by this Court, some Court must examine, when it's a retroactive principle, it must examine all cases. 
    This is a new remedy, Bruton, was a new remedy under Roberts. 
    It was a new decision. 
    It was a remedy presently available, and in the interest of comity which this Court has just recently emphasized in Harris v. Younger and Boyle v. Landry and other cases, in the interest of comity and in the interest of preserving the dual nature of federalism, it would seemed that it would be better to refer cases such as this back to the state court for an initial look. 
    The point is this. 
    Now, I agree that you could argue that well, you already in federal Court, why go back to the state court? 
    That's not really a question. 
    Here the trial transcript had not even been submitted to the federal court at the time we argued exhaustion. 
    Some Court must examine this transcript. 
    This one is I would say relatively short by some standards of trials in our State. 
    But I think that it would be -- it would further the concept of federalism and certainly reduce the burden on the federal judiciary, if exhaustion were utilized, when a new decision creates. 
    It -- what is in effect a new remedy and makes it presently available.

   Argument of James S. Campbell
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="919.742" stopTime="929.371">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Kirk. 
    Mr. Campbell?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="929.371" stopTime="959.324">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case involves evidence of an oral, unrecorded statement reportedly made by a suspect during custodial interrogation, a statement that accuses another person of participation in a crime, a statement reported in court by an investigating officer who conducted the interrogation. 
    This is unreliable evidence. 
    It's one of the most unreliable forms of evidence known to the law. 
    Yet, it is also --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="959.324" stopTime="962.924">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I'm not sure I have that clear. 
    Which is the unreliable evidence?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="962.924" stopTime="969.716">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    The unreliable evidence is the evidence of the statement, this alleged statement.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="969.716" stopTime="972.537">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you -- you're going to develop for us, why that's unreliable --
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="972.537" stopTime="1082.325">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    Yes I will Mr. Chief Justice. 
    This evidence in addition to being unreliable is also devastating. 
    It's powerfully incriminating evidence as this Court described it in Bruton. 
    This unreliability and this devastating impact are the two most important factors to keep in mind in determining whether O'Neil had in this case an adequate opportunity to cross-examine his accuserd. 
    In other kinds of cases, involving other kinds of evidence, dying declarations, spontaneous declarations, documentary evidence of one kind or another, business records, it may well be that something less than the fullest and most effective cross-examination will suffice to satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause. 
    But if there's any evidence as to which a defendant is entitled to have the true and full measure of cross-examination. 
    It is the highly unreliable and powerfully incriminating evidence which went before the jury that convicted O'Neil. 
    Now, O'Neil did not have a full and effective opportunity to cross-examine all the witnesses against him, for the alleged maker of this devastating out of court accusation, flatly denied having made the statement. 
    Fully effective cross-examination of an out of court accusation of this type, can occur only when the witness to whom the statement is attributed, affirms the statement in Court, so that the accused can probe its truthfulness by all the many lines of attack that we include under the head of cross-examination. 
    This principle is established in the case at bar as govern by the decisions of this Court in Douglas against Alabama and Bruton against the United States.

    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    Well, then there are two further facts which may change the result.

    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    Well, to the extent that he admits making the statement, but denies the content of it. 
    Now, he says it's genuine but that it wasn't true, then you have the situation which -- a situation which the United States is amicus curiae in Green said there would be effective cross-examination in this case. 
    The United States in Green took the position that where there was a flat denial of the statement as to its genuineness and its truthfulness, there can be no effective cross-examination, that's our case here. 
    The -- a further case is the one where the witness admits the genuineness of the statement but denies its truthfulness. 
    That is somewhat more like that Green case, but still not too Green. 
    The third situation is the one where the witness affirms making the statement, and he affirms the truthfulness of what's contained in there. 
    Then, he essentially incorporates and reproduces the accusations in Court and at that point, the only -- which it again, not our case, the only remaining argument against the admission of the statement under those circumstances would simply be a straight due process argument that despite this fact, the evidence is still so unreliable that the traditional exclusion of evidence of this sort is required as a constitutional matter.

    Now, if a witness is called, gives direct examination which just has no real impact on any on the particular case at all, just not a bit harmful. 
    It doesn't help; it doesn't hurt just largely irrelevant.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now the defendant's counsel here, respondent's counsel at trial made that kind of a decision, a tactical decision here, didn't he?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="1306.929" stopTime="1310.262">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    Yes, he did not, O'Neil's counsel did not cross-examine Runnels.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1310.262" stopTime="1313.633">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, then why would you think he made that decision?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="1313.633" stopTime="1336.765">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    I think he made that decision because he realized he could not fully effectively cross-examine the really damaging evidence in this case by addressing questions to Runnels. 
    The most that he could hope to do would be to elicit from Runnels a cumulative repetition of the denial of the statement which Runnels had already made on examination by his own counsel. 
    The notion that this denial --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1336.765" stopTime="1384.031">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How was Runnels' testimony damaging? 
    The denial which Runnels offered in Court was of sum, but very, very limited assistance to the defense, it was unnecessary part of the defense. 
    Obviously, the co-defendant Runnels would had to deny making a statement if is not going to plead not guilty, a statement which incriminates him as well as his co-defendant, but the point -- the evidence that were concerned about, the evidence -- the accusation which has not been cross-examined and which can't be cross-examined by addressing question to Runnels is this out of Court in custody accusation that is reported, this alleged accusation, it's reported in court through the testimony of the police officer.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1384.031" stopTime="1391.526">

    Isn't a proper way to attack to that by cross examining the officer when he testifies about it?

    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    No, I do not. 
    I simply say that that opportunity to cross-examine the officer and the opportunity to address further questions to Runnels denying the statement, do not amount to a full and effective opportunity to cross-examine the most damaging evidence in this case. 
    This out of Court accusation is particularly incriminating and particularly unreliable kind of evidence.

speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1506.602" stopTime="1510.993">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So, that was his tactical, refusal to exercise his rights.

    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    No, I'm not complaining about that. 
    But if that had been sufficient cross-examination of this out of Court accusation, both Bruton and Douglas would have had to been decided otherwise. 
    In Douglas, there were law officers on the stand --

speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="1554.270" stopTime="1556.305">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    That's in the context this trial, that's correct.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Right and he didn't cross-examine either one?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="1559.463" stopTime="1578.102">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    That's right. 
    He did not exercise his opportunity to address questions to either of those witnesses. 
    The point is that that opportunity which he had, which he admittedly had is not an opportunity to cross-examine his accusers on the accusations made to them. 
    It's not a fully effective opportunity to do that.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1578.102" stopTime="1581.168">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    How could he accurately cross-examine his accusers?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="1581.168" stopTime="1676.090">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    He can accurately cross-examine his accusers if his accusers come in to open court and give their accusations in open court, either directly at that point or by affirming the accusation and incorporating it in their testimony, pledging their credibility to witness standing behind it in the Court. 
    That is -- that is confrontation and that is cross-examination. 
    And I urge again, that this requirement of full and effective cross-examination is one that is appropriate to evidence of this kind. 
    And if I may return for just a moment to the nature of this evidence, in the recent case here of Dutton against Evans, the plurality opinion was able to identify a number of indicia of reliability which attached to the spontaneous remark that was there held to be properly admitted, despite the fact that the person who made it was not called as a witness at all. 
    In this case by contrast, one can identify numerous indicia of unreliability that attached to this statement. 
    This is accomplice testimony. 
    The accomplice was under arrest. 
    He was facing prosecution. 
    He made a self-serving. 
    He allegedly made a self-serving, plain-shifting statement. 
    He was in the coercive atmosphere of custody. 
    He -- they -- a common interrogation strategy was used against him, giving him a motive to accuse his fellow. 
    The statement was reported in the Court by an interested party, namely the investigating officer who allegedly received the statement. 
    There was no other officer present. 
    There was no other person present, and the statement, the statement is oral and unrecorded.

    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    Well, but Green was -- Green involved -- if Green would have to -- some of the discussion in Green would have to more close limited to the facts if the position that I've just urged were to be held to be still open, that's correct.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    In terms of confrontation, what real difference do you see between the case I just gave you where he admits making statement, but now denies its truth and where he denies having made the statement at all? 
    When you -- now on cross-examination you can ask him whether the facts that the officer claims he related are true or not. 
    I mean, you can not only ask him whether he made those statements, but you can say are those facts true, which is precisely what you would ask if he admitted making the proper statement?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="2013.508" stopTime="2050.751">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    This gets very precisely to the point that was urged by petitioner here that his denial is that best thing that can hoped for on cross-examination. 
    That is simply isn't true. 
    Runnels, for example in this case, Runnels self interested denial that he made the statement, whether it's true, either way, is far less persuasive to the jury than many of the results that cross-examination might have achieved. 
    For example, by showing that the statement was motivated by anger that it was full of errors and inconsistencies, Runnels denial really carries no more weight in the jury's eyes than he is not guilty plea. 
    He has to deny the statement and the denial is no substitute for cross-examination.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Rationale?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="2123.557" stopTime="2124.905">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    The holding, the holding.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2124.905" stopTime="2130.927">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I don't think you heard my question correctly that any statement if the man denies, it can't be admitted. 
    You don't want to say that?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="2130.927" stopTime="2143.017">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    No. 
    I want to bring this case back to the kind of statement and the kind of evidence we're talking about here. 
    We're talking about a classical form of unreliable, devastating accusation. 
    That's the kind of evidence --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2143.017" stopTime="2155.637">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Stage of this case, how could you get a probing, to use your word that you wanted, how under the sun?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="2155.637" stopTime="2159.478">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    You can get the probing if the witness who makes the accusation testifies --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2159.478" stopTime="2175.136">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This -- in the case this, the witness is made the accusation, the testimony is in. 
    Now once that's there, how could O'Neil probe?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="2175.136" stopTime="2176.753">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    He can't.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2176.753" stopTime="2179.676">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So, you really saying the statement should not have been admitted.
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="2179.676" stopTime="2180.847">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    That's right.
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="2180.847" stopTime="2198.131">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    That's right.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2198.131" stopTime="2210.361">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Here's the truth in the case, once he has said that, I didn't make that statement, the State had nothing that it could do about that.
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="2210.361" stopTime="2220.390">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    They should -- that's right.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2220.390" stopTime="2226.400">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    There's something with his right up, cross-examination and confrontation.
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="2226.400" stopTime="2290.387">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    Well, if I may, the procedure that should be followed in cases like this is the procedure that Mr. Justice White outlined in his dissent in Bruton and the one that the American Bar Association project and (Inaudible) the standards for criminal justice has recommended.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2290.387" stopTime="2296.943">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Did the American Bar report say that was a constitutional requirement or merely a good idea to how to handle the problem?
speaker="james_s_campbell" startTime="2296.943" stopTime="2386.769">
    Mr. James S. Campbell 
    I think that the discussion indicates there's a -- is a constitutional problem.

    Just a very few brief comment if I may Mr. Chief Justice.

    I would like to bring out something I believe is a misunderstanding of the record on the part of Mr. Campbell.

    Thank you, Mr. Kirk.
