    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case here on the writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit presents an important question as to the evidence that maybe utilized by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare in disability proceedings under the Social Security Act. 
    Specifically, the question is the correctness of a ruling by the Court of Appeals that written reports made by doctors found the examination of the patient which reflect the results of the examination and the doctor’s analysis and conclusions based upon that examination cannot constitute substantial evidence to support a determination of disability if, one, at the hearing before the social security authorities, the claimant objects to the introduction of this evidence. 
    And two, if these written doctor’s reports are contradicted by oral testimony given at the hearing by the claimant and the claimant’s doctor. 
    The Government has brought this case to this Court because of the serious adverse impact, it believes this rule announced by the Court of Appeals will have upon the operation of the entire social security disability program. 
    There's a tremendous number of these administrative hearings conducted each year in disability cases. 
    Last year, our figure showed that 27,000 of these hearings were held. 
    The hearings are conducted quite informally, they are not adversary in characters, we know the term and the examiner who presides is not an advocate of one position or the other. 
    He attempts to develop all the facts, both those indicating disability and both -- and those questioning disability. 
    Now, for as long as this program has been in effect for at least 15-years, traditionally these cases have been determined on the basis of medical reports, written reports --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="172.516" stopTime="176.167">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Friedman, how does it all start? 
    Someone has claimed disability?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="176.167" stopTime="177.057">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes, let me just --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="177.057" stopTime="177.846">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What's the disability?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="177.846" stopTime="231.599">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well let me start by explaining what happened perhaps in this case. 
    This man filed a claim for disability in April 1966, in which he claimed that he had become disabled in September of 1965 as a result of a back injury. 
    Before he had actually filed his claim, he had undergone some treatment which had been unsuccessful. 
    And when he flied his claim, under the procedures of statutory procedures, the claim was referred by the social security agency to the state agency that handles disability problems. 
    In this case the Texas Agency and under the statute, the statute authorizes the secretary to enter into agreements with state agencies to handle, to process these claims originally. 
    The state agency then --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="231.599" stopTime="237.348">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And in the procedures by which they’re handled differed depending upon the state?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="237.348" stopTime="289.040">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well, they may vary some but the basic procedure I think is the same which is the state agency makes whatever examinations are necessary at -- the Federal Government pays for these but it sends the man out for medical examinations. 
    In this case, there were a series of examinations by four different doctors. 
    First, they sent the man to an orthopedic surgeon who conducted various tests. 
    Then they sent him to a neurologist, following that they also had -- I might mention before this. 
    They also attached to his applications were various reports from his doctors who had indicated the problems they saw. 
    And at an early stage -- at an earlier stage before he filed his claim, he had undergone surgery, something called a laminectomy for this pain he had at his lower back.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="289.040" stopTime="292.807">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Would you explain there a little bit, he did have surgery?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="292.807" stopTime="296.463">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes, may I give the chronology of what happened to him?
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="296.463" stopTime="301.454">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And was he -- was there any curative effect as a result of the laminectomy?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="301.454" stopTime="319.662">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Apparently not, apparently not. 
    He was twice hospitalized by the orthopedic surgeon then the laminectomy was performed and following this, he went from seeing the orthopedic surgeon he consulted. 
    His family -- a family doctor, Dr. Morales who undertook the treatment.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="319.662" stopTime="329.400">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Do you know whether the surgery was performed by an orthopedist or a neurosurgeon or by both? 
    Does the record show this, I --
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="329.400" stopTime="336.321">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    I believe he was a neurosurgeon. 
    It's a doctor --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="336.321" stopTime="340.010">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And I take if they found pathology but no -- no relief?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="340.010" stopTime="369.253">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well they didn’t find much they thought, and this is one of the points. 
    They found some pressure and they did prescribed certain procedures but they did not find any specific neurological involvement of the kind that they believe would cause this pain. 
    Before the operation, before the operation the neurologist Dr. Munslow believed there was some problem with the disc but apparently the laminectomy did not disclose that fact.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="369.253" stopTime="381.462">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well did the preoperative diagnosis (Inaudible)?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="381.462" stopTime="467.994">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well there was enough there apparently to suggest that they performed two myelograms before the surgery and the first one is not on the record. 
    The second one suggested some disc involvement but apparently after the surgery was performed, they did not find anything which indicated the disc involvement. 
    And after that, the man put himself under the care of Dr. Morales. 
    A family doctor who treated him more conservatively with such things as he gave him some x-ray, not x-ray DP therapy. 
    He gave him drugs, he gave him pain killers, some minor, slight exercise and so but none of these conditions. 
    These treatment apparently alleviated his pain. 
    So, if I may just go back a minute to what happened in the case after the state agency has examined the man. 
    The state agency then initially at least decided that he was not disabled. 
    And subsequent to that, he then said he wished to appeal this to the social security administration after the state agency makes the initial determination which they’re permitted to do under the stature of the cases. 
    Then goes back to the bureau of old age and disability insurance of the social security administration which makes this --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="467.994" stopTime="474.985">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    What would’ve stopped him if the state agency found that indeed he was disabled, would that be the end of the case so far as so is this?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="474.985" stopTime="483.513">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Probably, probably and mostly I think in almost every instance where the state agency finds the man is disabled social security administration --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="483.513" stopTime="485.079">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I view, they found he was not.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="485.079" stopTime="485.673">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    He was not.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="485.673" stopTime="487.551">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Then what's the procedure after that?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="487.551" stopTime="509.929">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well then at this point he then goes to the social security administration and they wrote him a letter which is pretty much a form letter saying that the examination has been conducted and you’re found not disabled. 
    And then I said you have certain period within which to apply for reconsideration and he applied for reconsideration. 
    And after he’d applied for reconsideration --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="509.929" stopTime="511.091">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Reconsideration by whom?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="511.091" stopTime="515.501">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    By the social security administration by the Bureau of Disability and --

speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="516.899" stopTime="542.770">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    The state agency is out. 
    But following that, following that and before --well and then what happened is reconsideration was denied and then he was totally had the right to request a hearing and he requested a hearing. 
    Now between that period and before the hearing, he underwent a further examination. 
    This was something called an electromyographic study which is the counterpart of the electrocardiogram.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="542.770" stopTime="544.004">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Done at whose instance?

    Done at whose instance?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="545.864" stopTime="576.909">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    This was done at the instance of the social security people and probably, this examination was conduced and then he had a hearing as he had requested. 
    Now at the hearing he was represented by counsel and over his objection there were admitted the six doctors reports which reflected the tests that had been made by these doctors during the series of examination.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="576.909" stopTime="581.433">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Both the state agency and whoever it was that made this last --
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="581.433" stopTime="590.823">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well the examinations were made not by -- let me make this clear. 
    They were not made by the state agency; they were all made by independent consultants and specialists --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="590.823" stopTime="592.745">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Retained by whom, that’s what I'm asking.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="592.745" stopTime="711.564">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well they were referred by the state agency. 
    They were referred by the state agency except I believe for the electromyographic study but paid for by the Federal Government. 
    Now at the hearing, testimony was presented by the respondent Mr. Perales by Mr. Perales’s family doctor, Dr. Morales who had conducted this conservative treatment over a period of seven months by a fellow employee of his, by a vocational advisor who testified as to what jobs he could perform and by a man that the examiner had called who was known as the medical adviser. 
    Now, the practice in these cases is that where you get a difficult case, where the examiner feels that the case presents medical problems that are somewhat beyond his comprehension, he has the discretion to call a medical adviser to advise him. 
    It's up to the examiner to decide whether or not to call the medical adviser and medical advisers are called in roughly one out of seven cases. 
    The medical adviser in this case was called by the examiner at the second session of the hearing. 
    First session was held, he had the reports, heard the testimony and decided he needed some assistance. 
    The medical adviser was a Dr. Leavitt who was the chairman of the Department of Physical Medicine at Baylor University Medical School who was also the chief of staff at several hospitals and a consultant to the VA. 
    And Dr. Leavitt was sworn as a witness, Dr. Leavitt was cross examined by respondent’s counsel and Dr. Leavitt explained to the examiner what these various reports were, what the tests were in one case and explaining the consequences of the electromyographic study. 
    He used the blackboard and drew the different lines and graphs to show precisely what the effect is.

    No he is not the proponent of anyone, he is an object -- he tries to give objective.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That is correct, they have in each city, panels of different experts and in this case the record shows that the examiner did not select the particular expert. 
    The examiner asked his assistance, someone called a hearing assistant to select a doctor from a doctor from a panel in this area to appear some medical advice. 
    They obviously got some in familiar with physical problems in orthopedic.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    It varies, again it depends on -- might several times a year, it might be just once or twice.

    In which she is a specialist arose in the particular locality and also depending on the examiner.

speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="846.186" stopTime="929.403">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Oh yes, yes, yes it does and he just advised basically advised the examiner as to what the report showed and what the significance was. 
    Now, he concluded what he told -- the examiner’s conclusion was that these reports that had been presented and the evidence adduced at the hearing indicated that Mr. Perales had a low back syndrome of mild significance -- mild severance, excuse me, that’s what he said. 
    The examiner denied the claim, he said that on all the evidence, he concluded that that was basically what the man had was this low back syndrome of mild significance and also relying on certain statements made by the psychiatrist and neurologist that there was an emotional overlay to this illness and that neither of these factors individually are in combination constituted disability. 
    Then under the practice, Perales brought a suit in the District Court to set aside the determination. 
    I might say that those are further steps in the interim proceedings. 
    He sought review of the examiner’s decision by something called the appeals counsel and the appeals counsel upheld the examiner’s decision and under the statute, that then became the final decision of the statute.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="929.403" stopTime="933.252">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It appears counsel hear argument or it they hear the appeal on the record?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="933.252" stopTime="1036.660">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    In this case, they didn’t hear argument, there on occasions, they do hear argument but in most instances that it’s done on the record however briefs are sometimes filed. 
    I don’t believe that briefs were filed in this case. 
    The District Court said that the statements and the written reports of the medical advisers were not substantial evidence and that the testimony of the medical adviser was of little or no probative value. 
    And therefore the District Court remanded the case to the secretary to hold a new hearing before a different examiner. 
    He said that this examiner was out because -- the District Judge a month before this hearing had condemned the use of these medical reports and despite that this examiner had admitted them. 
    And so he said there had to be before a new hearing and the indication clearly was at the new hearing, only the doctor's testimony would be permitted, not the reports unless the parties agreed to it. 
    Now, the Fifth Circuit affirmed and what the Fifth Circuit said basically, I think four things. 
    First, the Fifth Circuit said that in view of a provision in the statute that the rules of evidence shall not be binding upon the secretary in these proceedings. 
    That the medical reports although hearsay were admissible. 
    That was the first thing the Court of Appeals said. 
    Secondly the Court of Appeals said that since under the regulations, a claimant has the right to request to subpoena witnesses and since Perales had never sought to subpoena the doctors, he could not complain that he was denied the right to cross examine the doctors because he hadn’t sought to attempt to do so.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1036.660" stopTime="1039.103">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is there an absolute right to subpoena Mr. Friedman?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1039.103" stopTime="1074.905">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No it’s not an absolute right, the -- in effect you had to show good cause and the practice is that if a man can show some reason why it is necessary to call the doctor to the stand. 
    For example, he would say that you just can't tell on the basis of these tests alone what his condition is. 
    That the significance of the test depends upon the circumstances under which they were done, how long you lapsed etcetera. 
    But they will not permit, they will not permit into subpoena a doctor merely because he says he wants to cross examine them.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1074.905" stopTime="1077.796">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But certainly, it's point was that he hadn't even tried.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1077.796" stopTime="1552.345">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    He hadn’t even tried and then they went on however and said that despite that, nevertheless because the doctor’s statements were uncorroborated hearsay, that could not constitute substantial evidence, where the claimant objected to the introduction of the reports and the reports were contradicted by the claimant’s testimony and by the doctor’s testimony. 
    The Court also said that it agreed that the medical adviser had properly been permitted to testify that once again, his testimony was properly admitted even though he said it was hearsay because it was built and turned on the reports. 
    But the Court then went on and criticized what it said was in view as the widespread practice of these medical advisers that called writing the circuit with the examiners for the purpose of reporting on the condition on the basis of the reports and so on. 
    And what the Court said is that this procedure should be frowned upon if not eliminated entirely. 
    Now, and that therefore affirmed the Districts Court’s decision. 
    I want to stress on that before getting into the discussion of the merits of the case. 
    That neither Court in this case has yet passed upon the question whether or not the secretary correctly held that Perales was not disabled. 
    All they have said was the evidence upon which the secretary based its decision was not substantial evidence. 
    We don’t know in this case, we don’t know in this case what the ultimate outcome will be and if the Court agrees with the Government. 
    That the Court of Appeals applied the wrong stand, all that we ask is the case be sent back to the District Court for the District Court now to review the substantiality of the evidence upon which the secretary based his determination. 
    I make this point because some of the amici in their briefs are complaining that this man wasn’t disabled and that on this evidence you have to conclude that he was not disabled because this test were basically unreliable. 
    That is an issue that has not been passed upon by either of the two lower courts. 
    Now I would like if I may just briefly to indicate the importance of the issue before coming to the discussion as to the question on the substantial evidence. 
    As I'd indicated earlier in my argument there are about 20,000 -- 27,000 last year of these hearings held annually and since the program has been in effect, they have always relied on these reports. 
    Now, the doctors have been very cooperative in these cases, they have been quite willing to examine the people. 
    Presumably knowing that it's only going to be in the unusual case when they will be asked to testify and the secretary has some information which we have set forth in our brief that if this rule obtains and if as the necessary result, there going to be have to be a great deal more testifying by the doctors and that a lot of doctors who have headed to, been willing to conduct these examinations are going to be very, very reluctant to do so because they know they examine a man and spend an hour or two making tests on him. 
    And so the end result of this maybe that several months later they will find themselves forced to attend a hearing at some distant place. 
    Perhaps have to sit for a whole day giving -- listening to the testimony, then giving their testimony. 
    Now not only will this make and this reluctance on the part of doctors to conduct these examinations would have two unfortunate consequences. 
    First, you make it more difficult for the secretary to determine this vast number of claims and secondly in the long run we think it would re-down to the detriment of the claimants themselves because the majority of these cases in which claims are made following these examinations, the claim is allowed and figures out roughly two thirds of all claims are allowed without ever going to hearing. 
    So that the claimants themselves might be handicapped if the doctors would generally unwilling and reluctant to conduct these examinations and finally we read in the papers all the time about the critical shortage of physicians in this country today. 
    I think 50,000 more are needed. 
    We have doctors working 50 and 60 hours a week. 
    They don’t have enough time to see patients and as I will now develop, I think -- we think these reports are thoroughly reliable and that really it would not be in the public interest that the doctors should spend a substantial portion of their time particularly, the specialist who are I presume, even in more critical short supply testifying at these hearings. 
    Now in the Social Security Act, Congress has provided a very flexible procedure for for the conduct of these things. 
    I might just mention one further point in passing, now that flexibility which has characterized these proceedings for many years would be substantially weakened we think, if everything had to be this formal. 
    If you had to have every time a doctor’s report was to be offered in evidence. 
    If he had to be called as a witness, whenever the claimant and the claimant’s doctor appeared and then normally of course, in every case, the claimant appears and I would assume this got to be the rule. 
    The normal practice would be that the claimant would always have his physician who would testify and then it would be necessary to call all of these doctors. 
    The statute gives the secretary authority to provide for the nature in extent of the proofs and evidence and the method for taking and furnishing such proof and evidence in disability cases. 
    And the secretary in turn of his regulations leave it to the examiner generally to determine the procedure at the hearings provided that the procedure will afford the parties a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing. 
    And as I've indicated, the statute expressly says evidence maybe received even though inadmissible in the Court of law under traditional rules of evidence. 
    And of course finally, the secretary’s findings if they are supported by substantial evidence are stated by the statute to be conclusive. 
    Now, substantial evidence as this Court has said on many occasions that it's sufficient to support an administrative determination is evidence from which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. 
    Evidence as it stated otherwise, it has rational probative force. 
    And we think under this standard, these reports are sufficient to constitute substantial evidence and of course I won’t debate at the point but the nature of this statute, the kind of determination that the secretary makes means that it's to the secretary to decide these questions to evaluate the evidence to draw inferences. 
    These reports, it seems to us are the kind of thing that whether you characterize in this hearsay or non hearsay are of the highest probative value. 
    Let for a moment, let’s just look and see what these reports are. 
    The reports are made by highly skilled professionals in the performance of their usual duties. 
    This is what a doctor usually does, he examines patients. 
    This is the form in which normally a doctor reports the results of his examination and the results of his diagnosis. 
    He files a written report. 
    The reports reflect the standardized type of examination and medical tests that doctors traditionally employ in dealing with this kind of a problem.

    Would you say Mr. Friedman that they have the same hallmarks of reliability that the day-to-day recording and recordings by doctors and medical records have in hospital procedure which are admissible under the conventional rules?

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    I would think so Mr. Chief Justice, I think, what I would say is that these technically, probably do not come within the business records exception because they are made in response to an individual request for consultation but they do have it seems to me, that’s the basic thing. 
    It's that kind of reliability and we've quoted in our brief a fine opinion by Judge Parker written almost 40 years ago in which he develops in considerable detail why report of this type is thoroughly reliable.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    May I ask Mr. Friedman, this number a year I suppose it's hard to answer this but do not those reports then really determine the basic issue of disability. 
    What purpose does the hearing serve?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1621.179" stopTime="1625.877">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well the hearings -- the hearing serve a number of purposes --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1625.877" stopTime="1641.555">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well let me put it this way, are there instances in which notwithstanding reports is unfavorable to the disability claim as these were as interpreted by the medical adviser? 
    How many cases nevertheless result the findings of disability?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1641.555" stopTime="1663.484">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Oh we do find, we do have -- the statistic shows that roughly one third of all the cases that go to hearing result in findings of non disability. 
    We have a statistic in our brief for about two years ago there are roughly 20,000 hearings in that year and I think 6,900 of the cases resulted in awards to the claimant so that in one thirds of the cases --

    Like this. --

    Not unfavorable to the claim as he is apparently were?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1670.651" stopTime="1695.214">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well I don’t -- I can't say that there will be unfavorable reports because if on the basis of the reports, it was decided that the man was disabled that wouldn’t be a hearing. 
    The hearing is only held where there’s been an initial rejection, so in one third of the cases -- and the evidence for example, you may have situations in which the man brings in his own experts who explain and throw some doubt about these things.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1695.214" stopTime="1697.374">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Like in this case?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1697.374" stopTime="1717.712">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    In this case the man, Mr. Justice was his family doctor and all that the family doctor said was that while he couldn’t disagree with basically with the reports that there seemed to be the something to matter with this man which in his view indicated he couldn’t work. 
    Now the examiner rejected that contention.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1717.712" stopTime="1733.982">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well I gather no matter how many experts he may bring in, who would testify that indeed there is disability. 
    Nevertheless, the Government’s position would be if the examiner finds there's not, these reports constitute substantial evidence.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1733.982" stopTime="1747.133">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That is correct because we think under the statute, Congress is basically committed to the discretion of the secretary and to the examiner and the appeals counsel to evaluate the evidence to weigh it and to compare it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1747.133" stopTime="1752.319">

    Just as though those doctors who wrote the report had come to testify it personally.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1752.319" stopTime="1768.962">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well, that’s right, that is correct Mr. Justice because we think that in the majority of cases. 
    The doctors if they had appeared would nearly in effect repeat what they had stated in their records. 
    And I think that is the point that Judge Parker made so effectively in his opinion.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1768.962" stopTime="1786.039">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well it’s a physical case where it goes to hearing where there’s been medical reports adverse to the claimant and yet an award of disability has been made, it must because the evidence that the plaintiff presents at the hearing.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1786.039" stopTime="1789.970">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That is correct. 
    The claimant may -- if I'm --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1789.970" stopTime="1791.625">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Which serves to override his reports.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1791.625" stopTime="1891.447">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes. 
    If I may with the Court's permission, I just -- in preparation for this case attended the disability hearing last week and I just like to explain what happened at this hearing because I think this will illustrate it. 
    This was a man who had some pulmonary difficulties and the question was whether he in fact had tuberculosis and when he came to the hearing, he was very short of breath. 
    And this was noticed by the medical examiner and by the hearing examiner and they asked them about this and they asked him whether he walked up to the second floor or taken the elevator and how he had gotten there. 
    And during the medical adviser’s testimony, the medical adviser suggested to the examiner that in view of this shortness of breathe which apparently had not been reflected in the previous reports. 
    That he suggested appropriateness of performing some additional tests which the examiner indicated he would have the man undergo. 
    Now this it seems to me is the kind of thing that can be brought out at the hearing which may serve to overcome the doctor’s reports. 
    But as I -- and I say in roughly 1/3 of the cases this happens. 
    But our basic position is that if the triar of the fact is not convinced by this evidence. 
    If the triar of the fact just concludes on balance, the record is enough to warn a conclusion of non-disability. 
    He can make that determination even though the basis upon which he makes that determination, are these reports made by the doctors. 
    That’s our basic submission.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1891.447" stopTime="1904.250">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And I suppose arguably that if the Government called doctors, their own doctors who would make these reports on every hearing it might be pure award of disability.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1904.250" stopTime="1908.447">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    There might -- there might be, well it's hard to say.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1908.447" stopTime="1913.393">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or there would be then personal confrontation between doctors I suppose?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1913.393" stopTime="1928.730">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Which I think would be unfortunate certainly and -- but I also suggest that there might be fewer awards of disability for another reason Mr. Justice is the difficulty of getting the doctors to make the examinations.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now Mr. Friedman, you mentioned that there were 20,000 hearings last year and 6,900 favorable to the claimant after hearing. 
    Do you have any figure in this record as to how many grants in favor of the claimant were made without going to hearing?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="1946.385" stopTime="2001.273">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes, we have a figure on that. 
    It's rather rough, it's about 540 or 560,000, it's roughly two-thirds of all applications. 
    I can give you the figure in a moment, yes it's at note seven pages 18 of our brief and there were in the fiscal year 1968 515,000 disability cases were processed and of the 515,000 343,000 were allowed prior to hearings. 
    Then, out of the remaining 160,000 that were initially disallowed only 20,000 went to hearing. 
    The remaining 140,000 apparently the claimant didn’t wish to pursue it further then out of the 20,000 roughly one-third of those, that went to hearing resulted in awards to the claimants.

   Argument of Richard Tinsman
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2222.799" stopTime="2228.281">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Friedman. 
    Mr. Tinsman.
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="2228.281" stopTime="2330.558">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The primary issue to be decided here is this limited one, where each side has directly contrary evidence on the crucial issue to be decided in this particular case. 
    Disability of the claimant and it's directly in conflict what procedure should be involved? 
    The one that the Fifth Circuit has mandated where the Government must bring in their doctors, their evidence or the one that has been followed in the past. 
    Now Mr. Justice Brennan indicated this is not an adversary procedure. 
    This is the position that has been taken by the Government but of it's very nature this is an adversary procedure because the Government on one hand has reports that say this man is not disabled. 
    The man says those reports are wrong, I am disabled and my doctor says I am disabled, so we really can't characterize this as not an adversary proceeding of its very nature. 
    It must be, because it is a disability hearing where there are two doctors, who are directly in conflict. 
    And the problem in social security hearings is there must be total and complete disability. 
    Not as in some programs as in veterans programs where there might be partial disability. 
    Now, we start out with a basic proposition that has been enunciated by this Court in numerous decisions that say they’re all cited by the Fifth Circuit. 
    One of them is Consolidated Edison versus to National Labor Relations Board that says uncorroborated hearsay does not constitute substantial evidence. 
    And then this Court has in many cases brought forward the proposition that the right of confrontation and cross examination even in administrative hearings is a basic right that a person has.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2330.558" stopTime="2334.172">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that the gist of your complaints about the hearsay?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="2334.172" stopTime="2379.815">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    We actually have three points that I’d like to bring out Mr. Justice Black. 
    First is that -- and the most primary one which as the Fifth Circuit decided on is that these hearsay reports are not substantial evidence and they should not be allowed to be so. 
    The second point that we will make in the argument is this medical adviser situation where the man has never examined the man is improper. 
    And the third point that we will make and have made in our brief is that the whole procedure that is presently followed by social security violates due process and that the hearing examiner is both the Government’s attorney and then he becomes the judge and he is not an impartial fact finder as has been required by the Court in past situations. 
    I would like to first --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2379.815" stopTime="2386.289">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Could you argue that in suits again when the Government is consented to be sued?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="2386.289" stopTime="2393.387">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    No, because, generally in the suits where the Government consented to be sued, we have an impartial fact finder and that’s the federal district judge.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2393.387" stopTime="2395.321">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2397.421" stopTime="2399.062">

    In to the suit against the Government?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="2399.062" stopTime="2428.699">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Yes sir but the hearing examiner must be the Government’s lawyer as well as the judge. 
    He first puts on the Government lawyer hat and then after he introduces the Government’s evidence, he rules on objections of the claimant’s attorney or the claimant, then he puts on his judge hat. 
    And it's difficult to determine where he stops being the Government’s lawyer who must assimilate all of this evidence and becomes the impartial fact finder. 
    In a federal tort claim case, of course, the judge does not assimilate the evidence.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2428.699" stopTime="2439.487">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Can you subject the Government to the same kind of constitution or rule where it can be consent to be a sued or not as it seems here, as you are a private company?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="2439.487" stopTime="2470.945">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well Your Honor, all we are saying here is that we are entitled. 
    If we are entitled to make a claim as the Congress has held we are. 
    That we are entitled to have this before an impartial decision maker and this Court has previously held in immigration cases that we cite in our brief, that a man who garners all of the evidence for the Government and then comes in and says now that I've gathered the evidence, I'm now going to hear the evidence that I've gathered and decide whether you should be deported that this man is not an impartial fact finder.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2470.945" stopTime="2473.202">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What kind of suit was that?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="2473.202" stopTime="2581.884">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    That suit was a deportation proceeding, this was the last point that I was going to cover in my brief but it's on 24, it's Wong Yang Sung versus McGrath and virtually the identical procedure was followed in that case, as is followed in social security hearings where the Government hearing officer gathers the evidence for the Government and then listens to the evidence he gathers and listens to the immigrant in that case and then decides whether or not he should be deported. 
    Here, the hearing examiner gathers the evidence for the Government. 
    Arranges for which witnesses he will call and then he simple decides whether or not he is going to believe the evidence that he has gathered or he is going to believe the evidence that the claimant puts on. 
    And the problem is particularly pointed in this -- like cases such as this where -- and the evidence is directly conflicting and much of the evidence relied on by the hearing examiner in this case was by evidence from insurance company doctor. 
    This man had insurance company claim and the insurance company doctor who did the initial examination. 
    Although, he said they were only state doctors. 
    Dr. Munslow as the evidence will show in the reports in the record was the insurance company doctor. 
    Dr. Munslow was the doctor he relied on as well as the hearing adviser, the medical adviser who had never examined the man. 
    What we are saying basically here is that this Court in a number of cases has said that where Government action direct or Governmental agencies adjudicate or make binding determinations which directly affect the legal rights of individuals. 
    It is imperative that those agencies use the procedures that have been traditionally associated with the judicial process, that was --

    Mr. Richard Tinsman

    Well all I'm trying to say is are you offering experts?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Yes, we offered one doctor.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well, I consider that the doctor was an expert witness by that --

    Expert in what?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    In medicine Your Honor, in other words are you saying did I offer any specialist?

    Yes.

    Were you prevented from doing it?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    No sir and it is our position in response to this.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2693.440" stopTime="2704.470">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Would it be the proper way to contradict a medical testimony by your cross examination that could be done by contrary affidavits?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Your Honor I would say this to you, it has been my experience and I am a trial lawyer who is a plaintiff’s lawyer that in many cases. 
    One is this example that when the doctors have to come testifying not only sometimes it isn’t the question of shaking their testimony but showing their bias and making their position look ridiculous. 
    For example the medical adviser in this particular case Dr. Levin testified on the record that he would consider no person in this country disabled even a quadrant amputee if they were given proper treatment.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2737.246" stopTime="2738.753">

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    If he is given proper care he says there is no person who is disabled in the country. 
    Even one with all of his arms and legs off, I don’t think this was the intent of Congress that no person could be disabled.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2765.660" stopTime="2768.149">

    It may have been the intent of the doctor to testify.

    But he was there for cross examination, was he?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="2770.432" stopTime="2795.086">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    That’s right but he had never examined the man and this is the significant thing, is he comes along and says even though, I have never examined this particular individual, I've looked at the doctor’s reports and I have looked at the transcript to Dr. Morales’s testimony and I think these doctor’s reports are wrong and this doctor is right. 
    Well, we don’t feel that that is absolutely necessary in any event.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2795.086" stopTime="2798.828">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, is the administrative determination subject to judicial review?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Yes sir, it is but only under the substantial evidence rule and I think this is another significant thing is 32% of the awards which have been appealed under the substantial evidence rule have been sent back which means that the Courts found there was no evidence.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2814.961" stopTime="2830.284">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well not necessarily, they are sent back for reevaluation many times and referred for further hearing, this doesn’t follow what you said.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    It is our opinion -- it was our judgment at least that once we make our case, it is not our burden to disprove the Government’s case in effect that’s what we are being asked to do?

    Yes sir.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    This man was picking up a bundle of shingles Your Honor and he was truck driver and unloading some shingles, he picked up a bundle and injured his back.

    And has he worked at all since then?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    No he has not and in fact it shows in the record only in his application to proceed in forma pauperis, one year after this hearing, this man had a back effusion which means all of these doctors who said there was nothing wrong with him were found to be wrong. 
    And the general practitioner who testified that he was disabled and there was something there even though he had no objective evidence was subsequently proven correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2886.195" stopTime="2892.903">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Don’t you think the -- let me track you down on that. 
    There was something wrong with him because he had efeffusion? 
    Is that what you’re saying?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="2892.903" stopTime="2900.433">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    In other word the doctor would not have done effusion unless he found that there was some problem in his back that requires this effusion.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    No it's been my experience at least in the trial practice and I've tried many back cases that effusion is only done as a last resort when you cannot eliminate the pain by any other method.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2936.032" stopTime="2938.275">

    Did it eliminate his pain?

    This man has had less pain but he is still a man with a third grade education and he is not been able to go back to work.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well, many people can, for example, a lawyer can work with pain or an accountant can, even though if he has back pain can perform labor but a laboring man whose really only asset is his back, is one who if he has a great deal of pain in his back cannot continue to earn a living.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well the doctors that we had said it were a back sprain. 
    Now I have not gone in and because actually, after the workmans compensation proceeding that was tried where he was granted total disability, I have not gone in and followed the medical records that closely because that would have to be reserved for another hearing. 
    But at the time of the hearing he was held to have a back sprain. 
    His own doctor said that the pain so severe that he could not work. 
    The insurance company doctor and as well as the doctor from the state agency said he had something wrong with his back but they felt that he could work based on this.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Yes sir.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3066.051" stopTime="3073.869">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Does this record contain any estimate as to how many hearing examiners it would take to handle the 20,000 hearings?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="3073.869" stopTime="3087.642">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    In an article cited in the amicus brief in the Mississippi law journal, it states that at in the present time, there are approximately 200 examiners in the United States, each of whom here in average of eight to ten cases per month.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3087.642" stopTime="3096.542">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So, are you suggesting that we apply to figure out how many hearing examiners we need to hear these 20,000 cases each year?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="3096.542" stopTime="3110.119">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well, those hearing examiners now hear these 20,000 cases Your Honor. 
    All we are saying is that we should make these hearing examiners independent and do just like it’s done in the Long Sherman’s case and make the Government attorney come in and present the Government evidence.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3110.119" stopTime="3122.345">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Then it doesn’t make any difference. 
    You got to get some more people to take the place of those bodies. 
    You’d have to get some lawyers to do what the hearing examiner now does for the Social Security Department, wouldn’t it.
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="3122.345" stopTime="3124.393">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Yes sir, that is correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3124.393" stopTime="3130.714">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But if they stayed on as lawyers is there any figure as to how many examiners you would need?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="3130.714" stopTime="3174.467">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    No sir but in other words, we don’t see that they would need any more examiners. 
    They would just need about -- they could use members from the U.S. attorney’s office but with only 200 examiners, this would not be an extensive available use of manpower. 
    I mean, if you say that a lawyer can be basically fair in this context, you could say well the plaintiff’s lawyer should be the hearing examiner. 
    He’s a lawyer; he’s gathered the evidence for his claimant. 
    He can listen to the Government’s evidence but that’s ridiculous. 
    And we all agree with that but it's really not anymore ridiculous than allowing the government’s lawyer who has gathered the Government’s evidence to be the hearing examiner and the independent man in --

    Mr. Richard Tinsman

    Your reference to the Goldberg case confuses me a little bit. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan’s opinion on the Goldberg case didn’t prescribe the kind of examiner you are talking about.

    Namely that the hearing officers were not totally independent. 
    It wasn’t the total adversary due process.
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="3859.097" stopTime="3935.957">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well, Your Honor what the Government is saying, when it comes to other cases where the poor people are involved really doesn’t rely on this concept of inherent rightness of the doctor’s reports. 
    In cases involving the revocation of a pilots license for example where a $40,000.00 or $50,000.00 job maybe at stake. 
    The FAA does not simply allow introduction of reports but they go ahead and allow the pilot to put on his doctor. 
    The FAA puts on their doctor and then the hearing examiner after evaluating that testimony, not the reports, goes ahead and makes a decision. 
    And so the Government is seeming to take the position when there are a lot of cases and where poor people are involved, we have one standard and where there are few cases and more affluent people involved, we have a different stand. 
    Basically, the Solicitor General took the position that it really doesn’t make any difference that the doctor is just going to get up and read his report and that’s all there is to it. 
    Well, as a member of the trial bar, who has tried a number of cases, I will say to you that in my opinion this is the real key. 
    This makes a tremendous difference as to whether you can win or lose your case as to whether you can cross examine the doctors who are relied upon by the Government. 
    Many doctors, for example, we see everyday --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3935.957" stopTime="3939.076">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well if that’s much difference why didn’t you call a doctor?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="3939.076" stopTime="3960.238">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Because it's our position, first the practical matter. 
    You recall the Government doctors get paid a $125.00, if we subpoena them they get paid the witness fee of $20.00. 
    In our area, it is unethical with agreement with the medical associations to subpoena a doctor without paying him his reasonable fee as set up between the bar.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3960.238" stopTime="3961.690">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I thought the Government would pay him?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="3961.690" stopTime="3980.942">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    They pay him the $20.00 witness fee Your Honor and nothing more. 
    Not any stipend like they pay their own doctor and so what we are faced with if we have to call their doctors, is we have to pay his fee for coming and attempting to disprove the Government’s case which is a practical matter.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3980.942" stopTime="3983.946">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Do social security taxes support disability?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman

speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4057.053" stopTime="4098.795">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Yes sir because we are found -- Mr. Justice White it's been my experience that we have found that many of these doctors in their reports will say this man has a 20% disability which means of course, he doesn’t have a total disability but this same doctor will testify when he comes to a hearing that the only way he will give a man a 100% disability, if he is paralyzed from the neck down. 
    And unless he is bedridden he gives -- it doesn’t give people a 100% disability and the further thing that is shown here in this very case where in the workmans compensation proceedings, the doctors had to be called and had to testify, that fact finder found that he was totally and permanently disabled.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Was it his own physician indicated that there was some psychosomatic involvement here?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4127.144" stopTime="4169.126">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    His own physician indicated that there was an emotional overlay and this together that these two factors that prior to the injury he was able to go out and earn a living even with the pre-existing emotional overlay. 
    But with the back condition that he had and emotional overlay that he had partly brought about on by his destitute circumstances. 
    In social security cases, you cannot even apply until you have been unemployed for six months. 
    And in this case, the hearing wasn’t held until he had been out of work for over a year-and-a-half. 
    So, generally these people are pretty destitute by the time, they get to a hearing examiner and anyone who’s been out for a year and a half is going to have some emotional overlay.

    Mr. Tinsman, what would you say if instead of calling these -- using these panels of doctors, specialists if these matters were referred to the panel of specialists to act as triers and let make them make the decision, you wouldn’t expect that you could cross examine a hearing officer would you?

    Well, I would say this Mr. Chief Justice that unless at the hearing before the hearing officer that you allowed the man to have the cross examination of the doctors who opposed the contention of his doctor that this would be a denial of due process. 
    Now, if you allowed a doctor to be a hearing examiner that would be fine.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4229.549" stopTime="4244.596">

speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4244.596" stopTime="4300.843">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well, it depends on how -- I don’t agree that just the file should be referred to them Your Honor. 
    Maybe the testimony as taken down and if you make them the final arbitrar on all medical questions. 
    This would be -- in other words you would be making them the independent fact finder and this would be constitutionally permissible. 
    But one of the problems is who do you accept as a doctor? 
    The state agencies many times select doctors who because they are attempting to hold down the cost of their own disability programs are generally very conservative and are hesitant to find disability in a man particularly where it means that money will be paid out of the public treasury. 
    And this is the type of doctor generally that is selected by the state agencies and example is Dr. Levitt here who would find no one disabled unless they were -- even if they had both arms and both legs off.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    No sir I would not.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    No sir, I would not. 
    I would insist on only one being present and if the Government had one present and he testified, then this would be for the hearing examiner to evaluate. 
    Not all five present and I would say this. 
    There was one specialist who we found out later because normally reports to the state welfare agency are not open to the claimant. 
    We found that a specialist in the same office as of Dr. Langston who was relied on by the Government who is a partner of his had found does man did have a post operative herniated disc but we couldn’t find that out until later because this report was not made available to us.

    Why isn’t that the practical situation?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    The practical situation is not there Your Honor because number one; they don’t have the subpoena that you request and secondly even if they do --

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    That’s right because we take the position that what in effect then you are requiring us to do is not only prove our case but we have to come in -- if we put the witnesses on and disprove the Government’s case and what if these witnesses testify adversely?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well, from the reports they certainly wouldn’t have helped us and so it was our position --

    Unknown Speaker 
    Exactly, and you had -- you tell me that you would always have the doctor there, if you thought that doctor is going to hurt you, you would not have him there, because he’s going to help you, you would have him there.

    If I was calling him directly.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    But if I had to have a choice between the report being relied on by the hearing examiner or the doctor’s personal testimony being relied on by the hearing examiner, even though I knew both were adverse to me, I would rather ask the doctors there.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well, it was a decision that we made that we felt that if we had asked the doctor to be there in effect number one; we would be vouching for the doctor, number two we would have had to pay for the doctor --

    Unknown Speaker 
    Well I don’t know how you stick with the Government with some agreement by your local bar association that you pay doctors. 
    And if you issue subpoena for the doctor, he’s going to show up.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Yes Sir but I have to continue to practice law in that community and if you do this as a practical matter, there are going to be some doctors that will always give your clients --

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    No, we’re not building -- in other words what we’re saying is that we just don’t have this obligation to an effect disprove the Government’s reports. 
    In effect, this would mean that in any administrative hearing if the Government put on the report of a lawyer or an engineer or anything else --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4587.561" stopTime="4597.485">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Did they tell you in advance, we are going to rely on the written reports unless you want the live testimony there. 
    Now if you want the doctors there you just tell us we’ll have him there even before the hearing even starts.
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4597.485" stopTime="4613.874">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Let me say this as a practical matter Mr. Justice White, they don’t tell you that. 
    They say the reports were going to rely on can be examined you on the morning of the hearing or in the examiners office and he is in Houston and it's not feasible to go 200 miles to look at the reports that happen to be in his office, we have written --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4613.874" stopTime="4617.072">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Are you suggesting you didn’t know you have the right to subpoena the doctor?

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Oh we knew that we had the right to subpoena the doctor.

    Unknown Speaker 
    You know choice you had?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4621.595" stopTime="4654.850">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    We did not know all of the reports that he had in his file, some of the reports Your Honor, in fact all social security reports that are made are not released to the claimant. 
    It's against social security -- we have attempted to get them in other cases in the Federal District Court and the social security administrations has come in and said this are not to be released to the claimant the man that was examined. 
    Because under the federal regulations they’re absolutely privileged so the only time you can see them is when the hearing examiner's file is open to you which means either going to Houston to look at them or on the morning of the hearing.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="4654.850" stopTime="4672.333">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mr. Tinsman, suppose the examiner says that I'm going to appoint a medical advisor and I've instructed not only to look at the reports but to personally examine the man. 
    And that doctor testified is that --
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4672.333" stopTime="4672.971">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    In other words --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="4672.971" stopTime="4674.813">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Would that satisfy you?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4674.813" stopTime="4676.268">

    Yes sir that would satisfy me.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="4676.268" stopTime="4681.876">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So the only difference is that the medical advisor didn’t personally examine the man.
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4681.876" stopTime="4684.450">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    That is correct Your Honor and it's our position that --

    That’s your only point?
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4685.550" stopTime="4695.093">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    No, no, no that’s our point on the medical advisor. 
    Our point is that the Government’s evidence as to no disability was only reports.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="4695.093" stopTime="4705.299">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Except that my report was based on the reports of the other doctors plus my personal examination of the man.
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4705.299" stopTime="4713.065">
    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    I would object to that, I would say his opinion could be only on his examination of the man. 
    In other --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="4713.065" stopTime="4714.846">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well suppose that happens to agree with the reports --
speaker="richard_tinsman" startTime="4714.846" stopTime="4716.509">

    Well that’s another matter.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    I think, he can read the reports but he must form his own independent evaluation. 
    In other words he can say, I read this reports and I disagree with them.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="4727.670" stopTime="4729.260">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That would satisfy you?

    Yes sir that would satisfy me.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    What we want is a man that’s examined him to testify in the hearing, yes sir and our position on this medical advisor thing is if they really believe in these doctors whose reports they say are inherently right, why don’t they just bring one of those doctors to be the medical advisor rather than bringing in a man who has never examined the man.

    Well, when we bring our doctor who testifies that this man is totally disabled, Your Honor we feel that we have met our burden of proof and then the burden of -- if the Government wishes to contest this, then they must come in with proof that says no, your doctor is wrong, he is not disabled.

    Mr. Richard Tinsman 
    Well, I think Your Honor that if we really feel that what Mr. Justice Brennan said in Goldberg is that in almost every setting where important decisions turn on questions of fact due process requires an opportunity to confront and cross examine adverse witnesses that this would be highly suspect as a violation of due process. 
    That Congress cannot provide this. 
    Now the Court said that almost every situation is for this Court to determine which are the exemptions. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Daniel M. Friedman

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Tinsman. 
    Mr. Friedman we've gone considerably over, if you have some more observations we’ll give you some additional time here.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="4840.232" stopTime="4840.657">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Thank you Mr.--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4840.657" stopTime="4841.989">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How much do you think would --
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="4841.989" stopTime="4925.260">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Oh I think another five minutes would certainly be plenty. 
    I would like at the outset just make three little factual points. 
    First, in the previous discussion over the role of the examiner in this case I want to make it clear these examiners are appointed under the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    They are the typical APA examiners who presided normal agency hearings. 
    They are not under the control of the sector of health, education and welfare. 
    They are independent examiners. 
    Now another point was made and I've been advised by the social security people that if a witness is subpoenaed at the request of the claimant. 
    The Government will pay with a reasonable fee for his appearance. 
    I'm also told that if a request is made to examine the file prior to the hearing and if the hearing examiner's office is 200 to 250 miles away, arrangements can be made to temporarily send a file to a local place where the man is, so that the claimant or his attorney can examine it. 
    Now finally, I think it is important and on the two aspects of the case. 
    First, on the medical examiner's testimony, it seems to me that basically what the medical examiner is doing in this case is pretty much the same thing --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4925.260" stopTime="4927.265">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Medical adviser you mean?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="4927.265" stopTime="5030.329">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    The medical adviser, I'm sorry if I misspoke myself. 
    The medical adviser is doing this case with any expert witness is doing. 
    The only difference is in the case of the traditional expert witness in Court he gives his opinion in response to a hypothetical question. 
    A whole string of hypothesis have put together and I take it if in his case the examiner had attempted to summarize the medical reports that have bee presented and then to summarize what had been testified to at the hearing, there will no objection to the adviser giving his expert judgment on that basis. 
    Now certainly, in this kind of an informal procedure that we have in these hearings, I don’t think, there's any need to resort to such formalism. 
    The examiner made it very clear in his questions put to the medical examiner that he was asking the medical examiner to give his opinion on the basis of the material included in the reports on the basis of the testimony. 
    And to whatever extent there might be any infirmities in the reports, to whatever extent there might be reasons that the report should not be accepted, that was clear on the record. 
    This is not a case of a jury having to have medical expert opinion solicited on the basis of hypothetical questions because otherwise they might assume facts that had been proven. 
    This is an informal administrative proceeding. 
    Now, the charge has been made here that the examiner is unfair, that this whole proceeding is unfair and it references to the statement of the need for cross examination and so on.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5030.329" stopTime="5032.624">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now does the statute use the word unfair?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="5032.624" stopTime="5113.715">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No, no the statute Mr. Justice says that the secretary shall -- it says the secretary shall have full power to make rules and regulations and shall adapt reasonable and proper rules and regulations to regulate and provide for the nature and extent of the proofs and the evidence and the method of taking and furnishing to say. 
    And then under that statute, the secretary has adopted regulations which give the examiner broad authority to conduct the hearings as he sees fit. 
    And he says that it's within the discretion of the examiner to determine the procedure or hearings generally provided that such nature is for the parties a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing. 
    We think that has been given and we think the fairness of this is demonstrated by the fact that in at least a third of these cases, the claimant prevails after the hearing. 
    And I suppose, in many instances it maybe that when the examiner sees the claimant before him, he gets a different view that the examiner's judgment as to what the report show and what their significance is.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Friedman is the hearing of this kind of case a full time job for this presenter?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="5118.979" stopTime="5120.058">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes. 
    This is --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5120.058" stopTime="5120.993">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That’s all they do?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="5120.993" stopTime="5165.326">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    This is all they do and I might say that these examiners prior to the time they start on the job, they get some kind of a course in which they get some basic medical information, like a six or eight week course in which they are instructed, I understand by various specialists in the field. 
    And certainly when -- as I said the proceeding is not an adversary one and the failure of the claimant in this case even to request that these witnesses be made available, he is never subpoenaed, I mean the Court of Appeals, he doesn’t (Inaudible). 
    The Court of Appeals itself in this case recognized that his failure to call the witnesses precluded him from complaining at the fact they weren’t there for cross examination.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5165.326" stopTime="5186.019">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What if the congress had passed a law providing cases against private insurance companies could be tried under the same statute and then the finding of the secretary would be final? 
    What would you say about that?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="5186.019" stopTime="5197.201">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well in effect, I would think, it would again depend on what kind of case it was. 
    There might be some problems with the Seventh Amendment on the right to a jury trial but we do have --

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes but we do have a similar kind of proceeding Mr. Justice under the Harbor Workmans Compensation statute which traditionally you have it held before a deputy commissioner and that is there are two parties -- there's usually the claimant on the one hand and the --

    That’s against the Government, that’s the difference.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That is a Government case, yes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5216.798" stopTime="5219.835">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    There's a difference in both these cases.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="5219.835" stopTime="5232.911">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That is correct, that is right this is the Government and the Government I think, can in dealing with these many problems resort to these more informal procedures that have been developed in recent years.
