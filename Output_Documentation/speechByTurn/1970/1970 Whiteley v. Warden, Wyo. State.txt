    oWhiteley against the Warden of Wyoming State Penitentiary. 
    Mr. Knudsen you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="26.893" stopTime="111.220">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Thank you sir. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This is a habeas corpus proceeding which started in the United States District Court in Wyoming in November 1967 where petitioner’s claims were rejected. 
    On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the lower court’s decision was affirmed. 
    The pertinent history of the state court proceeding begins with Whiteley’s arrest in November 1964 and is being charged in two counts, breaking and entering and being an habitual criminal. 
    The petition was tried in Carbon County, Wyoming by a jury in May 1965 and convicted on both counts. 
    He was sentenced one to 10 years on the first count and for life imprisonment on the second, both counts to run concurrently. 
    Whiteley appealed this conviction to the Supreme Court of Wyoming which affirmed the judgment below. 
    In the United States District Court below when the party stipulated to try the case on both the record in the Trial Court in these original criminal proceedings number 2885 and on the record on appeal to the Supreme Court of Wyoming. 
    The issue before this Court is whether probable cause existed for petitioner’s arrest. 
    If not, a surge incident to this arrest was illegal and invalid and the fruits thereof could not be used at his trial as they were.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    When was he tried originally?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="113.237" stopTime="155.274">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    He was tried in May 1965 Your Honor. 
    The pertinent facts are as follows: on November 23, 1964 several business establishments are broken into in a small town of Saratoga, Wyoming. 
    The next day, the sheriff of Carbon County acting on a tip from an unnamed and unidentified informant executed a complaint or affidavit on a basis of which an arrest warrant was sought and was issued. 
    With the Court’s permission, I would like to read the pertinent parts of this complaint since petitioner’s case in large part is based on a two alleged defects contained there in. 
    This complaint appears on page four of our brief.

    Mr. Knudsen you said based in large part, isn’t it based entirely --

    Well Your Honor --

    In your alleged defects of this --
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="161.232" stopTime="190.948">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Three courts below have surprised me by ruling that at the -- there was probable cause for a warrantless arrest. 
    And I would like to address that question in a moment sir. 
    I think the case rises or falls on this affidavit but the Supreme Court of Wyoming, the United States District Court for Wyoming in the Tenth Circuit have all argued that this was a warrantless arrest based on probable cause.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="190.948" stopTime="196.729">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Their position is that it doesn’t make any difference whether the affidavit is defective.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="196.729" stopTime="204.430">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    They didn’t seem to discuss it Your Honor and I take it that they felt that it was defective and there were other grounds for the warrantless arrest.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="204.430" stopTime="219.031">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I just want to be sure of your position. 
    Your position is that even if there were no affidavit which was defective, if the affidavit didn’t exist that still you would have a case here?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="219.031" stopTime="239.643">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    No, we would not. 
    You see Your Honor, first we have the affidavit which was defective and then we have the warrant of arrest which I say was defective because the affidavit was defective. 
    This warrant of arrest was put on a statewide broadcast to all law enforcement agencies requesting them to arrest Whiteley on site.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="239.643" stopTime="247.548">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I know what the facts are, right? 
    You’re setting up a string of dominoes. 
    And If -- I think your theory is that one tips, the whole group tips.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="247.548" stopTime="247.984">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes, so you might go --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="247.984" stopTime="259.369">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I’m asking supposed your case were such factually that there never was an affidavit, then would you be here?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="259.369" stopTime="264.724">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes, I probably would because I’d say the warrantless arrest like probable cause and --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="264.724" stopTime="267.349">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And I take it, you will expand on this, and this is what I meant to --
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="267.349" stopTime="299.367">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes sir, I hope so. 
    The affidavit on behalf of the arrest warrant reads as follows: I see W. Ogburn to solemnly swear that on or about the 23rd day of November 1964 in the County of Carbon in the State of Wyoming, the said Harold Whiteley and Jeff Daley, defendants, did then and there unlawfully break and entered a lock and sealed building, stars showing in matter that has been excluded as unnecessary --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="299.367" stopTime="302.001">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That is the Rustic Bar, is it not?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="302.001" stopTime="302.714">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Pardon.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="302.714" stopTime="304.395">
    Unknown Speaker 
    That is the Rustic tavern or --
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="304.395" stopTime="423.285">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes that’s right, yeah. 
    Contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided against the peace and dignity of the State of Wyoming, now that is the affidavit. 
    Now, the warrant of arrest was issued and a statewide broadcast made to all law enforcement agencies on the basis of this arrest warrant and nothing else. 
    That very night, petitioner was arrested by police officers of the City of Laramie which is the largest city in the adjoining county, Albany County and they arrested Whiteley with a Deputy Sheriff of Albany County. 
    And now we come to what I think is the crux of the case. 
    This arrest was made solely on the basis of the statewide broadcast. 
    Neither the Laramie police nor the Albany County Deputy Sheriff had any reason to arrest Whiteley other than the broadcast. 
    And the reason that this is so important is that these three courts below had previously passed on this very issue namely the Wyoming Supreme Court, the US District Court and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and each Court has made what I consider the same error that despite the fact that an arrest warrant had been used, the arrest was valid as a warrantless arrest on the ground that the arresting officers had probable cause. 
    And they find this probable cause because they were told by another law enforcement agency to arrest them. 
    Now, I think this must be emphasized. 
    The arresting officers had no independent knowledge of any facts concerning the crime. 
    Therefore, I submit that the key question before this Court is not whether an arrest based on an invalid arrest warrant may still be valid if efficient probable cause exists to support a warrantless arrest rather, the crucial issue here is whether an arrest based on an invalid arrest warrant and without any independent ground on the part of the arresting officer to support a warantless arrest is valid. 
    And I submit --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="423.285" stopTime="428.196">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would you make that argument if is Ogburn, the sheriff --
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="428.196" stopTime="429.151">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Of Carbon County.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="429.151" stopTime="457.957">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Of Carbon County, if Ogburn in fact have probable cause independent to this warrant, lay aside the warrant. 
    If Ogburn had no warrant at all but had information which would constitute probable cause for the arrest, would you say then Ogburn could arrest him, personally? 
    I suppose, the answer to that must be yes.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="457.957" stopTime="480.220">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    I guess the answer is yes, so I kind of lean Your Honor to the fact, to the rule that if you seek out an arrest warrant and you don’t do it properly, all bets are off, that’s the end of it. 
    But I know the lower courts in this country have held that if the arrest warrant is invalid but there still remains probable cause for a warrantless arrest, that is good.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="480.220" stopTime="495.814">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I’ll go back to my hypothetical, if in fact Sheriff Ogburn had probable cause to make an arrest personally, do you say he could not delegate that to someone via the state wide radio network of the police?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="495.814" stopTime="500.362">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    No, I do not. 
    If he had probable cause he certainly could delegate that.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="500.362" stopTime="513.109">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But your point is that even if he had probable cause for an arrest without a warrant, having one side of warrant then it stands or falls on the technical infirmities of that warrant.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="513.109" stopTime="517.909">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Well, I go beyond that Your Honor. 
    I say that but I also say that he did not have probable cause.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="517.909" stopTime="519.363">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well if you make both arguments.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="519.363" stopTime="525.426">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes, I say that he did not have probable cause. 
    Now, I say another way of putting this --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="525.426" stopTime="540.748">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    All the officer had you seen it at the place, at the time of the burglary or what was to be committed, have you seen him run out, arrest him and then also you had a warrant, would you say that he could arrest him on this probable cause?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="540.748" stopTime="544.091">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes, I think and under those circumstances, yes, if he had actually seen them. 
    Yes sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="544.091" stopTime="547.622">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So that is an issue in each case, I suppose.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="547.622" stopTime="616.355">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Your Honor here, there’s no information, whatsoever other than this anonymous tip. 
    We have no underlying circumstances. 
    I’m coming now to the affidavit and there are no underlying circumstances to show that Whiteley had anything to do with the crime, that’s Aguilar and Spinelli and Giordenello and secondly, there were no underlying facts set forth to show that the informant was reliable. 
    In fact, Ogburn didn’t even show that there was an informant in the affidavit. 
    It was only at the trial when defense counsel asked him how he got this information. 
    He said I got it from a tip. 
    And then the defense counsel didn’t follow it up and it remained that way. 
    So a non-identified informant gave him this information. 
    It does not appear in the affidavit that there was an informant but disappears at the trial. 
    He was unidentified. 
    There is no statement about his reliability in the affidavit or anywhere else for that matter in the record. 
    And the underlying facts with respect to the crime under Aguilar, Giordenello and Spinelli do not exist.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="616.355" stopTime="621.450">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Did the petitioner ask for the disclosure of the informant’s name?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="621.450" stopTime="631.744">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    No, he did not Your Honor. 
    I don’t’ know why. 
    This was tried several years before I came to Wyoming and I do not know.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="631.744" stopTime="643.292">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Suppose one practical reason is that the information having turned out to be correct, it did occur to that it was very useful to challenge him.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="643.292" stopTime="646.888">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    I think that might have been a tactic. 
    But or --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="646.888" stopTime="648.754">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is he represented by counsel at the trial?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="648.754" stopTime="706.699">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes sir, yes sir, assigned counsel. 
    I submit Your Honors that another way of putting this is whether an invalid arrest warrant can be validated by airing it on a broadcast to other law enforcement agencies. 
    I think the case is that simple. 
    I think that the courts below have gotten confused, starting out with the Wyoming Supreme Court which held that this was a good warrantless arrest because the police officer in Laramie had been told to arrest them by the Sheriff of Carbon County. 
    And I do not see how an arrest warrant that is bad can be validated by putting it on the air. 
    It is absolutely nothing. 
    I want to make this very clear to the Court. 
    There’s nothing in the record to show that there is any probable cause here that the sheriff had which he did not disclose to the magistrate. 
    The record is barren on that point.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="706.699" stopTime="715.527">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And it just feels that the original arresting officer would issue the broadcast could not address it.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="715.527" stopTime="728.715">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    I feel Your Honor, in fact I say that in my brief that Ogburn who was the affiant could not have arrested him on the basis of his information because it was based on a non-identified informant not proven to be reliable.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="728.715" stopTime="734.617">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And those are going to say whoever acted on that broadcast has more rights that he had.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="734.617" stopTime="756.871">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Exactly Your Honor. 
    In fact it’s kind of like Mr. Blackmun’s domino theory, I don’t want to describe that to you sir but since the affidavit was bad, the arrest warrant was bad, anything done pursuant to that arrest warrant was bad by anyone including Ogburn. 
    And I think this is the case. 
    If the Court has no more questions, I’d like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="756.871" stopTime="764.778">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, let me ask another fact question, with what was the defendant charged?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="764.778" stopTime="769.912">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    He was charged with breaking and entering and the habitual -- violation of the habitual criminal statute in Wyoming.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, let’s be a little more specific. 
    He was charged with breaking and entering what?

    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    He was charged with breaking and entering Shively’s Hardware Store.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And the original affidavit had nothing to do with Shively’s Hardware Store?

    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes, but I don’t make an issue of that Your Honor.

    Oh, I’m sorry Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="786.964" stopTime="791.975">

    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    I did not because I felt that both affidavits were equally defective. 
    The first one had to do with another man’s store across the street. 
    And then the second one which had to do with Shively’s Hardware, I think they are equally defective.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="806.683" stopTime="810.010">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, was there a second affidavit? 
    Wasn’t it the formal charge --
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="810.010" stopTime="823.276">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    No, it was an affidavit after he was arrested, at least I’m pretty sure it was an affidavit and which was made after the arrest and this was the basis for the further proceedings.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="823.276" stopTime="833.176">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Which is necessarily your possession however, that despite this difference in the accusatory affidavit originally having to do with the rustic tavern I think it was.

    But if they convicted him solely on other information or other data that they found at the scene and not on Daley’s testimony and not on anything they found on the car then I would say this whole case would not be here.

    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Your Honor, with the burglar tools, with the coins which came from Shively’s Hardware, with Daley testifying, I think this case falls in the Aguilar, Spinelli etcetera cases that there was absolutely no harmless error here. 
    When the jury were faced with these facts. 
    The coins which Shively had been saving for years and Daley said, this fellow sitting here committed the crime with me, I don’t see, I don’t think we confine that Your Honor.

   Argument of Jack Speight
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1048.896" stopTime="1052.016">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Speight.
speaker="jack_speight" startTime="1052.016" stopTime="1211.739">
    Mr. Jack Speight 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, counsel. 
    I like to direct myself to several questions that the court has raised before I go in to discussion, my aspect of the case. 
    I might add that my good friend, the counsel here and I, he at the law school and I in the Attorney General’s office have been fighting this for four years. 
    We started with it at that first Federal Court level and have taken a right through and we’ve lost issues along the way and now we’re done with the real knob. 
    And we do have a great familiar work, familiar hierarchy with this case as this Court obviously by its questions. 
    But I would like to spend a moment on Justice Blackmun’s question because I think you put your finger right on the case. 
    We have consistently argued from all levels of the Court that we could care less about that arrest warrant that is quite immaterial to our proposition. 
    That we’re talking about whether or not there was probable cause to make the arrest and or the search. 
    The Judge Kerr, the Federal District Judge, brought the argument. 
    The Tenth Circuit Judge Hecky writing the opinion about the argument and now we’re here at this Court. 
    And Justice Blackmun, this is the key question as far as the state is concerned. 
    Whether or not there was probable cause, we think it’s quite immaterial whether or not there was effective arrest warrant and we go one step further. 
    I think you again diagnosed the case right on point when you say there were two complaints and arrest warrant’s issued. 
    One for the burglary of the rustic bar and the other which she was actually tried on the arrest of the hardware store. 
    Now, in Wyoming we currently have adopted the criminal rules of procedures which are patterned after the federal rules. 
    But at this time in Wyoming we were operating under some old statutes that are not unique or different throughout the country. 
    There quite somewhere to many other states. 
    And it’s simply this that a complaint is filed usually by a law enforcement officer. 
    Based upon that complaint and arrest and or search warrant is issued. 
    The arrest is made, an information is filed which is in lieu of the grand jury hearing. 
    At a preliminary hearing probable cause is determined and the sequence is immediately whipped. 
    Whiteley was arrested on the 24th of that evening. the next morning the arrest warrant and the criminal complaint were filed against him. 
    The information was filed and a preliminary hearing held before a magistrate in Rawlins, Wyoming determined whether or not there was probable cause. 
    The probable cause being found it was set for trial and again the jury found that there was probable cause beyond the reasonable doubt that he committed the crime.

    Well, when was the search before or after?

    The search was taken on the 24th sir.

speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1223.728" stopTime="1234.414">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    One thing in the record, that the time that the search was made other than the broadcast that the arresting officer had to operate them.

    Mr. Jack Speight 
    Well simply the fact of -- the particulars detailed in the police broadcast. 
    They were looking for a man, we described the man.

    We’re looking for certain stolen --

    Mr. Jack Speight 
    Right, right.

    Let’s assume that the officer looking out to broadcast himself at no probable cause to put it out.

    Yet you would say that --

    No.

    Mr. Jack Speight 
    No, I’m saying if it please the Court and in this reflected on one of the questions that Chuck Ogburn, the sheriff had probable cause.

    Mr. Jack Speight 
    The probable cause was the information that he had, that Whiteley had committed the crime or he felt he had committed the crime.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    In response to this colloquy because I thought it matches the defined question. 
    You said the test of the validity of this arrest was the fact that the arresting authorities, what’s that county --

    Acting on this police broadcast that was the probable cause. 
    And then it didn’t make any difference, so far as the validity of that arrest is concerned. 
    What state of the affairs was the county where the crime is committed. 
    In other words, to put it -- it makes no difference on your theory where there was any probable cause and the police officer Ogburn to arrest him or not.
speaker="jack_speight" startTime="1548.853" stopTime="1563.309">
    Mr. Jack Speight 
    This was a fact determination made by the Wyoming Supreme Court and has been substantiated throughout, that the Laramie law enforcement officers had probable cause to make the arrest not only that but they had the duty to make the arrest.

    No, that doesn’t make it good. 
    That might give a law enforcement officer a defense in a civil suit on false arrest but that doesn’t necessarily make it good. 
    The reason in this case that we only -- not only did we name the defendant, we gave the description of his height, his tattoo marks, the law enforcement officer has said and it’s in the record that they knew what Whiteley looked like, one of the arresting officers, so they knew who they were looking for.

    Mr. Jack Speight

    What probable cause the officer had.
speaker="jack_speight" startTime="1888.403" stopTime="1910.497">
    Mr. Jack Speight 
    Well, Mr. Justice White analyzing this case, I’ve looked at a case of this court where there was not probable cause that was the Beck case. 
    And I feel that we have a better record than they had in Beck. 
    And based on that, I feel we have probable cause in this record and only this Court on an independent determination of the record can justify whether or not --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1910.497" stopTime="1946.252">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, what you are trying to tell us is brief, in a nutshell, how and why Sheriff Ogburn could have arrested this man, Whiteley if the Sheriff upon looking out the window of his office saw Whiteley standing on the street corner. 
    That is after Whiteley got the information that he received for the application for warrant. 
    You have to say that Ogburn could have gone out on the street corner and arrested him. 
    Now what is the basis for that?
speaker="jack_speight" startTime="1946.252" stopTime="2024.445">
    Mr. Jack Speight 
    Well, unfortunately in probable cause cases, the issue usually isn’t raised until we are somewhere down the road beyond the trial level or beyond any evidentiary hearing level. 
    Now, I know things beyond the record of which we can’t go into today that in my own mind, at least I know that was probable cause but over and above that what is in the record. 
    The record is that a person told Sheriff Ogburn that he had -- that he believed why he made the arrest or performed the burglar. 
    There was a general rash of burglaries in the area. Small counties being what they are. 
    There was not many suspects that you have to have to key in on. 
    You can usually eliminate it down to one or two. 
    In this case, they eliminated it down to one or two and of course as Justice Black said there was the counter band, there were his finger prints. 
    There were his accomplice’s words in the record. 
    All before the illegally seized evidence was introduced in the testimony. 
    And it’s a totality of the circumstances as the Draper case said probability is that there was probable cause. 
    An RPM standard could be applied to this case and a law enforcement officer could make the arrest.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2024.445" stopTime="2037.927">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So you take the position that if he wanted to challenge the informant that was the burden of Whiteley at the time of the trial to insist upon protection of that informant?
speaker="jack_speight" startTime="2037.927" stopTime="2039.480">
    Mr. Jack Speight 
    Absolutely, absolutely.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2039.480" stopTime="2042.199">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You say that he waived that right by not moving.
speaker="jack_speight" startTime="2042.199" stopTime="2043.108">
    Mr. Jack Speight 
    Yes sir.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2043.108" stopTime="2046.281">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And even though it’s a constitutional issue?
speaker="jack_speight" startTime="2046.281" stopTime="2081.261">
    Mr. Jack Speight 
    Yes sir. 
    This again goes into a whole new realm of jurisprudence of what can be waived and what cannot. 
    But at this late date, it certainly puts a handicap on law enforcement and those are on behalf of law enforcement to reconstruct something that we don’t have an opportunity to make an evidentiary record on. 
    If this Court is inclined in this area, give us one shot of an evidentiary record back in Federal Court we’ll get Chuck Ogburn understand, we’ll get Judge Castle JP understand, then we’ll develop the record as to whether or not what went through their minds.

    It was about --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    About an hour or so --
speaker="jack_speight" startTime="2101.204" stopTime="2166.722">
    Mr. Jack Speight 
    Mr. Justice White it was about a days trial, little over days trial as a matter of fact. 
    And I might add, I get very competent counsel at the trial level. 
    The facts have changed. 
    The law has changed since ‘64. 
    This is really what we’re talking about. 
    And we get in the final analysis, if we set through fascinating argument yesterday on the civil liability of a law enforcement officer and I think this is what we’re -- we’ve got to keep our eye on the rabbit. 
    If we’re going to protect the rights of the individual which is imperative that we do that we not isolate an arrest because when you look at the whole spectrum of criminal law, we are talking beyond the arrest, we’re talking of preliminary hearing, we’re talking about trial and with the (Inaudible) at this Court in the last three or four years, due process is provided to defendant and we can isolate the arrest from the trial. 
    At least I can in my rules and that if really we feel that people are being arbitrary law enforcement officer, being arbitrary in the final analysis when civil liabilities – tort liabilities are filed against false arrest, this will make the leaders out.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2166.722" stopTime="2177.716">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well I think it should be making the same argument here if Ogburn had heard about burglaries and said well there are only two people in this whole area that I suspect of this crime.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, one of Mr. Ogburn step, it is – goes to him and says there has been a robbery here to this tavern, and I think there are only two fellows in town and that really have done that and Ogburn as I agree with you, arrest them.

    Mr. Jack Speight 
    If I can address myself to this point. 
    When we were in Judge Kerr’s Court Mr. Chief Justice, we had six issues before us. 
    Of the six, I think in all fairness both counsel and I put that somewhere down the priority scale. 
    We were more concerned with being tried for double jeopardy and this several other legal issues which we spent great time in oral argument and secondly there was limitation of time and we were really acting in reliance upon lower court decision and upon this Court's decision as to probable cause. 
    And Judge Kerr bought this, he put it in a specific finding in his record which he does a nice job at on page 81, Judge Hickey picks this up of page 91 of his appellate brief. 
    And if there was error involved here, it was on the states acting in reliance upon prior Supreme Court decisions that we felt in our mind that was probable cause. 
    If this would have been the only issue before Judge Kerr and this what have sunk or floated our lawsuit. 
    I can guarantee we have to develop a record at that stage. 
    But quite frankly I didn’t feel that it was that an important of an issue of some other issues that had been on this case.

    Three.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="2621.172" stopTime="2703.182">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    He had more than three. 
    I -- may I proceed Your Honor? 
    I would like to make a couple of points here. 
    I think in the heat of the argument my good friend Jack Speight said something which is not completely accurate on the fingerprints. 
    On page 54 of the appendix Ogburn was asked if he had taken any fingerprints and he said no. 
    He couldn’t get any fingerprints of any kind and I just think that was one of the things made the heat of the battle. 
    I would like to address myself to the Draper point if I may. 
    There is absolutely nothing in the record to show that anything except that there was a tip, there’s nothing in the record to show that the tipster told Ogburn that he saw that he recognized a man with a tattoo on his arm and so on. 
    All we have is that the tipster told him, Whiteley did it, and I submit to the Court in the absence of this information. 
    The absence of this on the record, I think we must make the assumption that then Ogburn said, “well I know, I know Whiteley well, he is six feet tall, he’s 47 years old,” etcetera, etcetera, and he put this out. 
    Now I say I’m making an assumption. 
    But I think the other assumption is equally bad to say that the tipster gave them this information about Whiteley. 
    We don’t know and I say they have the burden of proof and therefore they haven’t’ proven it.

    Well, Mr. Speight argued among other things that when this issue was up, it was not challenged and that therefore you have waived the infirmities and probable cause by not pursuing – this is not mine -- I’m not advancing that, I’m asking you to respond to that argument. 
    If you have waived that --
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="2727.560" stopTime="2756.749">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    I don’t think there was a waive. 
    You mean in the original proceeding number 2885 once the -- attorney for Whiteley said, “How did you get this information?”” 
    And he said, “I got if from a tip.” 
    He should have pursued it. 
    I -- each attorney practices differently. 
    I think I would have pursued it. 
    In fact, I would have probably filed a motion to suppress in the first place. 
    But once this occurred I would have gone into it to find out where he got it, who the informant was, ask the Court to make him tell us who the informant was, was he reliable, etcetera, etcetera. 
    This did not occur.

    The absence of a motion to suppress has deprived the Trial Court right from the beginning of an opportunity to pass on this question at the time when it could have been passed on.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="2766.422" stopTime="2798.022">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes Your Honor but I think that if a lawyer does fail to move to suppress that he perhaps can raise this at the trial level with the Court’s permission. 
    I know some Courts, I was a U.S. attorney once, assistant U.S. Attorney at one time and on occasion I would have fit when the judge would permit this at the trial when the no motion to suppress had been made. 
    And I think here, it could have been raised at the trial if the Court permitted and he permitted those questions was how did you get the information? 
    I got if from a tip. 
    And then the whole thing died and they --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2798.022" stopTime="2800.589">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Was there an objection to the evidence on trial?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="2800.589" stopTime="2804.364">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Yes there was an objection to the evidence, yes. 
    On the grounds that it was an illegal search and seizure.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2804.364" stopTime="2814.527">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And I gather under Wyoming procedure, this maybe raised by objection to the evidence of the trial even though no motion to suppress is made before the trial.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="2814.527" stopTime="2826.161">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    I believe so Your Honor. 
    The rules were changed and I actually never tried any cases in Wyoming but -- nothing, there was no objection by the county attorney to the objection by the defense attorney.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2826.161" stopTime="2833.356">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In other words, opposition to the objection was not made on the ground that no motion to suppress had been made before the trial.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="2833.356" stopTime="2834.813">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Right, Your Honor. 
    Now --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2834.813" stopTime="2845.817">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And once they said -- once he got brought out that was from a tip, he had negative personal knowledge on the part of the officer.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="2845.817" stopTime="2850.037">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Once he asked him if it came out by a tip, the matter was just dropped. 
    Nothing else was asked.

    I think --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2851.841" stopTime="2853.356">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is that enough for that defense to --
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="2853.356" stopTime="2857.290">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    I think so Your Honor. 
    I think at that point the county attorney then has to say --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2857.290" stopTime="2859.572">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Would you have gone to ahead and build the state's case on?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="2859.572" stopTime="2912.376">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    If I had been the county attorney then I would have certainly proven that there was a reliable informant etcetera. 
    I would like to say just on this Draper question that I have set it forth in my reply brief but two things about Draper: One, Draper was a reliable informant. 
    We had a reliable informant there. 
    We do not have that here and I think for that reason Draper falls. 
    Secondly, in the Spinelli case, Mr. Justice Harlan says and I’m quoting from page 11 that it is especially important that the tip described the accused criminal activity insufficient detail so the magistrate may know that he is relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor circulated in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual’s general reputation. 
    I really think we have got a reputation case here because everybody in Wyoming knew that Whiteley was -- had four, five convictions. 
    And I think what’s done him in.

    Don’t you think somebody had told the sheriff something about him?

    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Oh yes, I don’t say that sheriff was perjuring himself. 
    I’m sure somebody told the sheriff, maybe Whiteley was in Saratoga. 
    I think that would be enough in Saratoga, small town of 2000 people. 
    If a burglary occurred, Whiteley was there, that might be planning. 
    In fact, I don’t know but I would assume that’s just what happened. 
    And then Ogburn went back and said let’s see, Whiteley is six feet tall, has a tattoo on his left arm, graying hair etcetera, etcetera and he put this out on the radio broadcast.

    And he might have added that you will find the stolen coins --[Laughter]
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="2951.040" stopTime="3020.980">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    I’m sure that that was added Your Honor. 
    One final point, we stipulated to the record in this case at the lower court, admittedly there were other questions. 
    This question always was in the case. 
    We had questions of exhaustion of state remedies and so on and Judge Kerr was more interested in those. 
    But this question was in the case and he adopted the Wyoming Supreme Court attitude or decision on it and so the defense circuit. 
    But if this Court should feel that a reversal is proper, I do not think it should be sent back to the District Court to have another hearing. 
    We had our opportunity to have a hearing. 
    We stipulated to the facts. 
    Whiteley has been in jail since November 24, 1964. 
    I think that he should have been dismissed. 
    And in 1965 at the trial or in a motion to dismiss -- motion to suppress and I don’t think we should send this back when a man’s liberty has been handled this way over this many years.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3020.980" stopTime="3028.413">

    Well, if you win, this case would just be reversed --
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="3028.413" stopTime="3044.612">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    In my opinion Your Honor, if this case is reversed and sent back to Rawlins, the county attorney will have to see what evidence he has. 
    As far as I know the only evidence he has is the other goods, the fruits that he found in the car and Daley’s testimony.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3044.612" stopTime="3056.941">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well I gather the form anyway if you prevail would be to send it back to District Court. 
    You give the state an opportunity to put him -- give another trial or else police them, is that it?
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="3056.941" stopTime="3065.677">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Well, I think it should be sent back to the District Court and the District Court should be ordered to send -- to order a new trial in the state court. 
    I don’t think --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3065.677" stopTime="3081.348">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Ordinarily, I think the form is it goes, this is federal habeas it goes back to the District Court with the instructions of the District Court to give the state a reasonable opportunity 30, 60 days whatever it is to bring and give him a new trial or else to release him.
speaker="william_k_knudsen_jr" startTime="3081.348" stopTime="3102.084">
    Mr. William K. Knudsen, Jr. 
    Oh to give him a new trial or release him, yes. 
    But I don’t think we should rehash all the facts in the District Court again Your Honor. 
    As far as if we go back ultimately to Rawlins, to the Carbon County Court, I think the county attorney has two things, what he found in the car and Daley. 
    I think they are both fruits of a poisonous tree and I think you have to dismiss it. 
    Thank you.
