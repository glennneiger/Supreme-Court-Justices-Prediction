    Mr. Benjamin Southwick 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    My name is Benjamin Southwick and I’m an Assistant Attorney General of the State of Wisconsin and I am here today representing the State of Wisconsin in this case which came up from a decision of a three-judge panel in the Eastern District of Wisconsin and the issue before this Court is whether a certain sections of the Wisconsin statute which I will discuss in a moment, meet the requirements of procedural due process. 
    The lower court decided this question in a two to one decision against the state, that the statutes were in fact unconstitutional with a dissent by the United States Senior Circuit Judge F. Ryan Duffy. 
    These statutes which are sections 176.26 and 176.28 sub (1) of the Wisconsin statute state which are set forth in pages 116 and 117 of the appendix, state in essence that a series of local officials including the wife of any individual and including the Chief of Police of any city that these series of local official which are set forth in the statute, when they make a finding according to certain standards which are set forth in the statutes and these standards essentially relate to the exposing of an individual to or his family to want or the town or village in which he lives to liability for a support or the injuring of the individual's health or the endangering of the personal safety and comfort of any member of his family or the endangering the security of the property of any person or becoming dangerous to the peace of a community. 
    When any of these local officials including the wife of an individual make a finding and this finding is made without notice of intention to make it and without a hearing, when these standards are met, then these empowered local officials can send a notice to the effect to any person and is normally persons within their jurisdiction that the person against whom this standard is found is forbidden to purchase alcoholic beverages or to be given alcoholic beverages for a period of one year and all the statute provides that a copy of this notice shall be sent to the person who has been what we call posted and the punitive Section 176.28 sub (1) provides that any person who knowingly serves an individual alcoholic beverages who has been self posted shall be subjected to certain criminal penalties.

    Mr. Benjamin Southwick 
    It is not at all by stated in the statute Mr. Justice Marshall what the person received and what he should do with it and of course this is the point I intend to make that the statute is a not on their face un-constitutional because they don't provide, they merely provide for this notice to go to the various bartenders and not that they set them up on the wall or that they publish them in any way.

    Mr. Benjamin Southwick 
    Well, there is a problem in the statute I think although one not raised by this case Mr. Justice Marshall that the wife is given powers which the husband is not but I don’t think along a similar vein Mr. Justice Marshall that the concept of empowering a private individual is -- is at all unique in this situation in the whole area of the state's regulation of alcoholic beverages and I cite the example of a bartender is forced to make a determination that an individual is of sufficient age to drink, that he’s 21 years old or in the case of the dram shop act mentioned by Mr. Justice Blackmun that the bartender is given, the onus of making the decisions of whether somebody is intoxicated or not, and I would suggest that this delegation to private individuals in this whole area of law regulating in the field of alcohol beverages is because these private individual are often the people who are closest to the problems and to the situations involved and this of course --

    That’s correct Mr. Justice Marshall and I think in the cases I really had to anticipated arguing this case purely from the analysis of looking at it in terms of the so called right to obtain alcoholic beverages because I think that is a very minimal right and I think the states have it to --

    Mr. Benjamin Southwick 
    That is what the court said Mr. Justice Marshall, yes. 
    Of course, what’s happened in this case is that Mrs. Constantineau has been posted by the chief of police for the state of the city of Hartford, Wisconsin. 
    Mrs. Constantineau brought an action in the federal court alleging two causes of action and the first cause of action which was against the chief of police for acting maliciously and arbitrarily. 
    This was the cause of action in which she mentioned and discussed her right of reputation and a right to be free from public defamation and the second cause of action which is the cause of action before this Court in which she sought an junction, the right of reputation was never mentioned, the right to be free from public defamation. 
    The state made motions to separate the two causes of action and to intervene as a party defendant and the motions were granted and at the hearing on the constitutionality of the statute, counsel for Mrs. Constantineau never mentioned the right of Mrs. Constantineau to be free from public defamation and to be free any reputation and the state sought to produce witnesses on this point and subpoenaed Mrs. Constantineau as the record shows but Judge Reynolds of the majority in the lower court refused the motion of the state to produce witnesses and in the questioning which appears in the appendix of page 113 of Judge Reynolds of the majority in the lower court, myself who was representing the state, Judge Reynolds said the fact and “the fact of being held up to ridicule for reasons which the party may not have any -- may not know why”. 
    I think that is the right which has not been mentioned which bothers me more than anything else in this case.

    Mr. Benjamin Southwick 
    Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, the only finding that we have in the lower court is the statement of Judge Reynolds of the majority in the lower opinion when he says the and I quote from page 119 of the appendix “it would be naïve not to recognize that such posting or characterization of an individual expose him to public embarrassment or ridicule”, so that despite the failure in this cause of action of Mrs. Constantineau to allege any damage to injury as a cause for the statutes to be unconstitutional on their face and despite the courts forbidding the states from calling any witnesses in this case, the judge made that assumption purely on his own that it would be naïve and if the submission of the state to this Court that this whole question of reputation in not present in the operation of this statute. 
    It’s not present in the record of this case and the deposition which is in the record in which I repeat, I’m embarrassed to say it was not reprinted in the appendix shows that the only point to which Mrs. Constantineau was hurt in the reputation was a statement that she made in the court in the deposition that she was embarrassed by the operation of the statute but later on she admits that she didn’t know her own reputation in this small city of Hartford for any matter except that she knew that people knew that she drink a lot, that’s only point on which she knew what her reputation was in the city and she didn’t know whether it changed or not since the posting and so I don’t think we have to --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I had understood this passage in the court’s opinion to which you referred simply to as a passing reference to some interest of Mrs. Constantineau being affected, the court currently realizing that the interest in drinking alcohol is not a very much or protected interest by virtue of the complete controls given by the States over that matter and it was necessary for the Court to identify some interest that was affected by this.
speaker="benjamin_southwick" startTime="1511.602" stopTime="1539.464">
    Mr. Benjamin Southwick 
    I think the Court had to find some interest which was affected in order to find the statutes unconstitutional because it’s clear that if we look at this solely in terms of the regulation of alcoholic beverages, the statutes are constitutional. 
    So the state of the Court had to come up with something and I came up with this point of reputation. 
    And it’s my point to this Court, the state's point, that this right to represent a reputation is not involved in this -- in the operation of these statutes and should not be accounted for in the balancing test.

    Mr. Benjamin Southwick 
    The first count is still pending in the Courts, yes so it's my point, if the Court are please before of this Court that this whole point of reputation, it should not be put on the balancing scale of due process if you please. 
    For the one reason that is not involved in the record of this case in any way that the statutes in their operation by their own terms in any way involve in the right of reputation. 
    And also as a matter of constitutional law if we look at the other cases, and I think you have Mr. Ramsey Clark the other day before this very court talking about reputation in here. 
    There he was talking about a case where the man had been severely damaged. 
    There has been no concrete showing of any sort that the economic future or economic interest of Mrs. Constantineau or have in way been affected by the operation of these statutes and that she does not have viable economic alternatives after as a result and after the posting which took place under these statutes.

    And I used the word right, the so called right. 
    It’s not in the right privilege sense that I’m using it.

    Well, I think each commodity would have to go through this balancing test itself. 
    And I couldn’t say whether it’s not up to me say whether an alcoholic beverages are more less important than shot gun shell but I think the Courts here and the law traditionally, especially since the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment has shown, that the right of the individual to obtain alcoholic beverage is very frail right and that if we look at these statutes purely in those terms then clearly even the majority in the lower court agrees it.

    All of these things, all of these interests which I submit to the Court are much more significant interest that are involved in this case have been taken away without notice in the hearing.

    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Yes, but I haven’t known of it arising in Milwaukee, it’s only used in the smaller communities where there is probably a more feasible means of controlling it. 
    Before the year ran out that this notice was posted for, the District Court stepped in and enjoined further action, we started this action in the federal court because we believe there was a substantial federal question. 
    There were rights of this lady under the Ninth Amendment or First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process clause.

    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    If it did your honor Justice Black it won’t be in favor of our case and we did not plead anything with respect to the 21st Amendment, that would be, if it was relevant which the state has brought up would certainly be a factor on their behalf. 
    I think, the counsel has been focusing no matter on procedural due process but I think we should look at the nature of the states action. 
    Here, the state is moving against the citizen who is not a public figure nor a public official. 
    And the power to do this is vested in this people with merely discretionary powers, and administrative official, a ministerial official in this case is the chief of police, and his discretion is almost unrestricted. 
    A lessening of the estate is one of the reasons or the misspending of the estate is one of the reasons that he can do this to this lady and now --

    No, the state has done that in their appendix.

    That law is set out in full.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Among your constitutional right while we have here just pausing for a moment only last 1969 term, less than a year ago, important federal constitutional claims were raised by some people in the fishing business in Alaska and this Court said that the District Court should have abstained from considering it until the state courts construed, state courts of Alaska had construed their own statute, why shouldn’t the District Court here have abstained until the state courts of Wisconsin have decided to what this statute meant?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2207.025" stopTime="2218.489">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Because your honor Mr. chief Justice, I think it’s well-established in a law when a substantial federal question is raised and a three-judge court has convened, that court can in its own discretion listen to the issues presented.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2218.489" stopTime="2224.227">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, but would you negate the abstention doctrine entirely?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2224.227" stopTime="2276.758">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Well, I would not negate it entirely but I would rather put it in a discretionary manner with the United States District Courts especially when there’s a three-judge court. 
    You know we can always run into the matters that we’re going to the state court first, exhaust their remedies there and then move to the federal courts, it’s nothing but a revolving door process and the only one that’s getting exhausted is the petitioner or the plaintiff in the court not the state remedies. 
    So, to facilitate what might ultimately be the end result, we start out in the federal court where there is discretion and where this three-judge court and Judge Reynolds particularly saw the reason to exercise that discretion. 
    And there are cases which we cited in our brief to the lower court and motions to dismiss that support our position that it is a discretionary function of the three-judge District Court to hear the matter if there is a substantial federal question.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2276.758" stopTime="2283.744">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Yes your honor, I would go up with that statement. 
    But we have to look at the nature of the state action as one of being a stigmatic identification of a citizen who is not a public figure and not a public official. 
    And the effect on that is to single out the citizen in a spotlight with unfavorable connotation.

    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    He would have — there would be a right to criticize his actions, his behavior because he is a public official under the New York Times rule.

    Could you criticize him by posting him?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2327.690" stopTime="2344.557">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    That under this law the chief of police could if he dared to do so, but the liability of the chief of police might be different because the mayor is a public official. 
    Under the New York times rule, the public official is subject to criticism in any parts of his life which is a public matter.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2344.557" stopTime="2353.278">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And that might affect his right to collect damages but I can’t see what it would have to do with the constitutional issues involved here?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2353.278" stopTime="2417.402">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Well, under the First Amendment we have to remember Mr. Chief Justice that free speech and with respect to the criticism of public officials is something that is almost — what is the last thing next to something that is absolute. 
    The only thing this Court has stated that only if the matter is done maliciously and with reckless disregard to the truth can criticism of the public officials be actionable. 
    But here we’re singling out our private citizen who has the right to live her own life in her own quite way and an assuming way. 
    And if that’s her expression of life, it’s a matter of invasion of that expression of living. 
    And that I submit is as an invasion of her privacy and her state of mind. 
    This Court recognized that in Map and it recognized in Stanley versus Georgia that the physical enclosure of a home is sacred. 
    And the state can’t go in there and here, the state is going beyond the enclosure. 
    It’s going right into the heart and soul of the citizen herself. 
    It’s imposing a stigma on her, not only when she is in her home, it’s in her heart and in her soul and attached to her when she leaves her home.

    Here is a woman that’s a divorcee, she’s got four children. 
    She’s never been convicted of a crime. 
    She has never been convicted of being drunk. 
    And here the chief of police is going out on his own and trying to limit her rates without a notice and a hearing. 
    And in a matter calculated that caused her damaged with the rest of the community with whom she lives. 
    Now, the bartender if he says so the one that’s asking for the drink is responsible for his being refused by becoming intoxicated in the first place. 
    Here, the citizen is not responsible for doing anything wrong that brought about the particular action except insofar as her displeasure existed in the eyes of the chief of police.

    Yes.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, that’s over.
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2642.495" stopTime="2651.008">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Yes, but the question of whether or not the notice was actually placed on the wall or whether it was just handed has not been decided. 
    Those are issues of facts which will be determined.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2651.008" stopTime="2678.320">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But why would you declare the statute would be unconstitutional on its face then until you find out how it’s been applied because on its face it doesn’t say anything about posting. 
    It says mailing a notice. 
    And I think it’s your intention is that you must construe that the statute was validly declared unconstitutional on its face because you must assume these notices go on the wall?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2678.320" stopTime="2689.592">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Well, it can be invalid without them actually being put on the wall because the fact that they’re disseminated throughout the community, the person has no chance to meet the inferences before they’re disseminated.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But some people --

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Schapiro, would you be content if Wisconsin statute now had incorporated in it a provision for hearing?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2702.234" stopTime="2729.919">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    No, I wouldn’t Mr Justice Blackmun for the reason that this statute is inherently aimed towards the poor in the community because they’re the ones who was -- who would be the obvious ones who would be restricted because they are the ones who be lessening their estates and leaving others to support the wealthy in the community, who could spend all they wanted more and not having their state lessened and others in the family deprived of their support would not be touched by this law. 
    And therefore, I feel it’s discriminatory against the poor of the community.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2729.919" stopTime="2737.840">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Does this suggest that you’ve never placed a wealthy person under guardianship for tendencies of this kind?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2737.840" stopTime="2756.494">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Well, a wealthy person your honor can be place on the guardianship but I think that in any such event there has to be a finding of incompetency by a tribunal with cross examination, the rights of counsel, hearing and notice.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2756.494" stopTime="2760.670">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Has there been some reason why this first account has not come to trial?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2760.670" stopTime="2779.748">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Well, the reason your honor Mr. Justice Brennan is because the state appealed this case to this Court and staying the appeal of the case and the determination of the facts by this Court as to the constitutionality of the statute, that is the reason I feel the lower court has not further proceeded in this manner.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2779.748" stopTime="2790.740">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, even if the statute were constitutional I suppose that a damage action might be possible for the way it mannered in which its been administered?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2790.740" stopTime="2911.915">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Yes Mr. Justice White. 
    It is our position that under those circumstances nevertheless, it is state action involved here and any state action would under the Civil Rights Act which this act is -- which this case is proceeding and it give rise to a cause of action. 
    There might be a difference if the law is unconstitutional and malicious or negligent posting of these notices, but the law of this case would nevertheless be allowed to proceed to trial. 
    It’s our position generally and as a closing comment that the rights of the plaintiff, the appellee here are rights of privacy and rights to her own name and reputation which couldn’t be included in the Ninth Amendment or on the 14th Amendment, due process cause alone or under the incorporation theory, under the First Amendment because her right to remain a non-public figure, to live her own life in her own quite way is generally an aspect of privacy and the state forcing her to become a public figure is a deprivation of her right of privacy. 
    And we likewise have the question of reputation involved in this matter because -- and I just want to make this as my closing comment which I wanted to go in a detail but I’ll just say that the stigma attached to this creates an outcast group in society, and that outcast group is forbidden by its own nature to have any associations with other groups in society. 
    People will tend to shy away from this people. 
    And as a result, their rights of association are limited. 
    And this is not the right of association in a political group to petition of the government for a redress, this is a socio-basic right of association, that it would inherently cause the posted person to be unaffiliatable and unassociatable with all segments of society except those in the outcast group which she has involuntarily become a member of.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is there any indication in the record or out as to how many people in the town were posted?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2918.119" stopTime="2926.965">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    It’s not in the record but all of the record, this is a common practice by the chief of the police in this community. 
    There maybe seven or eight a year like this.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2926.965" stopTime="2929.176">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose he could post everybody in town?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2929.176" stopTime="2951.418">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Certainly, the discretion is almost limited. 
    The only criteria is as applied to this case because this woman is not dangerous to the community which is one ground is the lessening of the state, the misspending of money. 
    Ansd I think that in the hands of a ministerial official without notice and hearing is one such instance of violation of not only procedural but substantive due process.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2951.418" stopTime="2955.271">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Why didn’t you go under state court to get some relief?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2955.271" stopTime="2966.424">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Well, we saw that there was no remedy by certiorari in the state courts. 
    I looked into that matter and certiorari would only be permitted to review the actions of an administrative tribunal.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2966.424" stopTime="2969.443">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You got a declaratory judgment procedure?

    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    Yes your honor Mr. Justice Harlan. 
    There is a declaratory judgment procedure but that would not cause the chief of police to take the notices down.

    What about injunction?

    Injunction would --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2982.231" stopTime="2983.651">

    And damage action?
speaker="s_a_schapiro" startTime="2983.651" stopTime="3015.151">
    Mr. S. A. Schapiro 
    An injunction and damage action would cause the notice to be taken down but the likelihood of success in the damage action Mr. Justice White in the state courts would be much more difficult than it would under the Civil Rights Act where there is definite state action. 
    Under the state law that would probably be the requirements of probing matters beyond state action. 
    And as a result it was our position that it would be an easier damage action to prove in a federal action under the Civil Rights Act.

    He did in this case when the lower court ordered him to but whether or not he could, the statute doesn’t provide any mechanism for him to do so. 
    If it was it would be in his own discretion.
