    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Iowa. 
    The petitioner operates a unitary business throughout the United States and in several foreign countries. 
    Because part of that business is conducted in Iowa, Kraft is subject to the Iowa business tax on corporations. 
    At issue in this case is Iowa's inclusion in the tax base of the dividends that Kraft received from six subsidiaries, each of which was incorporated and conducted its business in a foreign country. 
    While Iowa taxes the dividends that a corporation receives from its foreign subsidiaries, Iowa does not tax dividends received from domestic subsidiaries. 
    The question presented is whether this disparate treatment of dividends from foreign and domestic subsidiaries violates the Foreign Commerce Clause of the Constitution. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we conclude that the Iowa statute facially discriminates against foreign commerce and therefore, is unconstitutional. 
    Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Blackmun has joined.
