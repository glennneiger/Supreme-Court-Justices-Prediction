    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The second case I have to announce is No. 90-6113, White against Illinois and here, petitioner Randall White was convicted in an Illinois State Court of sexually assaulting S.G., the initials given to a four-year-old girl to protect her anonymity. 
    In the minutes immediately following the assault, S. G. told her babysitter, her mother, and a police officer that petitioner had assaulted her. 
    Several hours later, while at the hospital, she repeated her account to a nurse and to a doctor. 
    S.G. never testified at the trial. 
    However, over petitioner's objection, the prosecutor called to testify each of the five people who had heard S.G.'s story and that each repeat the statements that S.G. made about the assault. 
    These statements were admitted by the trial judge under two state law exceptions to the general rule excluding hearsay evidence. 
    One that permits witnesses to repeat statements made by another person while that person was excited and another, permitting witnesses to testify about statements by another while that person was in the course of securing medical treatment. 
    Petitioner appealed his conviction claiming that the Trial Court violated his right to confront the witnesses against him as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution by allowing this testimony. 
    The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed and we granted certiorari to resolve this question. 
    We hold that petitioner's confrontation right was not violated and affirm the decision of the Illinois Court. 
    We reject the argument advanced by the United States as amicus curiae that no violation occurred here because the Confrontation Clause is generally not intended to apply to hearsay testimony. 
    We think such an argument comes too late in the day given the court's long history of recognizing that hearsay testimony may often implicate Confrontation Clause concerns. 
    Nonetheless, while hearsay statements do raise these concerns, we conclude they are admissible based on a firmly ridded exception to the prohibition against receipt of hearsay testimony. 
    Such exceptions like the two involved here provide alternate guarantees of trustworthiness such that the requirement for in-court testimony of the decelerant may be dispensed with even if she is available. 
    Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justice Scalia joins.
