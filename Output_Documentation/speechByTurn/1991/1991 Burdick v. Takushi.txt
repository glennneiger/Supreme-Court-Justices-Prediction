    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 91-535 Burdick against Takushi. 
    This case involves Hawaii's prohibition against Write-in voting and its primaries. 
    In an opinion authored by Justice White, we hold that this provision does not infringe on petitioner's rights to vote under the First or Fourteenth Amendments. 
    Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens concur.
