    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion for the Court to announce in No. 90-1124, Jacobson against the United States. 
    For the reason stated in an opinion filed with the Clerk today, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed. 
    Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which I, Justice Kennedy joined, and in which Justice Scalia joined except as to part two.
