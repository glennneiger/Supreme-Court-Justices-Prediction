    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    The second case is No. 90-1912, Nordlinger against Hahn. 
    This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals of California. 
    It concerns Proposition 13 approved by California voters in a statewide ballot initiative. 
    This added an article to the California Constitution which embodies an acquisition value system of taxation. 
    Under that system, property is reassessed at current appraised value only upon new construction or a change in ownership. 
    There are exemptions for exchanges for principle residences by persons over 55 and transfers between parents and children. 
    Longer term owners paid lower taxes reflecting historic property values and this system over time has created dramatic disparities and taxes paid by persons owning similar pieces of property. 
    Petitioner who was a recent purchaser of a home filed suit against the County and its tax assessor claiming that the scheme violated the Equal Protection Clause. 
    The Trial Court dismissed the complaint and the Court of Appeal affirmed. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm that judgment. 
    We hold that the acquisition value assessment scheme does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. 
    The clause requires only that the classification rationally furthers a legitimate state interest. 
    The right to travel is not involved in this case. 
    We detect at least two legitimate state interests: One is in preserving continuity and stability in neighborhood preservation: the other is that a new owner does not have the same reliance interest warranting protection against higher taxes as does an existing owner. 
    The provision, thus, is not palpably arbitrary, even though it provokes some distaste on one's part and may appear to be unwise and unlikely ever to be reconsidered repealed by ordinary democratic processes. 
    We cannot conclude that it is prohibited by the Federal Constitution. 
    Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; he joins part 2a of the opinion, and Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
