    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    Petitioners managed certain federally owned forests known to contain the northern spotted owl. 
    Respondents filed two separate lawsuits against petitioners alleging that the proposed harvesting sale of timber from these forests would kill the owls in violation of five different federal statutes. 
    The courts below preliminary enjoined some of the challenge of harvesting. 
    In response to the ongoing litigation, Congress enacted the Northwest Timber Compromise Subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) of which prohibited harvesting all together from various designated areas within the affected forests. 
    Subsection (b)(6)(A) stated that management of the forest according to these two provisions was adequate consideration to meet the statutory requirements underlying the two pending cases. 
    The two District Courts considering these cases held that Subsection (b)(6)(A) had effectively modified the original statutory provisions, and that the Subsections so construed was constitutional. 
    In a consolidated appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed. 
    The court held that Subsection (b)(6)(A) did not amend any law but directed the courts to reach a particular result in pending cases under previously existing law. 
    Under that interpretation, the court held that Subsection (b)(6)(A) was unconstitutional under our decision in United States versus Klein. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    We conclude that Subsection (b)(6)(A) did modify previously existing law. 
    Before the subsection was enacted, respondent's claims would fail only if the challenged harvesting satisfied each of five old provisions. 
    Under Subsection (b)(6)(A) however, these same claims would fail if the harvesting satisfied Subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) to new and different provisions. 
    Moreover, we find nothing in Subsection (b)(6)(A) that purported to direct any particular finding of fact or application of law to fact. 
    The opinion is unanimous.
