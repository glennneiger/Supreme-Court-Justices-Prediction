    Justice David H. Souter 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
    Respondents filed a state law tort suit in a New Hampshire State Court alleging that one of them had contracted AIDS from a transfusion of infected blood supplied by the petitioner, Red Cross. 
    The Red Cross removed the case to Federal District Court citing among other basis for federal jurisdiction the sue-and-be-sued provision of its federal charter. 
    The District Court asserted jurisdiction on that basis. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed concluding that the charter provision in question did not in fact confer federal jurisdiction over cases to which the Red Cross was a party. 
    In an opinion filed today, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals. 
    This Court has construed similar sue-and-be-sued provision since the early 19th century. 
    When read together, our cases support a rule that such a provision may be read to confer a federal jurisdiction if it specifically mentions the Federal Courts, though a particular Federal Court need not be mentioned by name. 
    As the relevant provision of the Red Cross' Charter satisfies this requirement, we hold that it confers federal jurisdiction over cases to which that organization is a party. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Kennedy have joined.
