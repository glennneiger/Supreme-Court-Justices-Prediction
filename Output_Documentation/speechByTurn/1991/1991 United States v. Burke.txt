    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    The first one is No. 91-42, United States against Burke. 
    In this case, it was a settlement of a sex discrimination case under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
    And under that settlement, the Tennessee Valley Authority paid backpay to affected employees. 
    It withheld federal income taxes from that backpay. 
    The IRS disallowed the respondent's claim for refund of the taxes so withheld. 
    In a refund action, the District Court ruled that the settlement proceeds could not be excluded from gross income as, to use the words of the statute, damages received on account of personal injuries. 
    The Sixth Circuit, however, reversed and it held that the discrimination was a personal and tort-like injury. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse that judgment. 
    We hold that these backpay awards in settlement of Title VII claims are not excludable from gross income under Section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    Justice Scalia and Justice Souter each have filed opinions concurring in the judgment, and Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined.
