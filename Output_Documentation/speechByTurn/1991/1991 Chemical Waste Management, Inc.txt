    Justice Byron R. White 
    For reasons very similar to those given by Justice Stevens in the Michigan trash case that was just announced, we hold that the Alabama statute at issue in this case which deals with hazardous waste is also an unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce. 
    Hence, we reverse the judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion.
