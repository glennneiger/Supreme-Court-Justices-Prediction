    Justice Byron R. White 
    I have two opinions to announce. 
    The first one actually deals with two cases 90-1205, United States against Fordice, and 90-6588, Ayers against Fordice. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion on file with the Clerk, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded for further proceedings. 
    Justices O'Connor and Thomas have filed concurring opinions; Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
