    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Eleventh Circuit. 
    It involves a court order desegregation decree for the school system of DeKalb County, Georgia. 
    This school district has 73,000 students in kindergarten through high school, and it is the 32nd largest school district in the nation. 
    It has been subject to the supervision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia since 1969, when it was ordered to dismantle its segregated school system. 
    The school district implemented a neighborhood school plan that achieved substantial racial balance but soon an imbalance occurred. 
    The school district underwent a dramatic change in demographics. 
    What had been a Black student population of something less than 6% in 1969 became a 47% Black student population by 1986. 
    In that year the school district sought final dismissal of the case. 
    All concede that the district had not adjusted to the demographic changes so that there was substantial racial imbalance in student assignments to the various schools in the district. 
    Half of the Black students in the district attended schools that were over 90% Black. 
    Of the 22 high schools, five were over 90% Black while five were over 80% White. 
    The District Court found that the school district had achieved maximum practical desegregation between 1969 and 1986, and that the massive demographic changes that had led to residential segregation and that the school attendants' patterns were not caused by any action on the part of the school district. 
    The court found that the district had complied with its decree in four categories: student assignments, transportation, physical facilities, and extracurricular activities. 
    Accordingly, it ruled that it would order no further remedies in these areas. 
    The court went on to find that the school district was not in full compliance with reference to three other categories. 
    On of these was the assignment of teachers and principals to create a better racial balance. 
    The court retained jurisdiction over the case and ordered further remedies, but only as to those areas such as teacher and principal assignment where the school district was not in full compliance. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed. 
    It ruled that until the district was in full compliance in every respect, the Trial Court was obligated to keep control over all school operations. 
    The Court of Appeals reasoned that this would require further court orders to achieve racial balance in student assignments including remedies that might be, in the words of the Court of Appeals, administratively awkward, inconvenient, and bizarre such as busing. 
    We granted certiorari in the school district's petition. 
    We now reverse. 
    We hold that in the course of supervising school desegregation plans Federal Courts have the authority to relinquish supervision and control of school districts in incremental stages before full compliance has been achieved in every area of school operations. 
    Remedies are justified only in so far as they advance the ultimate objective of alleviating the initial constitutional violation. 
    Partial relinquishment of judicial control where justified by the facts of the case can be an important and significant step in fulfilling the District Court's duty to return the operations and control of school's to local authorities. 
    Next question is whether under the standards that we set forth the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court's order for incremental withdrawal of supervision on the facts of this case. 
    Again, we find the Court of Appeals erred that there was racial imbalance in school attendance zones was not tantamount to a showing that the school district was in non-compliance with the decree or with its duties under the law. 
    Racial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake. 
    It is to be pursued where racial imbalance has been caused by a constitutional violation. 
    Once the racial imbalance due to the de jure violation has been remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors. 
    Where resegregation is not a product of state action but of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications. 
    It is beyond the authority and beyond the practical ability of the Federal Courts to try to counteract to these kinds of continuous and massive demographic shifts. 
    To attempt such results would require an ongoing and never-ending supervision by the court's school districts simply because they were once desegregated. 
    Residential housing choices and their attendant effects on the racial composition of schools present an ever-changing pattern, one difficult to address to judicial remedies. 
    It was appropriate for the District Court to examine the reasons for the racial imbalance in school attendance before ordering an impractical and no doubt massive expenditure of funds to achieve racial balance. 
    Here, there has been 17 years of efforts to implement the court's comprehensive desegregation plan in a school district where there were fundamental changes in population patterns, changes not attributable to the form of de jure regime or any later actions by school officials. 
    The District Court's determination to order instead the expenditure of scarce resources in areas such as the quality of education where full compliance had not yet been achieved underscores the wise uses of discretion in framing equitable remedies. 
    For a number of reasons explained in a lengthy opinion, we remand to the Court of Appeals. 
    It may order further remand to the District Courts for findings under the standards we have announced today. 
    Justices Scalia and Souter have filed concurring opinions; Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, joined by Justices Stevens and O'Connor. 
    Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
