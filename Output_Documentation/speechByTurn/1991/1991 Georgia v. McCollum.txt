    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    One of these is No. 91-372, Georgia against McCollum. 
    The respondents who are White were charged with assaulting two African-Americans. 
    Before the jury selection began, the trial judge denied the prosecution to motion to prohibit the defendants from exercising preemptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. 
    The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed and distinguished a recent case here where this Court had held that private litigants cannot exercise preemptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse that judgment and hold that the Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in purposeful discrimination on the grounds of race in the exercise of preemptory challenges. 
    Doing this inflicts the harms addressed in the Batson case decided here sometime ago. 
    A criminal defendant's exercise of preemptory challenges constitutes state action. 
    The state has third party standing to challenge the defendants' discriminatory use of challenges and the prohibition does not violate a criminal defendant's constitutional right. 
    The Chief Justice, while joining the opinion, has filed a concurring statement; Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice O'Connor and Justice Scalia each have filed dissenting opinions.
