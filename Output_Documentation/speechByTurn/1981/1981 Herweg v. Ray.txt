    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    This case which comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit involves the eligibility standards for the Medicaid program contained within the Social Security Act. 
    In an opinion filed the day with the clerk, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and uphold federal regulations which place time limitations upon the authority of the states to consider the income of an institutionalized Medicaid applicantâ€™s spouse when determining eligibility. 
    The complexity of the statutes and regulations involved virtually defy any attempt at further oral exposition and I shall not attempt any. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and the Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion.
