    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Third Circuit. 
    The question presented is whether a motion to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens must be denied when dismissal would result in the change in applicable law unfavorable to the plaintiff. 
    The action arises out of a crash of a small airplane in the Scottish highlands. 
    The pilot and all five passengers were killed instantly. 
    The decedents as well as their heirs and next of kin were all Scottish. 
    The respondent is an American who is acting as representative of the victims in States. 
    She filed a damage action in the United States District Court against petitioners, the American Corporation that manufactured the aircraft and its propellers. 
    She concedes that she filed a suit in the United States solely because American law was more favorable than Scottish law. 
    Petitioners moved to dismiss on the grounds of forum non conveniens claiming that the trial should take place in Scotland. 
    The District Court granted their motion. 
    It found that the private interest relating to the convenience of the litigants and the public interest relating to the convenience of the Court itself favored trial in Scotland. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed. 
    That Court noted that the dismissal and trial of the cases in Scotland would lead to a change in applicable law that would be unfavorable to the respondents. 
    It ruled that dismissal should be automatically barred in such circumstances. 
    The Court of Appeals further held that that dismissal was inappropriate because the District Court had not properly balanced the private and public interests. 
    Today, in an opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that the possibility of an unfavorable change in law could not automatically bar dismissal on the grounds of forum non conveniens. 
    Automatic dismissal would be inconsistent with the purposes of a forum non conveniens doctrine and would pose substantial practical problems. 
    We also hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the private and public interest favored trial in Scotland. 
    Thus, we reverse. 
    Justice Powell took no part in the decision of these cases. 
    Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. 
    Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. 
    And Justice Stevens joined by Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion.
