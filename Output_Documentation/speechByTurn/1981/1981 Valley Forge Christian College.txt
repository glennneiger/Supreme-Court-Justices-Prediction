    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Pursuant to its authority under the Property Clause of the constitution, Congress enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 in part to provide an economical and efficient system for the disposal of surplus government property. 
    The Act authorizes the Secretary of Education to convey surplus real property to non-profit education institution and to reduce the selling price by an amount that reflects the benefit gained by the United States from the transferee's use of the property. 
    In this case which comes to us on certiorari from the Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit, the Secretary conveyed surplus property former -- formerly used as a military hospital to petitioner, a non-profit church related college primarily devoted to training men and women for religious ministry. 
    Respondents, an organization devoted to -- separation of church and state and four of its employees brought suit in the District Court seeking to rescind the conveyance on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. 
    Respondents maintained that the conveyance deprived them of the fair and constitutional use of their tax dollars. 
    The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that respondents lack standing as taxpayers under our decision in Flast against Cohen and had failed to allege any actual injury that would allow them to challenge the conveyance. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court. 
    Although the Court was inclined to agree, the respondents lack standing as taxpayers, it held they had standing as citizens claiming injury to their “shared individuated right to a government that shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.” 
    We now reverse this judgment and hold that respondents have failed to demonstrate standing sufficient to satisfy the case or controversy requirement of Article III of the Constitution. 
    They cannot claim standing as taxpayers under our decision in Flast because the transfer they challenge is not a congressional action taken under the taxing and spending clause of Article I, Section 8. 
    It is instead an executive branch action authorized by Congress under the Property Clause. 
    We also hold the respondents cannot claim standing as citizens. 
    Article III requires an allegation of tangible personal injury, which is not satisfied simply by the claim that the Government has violated the Constitution. 
    A plaintiff must also allege some personal consequence as a result of the allegedly unconstitutional conduct and the respondents have not -- have not done simply by claiming a sincere and fervent interest in the separation of church and state. 
    To the extent, respondents invite the Court to create an exception to Article III for cases arising under the Establishment Clause, we declined that invitation. 
    Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion which Justices Marshall and Blackmun have joined. 
    Justice Stevens has also filed a dissenting opinion.
