    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    In clause 80-1430, Engle versus Isaac, the case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    The case arises from three unrelated criminal convictions. 
    The three respondents were convicted by Ohio of voluntary manslaughter, murder and aggravated assault respectively. 
    At their trials, all three respondents claimed self-defense. 
    Without objections from the respondents, the trial judges instructed the juries that respondents bore the burden of proving this defense by a preponderance of the evidence. 
    After the Ohio courts affirmed the convictions, respondents sought federal writs of habeas corpus. 
    A fair reading of respondents' habeas petitions informed by the manner in which the district judges themselves construed the petitions reveals that each respondent presented only one colorable constitutional claim to the district courts. 
    Respondents claim that the trial instructions requiring them to prove absence of self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence conflicted with Ohio's constitutional duty to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not consider the merits of that claim because respondents fail to present it properly to the Ohio courts. 
    Under Ohio law, respondents waived their objection to the self-defense instructions when they failed to object to those instructions at trial. 
    Five years ago, when Wainwright versus Sykes, we held that a state prisoner who waived the constitutional claim during state proceedings could not present that claim in a federal habeas petition unless he demonstrated cause for an actual prejudice from a default. 
    Because the cause and prejudice standard serves important interest in finality and on comity, we reaffirmed that ruling today. 
    We find that respondents have shown no cause for their procedural defaults. 
    We have reversed the judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and remanded the cases per proceedings consistent with the opinion. 
    Justice Blackmun concurs in the result. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. 
    Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.
