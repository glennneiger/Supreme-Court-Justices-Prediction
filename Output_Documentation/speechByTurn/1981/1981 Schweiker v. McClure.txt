    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    In the second of these Medicare cases, Schweiker against McClure. 
    It is here on direct appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. 
    That Court held that hearing procedures with respect to claims filed under Part B of the Medicare program violated due process. 
    We conclude that the procedures were valid. 
    Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court. 
    The opinions of this Court were unanimous in both of these cases.
