    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    I have three cases. 
    The fist two involve statutory provisions that are not entirely suitable for oral delivery. 
    Accordingly, I will simply identify the issues and the judgment of the Court. 
    The first of these is 80-1594, United States against Erika. 
    This case is here from the Court of Claims, the question was whether that Court had jurisdiction to review decisions made by private insurance carriers of the amount of benefits payable under Part B of the Medicare program. 
    On the basis of the explicit statutory language, we hold that the Court of Claims did not have jurisdiction. 
    We accordingly reversed its judgment.
