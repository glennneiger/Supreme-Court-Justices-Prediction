speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="30.353">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have the disposition to announce in American Medical Association against the Federal Trade Commission and by way of a per curiam opinion filed with the clerk this morning, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is affirmed by an equally divided court. 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning. 
    I should add that Justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration or decision or disposition of this case.
