Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="94.026">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in Arizona against Maricopa County Medical Society. 
    Mr. Reed, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="94.026" stopTime="131.244">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this case is here on certiorari to review what the lower courts have characterized as a controlling question of law on which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion. 
    The United States District Court denied our motion for partial summary judgment on the question of a violation, on the ground that the legality of Respondent's agreed upon fee schedules was to be judged under the rule of reason rather than per se rule.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="131.244" stopTime="137.710">
    Unknown Speaker 
    He did deny it with leave to file a similar motion later after more discovery had taken place, didn't it?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="137.710" stopTime="164.294">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    To be sure, and we subsequently filed, Justice Rehnquist, a motion for partial summary judgment on the question of violation, based on the rule of reason. 
    That motion was filed in support of our papers for a preliminary injunction, and both of those questions were before the Ninth Circuit, both the 1292b petition for interlocutory appeal and the appeal of the denial of summary judgment motion.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="164.294" stopTime="172.884">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Summary judgment in your favor.
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="172.884" stopTime="195.734">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Summary judgment had been denied by the District Court under both the rule of reason theory and per se theory, and our request for continuation of the preliminary injunction was also denied under the theory that it did not violate either the per se standard and there was not enough evidence to show that it violated the rule of reason.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="195.734" stopTime="217.803">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But didn't Judge Coppel give you leave to renew your motion for summary judgment on either standard after more discovery had taken place, just that there wasn't enough facts in the record to say what the effect of the plan was?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="217.803" stopTime="363.995">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    He did in fact give us leave to refile. 
    We did in fact refile it. 
    He did in fact deny it. 
    I think the question this Court has to decide is how much additional discovery need be taken and on what additional issues must discovery be taken if at all before reaching a decision. 
    I think, as we talk in the briefs, there is talk in the papers about disputed facts, about the desire for further discovery, but I think the facts, Justice Rehnquist, necessary for this Court's decision are clear and simple, undisputed, and have been established by Respondent's own Rule 36 admissions and the affidavits Respondents themselves have prepared and submitted and filed with the lower courts, and those facts are really only three. 
    One, Respondents are trade associations of competing physicians. 
    Two, as part of their activities, Respondents formulate and prepare lists of prices covering the range of services that they perform. 
    Three, as part of their function, the Respondents prepare minimum standards which they utilize in endorsing pre-paid health plans, whether insurance health plans or by third party payors such as the state of Arizona, which reimburses health care plans as an employer. 
    For an insurer or an employer to receive Respondents' endorsement, the third party payor must agree to accept these minimum standards, one of which is the agreement to pay Respondent's members up to the amount set forth in the agreed upon fee schedules. 
    In return, in return, Respondents' members agree not to bill any more than what is set forth in those fee schedules. 
    Those facts, Justice Rehnquist, are established beyond cavil.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="363.995" stopTime="370.429">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I thought that the physician was free to bill the patient whatever he wanted.
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="370.429" stopTime="386.173">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    The physician can... a member of the society, a member of one of the Respondents can bill less than the fee schedule.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="386.173" stopTime="387.626">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What about more?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="387.626" stopTime="398.606">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Not at all. 
    He could prepare a piece of paper that said more. 
    He has been guaranteed of receiving what is set in the fee schedule.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="398.606" stopTime="411.398">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And if the patient wishes to pay him more, and he sends a bill to the patient for more, and the patient pays him more, he doesn't have to return it, does he?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="411.398" stopTime="413.177">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Not at all, Your Honor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="413.177" stopTime="417.473">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Can he enforce his higher bill in court against a patient?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="417.473" stopTime="425.017">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    He is under a contractual obligation as a member of the society, of the Respondent society--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="425.017" stopTime="425.845">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Not to. 
    Is that it?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="425.845" stopTime="427.142">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    --not to seek to collect--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="427.142" stopTime="429.141">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, can the patient defend on that basis?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="429.141" stopTime="433.872">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    --I would think so, Your Honor. 
    I would think the claim would be between the insurance carrier--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="433.872" stopTime="442.214">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, do we know from any Arizona court decision whether the patient can defend on the basis of this agreement?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="442.214" stopTime="483.634">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    --There is not an Arizona court decision I can cite you to, Your Honor. 
    I would suggest, Justice Rehnquist, that questions such as that are irrelevant. 
    Going back into the decisions of this Court, starting out with Justice Peckham's opinion in the Trans-Missouri Freight Association case, continuing through the recent decision in cases such as California Retail Liquor Dealers versus Midcal Aluminum, any agreement, any agreement among competitors raising, lowering, stabilizing prices is itself a per se violation of the antitrust laws.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="483.634" stopTime="502.798">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes, but Justice Rehnquist's question really goes to whether or not there is any such agreement like that at all. 
    If these doctors are completely free, despite what some piece of paper says, to charge the patient more, and they do, what kind of an agreement to set prices is there?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="502.798" stopTime="510.467">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Your Honor, any agreement among competitors to set prices is a violation of the law.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="510.467" stopTime="513.637">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, I am saying, is there an agreement if the first line says, we agree, and the next line says, we don't agree?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="513.637" stopTime="538.971">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Mr. Justice White, any agreement among competitors to set prices is a per se violation. 
    Any person obviously has a legal right not to abide by that agreement. 
    An agreement to fix prices is legally unenforceable. 
    The oil companies in Socony-Vacuum Oil Company could not legally have been compelled to abide by the price fixing agreement.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="538.971" stopTime="582.313">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Following up on Justice White's question, supposing that the agreement, if there be such, of the foundation says that you will not charge more than... you will not be reimbursed or charge more than $900 for this service, and the physician gets his $900 reimbursement but bills the patient $1,600, and the patient says, no, I don't want to pay $1,600 and doesn't pay the $1,600. 
    Can the physician nonetheless sue him and collect it?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="582.313" stopTime="583.797">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    I would think not, Your Honor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="583.797" stopTime="585.608">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What makes you think not?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="585.608" stopTime="631.481">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Because the agreement among the physicians, one of the criteria on which they signed their membership application when they joined the foundation is agree not to seek recovery, not to receive more than the amount of money set forth by the fee schedule. 
    Anybody can file a piece of paper and go down to court and seek recovery on a claim, seek recovery on a claim, whether it has merit or not. 
    There is a contractual obligation and an agreement among the competing physicians that they will accept the amount set forth in the fee schedules.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="631.481" stopTime="634.543">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Where is that in the record in this case?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="634.543" stopTime="644.069">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Your Honor, I would direct your attention to Page 9 of Respondent's reply brief on the merits.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="644.069" stopTime="645.460">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What color?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="645.460" stopTime="722.149">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Red. 
    Quoting, 
    "Foundation member health care providers agreed to accept as payment in full for patients covered by Foundation endorsed insurance the maximum level of reimbursement from the insurer for services rendered. " 
    I also direct your attention to the affidavit of Thomas Finley, the executive director of one of the foundations. 
    It appears at Page 78 of the joint appendix, at Paragraph 16 of his affidavit, and I think his statement there nicely sums up what is involved here. 
    This is an affidavit prepared by the Respondents and signed by one of Respondent's executives. 
    Quote: 
    "The Foundation does exercise direct control over the establishment of maximum payment rates for medical services. " 
    Direct control. 
    That is his language. 
    "However, these rates are a ceiling, not a floor, for Foundation members. " 
    "Each doctor who is a member of the Foundation expressly agrees that covered expenses will be reimbursed at no more than the maximum rate established by the Foundation. " 
    Period, close quote. 
    There is no question, Your Honor, that there is that express agreement.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="722.149" stopTime="725.945">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Will be reimbursed by whom?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="725.945" stopTime="731.442">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    By the insurance company or other third party payor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="731.442" stopTime="734.363">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But not necessarily by the patient.
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="734.363" stopTime="744.547">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    That is correct, Your Honor, except to the extent of the deductible coverage, or the first $100 that may be paid in any one calendar year.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="744.547" stopTime="750.153">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, isn't there a term of the agreement that the doctor will charge nothing to the customer except the reimbursible expense?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="750.153" stopTime="752.387">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Excuse me, Justice Stevens. 
    I am not sure I understood.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="752.387" stopTime="764.976">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Does not the overall agreement provide that the doctor who joins the plan when he is performing services for an insured person under the plan will collect all of his fees from the insurance company except for the deductible amount?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="764.976" stopTime="766.179">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    That's correct.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="766.179" stopTime="769.224">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So there won't be an additional charge to the customer if the agreement is adhered to.
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="769.224" stopTime="808.148">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    That is absolutely correct. 
    That this may be characterized as a maximum fee schedule is of no moment. 
    Again, the cases have consistently held in this Court that any agreement among competitors raising, lowering, stabilizing, tampering with prices is a per se violation. 
    Justice Peckham's opinion in Trans-Missouri made that point, one of the first price fixing cases before this Court. 
    The most recent case to present this issue, Midcal Aluminum, again, maximum price fixing is unlawful.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="808.148" stopTime="812.490">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What is the Foundation's share of the market in the state?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="812.490" stopTime="856.923">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Foundation member physicians have approximately 70 percent of the physicians in the area as members. 
    The precise market share I cannot tell you. 
    Your Honor, the precise market share is not a matter that is relevant either to a per se analysis or rule of reason analysis. 
    Justice Rehnquist, if you go back to Judge Addison Pipe, and take it through to former Solicitor General Robert Borak's most recent, I think very thoughtful analysis of antitrust paradox, makes a very telling point.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="856.923" stopTime="860.953">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, neither of them were members of this Court at that time.
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="860.953" stopTime="906.934">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    To be sure, Your Honor. 
    Fortunately, however, I think the rationale was accepted by this Court when it affirmed the Nationwide Trailer Rental case and again in the Broadcast Music case by Justice White, and again in the GTE Sylvania case, and the point is this, that where there is economic integration, where there is a pooling of productive assets, a sharing of risk and benefits, an incidental elimination of price competition is permissible. 
    Thus, Judge Taft in Addison, Justice White, you made this point yourself in BMI when you made mention of partnerships--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="906.934" stopTime="908.825">
    Unknown Speaker 
    That was a Court opinion. 
    The Court did it.
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="908.825" stopTime="948.464">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    --To be sure. 
    When you made the reference to partnerships, mergers, or joint ventures as being examples where economic assets have been pooled, there is a sharing of risk and benefits. 
    There, there is an economic integration. 
    Even where there are only two individuals, and this is Robert Borak's example, two individuals that legitimately form a partnership and pool their assets, if they independently, without pooling their assets, agree to eliminate competition, that is a per se violation without regard to their market share.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="948.464" stopTime="955.712">
    Unknown Speaker 
    If the Foundation had only 10 percent of the market in Maricopa County, would that be the case?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="955.712" stopTime="977.672">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Absolutely. 
    Absent an economic integration of the productive assets, whether it is 10 percent or whether it is only two physicians, agreeing on prices, that is a per se violation, absent an economic integration of pooling of assets, absent the sharing of risk benefits.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="977.672" stopTime="993.150">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Reed, that may be a fair inference from what the Court has said, but the Court has never quite said that, has it? 
    It has never said that two people can't horizontally fix prices. 
    There is no such case cut of this Court that holds that on all fours.
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="993.150" stopTime="995.930">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    That two persons cannot horizontally--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="995.930" stopTime="1002.662">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Two corner grocers get together and say, we won't charge less than a dollar for hamburger. 
    There is no such case, is there?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1002.662" stopTime="1050.033">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    --Not two persons. 
    But I think, Justice Stevens, if you refer back to Justice Douglas's opinion in Socony-Vacuum, he did indicate, and I think very definitely in his Footnote 59, that it matters not. 
    The Section 1 violation is complete, even though the conspirators do not have the power to carry out their agreement. 
    Power to accomplish the end is not relevant. 
    It is not material to the violation. 
    So, to be sure, we have not had before this Court the precise situation of those two individuals, but we have had the issue decided.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1050.033" stopTime="1061.262">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I think all the price fixing cases in this Court have been cases in which the defendants had market dominance. 
    It may be that isn't required, and I agree with you that Justice Douglas's language certainly doesn't seem to require that.
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1061.262" stopTime="1173.249">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    I think that is not necessarily the case, Your Honor. 
    In the opinion in the Nationwide Trailer case, which was affirmed per curium by this Court, the District Court was expressly unable to determine the market share of the defendants and unable to determine that the fee schedule had in fact been used. 
    It found that the members of the trade association had among themselves prepared, agreed upon, and published a fee schedule. 
    It had not... it did not make any finding in its findings of fact that expressly said that it didn't have the evidence to make any finding, that it was used or that it was followed, and absent any showing of market share, no ability to show that they had the power to put it into effect. 
    Nonetheless, the District Court there held that the mere preparation, publication, and circulation among its members of a fee schedule was a per se violation, and this Court affirmed that decision. 
    I think the Respondents here have gone much further, gone much further than anything in any of the earlier cases to come before this Court. 
    The people in Socony-Vacuum, the realtors in National Association of Real Estate Boards, the lawyers in Goldfarb, the trailer rental operators in the Nationwide Trailer case agreed among themselves on the prices, on a price list. 
    They had no guarantee, however, that they would be able to receive the prices that they agreed upon in their price list.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1173.249" stopTime="1177.576">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But Goldfarb was a minimum fee. 
    A minimum fee.
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1177.576" stopTime="1178.700">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    To be sure, and so was National Association--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1178.700" stopTime="1190.632">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And a person could not get the service in this part of Virginia affected by Goldfarb from any lawyer except by paying that minimum fee. 
    Isn't that quite different from a maximum fee?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1190.632" stopTime="1215.998">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    --I believe so, Your Honor, and I believe this case presents a more egregious. 
    The minimum, and while it didn't occur in Goldfarb, it did occur in the National Association of Real Estate Boards, where there was a stated minimum, a number of transactions went down from there, and in point of fact, transactions were made as noted by Justice Douglas in that opinion, transactions were made below the agreed upon price.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1215.998" stopTime="1223.212">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Is your charge here primarily then one of conspiracy, and nothing more?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1223.212" stopTime="1249.188">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Your Honor, that is sufficient to entitle me to summary judgment on the question of the violation. 
    I think there is much more that we can go into in the medical profession, but on the question of whether Respondents' formulation and preparation of fee schedules is a violation of the law, those facts those facts alone are sufficient to establish a violation.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1249.188" stopTime="1252.623">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Regardless of the market share or anything else?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1252.623" stopTime="1453.447">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Regardless of the market share. 
    The only exception being the question, is there an economic integration, is there a pooling of productive assets? 
    There is not here. 
    And the simple agreement among non-integrated competitors, which is what we have, on a price schedule is under the cases and in my view a per se violation of the antitrust laws. 
    What has been done here is more than simply a minimum violation, minimum fee schedule, rather. 
    The members of this society had guaranteed themselves payment up to the so-called maximum that they have agreed upon, and the effect of this, the effect of this, Justice Rehnquist, I think is evidenced pretty clearly by something that occurred during the course of this litigation, wherein the District Court... an injunction had remained in effect for a few months, and Respondents' members wanted to increase their prices. 
    They went into the District Court and asked that the preliminary injunction be lifted so that they could increase their prices an aggregate of $1.8 million a month, and they asked that as a condition of a continuation of this preliminary injunction, if the injunction were to continue enjoining them from increasing their fee schedule, the state of Arizona would be required to post a bond of $1.8 million a month for every month that they were enjoined from promulgating a new fee schedule. 
    Even if Respondents had not gotten the guarantee that they would receive what they had agreed upon, even if Respondents had done no more than agree upon a maximum level of prices, establish maximum prices, that agreement would still be... should still be per se unlawful. 
    I go back again to one of the first price fixing cases to come before this Court, Justice Peckham's opinion in Trans-Missouri, and he identified there the evil, one of the evils of a maximum price fixing agreement among competitors, and if I may take the liberty of quoting to the Court from Page 323 of 166 US, 
    "In business or trading combinations, they may even temporarily or perhaps permanently reduce the price of an article traded in or manufactured. " 
    Reduce the price. 
    "Trade or commerce under those circumstances may nevertheless be badly and unfortunately restrained by driving out of business the small leaders and worthy men whose lives have been spent therein. " 
    He went on on the next page to say, 
    "In this light, it is not material that the price of an article may be lowered. " 
    Mr. Peckham was talking hypothetical economics there, but well based economics.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1453.447" stopTime="1467.207">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But do we know that the same effects would result in the physician patient service relationship as between the railroad shipper analysis?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1467.207" stopTime="1543.082">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    I think the economic effect of that, Number One, to show that Justice Peckham was not off base is seen in the second American Tobacco case. 
    The second American Tobacco case, you will recall, is where the major tobacco companies reduced their price on the cigarettes they sold to provide a competitive alternative to the so-called ten-cent brands. 
    By reducing their price, they kept the ten-cent brands off the market. 
    The stated purpose for this... for the original inception of these foundations, and I am quoting from the joint brief in opposition, the red one, at Page 8, 
    "is a competitive alternative to the utilization of closed panel prepaid health insurance plans. " 
    stated differently, a group of competitors, the Respondents here, reducing their prices to compete with HMOs, just like... just like the major tobacco companies reduced their prices to keep the ten-cent cigarettes off the market in the second American Tobacco case.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1543.082" stopTime="1547.160">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But wouldn't we know more if we had deposition testimony--
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1547.160" stopTime="1548.940">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Most certainly.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1548.940" stopTime="1550.737">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --or witness testimony?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1550.737" stopTime="1575.461">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Most certainly. 
    I would think, Justice Rehnquist, that we could spend the next ten years and after ten years, or five years, perhaps, we could have the definitive treatise on medical economics. 
    But Chief Justice Warren made a very important point in the Brown Shoe case, and that is that we should not protract already complex antitrust cases by looking into peripheral economic facts.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1575.461" stopTime="1577.055">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, but--
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1577.055" stopTime="1603.450">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    And the per se rule in Northern Pacific Railroad is recognized as being based in part upon the necessity and the wisdom of avoiding unnecessary expenditures of judicial resources. 
    The whole notion of Rule 56 summary judgment proceedings is to decide cases prior to trial, if possible, when all of the material facts have been established beyond dispute.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1603.450" stopTime="1608.057">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --But how do you know when all the material facts have been established?
speaker="kenneth_r_reed" startTime="1608.057" stopTime="1686.291">
    Mr. Kenneth R. Reed 
    Because under Rules 56E and 56F, a party posing a summary judgment motion has the obligation of identifying material issues of disputed fact that require a trial, or under 56F, if there hasn't been enough of an opportunity to conduct discovery, identifying the specific issues of fact on which further discovery is required that will require trial. 
    First of all, we have never during the course of this litigation had a 56E statement or a 56F statement. 
    Be that as it may, there have been a number of factual contentions that have been raised that it has been suggested require further discovery or that it has been suggested are in dispute. 
    Justice Rehnquist, yes, we could conduct five years or ten years of court time and lawyers' time to explore those. 
    None of those matters are material. 
    None of those matters require a trial. 
    The fact that a group of independent competitors agree on a fee schedule... under Nationwide Trailer Rental, that is enough to constitute the violation.

   Argument of Stephen M. Shapiro
speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="2125.365" stopTime="2174.907">
    Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro 
    I will, Your Honor. 
    Our position concisely is that a maximum fee agreement has many of the objectionable features of an ordinary price cartel, that although the arrangement is denominated a maximum fee arrangement, that the individual doctors have very little incentive to charge less than the prescribed maximum. 
    In this case, it is stipulated that almost all of them do charge the maximum, and it is also stipulated that every year they hike the maximum further and further, which raises the costs of the insurance companies that do business with the foundations, and ultimately redounds to the detriment of the consumers that pay for the premiums on the insurance policies. 
    Our position is that it is harmful to consumers, and I will elaborate that point in the course of my argument.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2174.907" stopTime="2176.032">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Are the insurance companies objecting?
speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="2176.032" stopTime="2179.812">
    Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro 
    There is no indication of their position in this record.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2179.812" stopTime="2184.169">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Or of the non-member doctors?
speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="2184.169" stopTime="2300.623">
    Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro 
    No indication of that in this record. 
    Our submission is that the maximum fee schedules that were adopted by the foundations are in fact per se violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and we further contend that the per se rule can be applied at this stage of the litigation, in view of the specific admissions which the foundations made in the District Court. 
    I would like first to describe the legal standard which governs in a case of this kind, and then explain why Arizona was entitled to summary judgment under that standard. 
    Ever since this Court's ruling in Socony-Vacuum, it has been black letter law that competitors may not combine to restrain independent decision-making on price. 
    As the Court stated in Socony, and I quote, 
    "Any combination which tampers with price structures is engaged in an unlawful activity. " 
    And in the unanimous decision of this Court in Kiefer-Stewart, the Court reaffirmed that an agreement among competitors fixing maximum prices is subject to the per se prohibition just like a uniform price agreement or a minimum price agreement. 
    In Professional Engineers, the Court summarized its past opinions concisely by stating that any agreement that interferes with the setting of price by free market forces is unlawful on its face. 
    Of course, the per se rule must be confined by the scope of its rationale. 
    It applies to so-called naked restraints which cut off competitive or independent decision-making by independent rivals. 
    It does not ordinarily apply to agreements on price which are necessary components of joint productive activity. 
    This distinction is illustrated by a familiar example. 
    If a group of attorneys gets together and establishes a schedule of fees, this is a per se violation as the Court held in the Goldfarb case.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2300.623" stopTime="2302.417">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Minimum. 
    Minimum fees.
speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="2302.417" stopTime="2492.890">
    Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro 
    Minimum fees. 
    And under Kiefer-Stewart, maximum fees are subject to the same pet se prohibition. 
    But if that same group of lawyers gets together and establishes a law firm, they may agree on the prices which they charge their clients. 
    Members of firms are not expected to compete against one another or to attempt to divert business from each other. 
    Joint productive activity defends on cooperation rather than internal competition in an integrated business entity, such as a partnership. 
    Accordingly, the relevant inquiry in this case is twofold. 
    First, have competitors in fact entered into an agreement limiting their pricing, independence, and second, if they have, is that agreement an essential facet of joint productive activity, as in the case of a partnership or a merger of medical practices into a health maintenance organization? 
    In this case, these questions can all be answered with dispatch. 
    In fact, all of the information that is needed to render a judgment on liability is contained in the foundation's very extensive admissions of fact which are on Pages 156 through 273 of the joint appendix in this Court. 
    Let me now summarize what the foundations have in fact admitted. 
    The doctor members of the foundations vote by mail ballot on maximum fee schedules used to determine the fees which insurance companies pay them, and they agree to abide by those maximums. 
    If an insurance company wishes to do business with the foundations, it must agree to pay the doctors up to the maximum which they have jointly prescribed. 
    The foundations have increased these maximums nearly on a yearly basis since they were formed in 1969 and 1971, and only 5 to 15 percent of the doctors in Maricopa Foundation bill less than the prescribed maximum. 
    Significantly, when the foundations tried to identify issues of fact for trial, they did not suggest that the medical practices of their members were integrated into a partnership or a joint venture arrangement. 
    The undisputed fact is that the doctors here involved are hundreds of independent practitioners engaged in traditional fee for service medicine. 
    Accordingly, their price fixing falls into the category of a naked restraint, and is not an essential facet of joint integrated medical practice. 
    We note in this connection that the claims payment and review activities which the foundations carry on do not require that the doctors prescribe their prices, and the foundations have never made any contrary assertion. 
    In a period in which everyone is vitally concerned with inflation in the health care industry, it may seem somewhat unusual for the government to argue that doctors should not ban together and prescribe maximum prices for themselves. 
    In fact, however, maximum price fixing is no cure for rising costs in the health care industry. 
    Maximum price fixing has many of the objectionable features of an ordinary price cartel. 
    For example, if the doctors--

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Shapiro.

speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="2524.019" stopTime="2574.812">
    Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Our submission is that maximum price fixing has many of the objectionable features of an ordinary price cartel, and that is the reason this Court condemned it in Kiefer-Stewart as illegal per se. 
    For example, if the doctors prescribe a maximum price of $1,000 for a particular operation, and most of them actually charge that maximum, as the record here shows, then the maximum has many of the features of a fixed uniform price, and since it is always in the power of the combination to raise the price, the so-called maximum is not a maximum at all, because it can be hiked at will by the doctors themselves, as this record clearly shows. 
    Moreover, this Court has never suggested that a professed goal of having reasonable prices is an excuse for price agreements among competitors.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2574.812" stopTime="2585.916">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Do you think Arizona's primary complaint here is the predatory nature of the agreement or the keeping out of other doctors?
speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="2585.916" stopTime="2601.394">
    Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro 
    Arizona's point is that the agreement could be used to keep out other doctors through depression of the price, and it could be used to inflate the cost of health insurance through elevating the costs. 
    It is the aggregation of power through the combination to do those two things that is illegal.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2601.394" stopTime="2603.019">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But don't you need to know something about the market?
speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="2603.019" stopTime="2611.671">
    Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro 
    You do not. 
    That is precisely what you don't need to know in a case of naked price fixing, as this Court held in Socony and in Trenton Potteries, and many of it's other decisions.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2611.671" stopTime="2613.280">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You used the phrase "could be used".
speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="2613.280" stopTime="2763.126">
    Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro 
    It is the potential, as the Court pointed out in Trenton Potteries. 
    It is the aggregation of power to... which could be pressed to improper ends that Section 1 of the Sherman Act condemns as illegal per se. 
    The aggregation of power in a price fixing combination. 
    This Court's... Let me illustrate the point that I was making a moment ago. 
    If the foundations were permitted to enforce their own conception of a reasonable maximum price, there would be an inevitable tendency to adjust that price upwards to promote their own economic welfare, and as this Court emphasized in the Socony case, those who fixed reasonable prices today would fix unreasonable prices tomorrow, and any insurance company that wished to do business with the combination would be compelled to pay up to the fixed maximum price. 
    I would also point out in this connection that although the foundation's claim that a maximum price is essential to contain medical costs, they fail to suggest a single reason why that maximum price needs to be prescribed by a combination of competitors. 
    If in fact a maximum price is a useful feature in medical insurance plans, the maximum can be prescribed by individual insurers who pay for the medical services and who actually have an incentive to reduce medical expenditures. 
    That is the way the Blue Shield insurance policies operate throughout this country. 
    The present price fixing scheme prevents individual insurers from obtaining competitively negotiated agreements with individual doctors, and interferes with their efforts to contain medical costs. 
    That is bad for the consumers, who pay for the insurance premiums. 
    In short, this price fixing scheme poses a serious threat to competitive conditions. 
    It can be enjoined without causing injury to any joint productive activity. 
    In these circumstance, we submit, the per se rule is properly applied, and it is properly applied on the record which is now before this Court. 
    As this Court pointed out in the White Motors case some time ago, it is perfectly appropriate to use summary judgment procedures in a horizontal price fixing case, and it referred to the Kiefer-Stewart decision, which is a maximum price fixing case, in making that observation. 
    For there reasons, we respectfully submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2763.126" stopTime="2793.363">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Shapiro, may I ask you one question, if you are through? 
    You said there are two components of this agreement, one an agreement on what the schedule shall be, and secondly, each doctor agrees not to charge his customers more than the schedule, as I understand it, insured, where there is insurance, and you said Blue Shield is different in that Blue Shield specifies the schedule. 
    Would the Blue Shield program be illegal if Blue Shield specified the schedule and if every doctor that participated in the program agreed not to charge in excess of the schedule?
speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="2793.363" stopTime="2816.433">
    Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro 
    The Justice Department's consistent position has been that if individual doctors sign up individually on the dotted line, which is the procedure, it is perfectly all right. 
    But if the doctors combine together and use their concerted power to negotiate with the individual insurer to establish that price, that is illegal per se. 
    That is what our business review letters have said for the past decade. 
    Thank you very much.

   Argument of Philip P. Berelson
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="2824.336" stopTime="3000.373">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a summary judgment case, and because of that I am going to spend a great deal of time talking about the facts and the lack of facts that are undisputed and are in the record. 
    First, I would point out that Respondents have submitted a statement of material facts in issue precluding summary judgment. 
    It is found in the appendix, at Page 123, and I think it deals with many of the issues which I am going to discuss. 
    Most important, there is no fee schedule, no fee schedule as Petitioner and as the United States have used that term today. 
    The evidence shows that there is no agreement concerning what doctors charge patients, and the District Court so ruled, and that is right in its opinion. 
    What the Petitioner is calling a fee schedule is really an agreement by members of a medical foundation which only affects medical foundation endorsed insurance, and it is an agreement to accept the maximum reimbursement levels as payment in full in the event that the doctor bills the patient more than that maximum reimbursement level and the patient is medical foundation insured. 
    Then the doctor will write off the difference. 
    If the doctor is not a member of the foundation, then the doctor is free to charge the difference to the patient. 
    This is accompanied by agreements by the members of the foundation to be bound by peer review, not to use the foundation to change the rates they bill their patients, not to discriminate in billing between foundation insured and non-insured patients, and it has absolutely no effect whatsoever without the additional component of an insurer voluntarily agreeing to participate in the program, and there is no evidence in the record that there is any ability to coerce insurers to participate. 
    Indeed, the record is absolutely empty as to what the insurers really do in the market. 
    All we can say, and this is very limited, is that in 1979 Maricopa Foundation, one of the Respondents, insured about 1,000 people out of a population of 1.5 million in Maricopa County, about 7 percent, and in 1978, Pima Foundation covered about 6,000 people, or about 1 percent of the population of Pima County, and in that same year, only 31 percent of the physicians in Pima County were members of Pima Foundation. 
    So, it is not an organization which exercises any sort of dominance over delivery of medical care in the two areas where the Respondents are operating.

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    I am asking the Court to rule that on this state of the record, the rule of reason must be applied to determine whether or not there is a violation that will entitle the Petitioner to summary judgment, but when we have a trial, then we will have a full record, we will know the context, we will know the marketplace, we will have the experience for the Court to determine whether there is the type of conduct that could in the future be characterized as per se--

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    That's right. 
    There is no evidence in this record supporting the Petitioner's claim that the maximum reimbursement rates of the medical foundation result in physicians' revising prices upward, because there is very little evidence in the record as to what pricing takes place in Maricopa or Pima Counties at all. 
    What we do know from the record is that the Maricopa Foundation maximum reimbursement rates have lagged well behind the rate of increase of medical fees and the rate of increase of inflation both for medical and for general cost of living, both national and--

    Five increases?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3321.198" stopTime="3323.149">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --Five increases, and if you look at Appendix--

    Unknown Speaker 
    Over a period of how many years?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3324.806" stopTime="3426.656">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --Since... I believe that is from 1971 in the case of the Maricopa Foundation, but I may be wrong on that year. 
    The Appendix C to our brief shows the amount of the increases in the reimbursement levels of the Maricopa Foundation, and he compares it against published statistics on the rate of increase of medical fees in Maricopa County and nationwide, and shows that the rate is less for the maximum reimbursement levels, and that is consistent with the contention that we intend to prove at trial that the medical foundation is a mechanism for holding down costs, and it is the cost to the insurer of providing the medical care that the insurer has contracted to indemnity. 
    I would like to explain how that works. 
    You have to look at the three groups that are interested here. 
    It was an observation from the Court which is quite true that there is a tripartite situation. 
    You have the patients. 
    What does the patient want? 
    A patient wants a commitment from his insurer to pay the medical bills. 
    The patient does not want to have to pay a difference between what the insurance covers and what the doctor bills. 
    He wants the insurance to cover the medical procedures which are necessary, not to be told that he can't have the procedure because he can't afford it and it is not covered. 
    He wants the best quality of care. 
    He wants to choose the doctor who will give the care. 
    And he wants the insurance cost to be as low as possible, consistent with delivering the other things that he wants.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3426.656" stopTime="3442.478">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Berelson, may I interrupt? 
    I may have misunderstood something you said before. 
    In order to accomplish the objectives you have just described, is it correct that the doctor members of the association agree that the patients will not have to pay anything more than the maximum fee schedule?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3442.478" stopTime="3447.225">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    They agree that that is true if the patient is covered by--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3447.225" stopTime="3447.897">
    Unknown Speaker 
    If he is covered, yes.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3447.897" stopTime="3453.317">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --by the foundation insurance, and if the doctor has become a foundation member.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3453.317" stopTime="3454.005">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Right.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3454.005" stopTime="3455.098">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    And the record shows that--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3455.098" stopTime="3464.642">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But limiting it to patients who have the insurance and doctors who are members of the foundation, is it clear on this record that there is an agreement establishing the maximum which the patients must pay?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3464.642" stopTime="3471.264">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --No, it is an agreement establishing that the patient pays nothing, the insurer pays--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3471.264" stopTime="3473.311">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, right, but the maximum the insurance company will pay--
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3473.311" stopTime="3474.183">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --Exactly.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3474.183" stopTime="3476.261">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --which in turn allows it to charge a lower insurance rate, presumably.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3476.261" stopTime="3478.604">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Exactly. 
    The maximum the insurer has to pay--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3478.604" stopTime="3487.945">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So it is clear on the record that there is an agreement to fix the maximum fees that the doctors will receive for the services performed for this particular segment of the market.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3487.945" stopTime="3495.504">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --No, because it's an agreement to make a proposal to insurance companies, which they are free to accept or reject. 
    It doesn't fix anything.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3495.504" stopTime="3496.707">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes, but once the insurance... it is a tripartite thing.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3496.707" stopTime="3497.316">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    That's right.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3497.316" stopTime="3509.280">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Once the insurance companies have accepted, and I think four of them have, there is then in effect an agreement among the doctors that in this particular segment of their work they will receive a maximum of so many dollars for such and such a service.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3509.280" stopTime="3645.147">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Exactly, and it is an interesting fact that the doctor does not know, because he doesn't have circulated to him a listing in advance as to what those are going to be. 
    He is supposed to charge all his patients the way he ordinarily charges them, and when the patient happens to be foundation insured, the foundation will pay the claim, and if the bill was more than what the maximum reimbursement level is, the doctor is informed of this, and then he has to write off the difference. 
    Now, let's look at what the insurer would like. 
    The insurer would like to keep down the cost of the medical care that it is obligated to indemnify the patient for. 
    That means minimizing the payments for the treatment that must be given, avoiding unnecessary treatment, and the insurer can also lower the cost by limiting the extent o the coverage of the insurance, by excluding coverage of certain procedures or certain types of illnesses. 
    The insurer would like to accurately predict the costs of medical care because that enables the insurer to make better actuarial predictions, which means that it can lower its rates because it doesn't have to have a reserve to cover the unexpected, and it is worth pointing out that a big element in that unexpected is usually inflation, and the possibility of increases in the costs of medical services which you can't tell in advance. 
    You are writing insurance that covers a period of time. 
    You don't know what the cost of a particular procedure is going to be a year from now in the community. 
    The insurer needs a mechanism to negotiate cost containment. 
    He needs one which is inexpensive and administratively feasible. 
    He cannot go out and send his agents to negotiate individually with every one of the doctors in the community. 
    In the record we see a number of 1,700 in Maricopa County, and keep in mind that you are talking about a number of insurers who do business in Maricopa County, although the number is not defined in the record. 
    But if we assume that it is even 50, if you have 50 insurers each trying to negotiate with 1,700 doctors, you can see the administrative nightmare that you get.

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --Not at all. 
    That is the point I am trying to make. 
    The board of trustees of the medical foundation--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3705.342" stopTime="3709.496">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I thought you just told Justice Stevens there was an agreement among the doctors.

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --The agreement is not among the doctors. 
    It is between the doctor and the medical foundation that the doctor will accept the medical foundation maximum payment--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3721.133" stopTime="3732.113">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, all right. 
    You told Justice Stevens that once the insurance company agrees the doctors are bound to charge no more than a maximum fee, and that they have agreed among themselves to that.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3732.113" stopTime="3741.078">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --No, the doctor charges his usual fee, but is paid by the insurance some amount which may be less, and if it is less, he writes off the difference.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3741.078" stopTime="3745.545">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, he has agreed to collect from the customer no more than a maximum amount.

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    He collects nothing from... he has agreed to collect nothing from the customer, with the possible exception of a deductible. 
    It becomes a transaction entirely between the doctor and the insurer and the patient is out of it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3758.273" stopTime="3770.612">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, suppose as we read the record it doesn't look to us like this is the kind of an operation that Blue Cross runs.

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Well, that is right. 
    It is not the type of operation that Blue Cross runs, and that is why you have to have a factual understanding of what it does do in order to understand that it is a cost containment mechanism.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3782.451" stopTime="3784.013">

    Yes.

speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3792.400" stopTime="3810.658">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    That is right. 
    What I am suggesting is, the medical foundation does the same thing in this arrangement that Blue Cross does in its plans. 
    Blue Cross sets a standard as to what the reimbursement will be on a Blue Cross plan. 
    The doctor accepts it or rejects it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3810.658" stopTime="3812.580">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Individually, but he doesn't get together with others and--
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3812.580" stopTime="3835.571">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Exactly. 
    The same thing happens here, Your Honor. 
    What happens here is, the medical foundation offers the doctor the opportunity to either individually accept or reject membership in the foundation, and there is evidence in the record of many doctors who feel that the maximum reimbursements are too low, and they reject it. 
    Nobody is forced to join the foundation.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3835.571" stopTime="3842.069">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --Who are the trustees or members of the foundation?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3842.069" stopTime="3900.873">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    The trustees are members of the medical profession elected by the membership. 
    Now, we have cited in our brief a study performed by Mr. William Link which was published in the Journal of Law and Economics, and the important point of that study is that the empirical evidence and the theory behind it demonstrates that when members of the medical profession perform this function of proposing a maximum reimbursement level, empirically, the result is that you get a lower level, and you get more doctors agreeing to accept it as payment in full. 
    That is the evidence that we would put in at trial to demonstrate that this is a pro-competitive cost containment device, and that there is no effect on the fee that the patient pays. 
    There is an effect in that the cost of the insurance that he buys may be lower, and that is good.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3900.873" stopTime="3911.385">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Are there different insurance companies competing for the business of the foundation, or is it a self-insurer?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3911.385" stopTime="3930.798">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    No, any insurance company can offer a foundation endorsed plan. 
    All they have to do is agree to the minimum standards of the foundation, and if they agree that the plan will meet those minimum standards, it becomes a foundation endorsed plan. 
    You can have two insurers competing for the same business with the foundation with different--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3930.798" stopTime="3931.673">

    No.

speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3935.531" stopTime="3939.890">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    No, there is no limit on what the insurer charges for the insurance.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3939.890" stopTime="3947.762">
    Unknown Speaker 
    No, I don't mean that. 
    Don't all the insurance companies who sponsor foundation plans agree that they will reimburse doctors at the same rate?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3947.762" stopTime="3978.310">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    That is right. 
    The rate which has been proposed by the medical foundation. 
    But the important thing to remember is that the insurer does not have to accept that proposal. 
    If the insurer can do better on its own, if the insurer can negotiate with doctors a lower reimbursement rate, there is nothing to stop it from doing that. 
    What I am suggesting to you is that as a empirical matter, which we can prove at trial, if given the opportunity, they are not going to get in the marketplace a better deal than they will get with the medical foundation.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3978.310" stopTime="3993.257">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Doesn't that all boil down to the question that... the question that is presented is whether it is unlawful for a group that is not shown to be a monopoly to agree among themselves on maximum prices, and would it be a defense for them to show that those prices are lower than the free market?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="3993.257" stopTime="4004.285">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    No, that is not what it is at all, because they haven't agreed on a price. 
    They have agreed on a proposal that anybody can accept or reject, and if it is rejected, it is not the price. 
    The price is what they would ordinarily charge.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4004.285" stopTime="4005.096">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes, but the record shows that it has not been rejected, it has been accepted.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4005.096" stopTime="4012.750">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    No, it has been rejected, because only 7 percent of the people in Maricopa County are insured under this. 
    The other 93 have rejected it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4012.750" stopTime="4017.717">

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    No, no, that number just has nothing to do with what we are talking about here. 
    The number that is important is that for the people who have been insured, the foundation can show for Maricopa County a saving of $8 million compared to what the medical fees would have been.

    Savings, and that means that what are the aggregate amounts of money paid, then, if that is the savings between what it would be under this program as against some other program?

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    There is nothing in--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4066.931" stopTime="4067.837">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It must be several million dollars.

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --There are undoubtedly millions of dollars paid out through this mechanism. 
    No doubt about it. 
    Now, what we are saying is that this mechanism reduces that cost without--

    Unknown Speaker 
    Is that just 7 percent of the market then?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4079.957" stopTime="4090.858">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --without doing anything to demonstrably affect the price that a patient is being billed by his physician. 
    If the patient doesn't use the foundation, there is no effect from the foundation.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4090.858" stopTime="4092.608">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Is it your contention... let me just--
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4092.608" stopTime="4093.373">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Yes.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4093.373" stopTime="4111.085">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --Is it your contention that even if the record convinces us that there is an agreement here to impose a maximum level on charges by doctors to insurance companies and patients, that that is not unlawful unless it is further shown that in a free market the rates would be higher? 
    Is that your position?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4111.085" stopTime="4113.413">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    The rates would be different, no higher.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4113.413" stopTime="4114.474">
    Unknown Speaker 
    All right, that they would be different.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4114.474" stopTime="4142.370">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Right, and we are talking about the rate that the doctor charges the patient, because that is the marketplace which the Petitioner is claiming a monopoly or price fixing in. 
    The only effect on price is the cost to the insurer. 
    That is the effect of the medical foundation. 
    Petitioner complains that this is price fixing on what the patient is charged. 
    There is no evidence of that. 
    And there is no evidence that it fixes the price that the insurer must pay.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4142.370" stopTime="4148.601">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But you say the very purpose of the whole arrangement is to keep insurance costs down, so the purpose of it is to minimize the insurance costs for the patients.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4148.601" stopTime="4151.023">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Tha is right, and let me explain why--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4151.023" stopTime="4153.631">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I assume you think it will work, if you are doing it.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4153.631" stopTime="4155.862">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --That's right, and it does work to the extent that some--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4155.862" stopTime="4163.001">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But you say it is good for the market because it provides cheaper medical care and cheaper insurance, but I don't think you are saying it is a totally useless gesture, or why bother with it?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4163.001" stopTime="4166.094">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --No, it is a very useful thing to do, and the reason--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4166.094" stopTime="4167.233">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Because it keeps costs down.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4167.233" stopTime="4195.473">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --And also because it enables the patient to get a product he couldn't get otherwise, because the only way you can get the type of insurance that will cover the entire cost of medical care and not have the patient pay the difference between a maximum and what the billing is is to have some type of operation such as this. 
    Somebody has got to get doctors to agree to accept the maximum paid by the insurance as payment in full.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4195.473" stopTime="4207.749">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Berelson, let me put it to you directly. 
    Do you contend that the arrangement that you have described has any impact on the costs, on anybody's charges for anything?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4207.749" stopTime="4209.248">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Yes, it reduces the costs--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4209.248" stopTime="4210.248">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It keeps prices down, doesn't it?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4210.248" stopTime="4212.450">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --the costs of insurance--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4212.450" stopTime="4214.870">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It keeps the prices lower than they would be under a free market.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4214.870" stopTime="4219.354">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --There is a free market. 
    It is an alternative in that free market that--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4219.354" stopTime="4221.556">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, it keeps them lower than if you didn't have this arrangement.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4221.556" stopTime="4234.020">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --That's right, because the arrangement gives you something different than the individual doctors could offer, and in that way it is like, the Broadcast Music case, because what you have is something that--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4234.020" stopTime="4238.844">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It seems, to me your position boils down to the contention, and maybe you are right... I am just trying to think it through--
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4238.844" stopTime="4239.157">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --Yes.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4239.157" stopTime="4244.202">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --that an agreement to maintain prices is permissible, if it will keep prices down.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4244.202" stopTime="4287.981">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    No, because there is no agreement that is maintaining prices. 
    We are giving people an option. 
    There is a proposal that is out there. 
    If they accept it, the cost to the insurer is lower. 
    If they don't accept it, maybe the insurer can do better on its own. 
    The record is silent on that. 
    We have to explore that. 
    I am suggesting that authorities, secondary authorities that we can look at and which, even though they are not in the record, support our contention, that we can prove this at trial. 
    It is the conflict between the doctor's goals, the insurer's goals, and the patient's goals that inflict a market force on medical foundations and prevent them from fixing a price at whatever they want.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4287.981" stopTime="4293.026">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Isn't it true that the patient can go to any doctor he wants to in the county?

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Absolutely.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4293.823" stopTime="4301.383">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And if he goes to a non-member, he is taking the risk that he will be charged whatever the doctor wants to charge him.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4301.383" stopTime="4302.289">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    That is right.

    Unknown Speaker 
    And how many, what percentage of the patients do you say are covered by--
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4308.755" stopTime="4313.300">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    About 7 percent of the people in the county--

    Unknown Speaker 
    How many of them go to doctors that are members? 
    Or do you know?

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    I don't think we can tell from the record we have now.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4326.418" stopTime="4333.823">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I take it that the insurance... that an awful lot of doctors... a lot of patients are going to non-member doctors.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4333.823" stopTime="4336.962">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Yes, yes. 
    I would think so.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4336.962" stopTime="4338.056">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And the insurance company seems to get along all right.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4338.056" stopTime="4340.773">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Sure, because the way the foundation--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4340.773" stopTime="4348.427">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Because they just announce... the insurance company just has a... it just says there is a maximum that I will reimburse for, that's all.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4348.427" stopTime="4365.044">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --That's right, and the patient gets the same amount paid to the doctor whether the doctor is a foundation member or not. 
    There is no evidence of any effect that would coerce doctors to join the foundation, coerce patients to use foundation doctors, coerce insurers to use foundation insurance.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4365.044" stopTime="4384.037">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Without any foundation at all, why couldn't the insurance companies sell policies and say, here is our schedule, we will reimburse up to a certain amount for these procedures. 
    If your doctor happens to charge you any more, that is too bad.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4384.037" stopTime="4385.864">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    That is exactly what happens, Your Honor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4385.864" stopTime="4386.426">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4386.426" stopTime="4407.870">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    The difference in that situation is, the patient never knows in advance whether what the insurance pays will cover what the doctor bills. 
    If he is a member of a foundation plan, and if the doctor is a foundation doctor, then he knows in advance that whatever it costs, the foundation insurance will pay the entire bill, and he doesn't have to worry about the difference.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4407.870" stopTime="4421.288">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, I don't see why this arrangement has anything to do with insurance rates. 
    It has got to do with whether patients have some limit to their medical bills.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4421.288" stopTime="4453.650">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    That is the benefit from the point of view of the patient, and that is why doctors who are engaged in independent practices have an incentive to join a medical foundation, because this enables them to offer something to the patient which looks to the patient like an HMO. 
    An HMO does the same thing in the sense that for a fixed amount of money paid for HMO, you get all the medical care that you need. 
    A doctor in private practice couldn't do that by himself.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4453.650" stopTime="4466.488">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Is there any... I asked before, but I take it that it is correct that there is nothing in the record to indicate what the position of the non-member doctors in the community is with respect to this arrangement.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4466.488" stopTime="4467.394">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    The only evidence--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4467.394" stopTime="4469.565">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It must be that they haven't joined, they don't like it.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4469.565" stopTime="4493.742">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --Yes, there is evidence. 
    One of the affidavits points out that a number of doctors have refused to join because they feel that the maximum reimbursements are so low that they are unfair and they just can't accept them. 
    That is the only evidence that I am aware of in the record with respect to non-members. 
    We have urged that there is no showing that people are coerced to do this. 
    People are free to do it or not, and therefore, the market forces come into play.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4493.742" stopTime="4506.441">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, none of them have claimed that what this really is is a conspiracy among the member doctors to run them out of business by setting rates, setting low rates and getting all the patients there are in town?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4506.441" stopTime="4515.000">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Well, that is a concept that was introduced in the reply brief by the Petitioner, but it just doesn't make any sense from the economic--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4515.000" stopTime="4516.796">
    Unknown Speaker 
    There is nothing in the record about it, is there?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4516.796" stopTime="4531.666">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --That's right. 
    Nothing in the record. 
    You have to go back and get evidence in order to see whether that had anything to it or not. 
    What we are saying is that this foundation is structured so that market forces do come into play.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4531.666" stopTime="4549.797">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, it is real strange that you say that it is perfectly obvious that this whole thing saves money, when one of the large patients, so-called, the state of Arizona, says, it doesn't save us any money at all; as a matter of fact, it costs us money. 
    Apparently that is what they are saying.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4549.797" stopTime="4553.312">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    No, I don't believe that is what they are saying, and we show--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4553.312" stopTime="4556.357">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, why are they objecting, if you are saving them a lot of money?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4556.357" stopTime="4559.684">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --That is what I would like to know, Your Honor. 
    It doesn't make any sense.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4559.684" stopTime="4570.602">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Isn't the reason, one of the reasons for their objection the feeling that if your organization were not in business, more HMOs would be in business?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4570.602" stopTime="4580.505">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    If that is their position, there is nothing in the record to support it, and it is not the basis for summary judgment. 
    Yes, that may well be what they ultimately intend to show.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4580.505" stopTime="4583.536">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, they certainly are... the state pays out a lot of money for insurance.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4583.536" stopTime="4584.348">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Yes. 
    We--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4584.348" stopTime="4588.549">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So they don't think that you are bringing them any Christmas present.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4588.549" stopTime="4667.033">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --Well, but the record does show that when the fostered chosen care plan for Arizona went from the Maricopa Foundation reimbursement schedule to a different one, the state paid more money for the same medical services. 
    Why did they do that? 
    I submit it makes no sense at all. 
    They did it because they thought that what Maricopa Foundation was doing was not legal, and therefore they didn't want to participate in it. 
    But what we would like is an opportunity to show that it is legal, it saves costs of insurance, it lowers insurance costs. 
    The market forces control what the maximum reimbursement rates can be. 
    If the rates get too high, insurers will not write Maricopa Foundation or any medical foundation insurance. 
    They will set their own reimbursement levels that are lower. 
    If the rates are too low, the doctors just won't renew their membership in the foundation. 
    Unless you have broad coverage, a large number of doctors participating, you don't get the attraction of a lot of physicians who will accept payment as payment in full. 
    So, that will cause the rates to go up. 
    You hit an equilibrium which according to the Link study is going to be in the neighborhood of the average or median charge in the community.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4667.033" stopTime="4668.892">

    Is there a state antitrust law?

    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Yes, there is. 
    As a matter of fact, this action arose out of an investigation that was supposedly under the state antitrust law. 
    They took depositions. 
    They had a CRD type procedure.

    There is a pendent state claim.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4684.041" stopTime="4685.994">
    Unknown Speaker 
    There is a pendent state claim.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4685.994" stopTime="4881.165">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    In the federal action, which was not the basis for the summary judgment motion which you have before you today, but it is there. 
    The state law is the Uniform State Antitrust Law, which is very similar to the Sherman Act. 
    Indeed, it says that you look at the Sherman Act precedents. 
    In the opposition to the summary judgment motion, the medical foundations have argued that the maximum reimbursement levels are essential to the concept and operation of medical foundation endorsed insurance. 
    W should be given an opportunity to produce the evidence and present it at a hearing to determine that. 
    The situation is very similar to the type of activity that the Court sanctioned in the Broadcast Music case. 
    You have the creation of a new product, different from what any individual doctor could offer by himself. 
    What happens is, you get full coverage insurance, which pays medical costs in full, and a peer review to avoid unnecessary procedures. 
    The medical foundation does put the doctor at risk, and the evidence of that is in the appendix at Page 309. 
    The doctor is not compensated for any additional complexity or difficulty in treatment. 
    If he would charge more than the maximum reimbursement level because of complexity or difficulty, it is too bad, if he is dealing with a Maricopa Foundation patient and he is a Maricopa Foundation member. 
    He has to write it off. 
    If he performs a treatment which he in good faith believes is medically necessary, and peer review of the medical foundation disagrees with him, he is at risk for that. 
    He has to write it off and accept their judgment. 
    If the costs of medical services that he must buy, if his costs of supplies and help go up because of inflation, he can't increase what he receives on the Maricopa Foundation patients. 
    He is locked in for a year by his membership. 
    And at the end of the year, he may decide not to renew, but at least for that one year he is at risk for the costs and the inflation factor. 
    The medical foundation reduces the transaction costs. 
    It enormously simplifies the negotiations between insurers and physicians. 
    It limits the complexity of establishing understandable maximum reimbursement levels which can be administratively handled in payments. 
    It lowers the cost and complexity of claim processing, and one of the functions that the medical foundations perform is the claims processing function for the insurers if the insurer desires them to do that. 
    All of these things make a medical foundation the same type of pro-competitive activity that the Court sanctioned in the Broadcast Music case. 
    It doesn't affect the prices that the individual doctors charge individually. 
    It only affects the prices that somebody can agree to accept by agreeing to Maricopa Foundation or Pima Foundation endorsed coverage.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4881.165" stopTime="4897.408">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Where in the record do we find this information that has been alluded to about the comparison between the increase in costs under this plan and national inflation figures and national medical fees?

    And you can see that the rate of increase and the average annual change is less than any of the other numbers there which are there for purposes of comparison, the National Index for Medical Care, the Consumer Price Index for Physician Services, the Metropolitan Phoenix Medical Care Index. 
    Whether or not the same result could be accomplished in a less restrictive way is something that is in dispute, obviously, listening to Petitioner's argument and Respondents', and that in itself shows that this is not a case that is ripe for summary judgment at this time. 
    We need to know more. 
    We need to know enough about the industry in which this happened.

    Unknown Speaker 
    I must confess, I am puzzled about why we need to know more. 
    I can understand your argument that it is not necessarily unlawful. 
    But can't we assume that you are going to prove that you have kept prices down, or kept the rates down, and that you have done a wonderful job for the people of the city, and there are still the same legal issues there?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="4988.373" stopTime="5001.477">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Well, the legal issue is whether you are going to characterize that as price fixing, and what I am suggesting to you is that the evidence that is in this record does not enable you to make that characterization.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5001.477" stopTime="5010.582">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I don't see how a showing that the prices are lower than they would have been if they followed the general trend in the economy has any bearing on whether it is price fixing or not.

    I understand all that, but I just don't understand how any of the things you have described are relevant to the legal issue.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5028.857" stopTime="5033.230">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    They are relevant because they show that--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5033.230" stopTime="5046.819">
    Unknown Speaker 
    We have to decide, A, is this a price fixing agreement, and B, if it is, it is obviously maximum rather than minimum, although I know there is an argument to the contrary, but I think you are definitely right on that, and if it is a maximum price fixing agreement, is it unlawful.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5046.819" stopTime="5055.645">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --Well, you have to look at it in the same way that the Court analyzed the Broadcast Music agreement. 
    Are you creating something that is different? 
    In Broadcast Music--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5055.645" stopTime="5058.050">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You are arguing that you are creating something different.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5058.050" stopTime="5058.316">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --That's right.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5058.316" stopTime="5060.439">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You say it is good, because it keeps prices down.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5060.439" stopTime="5065.844">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    No, we are saying it is good because it offers a different product than the individual doctors offer.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5065.844" stopTime="5069.950">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, the doctors don't perform different operations under this plan than if there were a free market. 
    You don't really contend that.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5069.950" stopTime="5070.730">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Yes, but they--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5070.730" stopTime="5072.152">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You hope they don't, anyway.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5072.152" stopTime="5076.916">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --They agree that they will not have the patient at risk for the difference--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5076.916" stopTime="5077.400">
    Unknown Speaker 
    They won't charge any more than the schedule.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5077.400" stopTime="5110.278">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --between what his insurance i and what the bill is. 
    It is a very important difference if you happen to be a patient and you don't have that type of insurance coverage, and it is the same sort of thing that you have in Broadcast Music, because you also have the alternative, and there is nothing in the record to contradict that everybody has the alternative of doing it individually, unilaterally, and that the pricing of that transaction is not affected in any way by the operation of this particular entity which is giving you a new type service, a new type of product, and that is the important--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5110.278" stopTime="5121.320">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Your heavy reliance on Broadcast Music makes me wonder if you are in effect acknowledging that the fact that it is doctors in the medical profession doesn't really have much bearing on the issue.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5121.320" stopTime="5137.783">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    --The fact that it is doctors in the medical profession suggests that we have to know more in order to see whether doctors in the medical profession should be treated like people who sell iron pipe or people who sell gasoline. 
    I suggest that you don't treat them the same because the considerations are different.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5137.783" stopTime="5137.970">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Or people who sell music.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5137.970" stopTime="5138.345">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Excuse me?
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5138.345" stopTime="5139.501">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Or people who sell music.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5139.501" stopTime="5193.275">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Or people who sell music. 
    The considerations are different. 
    The Court has recognized that the considerations can be different. 
    We have to have a full record to see whether in fact they are different, and until you know that, you can't condemn this, or you shouldn't condemn this. 
    Furthermore, it would be unfair to have summary judgment granted before the Respondents have had an opportunity to put in the record the evidence that they claim shows pro-competitive aspects and the lack of affect on price of this particular conduct. 
    We haven't had that opportunity. 
    I have alluded to the pro-complaint discovery that the Petitioners had. 
    Because of the way this case came through procedurally, we just haven't had discovery on who is in the market, how they price, whether there is any effect all on their prices.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5193.275" stopTime="5206.223">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, the most, if I hear you, that you could really insist on is that we ought to have a mini-trial first to see whether the rule of reason applies, or whether it is per se.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5206.223" stopTime="5212.174">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    It would be something like what happened in the Society of Professional Engineers case, in which you developed a full record.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5212.174" stopTime="5218.172">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But you wouldn't necessarily have an entire antitrust trial on the assumption that the rule of reason was going to apply.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5218.172" stopTime="5227.622">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    It would depend upon whether the judge thought that would be the most expeditious way. 
    He could have the full trial and then during the course of the trial make that determination.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5227.622" stopTime="5242.474">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But you wouldn't be entitled to it. 
    Under the argument you are now making, you should have no more than a chance to put whatever evidence in that might be useful in deciding whether this is per se illegal price fixing.
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5242.474" stopTime="5254.079">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    Yes, and unless the Petitioner was able to put in undisputed facts to show that it was per se, then they cannot prevail on a per se theory and you do have to have that trial.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="5254.079" stopTime="5265.981">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Do you think that a district judge has discretion in the timing of his decision as to whether to grant or deny a motion for partial summary judgment?
speaker="philip_p_berelson" startTime="5265.981" stopTime="5306.292">
    Mr. Philip P. Berelson 
    I think a district judge does, but that the discretion has to take into account the experience and the theory and whether the precedents which deal with per se liability on price fixing are applicable and appropriate in this particular type of marketplace on the particular facts that are set forth. 
    In this case, the district court, if he has discretion, exercised it wisely, we believe, and we are just asking you to uphold that and to allow the proceedings to go back to their normal course, have discovery, and have a determination after appropriate discovery and after a full record. 
    Thank you.
