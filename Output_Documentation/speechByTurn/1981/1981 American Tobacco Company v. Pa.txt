    Justice Byron R. White 
    Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employment practices are illegal if they are purposely discriminatory or if they have that effect. 
    Section 703(h) of the Act however says that an employer may treat their employees differently pursuant to a seniority system if that system -- what was -- is not -- it was -- if -- provided that system is not racially discriminatory intentionally. 
    A seniority system that just has a racially discriminatory effect is not illegal under the Act. 
    The Court of Appeals in this case held that Section 703(h) protected only those seniority systems that were adopted prior to the date the Civil Rights Act that was passed. 
    We reverse that judgment. 
    We hold that 703(h) applies to all seniority systems whether they were adopted before or after the date of the passage of the Act. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion and he is joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun. 
    And Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
