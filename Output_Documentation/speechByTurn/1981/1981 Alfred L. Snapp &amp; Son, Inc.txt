    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has standing as parens patriae to sue 32 individual apple growers from the Commonwealth of Virginia for allegedly breaching the employment contracts and allegedly violating the federal statutory and regulatory rights of a small number of Puerto Rican workers during the 1978 apple harvest. 
    I am going to get into these points in more detail later, but we think there are three major reasons why the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico lacks parens patriae standing in this case. 
    First, the injuries alleged did not affect the general population of Puerto Rico in a substantial way. 
    Secondly, we believe that Puerto Rico in affect is attempting to litigate the personal claims of a small group of its citizens. 
    Thirdly, we believe that the Puerto Rican workers allegedly aggrieved have adequate remedies and have clearly demonstrated their ability to litigate the issues themselves.

    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Your Honor, there have been cases where they have brought purported class actions, and we have opposed those... the class certification in those cases. 
    We just do not believe that those cases satisfy the Rule 23 requirements for class action. 
    It is that simple. 
    For the very same reason--

    Okay.

    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    The court in New York in the case of Rios v. Donovan, which was originally styled Rios v. Marshall, has not yet made a ruling on whether to certify the class. 
    We have opposed it, and we strenuously oppose it because we don't think it is class action material. 
    Basically, you have a number of individual workers who have claims against individual growers. 
    A particular Puerto Rican worker, if he accepted a job offer, accepted the job offer of one grower. 
    If he was discriminated against, he was discriminated against by that one grower. 
    He does not have a grievance against any other growers, and yet what they have attempted to do in this case and what they have attempted, the individual Puerto Ricans have attempted to do in these purported class actions is to lump together into one case something which really shouldn't be brought as one case. 
    The facts in the case, in this case are relatively simple. 
    Since the case was decided on the basis of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b), we must accept as true all the material allegations of fact in the complaint. 
    The facts are basically these. 
    There are 32 Virginia apple growers who were sued in the district court and are Petitioners in this Court. 
    Each Virginia grower in the spring of 1978... I think the complaint says April 28th, 1978... filed individual applications to the United States Department of Labor for permission to bring in temporary foreign workers under the H2 program. 
    The H2 program was created pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, and it provides for the admission of temporary foreign workers into this country when not enough qualified U.S. workers are available. 
    There are very detailed procedures set out in the regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor at 20 CFR Part 655. 
    The H2 program is administered jointly by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Department of Labor. 
    The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its Department of Labor plays only a very peripheral role in the administration of this program, and its role is severely circumscribed by these regulations. 
    For reasons that are set forth in greater detail in the brief, the clearance order or the job offers of these individual Virginia growers, even though they were filed as early as April of 1978, were not sent to Puerto Rico until early August of 1978. 
    This was less than two weeks before the growers were due to be certified as to their needs to bring in temporary foreign workers. 
    This... The resulting last minute recruitment by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico allegedly produced names of enough Puerto Rican workers to fill all the jobs of all the 32 Virginia growers, a total of 787 jobs for all 32 growers. 
    However, only... when the apple harvest arrived, only 420 of the Puerto Ricans actually arrived in the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
    The remainder never left the Commonwealth. 
    The United States Department of Labor in effect ordered the cancellation of the remaining flights, allegedly because 
    "Certain growers had refused to employ individuals referred by Puerto Rico. " 
    Of the 420 Puerto Ricans who did arrive at the orchards, allegedly fewer than 30 had employment three weeks later.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="377.528" stopTime="394.489">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Bacas, I gather, at least by statute, Puerto Rico has put a special burden on the Puerto Rican Commissioner of Labor to protect the rights of Puerto Ricans participating in this program, has it not?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="394.489" stopTime="397.774">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    They do under Public Law 87.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="397.774" stopTime="400.976">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And that is a rather broad responsibility, isn't it?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="400.976" stopTime="403.345">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    I would say it is, Your Honor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="403.345" stopTime="418.172">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So, do you think that the Commonwealth... I guess it is commonwealth law, not state, isn't it? 
    that commonwealth law has any role to play in deciding a parens patriae issue?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="418.172" stopTime="419.122">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Absolutely none, Your Honor.

    Unknown Speaker 
    None. 
    Why not?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="419.957" stopTime="424.426">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    The concept of standing is a federal constitutional concept--

    Is parens patriae--
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="425.009" stopTime="444.755">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --even parens patriae standing. 
    Well, they... in fact, they rely on it in a very limited sense. 
    They say that, well, the Department of Labor of Puerto Rico is the proper party to bring this parens patriae action as a result of Public Law 87 if parens patriae action is permitted to be brought, so that law is--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="444.755" stopTime="449.643">
    Unknown Speaker

    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Where do I get that? 
    Article III limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases and controversies, and the courts have generally, as I will discuss in greater detail in my argument--

    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --Yes.

    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Which case is that, Your Honor?
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="479.845" stopTime="489.968">
    Unknown Speaker 
    The name eludes me at the moment, but it is discussed in some of the briefs. 
    All I can remember about it is, it was written by Mr. Justice Marshal.
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="489.968" stopTime="496.072">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Are you talking about Hawaii, Your Honor? 
    Are you talking about Hawaii v. Standard Oil?
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="496.072" stopTime="497.557">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes. 
    That's the one.
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="497.557" stopTime="524.624">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    The Hawaii v. Standard Oil, there was extensive discussion of parens patriae standing in that case, which was, incidentally, brought in the district court. 
    It was not an original action in this Court. 
    The... I think Justice Marshal... he may correct me, but I believe he made the reference that parens patriae... the case did not ultimately turn on the question of parens patriae standing, but there was an extensive discussion--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="524.624" stopTime="532.397">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It was on antitrust, wasn't it? 
    Wasn't it on antitrust, and parens patriae was just a little narrow slice of it?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="532.397" stopTime="548.573">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --Yes. 
    It did, but the ultimate issue in Hawaii really turned on the question of damages under the antitrust laws, and whether a state was entitled to bring, in effect, a treble damage claim under the antitrust law, and the Court held it did not.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="548.573" stopTime="581.978">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, what concerns me, and the reason I asked you the question, if a state, and let's for this purpose treat Puerto Rico as a state, and it's a sovereign state, and adopts a rather, as it has here, a system for implementing the federal statute, why can't we defer to the state's view of its policy and sovereignty interest instead of substituting our own? 
    Are you going to suggest we can't because there is an Article III limitation?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="581.978" stopTime="582.896">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="582.896" stopTime="585.182">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Where do you get that? 
    I still don't understand that.
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="585.182" stopTime="609.980">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Article III limits the jurisdiction of courts to cases and controversies, and we don't believe that there is a case and controversy between the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and these individual growers. 
    There might be a case and controversy between the individual Puerto Rican workers who allegedly were... applied for these jobs and allegedly were discriminated against, or were denied employment.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="609.980" stopTime="625.840">
    Unknown Speaker 
    In other words, are you saying that an individual Puerto Rican who got drawn into this and came up here and sat idle and didn't get a job or some other comparable complaint could sue that particular apple grower?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="625.840" stopTime="639.416">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Certainly. 
    There is no question about that, Your Honor. 
    We have never contested the jurisdiction of the courts to hear a claim of a particular worker, whether it be Puerto Rican or from some other state, to sue a particular grower.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="639.416" stopTime="679.141">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Of course, we have had original cases in which we have thought that we ought not allow a state suing another state to invoke our original jurisdiction if all it is doing is fronting for some private interest in the state, but that is a matter of protecting our original jurisdiction, but I still wonder why in the district courts a state isn't, in the context of this kind of case, with this kind of implementation, why a sovereign state ought not be welcome in a federal district court to represent the citizens--
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="679.141" stopTime="679.441">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Your Honor, I--

    --to protect their federal rights as the federal government has set them up. 
    Why not?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="683.045" stopTime="698.538">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --Your Honor, you are right that most of the cases, especially the cases in this Court, have involved the question of the original jurisdiction of this Court, and I think the Court has, justifiably so, been very protective of that, to limit cases which truly merit the--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="698.538" stopTime="704.092">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I know, but those reasons are... those considerations don't apply to a suit in the federal district court.
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="704.092" stopTime="728.808">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --They don't, Your Honor, but this Court has never so limited the... in stating the test for parens patriae standing, this Court has never so discriminated between those cases of parens patriae brought as original cases in this Court and those cases brought in the district court. 
    For example, Justice Marshal's discussion in Hawaii v. Standard Oil, that was not an original... case of original jurisdiction.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="728.807" stopTime="735.311">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Of course, we allow private organizations to bring lawsuits in the federal district courts on behalf of their members, don't we?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="735.311" stopTime="737.246">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="737.246" stopTime="745.852">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, then, why can't we allow states, sovereign states to bring proceedings on behalf of their citizens in district court?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="745.852" stopTime="761.543">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    There are a couple of reasons, Your Honor. 
    One is, the state is presuming here to speak for all of its workers. 
    We don't know whether all of those workers actually even have complaints. 
    That is one reason why we limit cases generally to those people who are actually aggrieved.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="761.543" stopTime="775.952">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, apparently the Puerto Rican legislature thought there were a number of Puerto Rican citizens who had interests under this federal setup to be protected and imposed the burden on the Commissioner of Labor--
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="775.952" stopTime="777.154">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="777.154" stopTime="778.704">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --to take the necessary steps to protect them.
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="778.704" stopTime="811.126">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    The legislature of Puerto Rico did enact Public Law 87, and that Public Law 87 has been in effect overruled by the First Circuit in the case of Hernandez Flecha v. Quiros. 
    In effect, they said, it is not the function or the role of the legislature of Puerto Rico to dictate the requirements of the job orders that are sent through this federal system. 
    That is up to the United States Department of Labor to determine those requirements, which it does under those extensive regulations that I have referred to at--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="811.126" stopTime="824.618">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But I thought this lawsuit by Puerto Rico was for the purpose of enforcing these rights of Puerto Rican citizens consistently with the regulations and federal rules of the Department of Labor, aren't they?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="824.618" stopTime="885.340">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --The suit does purport to do that, Your Honor. 
    However, I would suggest that there is a procedure set forth in the regulations which the Commonwealth is purporting to enforce. 
    These regulations specify a procedure. 
    When an employee has a complaint against a grower, he can file a grievance with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 
    Under those regulations, a worker from Puerto Rico who works in Virginia and goes back to Puerto Rico believing he has a grievance can file a complaint with the Department of Labor of Puerto Rico. 
    Under the regulations, the Department of Labor of Puerto Rico must refer that complaint to the state agency in the state where the work was performed. 
    That state agency investigates, gives a hearing if necessary, and there is even a right of appeal. 
    If the worker... the determination is not to the worker's liking, he can appeal that to the regional administrator, where the same process works again, even the provision of a full hearing.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="885.340" stopTime="890.661">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, why can't all that operate and yet allow Puerto Rico to maintain this suit?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="890.661" stopTime="912.926">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    In effect, you would be having a complete duplication of litigation. 
    The mere fact that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is bringing this lawsuit has certainly not stopped the workers from bringing their own lawsuits or even filing their own complaints with the employment service system. 
    If what you want to do is create a situation where everybody is suing everybody on the same issue--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="912.926" stopTime="918.561">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Incidentally, all we have got in the way of remedy involved here is injunctive relief, isn't it?

    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --I'm sorry, Your Honor?

    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    They are seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Or is it different from that?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="938.307" stopTime="947.913">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --It is not quite that, because the workers themselves are really not the plaintiffs here.

    Unknown Speaker

speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="950.715" stopTime="973.981">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Yes. 
    I would say that it is in part a corollary of that rule, that in effect what they should have said to their workers, look, there is a complaint system that is set up. 
    If you have a grievance, file your complaint and we will assist you. 
    In fact, the regulations actually say that the state agency should assist the worker in pursuing its claim.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="973.981" stopTime="984.855">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But if that is all there is to it, then that would be on the assumption that even if there is standing in the sense of case or controversy, that federal courts should refrain from exercising its jurisdiction.
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="984.855" stopTime="992.542">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    I don't concede that there is jurisdiction, for the reason that--

    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, I know that, but assume we didn't agree with you about case or controversy, that there was jurisdiction, case or controversy.

    --Yes.

    Oh, yes.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1008.638" stopTime="1025.765">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Certainly it is not the ordinary exhaustion doctrine that you are talking about, I take it, since that is ordinarily raised by the state or saying you should have tried your state remedies first. 
    Here, the state is saying, in effect, you don't have to use your administrative remedies. 
    I mean, in fact, we will sue on your behalf.
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1025.765" stopTime="1062.288">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Well, I think we would have that right to raise that, too, Your Honor, not just the state has the right to raise that argument. 
    I think we... you know, we are the targets... we are the targets of these complaints, and if there is a procedure, an administrative procedure set forth, especially with a party which is a member of this employment service system. 
    You know, they receive funding from the United States Department of Labor to participate in this system, and it seems to me that they must have some obligation to follow the regulations which administer this system and regulate the system.

    For purposes of this case, counsel, are the workers in Puerto Rico or the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico any different from the State of Michigan with respect to all the automobile workers of Detroit, for example? 
    Is there anything special about the commonwealth status that gives it a special parens patriae status?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1095.010" stopTime="1096.211">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    I would say no, Your Honor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1096.211" stopTime="1097.345">
    Unknown Speaker 
    In other words--
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1097.345" stopTime="1105.567">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    There is no difference. 
    In effect, the Puerto Rican workers are considered U.S. workers for purposes of the law--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1105.567" stopTime="1116.775">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --So for these purposes, this case would have to be decided, would you say, on the same basis as though the State of Michigan brought a suit against a lot of people on behalf of the automobile workers?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1116.775" stopTime="1170.410">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --It seems to me the same principle would apply. 
    The same principle would apply whether we are talking about Puerto Rico or the State of Michigan or the State of Texas or the State of Florida. 
    States which... the southern states are most of the labor supply states in this program. 
    That is where most of the farm labor comes from. 
    So it seems to me that if you are going to grant parens patriae standing to the Commonwealth, which I don't think you should, I am not sure how you distinguish the commonwealth situation from the State of Texas or the State of Florida. 
    As a matter of fact, there have been a couple of amicus curiae briefs filed by the State of New York and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, so there is obviously... there are some states out there who are anxious to pursue their rights and bring lawsuits if the Court so permits. 
    The complaint in this case sets forth three different categories of alleged violations.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Excuse me, Mr. Bacas. 
    May I ask you one other question? 
    If we have to deny, and it is not to be denied on jurisdictional grounds and Article III grounds, then where does the federal courts' authority to deny a sovereign state parens patriae come from? 
    If it is not Article III, where is it?

    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas

    Did you read Hawaii against Standard Oil, which of course originated in the district court, as turning on Article III considerations?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1216.206" stopTime="1231.565">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Ultimately, it really, it seems to me it turned on an interpretation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and not really Article III considerations. 
    It got into a question of double recovery of damages--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1231.565" stopTime="1238.304">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But all of the parens patriae cases were cited. 
    The original jurisdiction parens patriae cases were cited--
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1238.304" stopTime="1238.521">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --Yes, they were.

    --weren't they?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1238.971" stopTime="1309.500">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Yes, they were, Your Honor, but I think Justice Marshal noted early on that even though he was going to explore the history of parens patriae, the case really did not turn on the concept of parens patriae. 
    I think Hawaii is important because of its discussion that there was reference to the answer from Justice Brennan earlier that there has never been this distinction certainly in this Court and most certainly in the lower courts, the courts of appeals, that these... the standards that apply to parens patriae apply whether we are talking about a case arising under the original jurisdiction of this Court or one that is brought in the district court, and it applies whether we are talking about damages or it applies whether we are talking about injunctive relief. 
    I would note that in Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, the State of... the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. 
    They weren't really seeking damages in that case, and yet this Court denied parens patriae standing. 
    The Court said that in effect they were trying to sue on behalf of their individual citizens claims which those citizens could bring on their own.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1309.500" stopTime="1311.686">
    Unknown Speaker

    You say--

    Unknown Speaker

speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1324.510" stopTime="1333.866">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    --What was the reason? 
    The fact that they were in effect pursuing the individual claims of their citizens which those citizens could pursue themselves.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1333.866" stopTime="1341.471">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So is that just an application of an ancient rule that the real party in interest should sue, or was it an Article III decision like you suggested earlier?
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1341.471" stopTime="1343.855">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    I would say it is both.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1343.855" stopTime="1367.187">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Then you do have a fall-back position. 
    The fall-back position is that even if the case or controversy limitation doesn't bar you, bar this action, that even more ancient principles, namely, that the party in interest, that Puerto Rico has no real interest in this case.
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1367.187" stopTime="1368.789">

    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Bacas, in analyzing this, should we consider some of the same factors that the Court considered in determining standing for a private organization such as in Havens Realty Corp. opinion decided this term?

    We have--

    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas

    The... cannot identify the state or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico necessarily with the individual citizens.

speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="1490.668" stopTime="1571.456">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    The complaint alleges three categories of violations, and I think it is important to focus on the violations that are alleged. 
    The first category is an alleged failure to provide employment to Puerto Ricans, and here, however, we have two subcategories. 
    With respect to ten growers, the alleged failure to provide employment is based on the fact that their Puerto Rican workers never left the Island of Puerto Rico as a result of the cancellation of their flights. 
    In fact, this is the only allegation in the complaint against four of the Virginia growers named in this complaint, the fact that their workers never left Puerto Rico because the United States Department of Labor cancelled their flights. 
    Eight other growers allegedly denied employment to Puerto Ricans who showed up at their orchards. 
    With respect to these eight, at least seven of them also allegedly did other things to their workers. 
    So we are not talking about a blanket refusal to employ. 
    Even in the case of the eight who allegedly refused to hire those who arrived, they actually hired other Puerto Rican workers, even if we accept the allegations of the complaint here. 
    I see that I have five minutes left, and I would like to reserve some time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Paul A. Lenzini
speaker="paul_a_lenzini" startTime="1575.591" stopTime="1617.251">
    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, this litigation is only one chapter in an attempt by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to place unemployed farm workers in jobs in the east coast apple harvest. 
    The 1978 conduct complained of is not an isolated occurrence, but part of a continuing effort by certain apple growers to discourage referral of Puerto Rican labor. 
    This is a claim for equitable relief, but much of the equity of the claim is not before the Court. 
    Money damages were not sought. 
    Because the complaint was dismissed for lack of standing, the factual allegations are to be taken as true for present purposes.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1617.251" stopTime="1625.007">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Suppose there were two residents of Puerto Rico who were advancing this claim, instead of--

    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    If this were being advanced on behalf of two Puerto Rican workers? 
    I think that parens patriae standing would not exist, if that were all.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1636.148" stopTime="1639.183">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --How about 20? 
    Where do you draw the line?
speaker="paul_a_lenzini" startTime="1639.183" stopTime="1671.821">
    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    The line is hard to draw, Your Honor, but in this particular case we have a history of three years of attempts by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to place workers, and we have had in 1978 particularly a complete frustration of a very large government effort to place workers in the east coast apple harvest. 
    If a single worker, or if two workers were fired by the growers, I do not see that we would have parens patriae standing, because I believe that it is different from--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1671.821" stopTime="1680.760">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You must have some theory. 
    What proportion of the total market or the total population, or where... there must be a line somewhere.

    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    --The harm must be serious. 
    It is very hard to draw the line, Your Honor. 
    The harm must be serious, and this is serious harm particularly because it is addressed at a group boycott in effect. 
    In Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad, the gravamen of that complaint was that the 20 railroads had conspired to prefer other ports to Georgia ports, and therefore it was an attempt, Justice Douglas held, to discriminate against the State of Georgia, and thereby to place her citizens in an inferior position vis-a-vis other states. 
    This is what we have here.

    We allege the--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1725.039" stopTime="1730.693">

    --Puerto Rican discrimination.

    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    Puerto Rican discrimination, Your Honor, because Puerto Ricans represent the only large labor pool that can compete with the alien workers. 
    Puerto Rican workers represent a threat to the use of alien workers.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Let me put it another way, and tell me if I am wrong.

    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    --I think, Your Honor, that in parens patriae actions, while it has not been really articulated, there has been a reluctance to permit the sovereign to unleash his majesty upon private litigants, and therefore as in In Re Debs, before the government is going to be permitted to come in against private parties, there must be a public wrong, and that the sovereign may not vindicate the rights of individuals, a small number of individuals.

    They have filed an amicus brief in which they have said that this case by the Commonwealth does not impair or in any way contradict the interests of the United States. 
    They agree with us that the administrative remedies are ineffective, and they do not lend themselves to be used in a situation where there is a systemic violation, an industry-wide violation by the apple growers. 
    I think that the Secretary of Labor has been given no statutory authorization to bring actions against the growers. 
    I believe that the United States, however, is in no worse position than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, because I think under 28 USC Section 1345, that the Attorney General on behalf of the United States would have the right if he chose to do so to go in to enforce an action against large-scale violations--

    The Department of Labor, as it turned out, filed a brief for the Secretary, because his was the primary responsibility for carrying out the statute, and in that brief, the question had been raised as to whether or not the Employment System... the Employment Service complaint system, which is this administrative relief provision available to the workers, whether or not that was an adequate remedy for these workers, and the answer given there was no, it is not, it does not address the type of widespread, industry-wide, systematic discrimination which was the subject of this case. 
    And more than that, the ultimate relief that could be granted would be the denial of the right of the growers to bring in aliens in the following year, and they would not be entitled to use the Employment Service System.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Right. 
    Thank you. 
    Let me try another hypothetical to see if I can understand. 
    Suppose an action is brought by the State of Georgia against all the hotel and restaurant owners in New York City, where probably there is the largest concentration of that group in the country. 
    Assume it, anyway. 
    And they allege that the minority unemployment in the State of Georgia is 25,000 people, and that they want jobs in New York in hotels and restaurants, and that those jobs are now held two-thirds by Puerto Ricans, and that there is a plan and scheme to hire Puerto Ricans for these positions in New York, and that therefore the unemployed of Georgia are being denied something. 
    Now, laying aside all the merits, does Georgia have parens patriae standing to bring that suit?
speaker="paul_a_lenzini" startTime="2386.538" stopTime="2448.011">
    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    --There is no federal right, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    In this case, we have a strong Congressional preference articulated in the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
    That preference is brought forward by the Federal Employment Service System whenever growers choose to try and get alien workers brought in. 
    The privilege to bring in alien workers is a privilege granted to few industries in this country. 
    You can name them on the fingers of one hand. 
    The apple growers is one industry that may use alien workers. 
    Now, Detroit may like to do that, and the steel mills may like to do that, but they cannot do that. 
    The apple growers can do that, and when the apple growers go out for this privilege, they take on certain duties and responsibilities, and one of the duties and responsibilities is to make available on a non-discriminatory basis jobs to U.S. citizens who show up, and I believe that that would not be the situation in your hypothetical. 
    There is a federal right here.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2448.011" stopTime="2460.486">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Isn't there a federal right in any collective minority group not to be discriminated against on the... at least on the allegations that I have hypothesized to you?
speaker="paul_a_lenzini" startTime="2460.486" stopTime="2480.499">
    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    There is a right not to be denied equal treatment, except by due process standard. 
    Gonzalez versus Freeman is a case that comes to mind. 
    But in the situation you... your hypothetical, you... I don't think that Georgia is--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2480.499" stopTime="2503.679">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Georgia's economy is being injured by reason of having to have all these alleged thousands of people on relief and unemployed, and so the state of Georgia and its taxpayers have certainly, if the allegations can be established, but the allegations certainly make an injury to the State of Florida as such, do they not?

    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    Well, we certainly have Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and we have Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and we have the right... we have federal enforcement of these, and we have private enforcement of these. 
    We usually have individual complaints. 
    In this particular case, we have an entire government program which is being defeated. 
    The Puerto Rican government is being defeated in its attempt to send workers into the east coast apple orchards. 
    They are being frustrated almost completely.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2572.889" stopTime="2577.441">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And the statutory right is to be hired before foreign workers?

    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    That is the statutory right. 
    A strong Congressional preference has been established.

    Unknown Speaker 
    But all you are saying is that these people who are discriminated against according to you have a right of action, but that doesn't give the right of action to Puerto Rico. 
    If so, the statute should have said so. 
    Is it that simple?
speaker="paul_a_lenzini" startTime="2600.890" stopTime="2620.470">
    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    No, I don't think it is quite that simple, because I don't know of any federal statute which has ever established a parens patriae right, because a parens patriae right has always depended upon the circumstances of the particular case. 
    It is a very elusive concept, and the concept is, when the injury--

    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    Well, those are the cases in the Supreme Court.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2653.191" stopTime="2666.682">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, the Supreme Court cases aren't really very consistent, are they? 
    Do you see any way of reconciling Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad with Oklahoma versus Santa Fe Railroad?
speaker="paul_a_lenzini" startTime="2666.682" stopTime="2704.457">
    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    Yes, I think so, because I think in Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad, the question was one of discrimination of a particular sector of the country. 
    Georgia was being put in an inferior position by railroads who were preferring the ports of other nearby states, and I think that was not a concept. 
    It's the discriminatory element in Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad that distinguishes it, I think, from the Atchison case, and that's what we have here, because we have here an attempt by the growers to prevent the Puerto Ricans from being a threat to their use of alien labor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2704.457" stopTime="2723.521">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, do you think that threat... do you think the action of the growers was directed against Puerto Ricans in a different sense than it would have been directed against people from Maryland or people from Michigan, or were they just anxious to use alien labor and exclude whatever citizens they might want to, or might have to?
speaker="paul_a_lenzini" startTime="2723.521" stopTime="2738.697">
    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    I think that's right. 
    We have 23 percent rural unemployment, which means we have a body of workers who are unemployed, rural laborers, and who are available as a pool to supply, to be a labor supply for agricultural pursuits.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2738.697" stopTime="2748.153">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, supposing Michigan had exactly that same situation, 23 percent unemployed. 
    Would they have any lesser a claim than Puerto Rico did?
speaker="paul_a_lenzini" startTime="2748.153" stopTime="2749.403">
    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    No, I think not. 
    I think not.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2749.403" stopTime="2756.509">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So there is nothing peculiar about the Puerto Rican labor force or the status of Puerto Ricans that gives you any special standing.
speaker="paul_a_lenzini" startTime="2756.509" stopTime="3113.608">
    Mr. Paul A. Lenzini 
    I think that's correct. 
    I think there's nothing special about Puerto Rico in this respect. 
    Public Law 87 was enacted by the Commonwealth legislature in 1962, and it set forth special obligations on the part of workers who would hire for off-Island use Puerto Rican laborers. 
    In the mid-seventies, 1975, 1976, the U.S. Department of Labor held that if the Puerto Ricans were to insist upon these extra conditions that were not available, not required under the Federal Employment Service System, then they would be held legally unavailable in terms of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
    That is to say, even though they were in fact available to work in these orchards, they would not be held to be legally available because they were asking for more burdensome conditions. 
    When this Court denied certiorari in the Flecha, Fiecha versus Quiros, the Commonwealth legislature said, we will have to act, because Public Law 87, designed to help the workers, is being used to bar the workers, and so, they said, if jobs come through the Federal Employment Service System, the Secretary of Labor is permitted, given the discretion to exempt these workers... these growers, pardon me, from the additional conditions of Public Law 87. 
    In due course, then 2,000 Puerto Rican workers were recruited to work in the 1970 apple harvest, but immediately four associations of apple growers went into court in the Western District of Virginia. 
    They had initially complained that they were subject to the terms of Public Law 87, and they now complained that they were exempted from the provisions of Public Law 87. 
    On the strength of their assurances to the district court that giving an injunction permitting all of these immigrant visas... non-immigrant visas would not in any way harm the domestic workers. 
    On the strength of that, they obtained an injunction permitting them to bring in 1,000 additional alien laborers. 
    Thereafter, there were too many workers in the orchards, and the massive firings and the failure to hire at the orchard gates ensued in the Virginia orchards. 
    Mr. Bacas, opposing counsel, says that the individuals can sue on their own. 
    There is no need for this parens patriae action. 
    He has a problem, however, because we have people who were left at the gates in Puerto Rico. 
    When the growers were not hiring these people in the orchards, the U.S. Secretary of Labor advised Secretary Quiros that he could not send up any more, he should not send up any more, and so these workers who were ready to go up to Virginia were cancelled. 
    Where is the remedy? 
    Is it breach of contract for those workers who were left at the airport? 
    Is it breach of contract for those workers who didn't come up in 1979? 
    They have no remedy. 
    There is no remedy under the employment service complaint system. 
    That is futile. 
    There is no remedy in Puerto Rico, we believe, that is a secure remedy. 
    In Maryland versus Louisiana, just last term, the question was whether or not this first use tax, 7 cents per MCF on gas coming into Louisiana, would that give rise to a parens patriae claim on the part of eight states who sued in the original jurisdiction of this Court. 
    The Court held that there was parens patriae jurisdiction. 
    It involved many people; no doubt. 
    It was 7 cents per MCF. 
    But there were claim... there were forums available in Louisiana. 
    There was a tax refund suit filed by a natural gas carrier, but the Court in a footnote held that because there was no injunction, preliminary injunction available prior to decision on the merits, that was an imperfect forum. 
    Well, we have a number of imperfect fora in this situation. 
    The administrative forum is certainly imperfect. 
    Suits by individuals either in Puerto Rico or in Virginia, a very imperfect form, given the nature of these immigrant laborers. 
    We have the class action suit up in New York involving New York growers. 
    That comes fairly close to getting the kind of thing, the kind of relief that we are seeking, except that there is no class action suit against the Virginia growers. 
    We finally have the statement of the Department of Labor that the parens patriae action of the Commonwealth does not infringe any U.S. interest. 
    It is consistent with the interests of the Department of Labor, because it is consistent with the strong policy preference. 
    If that policy preference is to be established, we can send workers up to Virginia. 
    If it is not, we cannot, and this suit, we submit, is the only effective vehicle to establish in the Western District of Virginia the strong preference of Congress that U.S. workers be preferred over aliens. 
    I submit that the decision of the Fourth Circuit along with the decision of the Second Circuit on these issues should be affirmed.

   Rebuttal of Thomas J. Bacas
speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="3116.227" stopTime="3189.425">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I just have a few points. 
    First, I would like to emphasize that both the district court and the court of appeals in this case agreed on the proper test to apply in determining parens patriae standing. 
    Both courts said, you look at the size of the segment of the population affected. 
    You look at the magnitude of the harm, and you look at the ability of those injured to rectify the alleged wrongs on their own. 
    The disagreement between the court of appeals and the district court was not on what test to apply, but how that test applied to these particular facts. 
    We agree with Justice Marshal that 787 workers, which are the only workers that are covered by this particular complaint, despite insinuations by counsel to the contrary, the only growers involved in this case are the Virginia apple growers, 32 Virginia apple growers. 
    The only Puerto Ricans involved are the 787 who allegedly accepted those jobs in 1978. 
    That 787 number constitutes 3/100ths of 1 percent of the 1970 population of Puerto Rico.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3189.425" stopTime="3197.279">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes, but it is still a pretty large labor force, isn't it?

speaker="thomas_j_bacas" startTime="3225.848" stopTime="3372.025">
    Mr. Thomas J. Bacas 
    I believe, if... there have been many parens patriae suits. 
    I believe that is probably one of the ones involving diversion of water or some other injury to the land, and also a dispute between actions in one state that have an immediate effect in another state. 
    I would submit that those are substantially different from this case, where the alleged quasi-sovereign interest turns on the harm to the general economy of the state. 
    If the parens patriae test could be satisfied in this case, it could be satisfied in virtually any case, and I don't believe the parens patriae test has been broadened that much over the years. 
    Mr. Lenzini made a reference to the fact that there are upwards of five to 7,000 jobs in which he can place Puerto Rican workers, but what he is talking about, he is talking about the entire east coast apple harvest, and I want to stress, we have states which aren't even involved in the 1978 program. 
    The complaint alleges that Puerto Rican workers were sent to only four states. 
    They were sent to Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and New York. 
    He leaves out the six New England states, which evidently received no Puerto Rican workers in 1978. 
    So when he talks about a larger number, he is not talking about this case. 
    In this case, we are talking about 787 Puerto Rican workers. 
    We are talking about 32 Virginia apple growers. 
    Obviously, a number of you have pointed out, the standing cannot turn on the unemployment rate in Puerto Rico, or in any state. 
    I would note that the unemployment figures are cited in the... Page 8 of the amicus curiae brief of the State of New York, and they show that the unemployment rate was 19.9 in 1977, the year before. 
    In 1978, it was 18.1 percent. 
    In 1979, the year after, it was 17 percent. 
    I don't know how a constitutional concept of standing can turn on such a fluctuating standard of unemployment rate. 
    The other point I want to make, the last point, is that there is no allegation of a boycott in the complaint, and there is no allegation of conspiracy in the complaint. 
    The complaint merely alleges that certain individual Puerto Ricans have individual grievances against individual growers. 
    Thank you.
