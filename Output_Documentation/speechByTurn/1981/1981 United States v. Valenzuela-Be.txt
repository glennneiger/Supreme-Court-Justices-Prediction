    We'll hear arguments first this morning in United States against Valenzuela-Bernal. 
    Mr. Phillips, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, three questions presented. 
    First, the United States violates a criminal defendant's Fifth Amendment due process or Sixth Amendment compulsory process rights when it deports an illegal alien after making a reasonable investigation in concluding that the illegal alien has no material exculpatory evidence to make available to the defendant. 
    Second, assuming that the Government acts at its peril in deporting illegal aliens while the defendant in order to state a constitutional violation still must demonstrate that the laws of the illegal alien has caused him a concrete loss of material exculpatory evidence. 
    Finally, assuming that the Court of Appeals is correct, that the -- that the respondent's constitutional rights are violated when the defendant is deprived of no more than the loss of a conceivable benefit or the proper remedy for that technical constitutional violation is dismissal of the indictment against the respondent. 
    On March 29th, 1980, respondent was captured in the process of transporting five illegal aliens from Escondido, California to Los Angeles. 
    The circumstances surrounding respondent's arrest were explained by respondent in his own post arrest statement volunteered to Border Patrol agents. 
    Respondent is an illegal alien from Mexico, he entered the -- he entered this country approximately six days prior to his arrest with the assistance of an illegal alien smuggler. 
    He had been kept in a house in Escondido prior up to the day of his arrest. 
    On the day he was arrested, he agreed with the illegal alien smuggler to transport five additional illegal aliens to Los Angeles in return for the price of his illegal entry into this country. 
    Respondent had been told that the Border Patrol agents at the Temecula checkpoint were not actually checking for illegal aliens; unfortunately, for respondent, he was misinformed and was pulled over to the side or at least was motioned over to the side. 
    He slowed the car down and then drove away at a very high rate of speed. 
    Border Patrol agents chased him, two agents in a single car and respondent stopped his car approximately a mile away from the checkpoint and fled on foot along with the other five illegal aliens. 
    Respondent and three illegal aliens were captured by the Border Patrol agents; two other illegal aliens, however, escaped. 
    The Border Patrol agents then returned the respondent back to the Border Patrol checkpoint, informed the respondent of his right to remain silent. 
    He, however, waives the right and agreed to make a statement under oath. 
    In the recorded statement, he explained his decision to flee from the Border Patrol checkpoint on the basis, “I already knew that I had had it, too late. 
    It was done.” 
    Later, he told the agents, “I acknowledge the charge of driving.” 
    The agents also interviewed the other illegal aliens and they all admitted that they were in the county illegally and the respondent had been the driver of the car. 
    The Border Patrol agent at that point or soon thereafter called the Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of California for advice as to how to proceed in the case. 
    The Assistant U.S. Attorney based on the information regarding the respondent's apparent confession, the accumulative nature of -- of the statements made by the three additional illegal aliens and the general circumstances surrounding the arrest, the flight, et cetera, decided that no useful purpose would be served either for the Government or for the defendant in requiring two otherwise none -- not prosecutable by our -- in our discretion, however, but not prosecutable illegal aliens to remain in custody and therefore authorized the release of those two illegal aliens back in Mexico.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, unfortunately, the tape recorder had malfunctioned. 
    Originally, it was thought that the tape recording of respondent's statement had malfunctioned and there was no statement from him but it turned out that the malfunction was -- occurred during the time that the statements of the --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="262.007" stopTime="265.646">

    So in fact there is no written or recorded statement from those released?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="265.646" stopTime="282.107">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    No, not a specific written or recorded statement; although I think typically there would be, moreover, we do of course have the statement from the remaining illegal alien, Romero-Morales, and the statements from the Border Patrol agents, and all the statements by all of the agents -- or excuse me, by all of the illegal aliens are essentially the same.

    Subsequently when he testified at the -- at the hearing, they received -- they obtained that statement and there's nothing to indicate that his statement at the hearing on the motion to dismiss was different from the statement given to the Border Patrol agents at the time of his arrest. 
    The Assistant United States Attorney authorized the release of two of the three illegal aliens chosen at random and they were released on March 30th of --

speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="367.601" stopTime="392.986">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I believe it was appointed counsel. 
    Respondent was indicted on one count of transporting an illegal alien, Romero-Morales, within this country in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1324(a)(2). 
    Soon thereafter, he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the deportation of the two illegal aliens had the prior -- had violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. 
    District Court held a hearing on the motion at that --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Did he make any proffer of what the testimony would be given had these people been kept in the country?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="400.932" stopTime="419.374">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Not specifically, the closest thing to a proffer, I suppose, would be -- he did offer a testimony of Romero-Morales at the hearing. 
    Romero-Morales was at least putatively a defense witness at the hearing on the motion to dismiss; although I submit that his statements were rather strongly inculpatory of respondent rather than exculpatory.

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Yes. 
    I think so.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, when -- was a counsel appointed for him on the 31st?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I assume that that was the --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="439.278" stopTime="444.177">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So it would have been a question of whether to hold him for one day to give the counsel an opportunity to interview him. 
    Is that what we're pointing to?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="444.177" stopTime="449.015">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    In this specific case it would have been but there was no way, I don't think, of knowing that at the time necessarily.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="449.015" stopTime="457.019">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, isn't there a procedure whereby these things are processed in this manner normally and wouldn't you normally expect the complaint to be filled rather promptly?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="457.019" stopTime="477.337">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, we would assume that; although, of course, it's -- it's not really accurate -- altogether accurate to say that it's only holding him for a single day. 
    I mean other than the fact that he would have had counsel appointed at that point, there still presumably would have been a period of time the counsel would have required in order to investigate the matter and to pursue it. 
    Typically, the practice is to keep the illegal aliens for 10 days even after a counsel is appointed.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="477.337" stopTime="479.181">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The -- the practice is to keep them for 10 days?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="479.181" stopTime="480.086">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="480.086" stopTime="486.440">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    After -- I see, is that the -- well, I don't understand. 
    I'm a little puzzled. 
    What is the source of the 10-day practice?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="486.440" stopTime="495.143">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    It's just a -- it's a common law practice. 
    I think it's developed primarily by the magistrates in the Southern District of California; although it is also adopted in other districts.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="495.143" stopTime="497.873">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Then why wasn't it followed in this case?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="497.873" stopTime="504.580">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, because the case wasn't submitted to -- it wasn't -- the illegal aliens were already gone prior to the time that it went to the magistrate.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="504.580" stopTime="509.782">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In order to avoid the 10-day rule, you must ship them back before the magistrate complaint is filed, is that right?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="509.782" stopTime="526.190">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, in a sense, yes, Your Honor because the problem is that given the state of the law in the Ninth Circuit, the magistrate's simply not in a position to release the illegal aliens unless we -- unless we can modify the Ninth Circuit's very strict ruling, it's very difficult to have a magistrate agree to release the illegal aliens even though there is no likelihood of --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="526.190" stopTime="548.590">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Would the Government's problem be solved if the Ninth Circuit rule were modified to require them to be kept safe for 24 hours or --? 
    It seems to me that there is -- the dispute may be narrower than it appears to be. 
    You know, that the other side seems to be just asking for an opportunity to interview and the ten -- I can see your objection to the 10-day rule but I wonder if it necessarily would apply to say, a 24-hour rule.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="548.590" stopTime="562.454">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, I suspect that -- I mean, obviously, the Government's position would be immaterially advanced by a 24-hour rule but I'm not sure that the decision as to how much time is one -- that is a -- you know, it's not an easy judgment to make and certainly, I wouldn't -- it's a --

    Yes. 
    Would the Government's case be in any trouble if you did that?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="585.323" stopTime="597.168">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    No, I don't think so because it's still -- our submission is that there was no prejudice whatsoever and the -- and -- and even if there were some claim that we violated his right to counsel, you would still have to have a demonstration of prejudice.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="597.168" stopTime="602.561">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    You mean there's no Messiah overtone after a counsel is appointed to whether or not you could -- may release them?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, you don't have there -- I mean I -- no, I don't think -- no, sir. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    At the test -- at the hearing on the motion to dismiss, testimony was offered by the two arresting Border Patrol agents, the detained illegal alien, Romero-Morales, and the Assistant United States Attorney who approved the release of the two illegal aliens. 
    Based largely on the post arrest admissions by the respondent, the District Court held that the loss of the missing illegal aliens could not possibly or at least with no substantial possibility have prejudiced defendant's -- respondent's case and therefore, he denied the motion to dismiss.

    I thought defendants usually decide what -- what's the point --

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, it's not that we're really -- I mean actually not, I mean if we were to take -- if we were to reason by analogy from United States versus Lovasco, it would seem to us that the rule ought to be that the United States simply in pursuing its policy with regard to immigration, should simply deport the illegal aliens. 
    All we do in this context is attempt to provide a certain amount of protection for the respondent by virtue of the fact that we provide him with certain amount of protection.I don't think that should give raise to any inherent problems. 
    I mean, otherwise, we would just simply deport him as the Court held in United States versus Rose on the First Circuit decision.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, I mean, certainly the cost is a significant factor but I think the idea of -- of having illegal aliens languishing in jail for a period of time when no one has any intention of calling them as witnesses either the Government or the defendant and no one has -- you know, and they're not going to serve any useful function to anybody, I think that's the primary interest to the Federal Government in these cases. 
    And to go back to the statistics that we cited in our brief, it -- there's something wrong with the rule of law that requires the Federal Government to detain 5,000 illegal aliens as material witnesses in a district in which there are 36 trials on Title 8 offenses. 
    There's something just fundamentally wrong with that.

    Second of all, it's not altogether clear what an early interview will accomplish. 
    Testimony by the Assistant United States Attorney at the -- at the hearing on the motion to dismiss was to the effect that oftentimes defense counsel prefers to be able to try to retain illegal alien material witnesses even without any expectation of having them testify simply as leverage against the Government for a plea bargain arrangement so that I'm not sure that we're going to be at anything by virtue of having -- having counsel there earlier.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, it would have been -- the problem that that would have created is we would have a no -- we would have lacked a non-hearsay basis for proving some of the elements and perhaps created a Confrontation Clause problem.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Assume you had a statement that you thought was sufficient from the driver himself plus the testimony of the two agents who arrested the -- arrested them, that might have made out a sufficient case, just assume. 
    I think that's possible. 
    Then I suppose under your view, you could also have deported the man who was the -- actually, the charge was based on, under your view of the law.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1336.434" stopTime="1339.918">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips

speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1344.020" stopTime="1379.538">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Sure, but there was still -- and you have to analyze it in two different grounds. 
    One, on the basis of the reasonableness of our decision to release him, which is probably questionable on those circumstances since there's no -- since the detention of one illegal alien versus three is -- is perhaps not all that onerous a burden on us. 
    Second of all, you still would have to show that he was a material witness in any sense. 
    I mean typically, this is -- in some ways, it's unfortunate to this case -- in this case that the -- that the tape recorder broke because, typically, we would have an oral statement on -- from everyone that we could then examine. 
    And that would presumably serve as at least some basis for the counsel to inquire as to what possible grounds --

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, if you were prepared -- if the Court were to hold that it is abundantly clear that if we had that statement in hand, we can go ahead and deport the illegal aliens. 
    That may well be true. 
    But what we're looking for -- I mean this specific -- this specific case is not what's terribly important. 
    This is not a case about two illegal aliens and one criminal defendant. 
    This is a case literally about thousands of illegal aliens. 
    The United States captures -- has captured in each of the last three years one million illegal aliens. 
    Each of those, not every one of those illegal aliens, of course necessarily raises the Mendez-Rodriguez problem. 
    Now if you consider that most of them probably had some assistance coming into this country, probably had some assistance in trying to conceal themselves from the authorities and probably, because of where they ended up having to stay within this country came across criminal activity of another nature, the chances of a Mendez-Rodriguez problem with regard to all one million of those illegal aliens is fairly good. 
    And it cannot be that the Government is responsible to keep all of those illegal aliens.

    Mr. Phillips, suppose it were perfectly clear that a counsel would always be appointed in the vast majority of instances within 24 hours after arrest or 48 hours after arrest.

    You don't -- you've never talked to him. 
    The assumption is because you were present at the crime that you can take action.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I'd like to address four of the issues in this case. 
    First is the issue of what the statute with which Mr. Valenzuela was charged required for proof of conviction and what the defense in the case was. 
    Secondly, the way in which the Government's action in this case violated the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process. 
    Third, what the actual procedure is in the Southern District of California in implementing the Ninth Circuit decision in Mendez-Rodriguez, a decision that has been adapted by the Circuits -- of the three other Circuits, the Fifth, the Seventh, and recently in Armijo-Martinez, the Sixth.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1708.033" stopTime="1711.000">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, the -- the Fifth is a little different, isn't it?
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="1711.000" stopTime="1749.484">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun, as we talk about that in the brief, the original decision was Avila-Dominguez. 
    And in that case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that deportation of the witnesses before an interview is a violation of due process, the sanction for which is dismissal. 
    However, they said we reject the automatic dismissal rule. 
    The Ninth Circuit of course does not have an automatic dismissal rule. 
    And in a subsequent case (Inaudible), the Fifth Circuit said that the standard is that the defense in order to obtain relief must show either a plausible theory or some slight suggestion concerning which the witnesses could have helped.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1749.484" stopTime="1752.235">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    That strikes me as out of line with the Ninth Circuit's approach.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Well, whether you call it --

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I'm just objecting to your saying that this Circuit has followed the Ninth.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    I -- I should say that with the exception -- to our mind, the difference between the terms plausible theory or some slight suggestion and the Ninth Circuit formulation of conceivable benefit is a matter of semantics. 
    But I think you're correct that there is some difference in the formulation of the test although the Fifth has held that deportation in this context violates compulsory process. 
    Finally, I'd like to discuss the Government's proposal and why it would strike at the heart of the adversary process, which is the basis for our criminal justice system.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    No, Your Honor.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    In the District Court, the defendant submitted an exhibit. 
    We actually tried to subpoena these witnesses. 
    We obtained the addresses in Mexico, mailed them subpoenas although of course, the subpoenas have no force outside the geographical limits of the United States except with respect to United States citizens. 
    We also mailed a parole letter, which was countersigned by the U.S. Attorney authorizing the witness, should the witness choose to attend Court entering to the United States; the parole is the permit to let him in. 
    And finally, we sent a letter to each of the witnesses in these cases which was submitted as an exhibit at the hearing on a motion to dismiss. 
    In each of the letters, the counsel in the case wrote to the witness, “Your testimony regarding any conversations that occurred between Mr. Valenzuela, yourself and other occupants of the vehicle is important in the case of Mr. Valenzuela. 
    Further, your physical appearance on the date of the arrest and any information you provided or did not provide to Mr. Valenzuela concerning your illegal status and time and place of illegal entry in the United States is important to the issues of guilt or innocence.”

    It is because the exhibit was introduced as an exhibit. 
    It's in the record before the Court of Appeals albeit not in the joint appendix before this Court. 
    But their address, La Huerta, Jalisco for one of the witnesses and the other address in another State in Mexico is in the record.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1943.471" stopTime="1958.341">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I understand your statement as to what the defendants showed here were simply letters to the missing witnesses saying that it would be very desirable to interview them on certain points. 
    Was there nothing more than that?
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="1958.341" stopTime="2014.083">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    No, Your Honor, there was also a statement in argument by counsel that we wanted the witnesses because we felt that they could possibly testify in such a way as he might be found not guilty of a crime of knowingly transporting aliens. 
    And then this followed a colloquy when the Assistant U.S. Attorney was on the stand in which the questions were asked which set forth the defense in this case, the defense which the Ninth Circuit recognized in this opinion. 
    One of the elements of illegal transportation of aliens is that a person has to have reasonable grounds knowing that the people came into the United States within the last three years. 
    The prosecutor answered that's correct. 
    The Ninth Circuit recognized that that was the basis or conceivable benefit. 
    In other words, we showed both in the District Court and to the Ninth Circuit that these witnesses could have proffered evidence that would have been relevant to the defense. 
    What was that defense?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2014.083" stopTime="2017.279">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Relevant, one where it would have helped the Government.

speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="2017.279" stopTime="2020.997">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2020.997" stopTime="2031.926">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, couldn't the defendant himself have made some sort of an affidavit or proffer if in fact he hadn't talked to any of the deported witnesses in the car?
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="2031.926" stopTime="2047.509">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Well, there are several reasons why that would not be, I would suggest, an appropriate procedure. 
    First of all is the fact that the -- as a general matter, the defendant may not have himself knowledge of the relevant evidence that can be given by the witnesses.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2047.509" stopTime="2055.193">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but after that, I mean you're now at the hearing stages, talked to his lawyer and presumably has a much better idea from his lawyer than he would have had on his own.
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="2055.193" stopTime="2057.976">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    He has the Fifth Amendment right not to testify. 
    There's no --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2057.976" stopTime="2065.761">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Sure, he has other kinds of rights that if he doesn't testify, he may not help himself.
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="2065.761" stopTime="2083.617">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    I understand that, Your Honor. 
    But the point is I think that in the absence of some immunity in the Simmons context that the defendant could get up on the stand or submit an affidavit which could later be used -- parts of which could later be used at the trial and the case in chief to convict him, and that would be an inappropriate showing.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2083.617" stopTime="2103.733">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, presumably if he swears to something and says, “I didn't talk to these witnesses while they're in the car.” 
    The only need -- the only theory you need to have is that the witnesses will actually come back and say, “Yes, he did talk to me a lot in the car.” 
    And I don't see that that's unduly penalized, I mean, if he swears to something under oath.
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="2103.733" stopTime="2110.216">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Well, Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit and none of the other Circuits have ever made a requirement that the defendant himself make a showing. 
    The issue is --

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Yes, I understand. 
    I think the appropriate test would be not to require the defendant to come forth and make any showing but to allow his counsel by statement or by some indication as to the possible defense to show how these witnesses could have helped were they here, and that's what was done in this case.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Yes. 
    That's my point, Justice O'Connor. 
    It's not clear whether there would be a Simmons protection, in other words, whether that could not be used by the prosecutor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2167.154" stopTime="2169.030">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    That has not been tested to your knowledge.
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="2169.030" stopTime="2177.767">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    It has never been raised. 
    And so, because there was no such requirement in this case, counsel would have in effect been risking, allowing his client to get on the stand.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2177.767" stopTime="2180.489">

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    As to the showing, as to the showing --
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2181.918" stopTime="2184.493">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    For the showing of possible prejudice, wouldn't that be a possibility?
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="2184.493" stopTime="2242.249">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    I think it could be except that it would trench on the defendant's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
    I think the rule, which we have, is an appropriate one which is counsel must show given the facts and the law and the statute involved that these witnesses could conceivably because we'll never know for sure what they would have had. 
    They could have given evidence that would have helped this case. 
    Now, let -- let me just address this because the Government seems to say, “This defendant was so guilty, it doesn't matter.” 
    Well, certainly, there was no question that he transported the persons, that one of them in fact was an alien and given all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, possibly even that he knew of his illegal status. 
    But 8 U.S.C. 1324(a)(2), the statute employed in this case, requires that the defendant know that the alien had entered illegally within the last three years before the transportation.

speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="2246.360" stopTime="2255.675">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    The testimony in that regard, Your Honor, was that he did not enter with Mr. Valenzuela; that he met Mr. Valenzuela at a house in Escondido, which is some 50 miles north of the border.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Yes. 
    The witness, Mr. Valenzuela, the indication was from his statement who had been in the country six years, the witness had been in the country between a day and a half and possibly as little as 12 hours when he arrived at the house in Escondido.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    He denied any communication whatsoever, one way or the other. 
    And the point, of course, is that although he was the one witness that the Government chose to charge the other witnesses were apparently in his company, and it is conceivable that these witnesses would have said something to Mr. Valenzuela such as for instance, one saying to the other in his presence, “Do you remember when we were up in the Imperial Valley three years ago picking those grapes?” 
    Which would indicate to Valenzuela that albeit without illegal status, they had not in fact illegally entered the country within the last three years because as this Court recognizes, I think, in Brignoni-Ponce. 
    The Hispanic population of Southern California is large and in fact there are large numbers of people illegally there who have been there for many, many years.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Well, they could have -- they could have been of help in another way.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, I gather what you said earlier, Mr. Iredale, was that one of them might have said in the hearing in presence of the driver and this (Inaudible), might have said -- up in the great country three years ago and even though he denied that they had said anything, they might have come and testified that they did indeed say something. 
    And that's what was said, and your point is that this would have a bearing on the knowledge of the defendant.

    That he's been hiding in this place for four years, is that the idea?

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Well, many of the people who are illegally in California go from Southern California where they work up to the North and they have to get through the checkpoint. 
    And then, they come back down South and work in the South and then they go back up North without necessarily entering back into Mexico. 
    And he could have inferred that or believed that that was the situation here; even though admittedly, he knew they were without status, he could have inferred they were coming not from Mexico but from the Imperial Valley up to the Central Valley to pick crops there.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    But the statute has two mandatory of requirements. 
    One is that he knows they are illegaly here. 
    The second is that he knows they entered within three years, and I think that statement goes to the first.

    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    It -- it was never raised because we felt the Mendez-Rodriguez issue was absolutely all in our favor and we wanted to raise that issue only.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2984.872" stopTime="2989.478">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you think you're foreclosed on a remand if you lose this case?
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="2989.478" stopTime="3086.971">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    I would hope not. 
    I would hope we would not lose the case given the fact that we feel that the procedure here followed by the Government was completely unreasonable, especially in light of the practices in the Southern District of California. 
    This would testify two in the record. 
    Now, I'd like to explain it because I have a very reasonable effort to balance all of the interests of all of the parties. 
    When the defendant is arrested and charged with an offense involving felony illegal alien smuggling, he's bought in to Court, almost always within 24 hours of the arrest. 
    At the rule five arraignment counsel is appointed for him, counsel is also at that time appointed for the witnesses. 
    A date is set for preliminary examination which is nearly always within 10 days of the date of the initial appearance in Court. 
    And Mr. Justice Stevens, there's nothing magical about the 10-day figure and it's not common law. 
    The reason why it's 10 days is because the Government wants 10 days to be able to indict the case. 
    Defense Counsel Franklin could conduct his investigation in much less time. 
    It is the practice in the Southern District of California that the Government provides discovery, the reports to defense counsel on an informal basis and the witnesses are all interviewed before that initial appearance. 
    And at that appearance, after the interview of the witnesses has taken place, counsel appears with the defendant, the Government is required at that time to make a showing as to which witnesses they want. 
    Defense counsel is required to make a showing as to which if any witnesses he wants. 
    In one magistrate's code, it must be done by an affidavit under oath --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3086.971" stopTime="3095.748">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, what kind of a showing must he make? 
    What if he says, for example, all of these people were in the vehicle and I'd like to hold them all because they might conceivably benefit the defense? 
    Is that enough?
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="3095.748" stopTime="3102.008">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    That's -- that's insufficient. 
    You see, the standard of conceivable benefit does not apply at these hearings because --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3102.008" stopTime="3103.376">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, what is the standard of that hearing then?
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="3103.376" stopTime="3123.804">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    The standard -- the defendant must be able to show that the witness could offer relevant, material and exculpatory evidence that would not otherwise be obtainable from the witnesses that the Government is keeping. 
    In other words, counsel is held at that hearing to a very specific standard. 
    The reason is he has been able to interview these witnesses.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3123.804" stopTime="3127.265">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And does he say at that hearing what the exculpatory evidence would be?
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="3127.265" stopTime="3154.712">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    He's required to because absence such a showing, the magistrate will order the discharge of the witness immediately. 
    And as a matter of fact, at this hearing probably 50% to 60% of the witnesses are discharged.In every case, the Government keeps material witnesses in custody. 
    Even if this Court were to adhere to the Government's position, the number of material witnesses to retain in the Southern District of California would not decrease.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3154.712" stopTime="3169.959">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if the -- what if the defendant objects to an action of the magistrate in discharging a particular witness or group of witnesses, I take it he can preserve that point and object at trial and conceivably either have the indictment thrown out or the Court of Appeals reverses it.
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="3169.959" stopTime="3200.918">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    Justice Rehnquist, that's correct. 
    In other words, a verbatim record is kept of the magistrate's proceedings. 
    And defense makes his proffer, the Government may oppose it, the magistrates rule, and then it would be presented to the District Court for his resolution of the issue. 
    But the point is at this material witness hearing, the defense can properly be held to that high standard that they are held to. 
    We're not allowed to come in and say, “Oh, well, maybe he could help.

    Because we've had the chance to interview, the defense is required at that hearing to show specifically.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Can I -- Can I ask you? 
    Suppose a day after arrest, the witnesses are all available and the defense counsel interviews them, he's been appointed and he interviews them. 
    And then the 10 days go by and at the hearing, it turns out that the Government, two days after the arrest had deported all but -- all but the witnesses they wanted to retain. 
    And then, the defense counsel says, “Well, I want those witnesses that were deported.” 
    What would the judge say to him then? 
    Wouldn't he make you show --
speaker="eugene_g_iredale" startTime="3251.306" stopTime="3262.154">
    Mr. Eugene G. Iredale 
    That's exactly right, and that would properly be held. 
    In other words, Mr. Justice White, if I understand correctly, what you're saying is, given the interview, then the defense would have to make a specific particularized definite concrete exculpatory showing.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3262.154" stopTime="3279.593">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So if the Government -- if the Government made the witnesses available to a defense counsel even for a day and if he actually interviewed them, the Government -- if it was confident enough -- could just deport them if he -- if he -- they were sure you couldn't make the showing.

    Let me just say I hesitated the formulation of a day because depending on the facts of the case, a reasonable time might be necessary.

    We've seen such cases. 
    Now, I'll go back to my hypothetical.

    Mr. Justice Burger, this case isn't a typical case. 
    The Government chose this case as its so called “test case” so they chose the facts they felt would be most favorable to them. 
    In most of these cases, the issue is not knowledge but in many cases, alibi, mistaken identity, and in fact, who is doing what with whom and to whom.

    Just a few remarks, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Initially, I've point out from the record that Romero-Morales was asked whether he had heard any testimony or any statements made to the driver by any of the illegal aliens who had been deported. 
    That's on page 44, the joint appendix as to --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You said that was page 44?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3528.968" stopTime="3558.512">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Yes, Your Honor, at the bottom. 
    With regard to the reasonableness of the practice in the Southern District to California, it sounds good when you talk about individualized cases and the step-by-step determination. 
    But it seems to me that the aggregate effect of the rule in the Southern District of California is best demonstrated by the statistics. 
    Five thousand illegal aliens held in custody in order for 36 trials, and we don't even know of those 36 trials, how many if any illegal aliens ever testified on behalf of a defendant.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    On that point, Mr. Phillips, that -- that page 30 of the read brief, they give some figures about the number of cases and they say there were only 11 Mendez-Rodriguez motions filed in a total of 239 cases and only one motion was granted. 
    Is that -- is that accurate?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    We -- we did not independently evaluate that; although, we wouldn't be terribly surprised if there aren't a lot of Mendez-Rodriguez cases in light of the fact that the Government's practice is typically to detain all illegal aliens and/or to dismiss the charges. 
    So you wouldn't expect there'd be very many cases. 
    It doesn't come up because we assume --

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Yes, I don't know where -- I don't understand how the respondent can make that claim. 
    It seems to me inconceivable in light of cases like (Inaudible) where the Government has to detain 39 material witnesses for an excess of two weeks because of a decision and expressly on those facts by the Ninth Circuit.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips
