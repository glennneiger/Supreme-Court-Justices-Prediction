    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    The question in this case is whether Admiral de jurisdiction extends to claims arising from agency contracts. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we hold that there is no per se rule following agency contracts from admiralty. 
    Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Second Circuit.
