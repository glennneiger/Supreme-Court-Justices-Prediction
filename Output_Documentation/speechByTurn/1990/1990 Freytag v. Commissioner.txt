    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    It is an important case for those concerned with governmental structure or it has to do with separation of powers, but perhaps it has little appeal by way of a bench announcement for those who are not so interested. 
    The litigation centers in a statute that authorizes the Chief Judge of the United States Tax Court to appoint special trial judges. 
    Under the statute, he may assign to them certain specified matters and “any other proceeding he may designate.” 
    And as to the latter of this special trial judge may only hear the case and prepare the proposed findings in an opinion but the actual decision is then rendered by the Tax Court judge. 
    The petitioners here sought re-determination of the Tax Court of approximately one and a half billion dollars in asserted federal income tax deficiencies. 
    There are cases where assigned to a Tax Court judge but were later reassigned to a special trial judge. 
    His unfavorable opinion was adapted by the Chief Judge as the opinion of the Tax Court. 
    The Fifth Circuit rejected petitioner’s arguments that the assignment of a complex case to a special trial judge was not authorized by the statute and that the assignment violated the appointments clause of the constitution which limits congressional discretion to vest the appointment of so-called inferior officers to the president, the heads of departments, and the courts of law. 
    We affirm that judgment. 
    We hold hat the statute authorizes the Chief Judge to assign any Tax Court proceeding regardless of complexity or amounted controversy to a special trial judge. 
    Its plain language which contains no limiting term restricting its reach. 
    We also hold that the statute does not transgress the structure of separation of powers embodied in the appointments clause. 
    Such power can be vested in the Chief Judge only if his court falls within one of the three repositories that the clause specifies. 
    Congress obviously did not intend to create or to grant the president the power to appoint special trial judges, and the term department refers only to cabinet level departments. 
    An article one court such as the Tax Court, however, is a court of law within the meaning of the clause and that is the answer to the issue in the case. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment and is joined by Justice O’Connor, Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter.
