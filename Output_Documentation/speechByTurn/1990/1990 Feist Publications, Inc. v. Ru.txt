    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes to us on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. 
    It requires us to clarify the extent of copyright protection available to telephone directory white pages. 
    The respondent, Rural Telephone Service Company, is a certified public utility providing telephone service to several communities in Kansas. 
    Pursuant to state regulation, it publishes a typical telephone directory consisting of white pages and yellow pages. 
    The petitioner, Feist Publications, publishes a competing telephone directory covering a larger area. 
    When Rural refused to license its white pages listings to Feist for directory covering 11 different telephone service areas, Feist copied more than 1,300 listings from Rural's directory without the consent of Rural. 
    Rural sued for copyright infringement. 
    The United States District Court for the District of Kansas granted summary judgment to Rural, holding that telephone directories are copyrightable and that there was infringement. 
    The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    In an opinion filed today, we reverse. 
    We explained that a fundamental principle of a copyright law is that facts are not copyrightable. 
    This is because, as a matter of both constitutional and statutory law, a work qualifies for copyright protection only if it is original. 
    Original, as that term is used in copyright, means that the work was independently created by the author and that it possess a least some minimal degree of creativity. 
    No one may claim originality as to facts because facts are not created by the author. 
    They are merely discovered and reported. 
    One may, however, claim originality in the way facts are selected, coordinated, or arranged. 
    These choices by an author, so long as they entail some minimal degree of creativity, are sufficiently original to qualify for copyright protection. 
    We conclude in this case that Feist, by taking 1,300 listings from Rural's white pages did not copy anything that was original to Rural. 
    The bits of data contained in the listings are uncopyrightable facts. 
    Rural did not select, coordinate, or arranged these facts in an original way. 
    Rurals selection and arrangement were obvious. 
    The list is alphabetical by name of subscriber, town, and telephone of each of its subscribers. 
    This is a frequent and age-old practice so common placed that it has come to be expected as a manner of course. 
    Because Rural's white pages are the void of creativity, Feist did not violate the copyright laws by copying them. 
    The opinion is joined by eight members of the court. 
    Justice Blackmun concurs in the judgment.
