    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is Martin versus Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, No. 89-1541. 
    That case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
    The Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes a Secretary of Labor to prosecute civil penalty actions before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. 
    The question here in this case is whether a reviewing court should defer to the Secretary or to the Commission when these two actions act or disagree on the interpretation of a regulation. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that a court must divert to the Secretary under the circumstances. 
    We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Tenth Circuit.
