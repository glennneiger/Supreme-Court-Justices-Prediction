Houston Lawyers' Association v. Attorney General of Texas

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 90-813, Houston Lawyers' Association v. Attorney General of Texas, consolidated with No. 90-974, the League of United Latin American Citizens v. the Attorney General of Texas. 
    Spectators are admonished to remain silent. 
    The Court remains in session. 
    Do not talk until you get outside of the courtroom. 
    Mr. Chambers, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is the thirteenth time or fourteenth time that black citizens from Texas and Mexican Americans from Texas have been before this Court to ask for relief against practices of the State of Texas which denied or limited their participation in the electorial process. 
    Some of those cases involved overt practices of the State which directly excluded it. 
    Others involved, as this case does, subtle practices which limited their participation in the electoral process. 
    Congress, we submit, sought to address that problem when it amended the rights... the Voting Rights Act in 1982. 
    And we are here today to ask that the intent of Congress in the amendment in 1982 be carried out. 
    We have in Texas a number of African Americans and Mexican Americans who today are excluded from or limited in the participation in the election of judges in Texas. 
    We ask that they be permitted, as Congress directed, to participate on an equal basis. 
    The issue here is whether section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as amended in 1982 applies to the election of judges in Texas. 
    The district court held that the plaintiffs had established a violation of section 2 and directed interim relief. 
    The Fifth Circuit with the majority of the court held that section 2 did not apply to the election of judges at all because it read 2(b) to exclude judges. 
    A concurring opinion held that section 2 applied to the election of all offices including judges. 
    But in its view there was some unique feature of judges in the district court level in Texas which limited or prohibited the application of section 2. 
    It found that judges in Texas or the State had an interest in tieing the electorate to the judiciary... to the authority of the judges in Texas. 
    And it found that there was some single-person office in the way that judges were classified. 
    The Government advances another theory, and we submit one that is not permitted by the Voting Rights Act, that in some way the Court should weigh, and in some instances permit, State interest to trump deprivations of rights of minorities in the electoral process. 
    There is nothing in the Voting Rights Act of 1982 that permits that kind of analysis and that kind of weight to be given to the State interest that is being asserted in the case. 
    With respect to the majority opinion, we rely on the positions that were advanced by the petitioners and the Government in the Chisom case which you just heard. 
    I would like to turn, unless there is some further question about coverage, to the issues that were raised by the concurring opinion and to the issues that have been presented by the Government brief or amicus brief in this case.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Chambers, let me ask you one question about the meaning of section 2(a) which was, as you point out, was dwelled on rather extensively by counsel in the preceding case. 
    It said that that embodies the results tests from White against Regester. 
    Now, do you rely for that simply on the use of the word results as a verb in section 2(a).
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="284.031" stopTime="288.425">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    That the section 2(a) covers the election of judges or--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="288.425" stopTime="290.818">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    No, no, but that... that it's a results test--
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="290.818" stopTime="291.259">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    --Oh.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="291.259" stopTime="292.528">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --rather than an intent test.
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="292.528" stopTime="307.999">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    I think the language, Your Honor, as well as the legislative history clearly points out as this Court held in Gingles that Congress was acting to make sure that result, rather than intent, would be the factor that would be... that would enable one to establish a violation of the act.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="307.999" stopTime="315.665">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So you say then that Gingles established the proposition that 2(a) is phrased in terms of results rather than intent?
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="315.665" stopTime="339.821">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    I think Gingles said that Congress, with the amendment in 1982, was establishing result as the basis for establishing a violation. 
    And it suggested in section 2(b) how that result might be established. 
    So I think 2(a) clearly holds... provides that one can establish a violation here for the election of judges, including trial judges, under 2(a).
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="339.821" stopTime="356.904">
    Justice Kennedy 
    If you have a case where there's a blatant discriminatory intent, is there a 2(a) violation? 
    It might be difficult for us to imagine an intent without a result, but could you allege an intent and have that suffice to state a cause of action under section 2(a)?
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="356.904" stopTime="373.896">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    I would think so, Your Honor. 
    I think that 2(a) covers both intent as well as result. 
    I think that Congress and I think the Fourteenth Amendment was still there when Congress was acting... recognized that a State may act intentionally and a State may act with discriminatory results, and they wanted to make sure it was covering discriminatory results.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist

speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="501.362" stopTime="662.147">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Well, I'm... yes, Your Honor, but I'm also thinking about cases like the City of Mobile, where we had three commissioners who arguably were single-person officers. 
    And this Court approved or the low court approved of a division of those offices in order to ensure that minorities in Mobile would have an opportunity to participate in electoral process. 
    All I'm saying is it is not a per se rule. 
    I think that what I know of Governors in the State of... of States around this country, they would be occupying single-person offices. 
    I just don't want to say that under no circumstances would a particular office which they may be a single-person office, could be challenged under the Voting Rights Act. 
    That's all I'm saying. 
    I'd like to turn to the assertions that there were State interests that warranted not applying section 2 to the situation in Texas. 
    First, I would point out that section 2, as enacted by Congress, requires a type of analysis that does not permit a per se exclusion for the application of the act. 
    The Congress was trying to provide protection for minorities who were limited in their participation in the electoral process. 
    And the Congress set up a structure for an analysis. 
    And the only place where you really begin to look at State interest is under one of the factors that Congress listed, which talks about tenuousness of a State practice. 
    Here if the plaintiff put this issue into consideration, the Court is to look and see whether the assertive State practice is tenuous, and if it finds it is or if it finds it's not, that's just the factor that the... that the Court is to look at and make a determination in the totality of the circumstances whether there is in fact vote dilution. 
    It is never, I submit, a bar to one's establishment of a dilution and a particular electoral process. 
    Second, here there was no evidence offered I submit that warranted a court deciding that it would bar... that as a State's interest... application of section 2. 
    If we go through and look at the actual State practices that were involved, we'll see that there is no justification for really asserting... that there is some strong, significant State interest. 
    For example, we hear that tieing the jurisdiction to the electorate in some way promoted accountability. 
    But district judges in Texas have Statewide jurisdiction, not just county jurisdiction. 
    They had issued decisions that affect the whole State. 
    For example, a decision in the district court just the other day reconstructs the whole method for financing education in Texas.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="662.147" stopTime="673.633">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, is that because they have jurisdiction in other counties or just because a lawsuit can be brought into the county in which they have jurisdiction which has parties to it that would be in from other counties?

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Your Honor, I don't think that the State's interest is an appropriate defense, and I think that the Senate report shows that it is not a defense that would bar the establishment of a section 2 claim. 
    Again, Your Honor, what we are looking at is whether a particular State structure limits the ability of minorities to participate equally in the electorial process. 
    And if it does, then the Court is required to proceeded with some kind of relief. 
    It may take into consideration at the remedy stage the State's interest that may be asserted here in this proceeding, but not in deciding that we do not establish a section 2 violation.

    If the State, as the State in Texas, has set up a system that says that there will be 59 judges to 2.4 million population, and some other counties that says that there may be 3 judges for 200,000 population. 
    If we point... if we demonstrate that there is a percentage of minorities in that district, for example, the 200 district, who could elect a representative or could elect a judge, we give the Court an appropriate standard for measuring whether the minorities are submerged in that particular district and whether the Court should direct some kind of relief. 
    It's the same kind of approach that the Court followed in Gingles.

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Your Honor, we're not here arguing whether the one-person, one-vote principle should be changed or reversed with respect to judges. 
    I'm accepting for purposes of this case today... and that's all we need to advance... that in Texas we may have 200 people per 300... 200,000 people per 3 judge in one county, and 59 for 2.5 people in another county. 
    And I'm saying in those counties where we have minorities who could elect a judge, we use that standard that the State has employed to measure whether the minority votes are submerged.

 Another standard that's been suggested which you... which you also refuse to adopt... you say it may be used but then again it may not... is not one-person, one-vote, but the minority should not have any less voting power than... than the most deprived nonminority group in the State. 
 If you have some the district that's 1 to 300 as long as the minority has at least that, it's okay. 
 Now, those are two standards, and I understand both of those. 
 But I don't understand... you reject each of those as... as the standard.

   Argument of Renea Hicks
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1567.652" stopTime="1664.501">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I wish to address both the question of coverage and the question of the inapplicability, not an exemption, but the inapplicability of vote dilution at-large challenges to trial judges, the solo decision makers. 
    And I first want to address the question of coverage. 
    Much to the chagrin of much of the Texas judiciary, many of the people that have intervened on my case, I do not... I anticipate Mr. Pugh... I do not adopt the theory of noncoverage that Louisiana has adopted or that the Fifth Circuit adopted. 
    We argued below that the plain statement principle was the way to approach it. 
    The problem is not that "representative" clearly excludes judges. 
    It's that the use of the word "representative" doesn't clearly include them. 
    There is ambiguity there. 
    There is also some ambiguity I believe in the question of whether section 2(a) of the Voting Rights Act covers intentional discrimination. 
    I think it was Justice Scalia, but I'm not sure who pointed out, that the language certainly doesn't say anything about intent. 
    The language of section 2(a) only talks about results. 
    And I don't believe there's the slightest indication that Congress meant to do away with the intent standard in 1982. 
    But it appears that they did. 
    Of course, there is the protection of the Constitution there. 
    It's been there since 1870 or 1868, depending on whether you use the Fifteenth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    But nonetheless there may not be an intent standard in section 2 anymore if you read the language literally. 
    If you choose not to read the--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1664.501" stopTime="1676.319">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr.... Mr. Hicks, you... take a look at the word 2(a).

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1690.529" stopTime="1710.583">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --Well, if you read it simply as causes or eventuates in, then you're simply referred to the phrases beyond that for the substantive meaning of this section. 
    "A denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color or in controversion of the guarantees set forth in subsection 2. "
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1710.583" stopTime="1875.912">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Yes. 
    And... and I... I believe the proper reading is that there still is an intent standard. 
    There's no indication that they intended to do away with it. 
    But that doesn't answer the question about whether the statute is so clear you can tell it covers judges. 
    I disagree with one of the Justices who answered that the Court... and I think it was Justice White... who answered that the Court had decided that the original section 2 in 1965 covered judges. 
    The Court has never decided that. 
    The Court has never addressed that question. 
    In Mobile v. Bolden, without considering coverage of judges, the Court in rather an offhand manner... I don't mean the analysis was offhand, but the State... the use of the language was offhand I believe... in rather offhand manner said that section 2 is coextensive with the Fifteenth Amendment. 
    In Rogers v. Lodge 2 years later, it was stated differently. 
    The Court said section 2 reaches no further than the Fifteenth Amendment. 
    There is a difference there, and it's an importance difference for the analysis of this case. 
    If you go back to 1965, as Mobile v. Bolden pointed out, the legislative history on section 2 is sparse. 
    This Court has noted that there is extensive debate in the 60... during the '65 on the preclearance provisions, the rules about doing away with literacy test, the rules about access to the poll question that were such a horror in the South at that point. 
    And it... it's clear that in 1965 Congress was trying to do away with a lot of those horrors. 
    But there is no indication that Congress in 1965 addressed judges in section 2. 
    It didn't even think about it. 
    It didn't even think about it in 1960... in 1982 either. 
    And in 1982, Congress was using a power, the enforcement clause power, which is a much more hemmed-in power, I would say, than the... its power to straight out announce what the Constitution covers under section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment and section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment. 
    So during the 17 years, from 1965 to 1982, there is no... there's no empirical evidence that section 2 covered judges. 
    There was not a single statutory section 2 case involved... vote dilution case involving judges reported anywhere in the annals of these cases. 
    There is not a single effects standard case involving judges, either under the Constitution or the statute, during that 17-year period. 
    There was one case... Fifth Circuit case that was dismissed. 
    There was no trial of it. 
    The... 12 beat 6 dismissal at the trial court level. 
    And then it gets up to the Fifth Circuit and then... the only provisions mentioned are the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. 
    And the only challenges are clearly intent challenges. 
    They aren't, however it may in retrospect be read to me, they are not White v. Regester kinds of challenges. 
    And so--

    --They didn't address it. 
    There's no mention of it. 
    There's not a single case. 
    The only things back in that era... the 17-year era of whatever the original section 2 meant... the only cases around was an intentional... constitute clearly intentional... no debate about it... and constitutional case on vote dilution about judges. 
    Then the other things that came up were the Court's summary affirmances of the rule that one-person, one-vote does not apply to judges. 
    You get to 1982, Congress wants to reinstitute the pre-Bolden rule as it reads it. 
    It has to use its enforcement powers under the Civil Rights Amendment to do that. 
    And it is not free to do anything it wants when it does that. 
    It is not free to not deliberate and just announce a rule. 
    It has to deliberate. 
    That's what Katzenbach v. Morgan, Oregon v. Mitchell say it has to do. 
    It may not have to deliberate like a trial, make a court record, and things like that.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I think... well, the premise of Katzenbach v. Morgan and its progeny is, yes, Congress does have to think about them, if it's enacting statutes that go further than this Court has announced the Constitution goes. 
    It doesn't... if you want to say it this way... it doesn't have to think about it if it's enacting a statute that governs Federal employee relations. 
    It doesn't. 
    I... you don't have to... as I think you've said so often... if the plain language covers it, we don't have to worry about whether they thought about it. 
    Whether they thought about it the right way and all that, you don't go behind it. 
    But things are different when you get into the realm of the enforcement clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    If they aren't different, then Katzenbach v. Morgan is not good law. 
    But Katzenbach v. Morgan I believe is good law.

    Well, I can only have the words. 
    I don't write the opinions, so I can only tell from its words and the way it's been applied that it is premised on the idea that there is some peculiar ability within Congress which is known as the world's greatest deliberative body to deliberate about what it's doing. 
    And you will find no indication... a few smatterings... back... way back in hearings buried in a table, there might be a listing of a judge. 
    So that's usually about section 5 coverage. 
    But there may be a few smatterings that something about judges will sit, but once you move past that... once you get into the area where this Court pays some attention to legislative history... that is, into the committee reports, into the debate about the bill on the... on the floor of the House and the Senate, there is nothing.

    That would be the hardest question for me. 
    I think it would be a closer question. 
    But it isn't close here. 
    I don't adopt the view that representatives clearly excludes judges. 
    But I do adopt a view to you that it's at least ambiguous... at least. 
    We know that they weren't thinking about it. 
    You can tell it's ambiguity if you go look at the Senate report. 
    All of those 23 cases that you don't want to read in the Senate report have to do with executive and legislative arms of the Government, and not a single judge's case. 
    They don't even address the problem of one-person, one-vote.

    I think what that indicates is the plaintiffs didn't think they were covered. 
    They didn't sue. 
    There weren't any vote dilution effects test suits until after 1982. 
    And if section 2 originally had covered it... given the claims that the State judicial system is the last bastion of white supremacy in the South which I don't think is so... but given that claim and given the claim that it is such a crucial institution, I would have thought that would have been the primaries of focus, but it was not.

    The legislative history covers about just every officer if you go back and look at it. 
    I do think that judges are different. 
    I think that's part of the reason for the argument for the Solicitor... that the Solicitor General's office has made. 
    They acknowledge that the judges... that judges are different. 
    I actually believe that petitioners have acknowledged that judges are different.

    I believe that this Court has historically recognized their unique place. 
    It is... this Court has an interdependent relationship with trial judges at the State court level and with all judges at State court level. 
    It relies on them for a lot of rules that it must apply. 
    It relies on trial court judges to take care of a lot of Federal constitutional issues. 
    It relies on trial court judges and other State court judges to address, it seems to me, a lot of issues that will relieve the Court of a lot of--

    Congress makes the ultimate judgment on whether it wants to extend its... the Constitution to reach down into the arms of the State government that are traditionally off limits. 
    But it should exercise that judgment. 
    It shouldn't stumble across it. 
    It shouldn't be an accident.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I don't think it's necessary to answer that question in this case, because we've been found not to discriminate intentionally, but I think there is no legislative history to indicate that in 1965 Congress intended to get at judges. 
    I also think though the test for how much they had to have paid attention is different for 1965 because they weren't exercising their enforcement clause powers under section 2, as Bolden has seen it in retrospect. 
    They were just announcing... regurgitating what the Constitution said. 
    So there is a different standard when they move to the effects test. 
    But I do emphasize Texas has been found specifically not to have intentionally discriminated in the creation and maintenance of this system. 
    It's only the effects test that matters. 
    And Congress in instituting the effects test and going further than Bolden said the Constitution goes, didn't pay one whit of serious attention to judges.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --I think that there is a possibility of bringing section 2(a)'s reach and results. 
    But it only reaches results because of language inserted in 1982. 
    That language again didn't... when they did it, they didn't attend to judges at the State court level. 
    And there are so many reasons why there should have at least been some debate on this if they were thinking about judges... the application of the one-person, one-vote rule which it doesn't work in this... in the... for State judges. 
    Surely that would have been mentioned. 
    Surely the other differences between judges and others would have been at least mentioned if they had thought they were extending the Constitution further than you have extended it. 
    But they didn't mention it. 
    I'd like to turn briefly to what has been called the solo decision-maker exception argument that we have made and that Judge Higginbotham and four other members of the Fifth Circuit found to be persuasive. 
    I first want to say that it is not an argument for an exception from section 2 for trial judges. 
    There are other aspects of section 2 and section 2(b) than just vote dilution aspects. 
    I am only talking about the inapplicability of the concept of at-large vote dilution challenges to trial judges to solo decision makers. 
    And I don't think there's any question but that trial judges are solo decision makers. 
    They function independently. 
    This Court in an opinion by Justice Blackmun has recently... in a different setting... has recently talked about the difference between appellate courts and trial courts and how trial court functions independently and as a solo decision maker and how appellate courts function in a collective manner. 
    There is no indication... in fact Reynolds v. Simms which is the progenitor of all this... suggests otherwise. 
    But there's no indication that Congress when it enacted section 2 intended to get into destroying the basic choice of the... the electorate to be represented by the decision... decision-making body that they elect. 
    Texas has set up, for instance, the legislature. 
    The decisions coming out of there in the form primarily of legislation it seems to me. 
    Texas... section 2 can't destroy that choice that the electorate is the whole State of Texas. 
    How it is carved up is different. 
    But the electorate is the whole State of Texas and the decision that their... their democratic views are embodied in decisions made by a body representing the whole State of Texas. 
    Texas has chosen for trial judges to say the county is the electorate... the electorate of the county are the electorate to be represented through the decision of this trial judge. 
    There is... there is no way to make out a vote dilution vote challenge in that kind of setting it seems to me. 
    The concept is inapplicable. 
    There may be other challenges that can be lodged under section 2. 
    That wasn't done here. 
    But there may be other challenges that can be lodged. 
    And... the... that kind, though, cannot. 
    It would Balkanize the representation. 
    You would have a judge from one section of the town elected by one segment of the community--

    --I would think if there were an effort to do that, that would be seen as intentional discrimination. 
    Trying to disenfranchise people is intentional discrimination, and we have not done that. 
    This is statistical... a statistically based test that was applied here. 
    And through statistics it was suggested... ignoring the role which is the overwhelming... overwhelmingly dominant factor... ignoring the role of partisan politics, using statistics and throwing out that most people vote party ticket one way or the other in these kinds of races, the court statistically said there's some submergence.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Well, I don't know if they all would have to based on the intent. 
    Footnotes 10 and 12 of Thornburg v. Gingles... in those footnotes, this Court said there are a host of other section 2 kinds of challenges. 
    In at-large vote dilution challenges it may be available. 
    And I'm not creative enough... I've gotten into the mindset of being a defendant in this... these cases now, so I'm having a hard time thinking. 
    But I'm sure the plaintiffs would have no difficulty figuring out a section 2 vote... a section 2 challenge to that kind of action that was not an at-large vote dilution challenge. 
    The Thornburg v. Gingles principles wouldn't mean much. 
    It would be other aspects of the language of section 2... even on effects, not just on intent. 
    And I don't think... that's the problem with this. 
    We have a... and I think that's part of the reason for the Court's concerns on the inapplicability of the one-person, one-vote rule in this setting... you have a structure set up to attack a system where that structure just doesn't fit. 
    It doesn't fit at all. 
    At least Congress ought to have to go back and figure out if that's the structure they want to apply or if they want another. 
    There might be other situations in which that structure... something other than that structure might be applied... numbered post kind of system or something like that.

   Rebuttal of Julius LeVonne Chambers
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="3273.478" stopTime="3424.894">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    First, I'd like to note that the Senate factors are reported on pages 29... 28 to 30 of the Senate report. 
    Second, with respect to coverage... and we call of course attention again to section 14(c)(1), which clearly shows that the act applies to all voting, whatever the position is involved. 
    I'd like to just address briefly the question of single-person office. 
    And to point out that what we have in Texas, for example in Harris County, are 59 separate judges or 59 judges for the State representing 2.4 million people; 20-some percent or so of those are minority voters. 
    They are unable to elect a representative. 
    And these 59 people, although occupying a position that permits them to make a decision on a particular case, are certainly in positions that can be divided among the electorate to give the minorities a change to elect a representative or to participate more effectively in the process. 
    There is not case that I know of that goes off on the function of the office once the State decides to make the office elected. 
    What we look at is whether this office is so unique that it cannot be divided among the electorate in order to eliminate the impairment of the minority voters in that particular district. 
    And here clearly these judges can be subdivided to permit minorities to have an effective role or an equal role in the election of judges. 
    That's what we are asking. 
    And I think that in the concurring opinion suggestion that these were single-person offices which prohibited a vote dilution analysis was simply not following out the objective of Congress in section 2, because these positions, just like the legislative position, can be subdivided and minorities will have a chance to participate more effectively in the... in the process. 
    No one suggests that any of the judges subdivided would have less authority than the judges who presently occupy those positions. 
    What we suggest is that they be permitted to vote... that minorities be permitted to vote to elect a representative member of the... of the bench. 
    Closing off that opportunity, we submit, would be contrary to what Congress has suggested in the... in the statute other than the legislative history of the--

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    --The court approved it was settlement, Your Honor... that included that method of electing representatives. 
    And then we have the Pennsylvania case that's also cited in material that approves of a limited voting method. 
    And again there is ample literature that points out that cumulative or limited voting would permit the... a system to adjust or deal with the dilution of minority voters without materially altering the particular structure that's there. 
    Also, with respect to the legislative history, we would point on pages 13 and 19 of the amicus brief of the Lawyers' committee there is a listing or citation of a number of instances in which Congress looked at the election of judges in considering the 1982 amendment to the Civil Rights Act. 
    So Congress was aware that the... the proponents were asking for coverage of the most important section of the local governments that continue to affect minority voters.
