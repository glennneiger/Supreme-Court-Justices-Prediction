    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The second case which I have to announce is Touby versus the United States which comes to us on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
    At issue in this case is the Controlled Substances Act which authorizes the attorney general to identify dangerous new drugs and add them to a list or schedule of controlled substances. 
    It takes six to twelve months for the Attorney General to complete the procedures required to add a drug permanently to a particular schedule. 
    Drug traffickers were able to take advantage of this time gap by developing and marketing designer drugs, that is drugs that are similar in effect to schedule substances but differing slightly in chemical composition, so that existing schedules did not apply to them, long before the government was able to schedule the new drugs and initiate prosecutions. 
    To combat the designer drug problem, congress created an expedited procedure by which the Attorney General can schedule a substance on a temporary basis when doing so is necessary to avoid an eminent hazard to the public safety. 
    Pursuant to the temporary scheduling statute of designer drug known as Euphoria, was scheduled by the Attorney General as a controlled substance. 
    The petitioners in this case were indicted for manufacturing the drug but moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the statute violates the constitution by delegating legislative power to the Attorney General. 
    The District Court denied the motion to dismiss and the Court of appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the petitionerâ€™s convictions. 
    In an opinion filed today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    A temporary scheduling statute does not delegate legislative power to the attorney general. 
    Our cases made clear that congress may invest a certain degree of discretion in another branch of government so long as it lays down an intelligible principle to which that other branch must conform. 
    There is no doubt that in the temporary scheduling statute, congress has laid down an intelligible principle. 
    Petitioners argue also that by baring judicial review, the statute makes it impossible for a court to ascertain whether the will of congress has been obeyed. 
    We conclude that the temporary scheduling statute does not bar judicial review. 
    It merely postpones it until the administrative process has run its course. 
    In addition, the statute does not preclude an individual phase in criminal charges from bringing a challenge to a temporary scheduling order as a defense to the prosecution. 
    The petitioners also argued that the statute concentrates too much power in the Attorney General, thereby violating the principle of separation of powers. 
    They conceive that congress may legitimately authorize someone in the executive branch to schedule drugs temporarily but argued that it must be someone other than the Attorney General because he wills the power to prosecute crimes. 
    This argument has no basis in our separation of powers jurisprudence. 
    The doctrine focuses on the distribution of powers among the three coequal branches. 
    It does not speak to the manner in which authority is parceled out within a single branch. 
    The opinion of the court is unanimous. 
    Justice Marshall has filed a concurring opinion which Justice Blackmun has joined.
