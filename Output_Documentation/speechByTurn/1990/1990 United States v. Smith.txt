speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="0.000" stopTime="63.190">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In the other case, United States against Smith No. 89-1646 is here on a certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    The question in this case is whether respondents, David Cober against the military position for malpractice committed at an army hospital in Italy. 
    The Federal Tort Claims Act bars recovery against the United States for such hindrance occurring aboard. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that the Federal Employees Liability Reform Act also bars recovery against the individual positions. 
    We therefore reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
