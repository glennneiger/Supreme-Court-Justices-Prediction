    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The first case, No. 90-89, International Primate Protection League versus the Administrators of Tulane Education Fund, is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    The question before us today is whether federal agencies can remove the suit to Federal District Court pursuant to Section 1142 of Title 28 of the U. S. Code. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and remand the case to the State Court. 
    Justice Scalia took no part with the decision of this case.
