Perry v. Louisiana

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now on No. 89-5120, Michael Owen Perry v. Louisiana. 
    Mr. Nordyke, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="keith_b_nordyre" startTime="63.733" stopTime="204.244">
    Mr. Keith B. Nordyre 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The question before the Court today is whether or not the State of Louisiana may, for the sole purpose of executing an inmate, forcibly medicate a mentally ill inmate with psychotropic drugs. 
    The Louisiana Supreme Court, confirming conviction and sentence on direct appeal, restated that Louisiana does not execute the insane, and invited inquiry as to competency to be executed. 
    The trial court on its own motion determined that Mr. Perry has met the threshold test of Ford v. Wainwright as adopted by Louisiana and held a hearing to determine competency to be executed. 
    The result of that hearing was an order which we contend is without any limits, without any exercise of medical judgment, without review, without any ability to terminate medication, that is, without the medical approach that this Court has previously used. 
    That order said that the medical staff of the Louisiana State Penitentiary should medicate Mr. Perry with the drug Haldol solely for the purpose of preparing him for execution. 
    Mr. Perry has schizoaffective disorder, which is a major mental illness that is incurable. 
    There are two major components to this disorder, the first of which is a mood component... we commonly think of it as a bipolar disorder or manic depressive... and the second is a psychotic component where Mr. Perry has delusions, has auditory hallucinations, and very often does not know where he is. 
    It's also marked by very strong ambivalence, meaning that he cannot say consistently and know consistently from one minute to the next the same thing. 
    The classic example that appears throughout the record is Mr. Perry on the one hand will say, I killed my mother and my father, and within the same sentence will say, for $20,000 I'll tell you who killed my mother and my father. 
    The Louisiana Supreme Court initially stayed the forcible medication order in this case and then denied writ. 
    Under Louisiana law a writ denial is not to be considered an expression of the law. 
    The tension in this case as Petitioner sees it is the pitting of the... the medication model of treatment versus the punitive model of treatment.

    First, we have the best interest component and secondly, the danger to self and others component. 
    The record in our case is absolutely barren of either. 
    There is no finding of best interest and no finding of danger to self or others by the trial court.

    Mr. Keith B. Nordyre 
    Definitely it came up before the Supreme Court of Louisiana, Your Honor. 
    We briefed... the brief that we filed in this Court is very similar to the brief that we filed in the Louisiana Supreme Court and has virtually all the same arguments, including the due process argument, the State created liberty interest. 
    We take the position that the order's sole purpose is for purposes of punishment. 
    The sole reason that the trial court ordered this medication is to attempt to change the man, to change the mind of this individual for the Government's purposes. 
    The injections that the State wants to give Mr. Perry are for no other purpose than to execute Mr. Perry and, therefore, become a step in his punishment and part of the execution that, to our mind, are not part of the Louisiana law, not authorized by Louisiana law. 
    The second major point that we want to make in terms of showing its sole purpose is for punishment is that no prison physicians have ordered this. 
    As was pointed out a second ago, Louisiana does have a statute which we claim sets up a liberty interest, and that statute sets up the medical model that this Court has consistently set up in Vitek and Harper and Youngberg and--

    The statute sets up, basically, the involuntary commitment statute that Justice Blackmun discussed last term in his concurring opinion in Harper as being sort of a cure-all to this problem of forcible medication. 
    And that's what this statute for criminals... the inmates does.

 The case that we heard argued today urges exceptions from what is normally a general rule. 
 Why can't the State say that this statute which prohibits involuntary treatment except where the person is a danger to himself or others, why can't the State court say, well, as we interpret it it's not meant to apply to the case of a condemned prisoner, who so long as the treatment does not harm him and improves his condition is not entitled to refuse it simply because he doesn't want to be made healthy, because if he's made healthy, he'll be executed. 
 Seems a perfectly reasonable exception. 
 Why can't the State supreme court make it?

    The State supreme court perhaps could, but they have not.

    They perhaps could make such an exception, but they haven't.

    Mr. Keith B. Nordyre 
    Your Honor, under our civilian system of law in Louisiana... and I realize this is a criminal constitutional issue... but under our general proposition of how courts make law in Louisiana, we are a civilian system and we generally follow statutes, and if there is no statute, the court generally does not go forth and make law on it. 
    They have to usually go from a statute and analogize from a statute. 
    You know, what Your Honor I think says is interesting and this is that if the court were to say the statute is silent and we're going to go ahead and allow this as an exception, then what it does, I think, is clearly make part of the punishment this medication. 
    And what we are doing is we are at this point adding a punishment not authorized by statute.

    Mr. Keith B. Nordyre 
    --Not the first time, Your Honor. 
    The first time that I wrote the letter to request that he not take medication, which was in March of 1988, the reason that was done was that Mr. Perry was having discomfort. 
    He was feeling really bad on the medication. 
    The first time that I ever met this client was in January of 1988, and he was agitated and having the side effect of... the intense agitation of this medication and I looked at the statute and found 830.1 and wrote a letter saying, let's discontinue him from the medication. 
    The second time I didn't discontinue him from the medication. 
    I wrote a letter to the State Penitentiary asking that they not medicate him absent compliance with 830.1. 
    And the final time that Your Honor might be talking about is when there was a last hearing, I believe, and one of the doctors made some comment about what I said. 
    I didn't say that. 
    That may be Mr. Perry's auditory delusions, but I didn't say that.

    Mr. Keith B. Nordyre 
    We don't know, because his best interests were not a focus of any of the hearings. 
    None of the hearings that we had focused on what Mr. Perry... what was good for Mr. Perry, what was bad for Mr. Perry, how much was good, how much was bad. 
    The problem is that we didn't use the medical model throughout. 
    As Your Honor knows from the Harper case last term, this sort of medication has got problems with it. 
    It's got side effects. 
    It's got dangers. 
    And the use of these medications, as dangerous as they are, may be good for inmates under some circumstances. 
    But it's a constant push and pull and a tension, a medical risk reward analysis, that the physicians need to undertake and that wasn't done.

 But that wasn't the purpose. 
 The purpose was simply to have him, even if it hurt him enormously, to have him rational for one brief instance so he could be executed. 
 I don't see anything in the record that justifies that. 
 Mr. Nordyke, in that respect there has been discussion up here about the wording of the order. 
 It is the order of October 21, '88, isn't it?

    --Well, the answers to that are varied. 
    First of all, under Ford v. Wainwright, Your Honor, we constitutionally don't do so. 
    And secondly, under Louisiana law, perhaps even more importantly if Ford were to disappear, under Louisiana law there's a liberty interest that has been created both by State v. Allen a number of years ago and State v. Perry where, in the Perry case itself, the Louisiana Supreme Court said that Louisiana does not execute the insane. 
    They cited Ford v. Wainwright further down in the opinion, but that was not the basis for which they made the decision that Louisiana does not execute the insane.

    We believe it's fundamentally wrong under the Eighth and that the Eighth prohibits this sort of use of forcible medication. 
    We also think that there's a consensus against the use of forcible medication that is created by the States. 
    No State has authorized the use of this medication for purposes of punishment. 
    And we think that the fact that no State has authorized it is important. 
    Secondly, the amicus in this case, the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association, have filed a brief saying that from their perspective it's fundamentally wrong and ethically wrong. 
    And I think that that second element of a consensus starts with those two organizations. 
    They are the organizations that will have to carry out this order and they have to know more about this sort of thing than any other group.

    The position that we have taken in this case and taken in brief is that first we believe it unconstitutional under the Eighth.

    The court did specifically find, by asking questions of the individual doctors, whether this medication was good for him. 
    The doctors, including Cox, Jimenez, and Vincent collectively said, this medication is in his medical interest because it is one, rational. 
    Two, it is appropriate. 
    And three, it is beneficial.

    Mr. Rene' I. Salomon 
    I don't think there was a finding that he will be a danger without the medication. 
    But the State's position in this case is when you examine this title XV, section 830.1, the State need not prove that he is dangerous to himself in order to justify medication in this particular example. 
    What we respond to my colleague's argument here is that 830.1 is not the particular statute that governs this particular case, as was in the case of, I believe, Kentucky v. Thompson in dealing with visitation privileges. 
    We have a scenario where a State statute specifically says, you can do medication where the inmate is dangerous, and that is a sufficient condition on which the State may choose to exercise its ability to medicate.

    Mr. Rene' I. Salomon 
    Well, I believe that it does comply with Harper and in the State's view, Harper indicates the appropriate result in this case. 
    If, for example in Harper, mental illness can justify involuntary medical treatment in order to prevent dangerousness to the individual, to others, or to even their property, then certainly the State's interest in this case is at least that great if not greater.

    Absolutely. 
    That is correct what the judge said. 
    And what we are saying, Justice O'Connor, is basically that Harper, once again, if you can medicate a person who's mentally ill to protect property, you certainly should be able to do it to enforce the court's interest in its laws and in obtaining its punishment. 
    To respond to a point made by Mr. Nordyke also, we believe that in this particular case there is less of an interest on behalf of the inmate for the simple reason in Harper there was an individual who one day was going to get out of jail, who had a long-term interest of the effects that might result from the administration of the medication. 
    In this particular case, because this man is sentenced to death, his opportunity to live the number of years in which he will be alive are limited, not as if the matter in Harper, where we have an infinite number of years where the individual may stay alive.

    Mr. Rene' I. Salomon 
    It did not. 
    And I don't think that the court was clear to be very frank that it did or it did not apply. 
    The court was somewhat in a vague area whether or not this statute, 830.1, applied in this particular case. 
    As Mr. Nordyke said, at one juncture he used a part of 830.1 to stay the medication. 
    At another juncture he said, no, my interests are different and conducted a somewhat different analysis.

    That is in dispute. 
    It depends on where you can draw the line as to he has a blood serum level that allows him the opportunity to make such a decision. 
    Some of the doctors have said that it will take 3 months of consistent treatment, that is, one injection every 4 weeks, for him to reach a plateau where he would be able to act as if he were not hallucinating or having delusions or showing symptoms of psychosis.

    And in this particular case, we feel that an examination of the facts and the law according to Turner v. Safley, as was applied in Washington v. Harper, is appropriate. 
    And if you do this testing a standard of reasonableness, that is, whether the court's order is reasonably related to a legitimate penalogical interest, the State of Louisiana submits that this court order is appropriate in this case, because it is related to a legitimate penalogical interest.

    Mr. Rene' I. Salomon 
    --Right, but I think the State of Louisiana is limited by the Eighth Amendment and other provisions that we can't do things that are cruel or unusual or excessive in nature. 
    And I think that we have to meet some minimal due process guidelines here procedurally in what we can and cannot do. 
    Now this particular inmate has previously to go to trial been treated. 
    And he has been medicated at the forensic facility in order to establish competency for trial. 
    Louisiana, like several other States, does allow for the treatment of incompetent defendants in order to establish competency for trial. 
    We submit that if Louisiana can establish competency for a defendant to go to trial when that individual's presumption of innocence and other rights are at its zenith, then the State of Louisiana should be allowed to establish competency in order to carry out its sentence in this particular case.

    Well, I think that it may be, to be very candid, Justice O'Connor, but I don't think that you always have to establish dangerousness in order to justify the involuntary or some other administration of medication in order to establish competency.

    And there are some States that do not.

    Mr. Rene' I. Salomon 
    That's exactly right. 
    Many of his rights, as I have said, have been limited, and that includes, for example, his right to life and his right to self-determination of sorts. 
    To honor Mr. Perry's request in this case, that is his refusal of medication and beneficial medical treatment, I might add, would be to be contrary to several valid interests. 
    First, I think that it's correct to say that the inmate's right to some sort of self-determination has been greatly diminished by the fact that he has been convicted of a capital murder and that he has been sentenced to death. 
    And I think also that once that right of the State to impose punishment is established, that we recognize in some sort of inferential way that the State is the entity that chooses what a punishment shall be. 
    And if we in this case honor Mr. Perry's right to refuse medical treatment as indicated in the record, then I think we give, in a way, to Perry the opportunity to choose his punishment.

    Mr. Rene' I. Salomon 
    That's true, but I still say that even though the State might have an interest in seeing its penalty satisfied, that a Turner v. Safley analysis says that you have to have a legitimate penalogical interest. 
    And possibly in your hypothetical, the State's interest would be reduced if there is not beneficial medication. 
    Because there's a benefit to the individual. 
    There is an interest of the State to carry out its punishment bottom line. 
    But it's limited. 
    And it's limited by things like what's legitimate and what's going to be cruel and unusual.

    Mr. Rene' I. Salomon 
    Beyond the trial court's analysis in this particular case, the trial court did not conduct any national consensus search, but we submit to this Court today that there is no State legislation that exists anywhere prohibiting involuntary medication for a competency to execute. 
    In fact we suggest that one State, the State of Maryland, does specifically allow competency to be based on the involuntary administration of medication. 
    In fact, of 37 States which have the death penalty, 24 of those States contemplate in one fashion or another that treatment can occur. 
    And it's basically premised upon a finding that executions cannot be carried out until competency is established, restored, or regained. 
    If on the one hand, we know that we can't or cannot execute those who are incompetent and on the other hand, we can, if they are restored to sanity, the State suggests something happens between those two points. 
    And the something that happens is these 24 States basically permit the administration of medication to establish competency for execution.

    No, I do not. 
    My colleague in this case has spent some time in his brief talking in terms of procedural due process was violated in this matter and we would submit to the Court again that the court, the trial court, utilized far beyond the procedures required in Ford v. Wainwright to determine the interests of Mr. Perry, the interests of the State, and whether the State's interests would supersede. 
    In Ford, the court was basically required to afford an opportunity to be heard, a neutral decision maker, and those things were in fact provided to Mr. Perry, in addition to many other matters. 
    If the Court would have any further questions on any of these matters, I'd be pleased to answer them.

    Mr. Rene' I. Salomon 
    Difficult question. 
    I checked as recently as yesterday and it depends how you define what is forcible medication. 
    The scenario that has occurred as of June the 20th or so of 1990 was that the doctors determined that Mr. Perry was in some kind of episode where he was dangerous and they said to him, we want to give you medicine. 
    Are you willing to take it? 
    And if you're not willing to take it, we're going to make you take it and basically he said, yes, I'll take it. 
    And he has taken the medicine in June, August, and September, and as recently as a week ago, one of the supervising physicians did in fact enter another standing order for 3 months' worth of treatment, which would be one injection every 4 weeks of approximately 200 milligrams of the medication known as Haldoldeconate, which is a long-acting and lasting medication.

    Thank you, Mr. Salomon. 
    Mr. Nordyke, you have rebuttal. 
    You have 2 minutes remaining. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Keith B. Nordyre
speaker="keith_b_nordyre" startTime="3208.365" stopTime="3313.742">
    Mr. Keith B. Nordyre 
    First let me address the Maryland statute that counsel addressed. 
    The Maryland statute, if one would examine the legislative history of that statute, as we have, would indicate that the Maryland legislature was very concerned about the ethics of doctors. 
    They adopted exactly the approach that the AMA would suggest in this case. 
    There is a legislative task force history of that statute that is available and subsequent to Ford v. Wainwright, that statute was reenacted and they commute after one opportunity at a hearing. 
    The statute does say that a person is not incompetent merely because of the continued administration of psychotropic medication. 
    But what I suggest that suggests is somebody that would otherwise be sane even without the medication. 
    Secondly, turning to the Turner v. Safley analysis that counsel suggested, Turner simply doesn't apply. 
    Turner is a method of analysis that applies to a prison regulation. 
    This is a statute that we're talking about. 
    And if it's not a statute it's certainly the Eighth Amendment. 
    Justice Marshall asked about the injections. 
    They are in fact injections and the Haldoldeconate is a large enough injection where they have to be broken down into several shots each time in order to give them. 
    The question of whether it was good for him and it doesn't appear anywhere in the record. 
    I still think it doesn't. 
    And the reason that I think counsel says that it appears in the record is that the questions that were posed were, can you make him competent to be executed? 
    The questions that were directed to the physicians on the witness stand had to do with competency to be executed and not whether or not any of these medications were in Mr. Perry's best interest. 
    We likewise have spoken to Mr. Perry, not the physicians, in the last 2 weeks. 
    He believes that the monthly shots he's getting are lethal injections. 
    Thank you.
