    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The first one of these is Eastern Airlines versus Floyd No. 89-1598. 
    This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
    Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention sets forth conditions for liability of international air carriers for injuries to passengers. 
    The question in this case is whether passengers who suffered only mental distress or emotional injury from an airplane accident can recover on Article 17. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we hold that Article 17 does not allow recovery for purely mental injuries. 
    We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.
