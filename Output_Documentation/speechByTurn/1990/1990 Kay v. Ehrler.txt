    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The petitioner in this case is a lawyer who twiced requested the Kentucky Board of Elections to place his name on the Democratic Party's primary ballot for the office of President of the United States. 
    When the Board refused to do so, he brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the Kentucky statute on which the Board had relied. 
    He ultimately prevailed and sought an award of reasonable attorney's fee pursuant to the fee shifting provision of the Civil Rights Act. 
    We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the circuits concerning the question whether a lawyer who represents himself in this kind of litigation maybe be awarded such a fee. 
    For reasons stated in a unanimous opinion, we conclude that such a fee award is not authorized by the statue and therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
