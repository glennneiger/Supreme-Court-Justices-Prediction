    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The third case which I have to announce is Florida against Jimeno No. 90-622. 
    The respondent in this case, Louis Jimeno, was stopped by the police in Florida for a traffic violation. 
    The police asked him for permission to search his car for drugs. 
    Jimeno gave his consent. 
    The police searched and discovered a paper bag containing a killer gram of cocaine on the floorboard of the car. 
    The Florida Supreme Court suppressed this evidence based upon its view that under the Fourth Amendment, a general consent to the search of ones car does not extend to close containers such as the bag found here in the car. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    The scope of a consent search is defined by the terms of the consent. 
    A police officer here told Jimeno he had reason to suspect there were narcotics in the car. 
    He asked for permission to search it. 
    Jimeno granted permission, placed no limitation on the consent. 
    Under these circumstances, it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that Jimenos consent extended to a paper bag lying on the floor of the car, a bag which might contain drugs. 
    A reasonable officer would know that narcotics are generally carried in some form of container. 
    The Fourth Amendment requires only that a search be reasonable under the terms of the consent and we hold that this one was reasonable. 
    Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens joined.
