    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The petitioner in this case, Pearly Wilson, is a prison inmate in Ohio. 
    He sued the respondents, who are prison officials, alleging that certain conditions of his confinement constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    The District Court granted summary judgment for the prison officials. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that Wilson's affidavits failed to establish the requisite culpable state of mind on the part of the officials. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we agree with the Sixth Circuit that an inmate claiming that prison conditions violate the Eighth Amendment must show a culpable state of mind on the part of the officials. 
    This requirement is implicit in that Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. 
    The Sixth Circuit, however, appears to have applied an overly exacting intense standard, stating that the official's conduct must be marked by "persistent malicious cruelty." 
    The appropriate standard is the one we have long applied to prisoner claims involving medical care, namely deliberate indifference. 
    We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for reconsideration under that standard. 
    Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens have joined.
