    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case involves a respective rights of New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma to the waters of the Canadian River. 
    The Court pointed a Special Master. 
    The Special Master has filed a report and the States have filed exceptions to that report. 
    The case was argued and we now sustain the exceptions in part and overrule the exceptions in part. 
    And the case has remanded to the Special Master for further proceedings, just the Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part and Justice's O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy have joined the Chief Justice.
