    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    The first case is No. 89-1629, Salve Regina College against Russell. 
    This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
    The issue is whether a Federal Appellate Court may review a District Court’s determination of state law under a standard that is less probing than that applied to a determination of federal law. 
    Respondent filed a diversity action in Federal Court alleging that the petitioner, College, had breached an implied agreement to educate her when it asked her to withdraw from its nursing program for failing to meet certain weight loss commitments. 
    The District Court concluded that the Supreme Court of Rhode Island would apply the commercial doctrine of substantial performance in this academic setting. 
    The jury returned a verdict for respondent and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    It held that appellate deference made by a federal judge of that state was not an error. 
    In an opinion filed today, we reverse that judgment and remand the case. 
    We hold that a Federal Court of Appeals must review de novo a District Court’s state law determination in a diversity case. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion, and is joined by Justice White and Justice Stevens.
