    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes to the court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
    The petitioner, FMC Corporation, self-funded healthcare plans, paid a portion of the respondents medical expenses resulting from an automobile accident. 
    FMC then informed respondent that it would seek reimbursement under the plans subrogation provision from any recovery she realized in her Pennsylvania negligence action against the driver of the vehicle in which she was injured. 
    The respondent subsequently sought and obtained a declaratory judgment in Federal District Court that Section 1720 of Pennsylvanias motor vehicle financial responsibility law, which precludes reimbursement from a claimants tort recovery or benefit payments by a program, group, contractor, or other arrangements, prohibits FMCs exercise of subrogation rights. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed holding that the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA which applies to employee welfare benefit plan such as FMCs, does not preempt the state statute. 
    In the opinion filed today, we examine the scope of Section 514b2b of ERISA otherwise known as the deemer clause. 
    The deemer clause sates that an employee benefit plan shall not be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer or to be engaged in the business of insurance for purposes of any state law reporting to regulate insurance companies or insurance contracts. 
    We hold that this deemer clause excludes self-funded ERISA plans, such as FMCs plan, from the reach of state laws that regulate insurance. 
    Thus, Pennsylvanias Section 1720 is preempted. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed accordingly and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Justice Souter took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
