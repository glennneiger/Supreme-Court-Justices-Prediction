Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Haslip

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first in Number 89-1279, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Cleopatra Haslip. 
    Mr. Beckman.

    Mr. Bruce A. Beckman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This matter is here on writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court. 
    That judgment affirmed and awarded punitive damages against the Petitioner, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company, on a respondeat superior basis for fraud committed by a sales agent in collecting and pocketing premiums from a policy of group health insurance issued by another carrier, Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company, and also on individual policies of life insurance issued by Pacific Mutual. 
    The insurance was issued to cover employees of the City of Roosevelt, which is a small town in Alabama. 
    During the course of the trial, all counts asserted by plaintiffs alleging any wrongdoing against Pacific Mutual directly were dismissed and abandoned, so that the sole basis of the award was respondeat superior, or the fraud of the agent. 
    The major portion of the award went to Mrs. Haslip because she incurred medical expenses during a period which would have been covered by the Union Fidelity policy had the agent not misappropriated the premiums. 
    She was apparently unable to pay the hospital expenses, and a judgment was entered against her. 
    And that appears to explain the great disparity in the award that went to her, and the relatively nominal awards that went to the other plaintiffs.

    Mr. Bruce A. Beckman 
    Justice O'Connor, under Alabama law, the punitive damage award to Mrs. Haslip would have been at least $840,000, because the maximum... she had a prayer for $3 million of punitive damages, and a prayer for her actual damages, plus emotional distress damages of $200,000. 
    The award to her was $1,040,000, so that if we assumed that she got the full general, actual, economic damages, and emotional distress damages, for which she prayed, the punitive award still would have been at least $840,000, and that would have been the computation under Alabama law. 
    The plaintiffs themselves submitted the case to the Alabama Supreme Court--

    Mr. Bruce A. Beckman 
    Yes, Justice Stevens. 
    Pacific Mutual has petitioned this Court to vacate a judgment of the Alabama Court and the award of punitive damages as violating the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Of the issues that were briefed and submitted here on behalf of the petitioner, I would like to focus my argument on three central issues: 
    First, that the open-ended, standardless discretion delegated by Alabama law to the jury here to determine whether or not to punish Pacific Mutual for the agent's fraud, and if so, how much, violated due process. 
    Second, that the system of judicial review in place in Alabama did not cure those violations, and third, that respondeat superior on the record in this case is not a constitutionally permissible basis for imposing punishment on Pacific Mutual.

    Mr. Bruce A. Beckman 
    Petitioner submits that that is correct, Your Honor. 
    The... in... for compensatory damages under respondeat superior, the rationale of it is that where one of two innocent people should suffer because of acts of an agent, wrongful acts of an agent, the principal who put the agent in a position to cause the injury should bear the loss. 
    Imposing punishment on a principal who, as in this case, was in fact a victim of, in effect, embezzlement... is not a rational basis for punishment.

    Mr. Bruce A. Beckman 
    There's... there is... that is a different situation than we have here. 
    Under the Sherman Act, for example, or a regulatory program, the company is under a direct obligation to comply with the law. 
    And if in fact fines or triple damages under the Sherman Act are sought to be imposed upon it because of the violation by the company, and the company comes in and tries to defend saying well, high-level management or the responsible people didn't authorize those acts or know that they were going on. 
    And the courts have held that if that action is taken in the course of the company's business, and to further its profits, the company management can't come in and say well, we didn't know what was going on, and avoid liability. 
    But the situation is different, I submit, where the agent, even a high-level officer, is affirmatively acting against the company's interest, and is in fact, as here, embezzling, or stealing the money--

 That's... that's your position? 
 Even though the company put this officer in a position where he could do this, you know, put him in charge of all its chemicals, so that he was in a position to dirty the earth, which is what he wanted to do, you couldn't punish the company for that?

    And with respect to Pacific Mutual's basic due process point presented here, Alabama law delegated complete discretion to the jury to determine whether or not to punish Pacific Mutual for the agent's fraud, and if so, how much. 
    The Alabama legislature had never established any limits on permissible punishment for conduct, or for punitive damages generally, and the decisions of the Alabama Supreme Court recognized that in Alabama there was no legal measure which limited these awards.

    Mr. Bruce A. Beckman 
    Yes. 
    One... well, two come to mind, and one that would not work. 
    If you're talking about overall standards for limiting punitive damages awards, which I understand to be your question, it would... it... I'm sure there is a continuum of solutions which would be acceptable and meet due process requirements. 
    But one which certainly would be for the legislature to take various categories of conduct which are subject to this umbrella penalty, which is a whole spectrum of torts and tortious breach of contract in Alabama, and define the categories of conduct and specify the penalties for those... those specified items of conduct, much as in a penal code. 
    The other could be, and still meet, I think, the concerns which have been expressed by some members of this Court and... with respect to punitive damages, and have... try to have an umbrella remedy, a situation where you had either a fraction or a multiple of actual economic harm caused, which would cause the award to have some reasonable relationship to... or a necessary relationship to actual harm, plus attorney's fees, to take care of small cases which might not otherwise be brought. 
    And I would suggest also a cap, and then the... even the amount of a multiple of actual damages, to take care of the cases such as cited in the amicus brief of the national accounting firms, where there would be a large corporation where a lot of money was involved but a very small degree of fault.

    No, Justice O'Connor, it would not. 
    Those factors are highly judgmental, subjective, and would not remove from the jury the personal discretion to impose punishment on a... virtually a limitless amount.

    Mr. Bruce A. Beckman 
    Yes. 
    The... yes, the Hammond factors, there's really only three of them that are at all substantive. 
    The first is that the award should bear some reasonable relationship to actual damages. 
    But in practice, that has proven to be a meaningless test, because any... any relationship can be and has been held to be reasonable. 
    And further, in Alabama, at least, about the same time the Hammond case was decided, the Alabama Supreme Court overruled an earlier decision which had required a... a... required relationship between actuals and punitives and adopted a rule that there was no necessary relationship between actuals and punitives. 
    And the second Hammond factor is to consider the reprehensibility of the conduct. 
    That is really only putting the... in different words what the jury here was instructed to consider, which was character and degree of the wrong, and it is just as vague. 
    And in fact this Court noted that reprehensibility was not a suitable, or a sufficiently precise basis for imposing punishment in the Giaccio v. Pennsylvania case. 
    The third, relatively substantive, Hammond factor was the wealth of the defendant. 
    The wealth of the defendant factor, when you take that into account, really only ensures that a large corporation, with a jury argument that the award has to be enough to hurt and sting, is going to ensure that there is in effect a multimillion dollar award, even if there is a very small degree of fault, and... I submit on behalf of the petitioner that those factors just would not adequately control the jury's discretion.

    Because it is so high that it wouldn't be fair notice of what the actual penalties would be. 
    I mean, it's like having life imprisonment for a traffic offense. 
    It wouldn't take the discretion away from the sentencing authority to give virtually any sentence for a minor offense, and there would be no real notice to anyone of what the penalty might be, and it would certainly not cure the open-ended discretion of the sentencer in that situation.

    Very well, Mr. Beckman. 
    Mr. Ennis, we'll hear now from you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="1608.543" stopTime="1809.268">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Alabama provides two levels of protection for defendants facing the possibility of punitive damages. 
    First, the jury sets the award pursuant to the traditional common law standards, then, trial and appellate courts independently reassess the award pursuant to even more protective standards. 
    Let me talk first about the jury instructions. 
    The jury was instructed, with respect to the State's purpose in punitive damage awards, that they are to punish and deter, that they are not to compensate the plaintiff, or not to be a windfall to the plaintiff, and the jury was instructed that the amount of the award must be tailored to the character and the degree of the wrong as shown by the evidence in that particular case. 
    Pacific Mutual did not object to those common law instructions at the trial, and did not request any more specific instructions at trial. 
    Those common law standards, by themselves, certainly satisfy traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. 
    They have been used and approved by courts throughout the land for 200 years, and no court has ever found them violative of due process. 
    Despite enormous pressure on State legislatures and Congress in the past 15 years, those are still the standards that are used in nearly every State today. 
    These standards, as the Court recognized in Day v. Woodworth, were well established before the due process clause was adopted. 
    In fact, in another Alabama case, Louis Pizitz, decided by this Court in 1927, this Court upheld those very common law standards and unanimously rejected precisely the same due process challenge Pacific Mutual is raising again... that these common law standards gave the jury "unbridled discretion" to fix the punitive amount 
    "without any method of ascertainment and without any limit to the amount it may impose. " 
    That argument was rejected unanimously in Pizitz. 
    Earlier, in Standard Oil v. Missouri, this Court also upheld against due process attack a punitive fine where there were no standards for determining the amount and no maximum. 
    That was a State antitrust fine, but the Court relied for its decision expressly on the analogy to punitive damage proceedings. 
    I think that there is simply no anchor in the text of the due process clause, and there is certainly no established societal norm from which the Court could define or develop new standards. 
    In this circumstance, where these standards have been used and thought to be fair for over 200 years, and where, even today, Pacific Mutual does not suggest specific standards for determining what is the right amount, merely a cap on whatever amount is awarded--

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    Well, Justice O'Connor, I think not, for two reasons. 
    First, this Court's due process decisions in the past have always applied with respect to clarity in the conduct that can trigger a punishment of any type. 
    There must be clear notice of the conduct. 
    That was certainly true in this case. 
    Pacific Mutual was punished for intentional fraud. 
    There is no claim that the conduct at issue in this case was vague. 
    Second, even in the case of capital punishment, in the McGautha decision, this Court ruled that the due process clause does not require more specific standards for determining the sentence of death. 
    In that case, the jury was instructed that it had 
    "absolute discretion to decide whether to sentence to death or not. " 
    and there was absolutely no legislative or judicial guidance as to whether to impose that penalty. 
    The Court decided that, as a matter of due process, that did not violate the Constitution. 
    The next year, in Furman, the Court, of course, did decide under the higher, more rigorous standards of the Eighth Amendment, that capital cases do require guided discretion, but the due process clause does not, as this Court ruled in Pizitz, and ruled in Standard Oil v. Missouri. 
    Let me turn to the second level of protection that Alabama gives defendants in punitive damages cases.

 Before you get off the first, I don't... I don't quibble with your assertion that that has been accepted for many years, but I do... do you really think it's fair to call it a standard? 
 I mean, you say that the standard is telling the jury, essentially, be sure that the punishment fits the crime. 
 That... that is what you describe as a standard.

    I think, Your Honor, that if it could be shown through empirical evidence that there wasn't just an occasional aberrational decision, but that, in a substantial number of cases it was entirely arbitrary and fortuitous whether a particular defendant got hit with a punitive damage award or not, that would raise a due process question with respect to conduct that can subject one to a punitive damage award.

    Well, Your Honor, I am talking right now with respect to civil cases. 
    This is not, obviously, a criminal case where the ex post facto case... ex post factor clause would apply. 
    The ex post facto clause also, I think, is different because it requires... it applies to conduct that was not criminal at the time of the crime.

 Or does this just apply to the amount of the liability, not to the liability itself, which would seem very peculiar? 
 You'd extend that to the whole system, I assume.

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    They just have to have some rational basis, and not be arbitrary, that's correct. 
    And Alabama today ensures that it is not an arbitrary process. 
    The Hammond Hornsby Standard of Review which the Alabama Supreme Court has been adopting since 1986, expressly provides that jury verdicts will be independently reassessed by trial and appellate courts in order to determine whether the amount set by the jury is more than would be necessary to accomplish society's goals of punishment and deterrence. 
    That test has actually been advocated by the insurance industry amicus brief supporting Pacific Mutual as a workable and appropriate test that will protect against arbitrary and irrational punitive awards. 
    That's the test that Alabama applies today.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2364.406" stopTime="2366.607">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Was that test applied in this case?
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="2366.607" stopTime="2367.268">

    Yes, it was, Your Honor.

    Do you think the trial judge's memorandum really reflected what the test is supposed to reflect?
speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="2376.043" stopTime="2435.335">
    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    Well, the trial judge's memorandum does refer to the Hammond opinion and does state that the award was reviewed by the trial court under Hammond. 
    The important thing to understand that it is not just the trial court but the Alabama Supreme Court itself that independently applies these factors. 
    The Alabama Supreme Court has itself reduced or set aside many punitive damage awards, even when the trial court thought they were appropriate. 
    For example, one of the Hammond-type reviews requires a comparability review to ensure fairness of punitive amounts across a range of similar cases. 
    Using that comparability review, which is not equally available to the trial courts because they are not as aware as the Alabama Supreme Court of the range of cases, the Alabama Supreme Court has regularly reduced punitive damage awards when it finds that the amount is outside that reasonable range. 
    Just within the past 10 days, the Alabama Supreme Court has done that twice.

    Well, Your Honor, I think that the cases that established such a substantive limit on what is State economic regulation are very old cases and may not be good law today, but for purposes of this case. 
    I'm not challenging those old cases in which the Court did say that a civil fine or civil penalty which is wholly arbitrary and irrational may violate the substantive component of the due process clause.

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --No, Your Honor, I don't think it does. 
    In this case, let me make very clear that the standard of review that was used by the Alabama Supreme Court is much more protective than the traditional, common law standard of review that was at issue in Browning-Ferris and Bankers Life. 
    There, the courts applied the traditional standard of whether the verdict was the result of bias, passion, prejudice, or corruption. 
    Here, the Alabama Supreme Court applies a much more protective standard, and it will explicitly reduce or set aside a punitive award even if that award was not the result of bias, passion, or prejudice, if the award is greater than is reasonably necessary to accomplish society's objectives of punishment and deterrence, and it measures whether the award exceeds that test by an application of the seven standards in the Hammond Hornsby Standard of Review. 
    In 15 cases since 1986, the Alabama Supreme Court has reduced or set aside jury awards under that standard. 
    This is a standard with teeth. 
    It is a meaningful, meaningful constraint on--

    --Your Honor, there are at least two parts of an answer to that question. 
    The first is, you can't determine how much is appropriate to deter based simply on knowledge of the wealth of a defendant. 
    The jury is instructed they must look at character and the degree of the wrongdoing. 
    Under the Hammond standards, the reviewing courts are instructed to look at how much knowledge the defendant had.

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    --Your Honor, the Alabama Supreme Court looks at those factors. 
    For example, whether the defendant had continuing notice of the particular wrongdoing at issue, whether it took corrective steps or not. 
    There very specific standards, cited at page 32, 33 of our brief, which the courts use to reach that decision. 
    In a recent case, for example, the Alabama Supreme Court noted that the degree of the wrongdoing was sufficient to merit a punitive award by itself, but noted, as the jury does not know, that that same defendant had been hit with a punitive award in another case, and therefore decided that it was not necessary to have a second punitive award against the defendant for the same conduct. 
    That would not rationally further the State's objectives, and so it set aside the punitive award entirely, based upon that factor. 
    The Alabama Supreme Court does the same thing with respect to comparability reviews. 
    It says to itself, all right, here's another insurance bad faith case and a punitive award was set at this amount; we have had seven of these insurance bad faith cases in the past 3 years, and here is what seems to be a reasonable range of punishment in these cases; we think this one exceeds that reasonable range, and reduces it accordingly. 
    It is not a standard of review that simply rubber-stamps the jury. 
    Far from it. 
    In Alabama, I think, unlike any other State of which I'm aware, there is a right for a post-verdict evidentiary hearing at which the defendant can present new evidence that was never presented to the jury in... in support of reducing the punitive award. 
    The defendant can come in and say, the award should be reduced because I am quite poor, and this would absolutely bankrupt me and cripple me. 
    The defendant can come in and say, the award should be reduced because I have already been subjected to a criminal fine for similar conduct. 
    That kind of information would be extremely prejudicial to a jury... for a jury to hear at the liability phase. 
    But Alabama courts give the defendant an evidentiary opportunity to present all relevant evidence, and then, based on that evidence, the courts independently reassess. 
    They are not simply rubber-stamping jury verdicts.

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    Well, let me... let me turn to that, Your Honor. 
    First, Pacific Mutual's argument on vicarious liability is that there must... constitutionally, there must be some element of benefit to the principal. 
    First, that issue is not before the Court, because at the trial level and in the Alabama Supreme Court level, Pacific Mutual never argued that benefit is a constitutional requirement for vicarious liability. 
    It's argument was on quite different grounds. 
    Furthermore, this would be a very inappropriate case to consider that, because indisputably in this case, there was economic benefit to Pacific Mutual. 
    There were at least 3 months of premiums on life insurance policies that Pacific Mutual received and never refunded as a result of these frauds. 
    But turning to the merits of that vicarious liability argument, in both punitive damages cases and antitrust cases and even in criminal cases, this Court has expressly approved vicarious liability without either fault by the principal or benefit to the principal. 
    Again, in the Pizitz case, decided unanimously in 1927, the Court squarely ruled that Alabama, the same system we're talking about here, could impose vicarious liability for punitive damages without fault by the principal. 
    That was a unanimous ruling of this Court. 
    In the Hydro-level case, this Court even went so far as to adopt as rational and wise social policy a rule of vicarious liability for Federal antitrust cases that is indistinguishable from the Alabama rule at issue here. 
    In Hydro-level, this Court ruled that, under the antitrust laws, a principal can be held vicariously liable for antitrust violations by an agent even if the principal was not at all at fault, and even if the principal did not benefit. 
    Now, I know that some justices of this Court dissented from Hydro-level and did not think that was the wisest or most rational... the best policy choice, but the fact that the Court as a Court reached that conclusion shows that that decision is at least a rational judgment. 
    Alabama has made that rational judgment, and it should be upheld. 
    Finally, even in criminal cases--

    Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr. 
    No, you don't, Your Honor, not at all. 
    This is not a policy case. 
    This is a constitutional case before the Court, and you certainly don't have to as a policy matter. 
    Even in criminal cases, this Court has upheld vicarious criminal liability without fault or benefit. 
    In the Park and Daughterwite cases, the Court even went so far as to rule that an individual officer of a company can be held criminally liable on vicarious liability principles for the wrongdoing of an agent of which the principal was not aware, and from which the principal did not benefit. 
    It seems to me to follow a fortiori that if vicarious liability is appropriate even in that criminal context, it is appropriate here. 
    Let me simply conclude, since my time is almost to expire, by saying that the principal issue here I think is the standards issue. 
    I think that Alabama has developed a rational system for achieving legitimate and very important State objectives. 
    Alabama provides substantially more protection than the common law standards that were well established when the due process clause was adopted and that are still the prevailing standards today. 
    This Court should not expand upon that traditional understanding of due process and throw settled State tort law into complete disarray without compelling evidence that the punitive damage awards are fundamentally unfair in the majority of cases, and without compelling reason to believe that the legislative process is closed or is incapable of addressing that problem. 
    There does not have to be a constitutional remedy for every social problem. 
    In this case, I think this is a paradigmatic case for judicial restraint, not judicial activism. 
    Thank you very much. 
    Thank you, Mr. Ennis. 
    Mr. Beckman, you have 2 minutes remaining. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Bruce A. Beckman
speaker="bruce_a_beckman" startTime="3335.238" stopTime="3475.751">
    Mr. Bruce A. Beckman 
    The jury instruction in this case, and the common law jury instruction in Alabama really left the jury entirely to its own internal resources in deciding whether or not to punish and, if so, how much. 
    It was recognized rather forthrightly by Justice Houston of the Alabama Supreme Court in a subsequent decision to ours that that instruction was incomprehensibly vague and incomprehensible as a gauge for the jury to use in measuring the amount of a punitive award. 
    And he noted the consequences of that vagueness in two recent cases that had come before the Alabama Supreme Court, where he found the facts to be identical and the jury instructions to be identical, and in fact identical to the instruction here, and in one the jury came in with an award of $2,500,000, and in the other, $21,000. 
    In the jury room when the question came up, shall we punish Pacific Mutual for the agent's fraud, all it had to go on was its own notions of right and wrong or whether or no. 
    All it was told by Alabama law was that you have discretion. 
    You can if you want. 
    Similarly, when it had decided to make the award and say, we're going to punish Pacific Mutual for the agent's fraud, how much should we award, all the instructions told them was, you've got discretion. 
    It's any amount you want. 
    I suggest that that is exactly the arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement that due process condemns, and would respond... in response to Respondent's contention that due process requires no notice of penalty, I'd suggest that that's a rather crabbed and narrow view of due process, and prior decisions of this Court have held that the fair notice portions... concerns of the ex post facto clauses are included within the concept of fundamental fairness included in the due process clauses of both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    If you could imagine a statute--
