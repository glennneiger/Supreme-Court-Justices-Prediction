    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Petitioner here, Paul McNeil, was charged with armed robbery in West Allis, Wisconsin. 
    At his bail hearing, a public defender was appointed to represent him. 
    While he was in jail on that charge, McNeil was approached by police about an unrelated crime, a murder in Caledonia, Wisconsin. 
    Before beginning the questioning, the police advised McNeil of his Miranda rights which he expressly waived. 
    He then proceeded to make statements incriminating himself in the Caledonia murder and was subsequently charged with that crime. 
    The Trial Court ruled McNeil’s statements admissible and he was convicted. 
    On appeal, McNeil argued that his request for a public defender at the bail hearing on the West Allis armed robbery charge should be construed as an invocation of his Miranda right to counsel which under this Court’s precedents would automatically render invalid his subsequent express waiver of his Miranda rights. 
    The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected that claim. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm that judgment. 
    An accused's invocation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel during a judicial proceeding does not constitute an invocation of the right to counsel that this Court derived in Miranda from the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee against compelled self-incrimination. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissent which Justice Marshall and Justice Blackmun have joined.
