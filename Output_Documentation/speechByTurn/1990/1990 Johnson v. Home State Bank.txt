    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
    The issue is whether a mortgage lien that passes through the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy is a claim subject to inclusion in the Chapter 13 reorganization plan. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that a mortgage lien, in such circumstances, is a claim under the Bankruptcy Code. 
    We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Tenth Circuit.
