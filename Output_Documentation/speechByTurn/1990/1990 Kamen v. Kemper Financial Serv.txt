    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In the other case, Kamen versus Kemper Financial Services Incorporated, No. 90-516, is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
    In a shareholder derivative action, the plaintiff typically must make a demand on the board of directors before bringing suit. 
    The question in this case is whether federal common law recognizes a futility exception in this requirement in a derivative action under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that a court in such a suit must apply the futility exception as defined by state law. 
    We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.
