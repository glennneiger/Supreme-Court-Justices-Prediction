    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The second case, United States versus Centennial Savings Bank No. 89-1926, is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that a lending institution realizes deductible losses when it exchanges mortgage loan with another lender. 
    We also hold that family withdrawal from these accounts collected by a savings account do not qualify as income from the discharge of in debt following under Section 108 of the tax code. 
    We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Fifth Circuit. 
    Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice White joins.
