Navarette v. California

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We'll hear argument in Case 12-9490, Navarette v. California. 
    Mr. Kleven.
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="5.987" stopTime="53.218">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In this case, the Court should hold that officers acting on anonymous tips must corroborate the tips' assertions of illegal conduct as well as the identifying details before making a stop, whether that tip involves erratic driving, illegal gun possession, or any other allegation of misconduct. 
    Now, the State proposes that the reasonable suspicion rule established in Terry v. Ohio, which courts and law enforcement officials have been applying now for more than 40 years, should be altered so that now it applies as a sliding scale where the level of suspicion varies depending on the nature of the crime that an anonymous tipster claims someone has committed.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="53.218" stopTime="70.260">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    So if the tip -- if the tip is, is this car is driving by and throwing bombs out the window, okay, every, you know, whatever, 500 yards, the police find the car, they have to wait until they see the person actually throw a bomb out the window themselves before pulling them over?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="70.260" stopTime="86.456">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    Well, Your Honor, in terms of the reasonable suspicion, yes. 
    If all they have is an anonymous tip and there is no -- they have no way of corroborating any of the -- any of the innocent details except that they can identify the car, then, yes, under--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="86.456" stopTime="94.043">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    So your answer is yes, the car is going there and he's throwing a bomb out and it goes off, but he has to wait till he sees them throw out another bomb?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="94.043" stopTime="110.319">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --Your Honor, under the Florida-J. 
    L., the Court has said when they are looking -- when all that they are able to corroborate are obvious reasonably observable details, such as that, then there is no basis for the Court to go beyond that--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="110.319" stopTime="120.524">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I thought that J.L. gave an example of an exception that the report is somebody is carrying a bomb?

    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --Well, there is that exception, Your Honor. 
    And in Florida-J. 
    L. it said that it was not, the Court said that it was not required on the facts of that case to speculate about a situation where such a serious danger--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Throwing bombs doesn't count, but carrying a bomb does, is that it?

    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --Your Honor, that would not make a difference. 
    However, in this case, in terms of adjusting the reasonable suspicion standard, the Court should not address that. 
    The Court has never said--

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Excuse me. 
    I'm sorry. 
    Could I ask you what you mean by an anonymous tip? 
    Suppose somebody calls up 911 and gives a name? 
    Does that make it not an anonymous tip?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="164.889" stopTime="180.332">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --Your Honor, technically it would not be, but in the circumstances here, I think it should be treated as an anonymous tip because, again, the name could be false when the tip first comes in. 
    If it's corroborated in some way, then--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="180.332" stopTime="194.139">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Well, how would you corroborate it? 
    Let's say the person calls up and gives a name and gives an address? 
    So what would be necessary? 
    What would the police have to do then before they could stop the vehicle other than observing the vehicle do something illegal?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="194.139" stopTime="221.723">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --Again, if all they have is an assertion by the -- by the tipster that this is the name and the address, if the officers can somehow, again, by caller identification or some other method verify that in fact that is the person so that somewhere down the line that person will be held accountable for a false tip, then it can be treated differently.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="221.723" stopTime="235.566">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, what if you have caller ID. 
    I mean, you have one of these anonymous flip phones, right? 
    You can buy them, it's prepaid. 
    You call up and say, I'm, you know, John Smith, I've seen this and they look, there's the caller, there's the number. 
    Then they can do it?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="235.566" stopTime="243.237">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    No, Your Honor. 
    If all they have is a number, then they are not going to be able to use that as a basis for--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="243.237" stopTime="245.422">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Isn't that all caller ID gives you?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="245.422" stopTime="299.523">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --Well, with caller ID, if they are somehow able to verify, not just that this is coming from this phone, but that in fact there's a particular person there, if they can identify the location, that sort of thing. 
    As the -- as the tip gets more and more like the known informant in the Adams case, then the officers can take more solace in the fact that that person is going to be able to be held responsible. 
    In Adams, of course, there's a situation where there is a known informant who can be arrested immediately if, in fact, the tip turns out to be false. 
    The problem with so many of these cases, with the 911 tape -- 911 caller, is that even if -- is that there's not going to be any sort of accountability even if they do manage to identify the person in terms of showing the tip is false where the allegation, for example, is weaving. 
    There's no way to prove--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="299.523" stopTime="339.383">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    If we transport the standard that applies outside of the vehicle context to this context, what would happen in this situation? 
    A person calls up and says, This is my name, this is my address and it's, it's not blocked by caller ID, so the 911 operator can see that that's the name, that's the address. 
    The person says: This guy ran me off the road. 
    The police find the vehicle. 
    They drive behind the vehicle for a while. 
    They don't -- they don't see any -- they don't see any violation. 
    So then they think, well, this guy must have lied. 
    So are they are going to prosecute the guy for calling that in?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="339.383" stopTime="351.458">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --No, Your Honor, because still they wouldn't be able to prosecute them because the fact that the vehicle is now not weaving doesn't show that they were -- that it was or was not weaving--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="351.458" stopTime="372.187">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    I mean, your argument goes well beyond. 
    You're saying this has to do with anonymous tips, but it really goes well beyond anonymous tips. 
    It covers tips where you know exactly who called in, and what you're saying is they really can never stop a vehicle no matter what kind of a tip they get, unless they see the vehicle committing an illegal act. 
    That's the argument.
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="372.187" stopTime="393.416">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    I'm sorry. 
    No, I don't think it goes that far, Your Honor. 
    I think as the tip becomes -- as the tip contains more detail and as the tipster becomes more accountable for a false tip, again getting more over toward the Adams v. Kennedy, then at some point the anonymous tip would be or--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="393.416" stopTime="403.856">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Give me an example of a situation in which the police can pull somebody over after receiving a tip without actually seeing the vehicle commit an illegal act?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="403.856" stopTime="482.223">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --I think, Your Honor, in a situation where the caller calls in, says I'm, I've been -- this car is driving erratically. 
    The caller then says, I'm following the car. 
    Now, we're at such and such a location. 
    The vehicle has just done something else that's wrong and they continue to follow up to the point where, okay, I can now see the patrol car coming up, again, where the tipster is putting his or her credibility on the line and becomes more and more accountable towards the Adams v. Kennedy known informant, then if you add that together under the totality of the circumstances, then you will have a situation probably to do it. 
    I think it's going to be rare, and I think it should be rare because it is so easy. 
    As the Court has indicated, the Court has shown skepticism for anonymous tips because the tipsters are able to harass other people without running any risk of being held accountable and it should be particularly skeptical in the case of anonymous tips about erratic driving, because with the ubiquitous cell phones, it's so easy for somebody who's on the road, who's been annoyed by somebody else to just pull out the cell phone and call in a false tip.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="482.223" stopTime="489.379">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Do we have any indication that this is a serious problem? 
    The false tips?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="489.379" stopTime="539.429">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    Well, there's no empirical evidence in the record. 
    However, it was the same concern that led the Court in J.L. to refuse to adopt the firearm exception, the concern that making it so easy for people to subject others to the harassment of a -- of a stop and -- and potential -- potential search concerned the Court enough that it denied -- it refused to adopt the firearm exception. 
    And in this case, we have a firearm exception -- we have an exception that's being requested that's doctrinally the same as a firearm exception. 
    There -- there is no indication in the record that drunk driving on its own in totality presents a more serious threat to public safety than -- than firearms do. 
    In fact, it--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="539.429" stopTime="546.933">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, is that -- is that true? 
    I mean, how many people die from drunk driving versus how many people die from firearms?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="546.933" stopTime="592.714">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --The most recent -- the most recent statistics show a little more, about 11,000 people die from homicides by firearms, and it's usually under 10,000 now that are driving -- dying by drunk driving. 
    And in terms of public safety, approximately two-thirds of the people who die as a result of drunk driving are the drunk drivers themselves. 
    So, in fact, the overall threat to public safety is not as great when you're talking about drunk driving as -- as with firearms. 
    And the Court indicated in J.L. that it was specifically concerned about the serious threat that armed criminals pose to public safety and, despite that serious threat, they denied -- the Court denied the firearms exception. 
    Now, what the -- excuse me.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="592.714" stopTime="606.806">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I was just going to say, we have held that the -- the standards are loosened in the vehicle context because your expectation of privacy is diminished when you're out on the road driving along in -- in a vehicle. 
    Does that have any pertinence?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="606.806" stopTime="632.022">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    I don't think so in this case, Your Honor, because even though it's diminished as opposed to, for example, in the home, it's -- in J.L., of course, the person was on a public sidewalk; the person was not in the home. 
    And in Prouse, the Court talked about the fact that in modern day times, people -- a lot of people will feel more of a sense of security, they'll feel more privacy in a vehicle than they would out on the street.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="632.022" stopTime="638.026">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    But in the context in which we've approved sobriety checkpoints, why should we get bent out of shape over this?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="638.026" stopTime="672.499">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    Well, Your Honor, in the sobriety checkpoint case, the Court has looked at the intrusion and found that to be at the very rock bottom in terms of intrusion, the fact that somebody is -- along with a number of other people, that they have to submit to a brief stop, it has put that on the lowest -- on the lowest level. 
    And so it's a -- the Court has not approved any situation where individual vehicles, as in this case, are pulled over without reasonable suspicion that, in fact, somebody in that vehicle is engaged in -- in criminal activity.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="672.499" stopTime="678.920">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Well, but why is that an important line? 
    Why should we be more concerned when an individual automobile is pulled over?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="678.920" stopTime="737.124">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    Well, because the -- the intrusion is greater, Your Honor. 
    And the Martinez-Fuentes case and the Brignoni-Ponce case, the Court talked about the very minimal intrusion of the checkpoints as opposed to -- and Prouse talks about this also, that there is a serious intrusion when somebody is pulled over. 
    You have the activation of the emergency lights, you have a siren, you're pulled over possibly in a neighborhood where -- where you're known and people see it, possibly out in the middle of a road in the middle of the night as in the -- the Wells case. 
    And in either circumstance, it is a serious intrusion and one that people are not going to take that lightly. 
    So it's -- it's a different situation. 
    And the Court, again, if they're going to be pulling over individual cars, signaling them out for -- for stops which could, under the Court's rules, again, the driver, all the passengers can be ordered out of the car if -- if the Terry standards are met. 
    They can--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="737.124" stopTime="812.939">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    White suggested that we don't have an absolute rule with respect to requiring independent corroboration of the actual illegal conduct. 
    In White, the -- the tipster gave future predictive information, but all of it was innocent, somebody driving a car and going to a particular place. 
    Now you're asking us to import that wholesale. 
    Why don't we just stick to our general standard, which is the totality of the circumstances, and look at what failure there is in the logic of the California court below. 
    It -- it looked at the quality of the information regarding the vehicle, which is -- a legitimate tipster will tell you what the vehicle looks like and its license plate or enough information so it can be identified. 
    It looked at the caller actually witnessing the event and giving you enough detail to know that it's not a legal conclusion, but an actual event that suggests recklessness. 
    And corroboration of the -- of the details given by the tipster. 
    Isn't that the application of our traditional test?
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="812.939" stopTime="818.159">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --No, Your Honor.

speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="818.159" stopTime="840.089">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Well, that's just not true in Florida v. J.L. because the individual didn't match the description completely and there were two or three individuals there, not just one. 
    And so -- and there was no predictive or no other detail other than someone in this general area.
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="840.089" stopTime="850.464">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    --Well, there was no predictive detail, but in J.L., the tip was a young black male in a plaid shirt at a bus stop.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Correct me if -- if I'm wrong.

    The tip in J.L. was not a -- did not assert that a crime was being committed, so there was something suspicious. 
    There was no crime in possession of the gun.

    --Well -- but unless -- unless the -- the implication is that the gun possession is illegal, then there's no reason for the officer to--

    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    But if -- if the tip calls -- if the tips says I'm looking at a case of gun possession that, as far as I know, is perfectly legal, it's like in this case if the tip came in and said: I've just been passed by a car whose -- which was driven very skillfully, there's no point in -- in pursuing the tip in J.L. unless there's some -- some element of illegality.

    Justice Sotomayor, going back to -- to your concern, so in Florida v.

    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    Well, there is something significant, Your Honor. 
    But, by itself, that just gives the officers some reason to go check and see whether, in fact, there's a chance to corroborate. 
    In the case of an inebriated driver, the fact that the driver is inebriated is concealed in the same way that J.L.'s gun was unless there's some sort of erratic driving going on.

    And somebody calls with an anonymous tip saying this fellow, you know, in this car has got a child in the trunk.

    You can't -- the officers can't see it and, therefore, there's no reason to treat this case any differently than the case in J.L. They have to be able to see something like erratic driving or something else in order to be able to corroborate that.

   Argument of Jeffrey M K Laurence
speaker="jeffrey_m_k_laurence" startTime="1611.164" stopTime="1641.033">
    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    A police officer may act on an anonymous tip that reports reckless or drunk driving by immediately stopping the vehicle, without waiting to personally observe dangerous driving that could threaten others. 
    An officer can reasonably rely on such a tip because the importance of the governmental interest in protecting the public from the ongoing and immediate threat of drunk driving outweighs the minimal intrusion of a traffic stop. 
    Now, Petitioners argue that--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="1641.033" stopTime="1643.135">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Is every reckless driving drunk driving?

    --I'm sorry?

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Is every reckless driving drunk driving?
speaker="jeffrey_m_k_laurence" startTime="1646.853" stopTime="1655.443">
    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence 
    Not every reckless driving is drunk driving. 
    But a report of reckless driving gives reasonable suspicion that the person may be drunk, and that's sufficient for the stop in this case.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="1655.443" stopTime="1675.254">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    How about if somebody just calls and says, X vehicle is driving recklessly, says no more, doesn't describe how, doesn't give you any details as to how they know it. 
    Is that enough for reasonable suspicion?
speaker="jeffrey_m_k_laurence" startTime="1675.254" stopTime="1692.464">
    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence 
    I would say that the term “ reckless ” is. 
    And the reason I say that is because driving is something that's intimately familiar to the average citizen. 
    And when a citizen is going to call in and make a report, when they use the language “ reckless ”, that has meaning. 
    That describes a behavior that poses an ongoing threat to the public.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1692.464" stopTime="1705.705">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But not necessarily drunkenness. 
    I think there -- there are a lot of people that get tickets for reckless driving who have not served jail terms for driving drunk. 
    The two are far from synonymous.
speaker="jeffrey_m_k_laurence" startTime="1705.705" stopTime="1711.276">
    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence 
    Well, I wouldn't say they're synonymous, but I would say that one is the indicator of the other, because while you can--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="1711.276" stopTime="1715.944">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Why? 
    How about speeding? 
    There's plenty of people who speed regularly.
speaker="jeffrey_m_k_laurence" startTime="1715.944" stopTime="1720.079">
    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence 
    --I would say a report of speeding is not sufficient to have reasonable suspicion.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="1720.079" stopTime="1734.672">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Isn't that reckless behavior? 
    So how do you know someone who calls -- my mother, who can't drive above 50, thinks that when I go 51 that I'm speeding and reckless. 
    I'm speeding and reckless.
speaker="jeffrey_m_k_laurence" startTime="1734.672" stopTime="1775.481">
    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence 
    I would say that, once again, the public has lots of familiarity with driving, and they can recognize the difference between poor driving and reckless driving, or something, or drunk driving. 
    And when people are going to pick up the phone and make that call to 911, they're doing so because they perceive a danger on the roadway. 
    And I think while the statistics are sparse on this, the Footnote 2 in the government's brief is particularly helpful in this regard in that they note that for calls that are made to 911 centers for -- that are tracked by the States, between 25 and 50 percent of those calls result in arrests. 
    And what that shows is that the public knows what they see when they make these calls. 
    This is a far--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1775.481" stopTime="1782.486">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And -- and between the, what, 50 and 75 percent they've stopped people without just cause.

    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence

    But if the personal knowledge -- if the officer can use that personal knowledge to confirm, okay, he was correct about the report of the car, report of the location, report of the direction where it's supposed to be going, then you have some indication that the personal knowledge is accurate. 
    As opposed to a bare tip when you're talking about hidden conduct, then you have to look to predicted details.

    The closest case I can think of is Hensley where an officer was relying on an arrest bulletin from another jurisdiction.

    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence

    You're saying that in every case when we have to decide whether the threshold level of reasonable suspicion has been met or whether the level of probable cause has been met, that courts can take into account the seriousness of the offense, and what would not count as probable cause for one crime will count as probable cause for another?

    What I'm saying is that in terms of when we can deem a tip reliable, White identified two components to the inquiry. 
    One is the indicia of reliability and the other was the content of the tip. 
    And so we have to take the seriousness of the offense and the threat to public safety into account in determining when the officer can rely on that information.

    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Well, I don't understand how what you're saying is different from what I just said, and that would seem to me to work quite a substantial change in -- in Fourth Amendment law.

    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence

    Justice Elena Kagan 
    The balancing occurs categorically. 
    We decide that there's a reasonable suspicion standard by balancing interests. 
    What we don't do is say, you know, depending on how serious we think this crime is, more or less will meet that reasonable suspicion standard. 
    That would be a very substantial reworking of Fourth Amendment law or so it seems to me. 
    Maybe I'm wrong.
speaker="jeffrey_m_k_laurence" startTime="2240.480" stopTime="2280.522">
    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence 
    Well, I believe that was something that was indicated in Hensley, that this Court looked to the nature of the offense in deciding whether or not the officer had reasonable suspicion at the inception in making that stop for a crime that had occurred two weeks earlier. 
    And it didn't -- it declined to consider whether or not that would be sufficient for a misdemeanor. 
    But in taking the seriousness of the crime into account in determining whether or not they could make that stop, that's a recognition that balancing does play some role. 
    And in White, this Court recognized that the reliability component is variable. 
    There's a difference between probable cause and reasonable suspicion.

    And it goes to the totality of the circumstances in helping confirm that the person actually observed what they're saying. 
    So that you have -- it goes to the reliability of the personal observation. 
    So it builds -- it adds an additional layer of -- of the indices reliability so the officer can rely on it sooner.

    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence

    And so if that's dissipated, then at that point you have -- the -- the reliability of the tip that you're relying on is not as significant. 
    Put it this way. 
    When you have the threat to public safety balanced in the totality for purposes of reliability, if that dissipates, then you have to go back to the tip itself, whether it is internally reliable or whether it has enough to satisfy J.L.-- 
    I think that when you have an immediate threat, and you have a report of drunk driving, the officer shouldn't have to wait to see that 50 miles to see if they can pass or fail.

    When they observe something, they draw reasonable inferences and determine whether it gives them suspicion. 
    One thing I would point out, that the CHP dispatchers, the testimony in this case reflects that they asked. 
    They asked the driver, well, what did you see? 
    So that they can get that information and pass it along to give the officers as much--

    I think it's an entirely different case if the tip -- if the tip here was, you know, I was at a party. 
    This guy got in his car. 
    He should not have turned the key on in that car. 
    This guy is really drunk. 
    You should stop that car on the road. 
    I think that's totally different from somebody just saying this guy swerved or this guy drove me off the road. 
    You're -- you're just making the assumption that -- that every -- every one of those incidents demonstrates a drunk behind the wheel, and I just don't think that's true.

    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence 
    --Well, again, I would say it's not about demonstrating.

    I've been -- I've been on an expressway, and I've had people go by me at -- they went by in a blur. 
    They must have been going well over a hundred miles an hour. 
    Now, if the police catch up with that person, of course, the person's going to slow down while the police follow the person. 
    And then when the police decide to stop, they're going to go back to engaging in this intentional, extremely dangerous conduct. 
    So I don't understand why there's a distinction between reporting that somebody necessarily is driving erratically, so the person may be impaired, and somebody who is -- where you have extremely reckless driving that's intentional.
speaker="jeffrey_m_k_laurence" startTime="2690.134" stopTime="2708.926">
    Mr. Jeffrey M K Laurence 
    Well, I wouldn't draw that distinction. 
    I think reckless driving, in and of itself, can pose a threat to public safety that also mandates an immediate stop. 
    If someone's playing chicken with another car on the road, if someone is, you know, testing out their new Ferrari, is going a hundred miles an hour weaving in and out of lanes, those all represent threats to public safety. 
    All those circumstances--

    What we have here is we have a tip that, if it was given by a known person, I think would undoubtedly allow the officer to pull that car over immediately.

    Why -- the -- we have the case of the trusted informer. 
    The informer several times has given the police tips and it turned out to be right. 
    And then we have another side, the anonymous person. 
    Then there's somebody who calls, gives a correct name and address, but no record at all of reliability. 
    Why should the fact that the name is known -- the name of the informer is known if the police have no reason to believe one way or another that this informer is reliable?

    And I think one thing that Gates says in the context of somebody who reports a -- a personal observation of a crime is that even if we doubt their veracity, even if we have some question as to their motives, the fact that they are giving a personal observation, they note that it's a personal observation, and giving a detailed account of what occurs, that report is entitled to a greater degree of reliability than--

    All right. 
    Please define for me what behavior would give police officers or what descriptors would be adequate for the police to think someone's drunk. 
    Swerving, I know, has been mentioned. 
    But reckless driving, there's been a lot of discussion that there could be a wide variety of reckless driving.

    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    --So, Your Honor, I think I agree with the observation that there are some behaviors that pose an ongoing threat to others on the roadway, and some driving violations that don't. 
    NHTSA, the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration and other organizations do keep track of what kinds of behavior are associated with drunkenness. 
    And the Court in this case, of course, looked at the particular behavior and said is this really a reckless driving behavior, the kind of behavior that poses this imminent danger? 
    So there is a line that courts would need to draw, but the courts that are engaging in this kind of analysis do draw that. 
    And of course--
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="2921.645" stopTime="2927.047">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Well, what -- what goes on the other side of the line?

    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    --Sure. 
    So examples of behavior on the other might be a seat belt violation, and they also might be behaviors that it's a real judgment call whether a violation occurred or not. 
    So for instance, that person didn't fully stop at a stop sign. 
    We might have doubts about whether an informant who we don't know anything about can accurately perceive that. 
    But when we're talking about behavior like--

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    I think what you're saying to me, am I correct, that almost any moving violation counts?

    I'm not sure that it's always illegal and it's something where we may have doubts about whether the informant can accurately separate this person was breaking the law from this person wasn't. 
    I think the courts are going to have to answer the question of whether this is the kind of behavior that poses--

    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    --So--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3008.617" stopTime="3023.111">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I mean, in either case, you have let's say the seat belt and the swerving driver. 
    It's the same witness. 
    He said still it's a white Ford. 
    The reasonableness of the suspicion would seem to me to be totally divorced from what it's about.
speaker="rachel_p_kovner" startTime="3023.111" stopTime="3076.579">
    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    --I think that's true, Your Honor, and we actually think and, you know, we argued in our brief that there is reasonable suspicion here. 
    When an informant gives a basis for knowledge, you have reason to think they are an eyewitness. 
    But the Court has also recognized that there are certain dangers on the roadway that allow intrusions even when we might not otherwise allow them. 
    So, for instance, in the Sitz case the Court said drunk that drunk driving is such a great danger that we're going to allow even random stops of vehicles to detect drunk drivers. 
    So I think the court has indicated there are certain driving behaviors that are so dangerous we'll allow even suspicionless stops. 
    And here, of course, we're not dealing with suspicionless stops. 
    The questions from the Court have indicated some of the reasons why that's the case. 
    Here we have a caller who has demonstrated their basis for knowledge and officers have been able to confirm that. 
    So we're talking about tips where the person relays the kind of details you can really only have if you are an eyewitness to this person's driving on the road.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3076.579" stopTime="3087.703">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, that's just not true. 
    It's -- it's an acquaintance. 
    I know what kind of car he drives, I know where he's going. 
    I didn't see anything on the road, but I call the police and say, oh, there's this, you know, white Ford swerving all over the road.
speaker="rachel_p_kovner" startTime="3087.703" stopTime="3106.098">
    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    So, Your Honor, I think this class of people who are going to have the relevant knowledge is almost exclusively eyewitnesses. 
    You may also have a few people who have seen the person's car and happen to know what direction they're headed in, but for the most part we're talking about a very narrow class of individuals that are largely going to be eyewitnesses to this person's driving on the road.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3106.098" stopTime="3120.356">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    No, I'm talking about the concern that you want to have the police pull over people that you don't like, where you know somebody's got something bad in the car and you don't like it, and so you're going to take advantage of the fact that the police don't have to observe anything and yet you can still get them to pull over this person.
speaker="rachel_p_kovner" startTime="3120.356" stopTime="3128.544">
    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    So somebody who's malicious, who's a prankster, is still going to have this kind of specialized knowledge, and that's not something a malicious prankster is necessarily going to have.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3128.544" stopTime="3161.331">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Why is that different from the knowledge in J.L. that they were three young men, they were described, and the caller says 
    "the one with the gun is the one with the plaid shirt. " 
    All of that was corroborated by the police, and yet we held that that was no indication that a crime had been committed.
speaker="rachel_p_kovner" startTime="3161.331" stopTime="3185.546">
    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    Your Honor, I think the critical thing that's present here that wasn't present in J.L. is the basis for knowledge. 
    So as the passage that Justice Breyer read signals, we're talking there about concealed criminal activity, and the Court pointed out in that case there's nothing in the tip that signals how the informant knows this person had a gun. 
    Here, in contrast, the person is telling you 
    "I'm an eyewitness. " 
    "This person just ran me off the road. "
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="3185.546" stopTime="3193.218">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    But then you think J.L. would have come out differently if the tipster had said 
    "I just saw these guys and I saw, you know, one of them had a gun? "
speaker="rachel_p_kovner" startTime="3193.218" stopTime="3220.785">
    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    I think this case comes out differently for two reasons. 
    One is, yes, the tip would be stronger than the tip in J.L. if the person related eyewitness basis. 
    But the second has to do with the imminent danger here that's posed by a car that's moving down the roadway and that's being operated by a potentially drunk driver, and the reduced expectations of privacy you have when you're talking about a vehicle stop. 
    And those were front and center in Sitz, where the Court said that even suspicionless stops can be justified by that particular danger.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3220.785" stopTime="3252.240">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yeah, but that -- but that second danger -- you may have a drunken driver on the road; that danger can be eliminated by following the car. 
    You don't have to stop the car right away. 
    You can follow it and if indeed the driver seems to be driving erratically, then you can stop. 
    You'd have probable cause. 
    I don't think you have to automatically allow a stop in order to prevent all of the horribles that are going to arise from drunk driving. 
    Follow the car. 
    If he's behaving like a drunk driver then stop him.
speaker="rachel_p_kovner" startTime="3252.240" stopTime="3268.183">
    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    Your Honor, officers could follow the car, and if they do, they may witness a subsequent dangerous behavior that could justify pulling over the car. 
    The problem is that the subsequent dangerous behavior they observe may be the car swerving into another lane and hitting another vehicle.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3268.183" stopTime="3293.833">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That is so remote. 
    I mean, it seems to me you're asking us to adopt a broad rule that is contrary to what we normally do for searches and seizures because now and then, it would seem to me very rarely, before the police can stop the drunk driver he kills somebody. 
    I mean, I suppose that could happen now and then but it's pretty fanciful.
speaker="rachel_p_kovner" startTime="3293.833" stopTime="3311.029">
    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    Your Honor, I don't think it's a remote harm at all. 
    Now, this is a harm that causes one-third of all traffic accidents, that takes tens of thousands of lives a year, and it's a harm that this Court has always said is a harm of the first order that justifies the kind of intrusions that we might not otherwise allow.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3311.029" stopTime="3351.653">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But here we have the police did follow the vehicle for about 5 miles and saw nothing erratic about the driving. 
    So perhaps if the police had immediately stopped the person or -- but don't we have to take account that there was no corroboration? 
    The police get there. 
    Even if they could stop him instantly when they have no corroboration, then that doesn't amount to reasonable suspicion.
speaker="rachel_p_kovner" startTime="3351.653" stopTime="3383.789">
    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    Your Honor, I agree that police might follow a car for such a long period of time that the reasonable suspicion would dissipate. 
    On the facts of this case, Your Honor, the record indicates there were five minutes between when the officers first saw the car and when they pulled it over. 
    They weren't five minutes of uninterrupted observation. 
    They were five minutes in which the officers were turning their cars around because they were headed in the opposite direction, were catching up to a car along the freeway. 
    So the California Supreme Court analyzed that delay and found the fact that they didn't observe additional--

    I don't know if we have to get into the drunk driving. 
    It's 3 miles south of the Humboldt County border on -- do you know the answer to this? 
    Is it in the record? 
    I mean, on many sections of that road in Mendocino County you drive someone off the road, they are dead. 
    I mean, there are sheer drops, and so I just wonder, if I look that up here, what's the situation where this supposedly took place?

    Mr. Rachel P Kovner 
    --The only thing I can point to about that, Your Honor, is the way that the California Supreme Court treated this, which is that. 
    Because they pointed to the fact that this is a two-lane highway and that it's particularly dangerous on this particular road to engage in this behavior. 
    But I don't know about, you know, whether there are pits on the side of the road.

   Rebuttal of Paul R Kleven
speaker="paul_r_kleven" startTime="3460.971" stopTime="3560.568">
    Mr. Paul R Kleven 
    In this case we're talking about a single uncorroborated tip of reckless driving. 
    After that single incident, the car -- the truck went for approximately 19 miles with no indication of any other problem and then was followed for up to 5 miles by the police officers, again with no indication of any erratic driving or any other violation that would have been a reason for pulling him over immediately. 
    There's no reason to believe that the driver of this truck presented any kind of danger about being about to lose control, which is the argument that the State is relying on, and the Federal Government, and neither one of them came up with any anecdote even where that actually occurred, much less any statistics that show that that is a serious problem of people losing control while they're being under surveillance by the police officers. 
    This case is even farther away from the bomb situation than J.L. was. 
    In J.L., you had a person who was armed, who could have pulled out a gun and started firing at any moment. 
    Here, you have something where there's no indication of any ongoing risk to the public. 
    I don't think -- I don't know that there's a good answer to the bomb question. 
    I read through the transcript from the oral argument in J.L. I didn't see any -- you know, there didn't seem to be any good arguments -- any good discussions there either, as to which way the court could go. 
    But this case -- in J.L., the Court said there's no reason for us to resolve that. 
    We don't have to speculate about a situation where that would happen. 
    In this case, I submit, there's even less reason for the Court to speculate about the bomb situation or even the kidnapping situation.
