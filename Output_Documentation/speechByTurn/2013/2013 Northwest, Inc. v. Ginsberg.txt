Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-462, Northwest, Incorporated v. Rabbi Ginsberg. 
    Mr. Clement.
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="10.222" stopTime="85.087">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Under this Court's decision in Wolens, there are only two relevant questions here, and the Ninth Circuit got both of them wrong. 
    The first question is whether a claim for additional benefits under a frequent flyer program, like flight upgrades, relate to prices, routes and services. 
    This Court answered that question in the affirmative in Wolens and, indeed, underscored the questions not particularly close. 
    The Ninth Circuit's ability to reach the contrary conclusion in the precise same context underscores how far they have strayed from this Court's precedence. 
    The second question is whether the Plaintiffs' claim here seek merely to enforce the parties' voluntary undertakings or, rather, seek to enforce State law to enlarge those undertakings and enlarge the parties' bargain. 
    And it's to that question 2 we think Respondent's own claims here make the case quite clear. 
    Respondent did bring a claim here to enforce the parties' voluntary undertakings, a breach of contract claim and lost on the merits. 
    The implied preemption claim is different. 
    It seeks to impose a duty of fair dealing and reasonableness and superimposed that on the bargain, even where the parties to the contract have essentially given one party absolute discretion.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Clement, the argument was made that if -- if the airline has an unreviewable right to terminate this agreement for any reason or for no reason, if that is so, then it's an illusory contract. 
    What -- what is your answer to that, if one party can get out willy-nilly, why -- what kind of bargain is it?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="115.772" stopTime="140.740">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    Well, there are a couple of answers to that, Justice Ginsburg. 
    The first is I think although the focus on whether a contract is illusory is sometimes used as part of the analysis under the implied covenant for a bilateral contract. 
    I don't think that same analysis would apply to something like a frequent flyer program, which I think would be properly understood as a unilateral contract, where you don't worry about those sort of illusory promises. 
    The second thing is I think you have to understand in the context--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="140.740" stopTime="141.923">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Did a unitary contract?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="141.923" stopTime="142.757">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    --I'm sorry.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="142.757" stopTime="144.191">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    I'm not sure I understand that point.
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="144.191" stopTime="171.026">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    There -- there is a distinction, if you go back to the Horne books on contract law between a unilateral contract and a bilateral contract. 
    A unilateral contract is -- is a typical sort of outstanding promise, that promise doesn't require an exchange of consideration, and the party who makes the promise has the ability to withdraw the promise until there's -- there's performance essentially relying on the promise. 
    And that's why I think it's actually a little bit of a mistake to apply that doctrine to something like a frequent flyer program.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="171.026" stopTime="193.707">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Clement, because I always thought that the way these agreements worked were there were agreements that if I flew a certain number of miles on your plan, I was going to get a free ticket. 
    And -- and it wasn't a gift that I was getting a free ticket, it was because I did something, I flew a certain number of miles. 
    So that there was an exchange with value on both sides.
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="193.707" stopTime="204.397">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    Well, I -- I suppose you could conceive of it that way. 
    You could also conceive of it as basically being a premium that's offered by the company to reward your loyalty, but you've already gotten full performance.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="204.397" stopTime="231.714">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No. 
    I think you have to conceive of it that way, but that still makes it a unilateral contract. 
    It's not a promise in exchange for another promise. 
    It's a promise in exchange for the performance of an act; that is, flying the airline, you know, a certain number of miles. 
    You're correct, it is a -- a unilateral contract. 
    Now, whether that -- that means that there's no -- is there no such thing as an illusory unilateral contract?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="231.714" stopTime="240.336">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    I don't think there really is. 
    You know, I looked at the -- the treatises for that, and I just don't think that concept really applies in the unitary -- the unilateral contract context.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="240.336" stopTime="256.865">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    I just don't see why that would make sense. 
    Because if I knew that it was really up to you to give me the free ticket, maybe I was willing to get it and maybe I wasn't. 
    I don't think that I'd be spending all this time in the air on your planes. 
    You know, I'd find another company that actually gave me the free ticket.
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="256.865" stopTime="281.980">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    That really, I think, gets to the nub of this, because, of course, what you're suggesting is that there would be a market solution to this problem. 
    And that's what the Airline Deregulation Act is all about. 
    Letting the market decide these issues. 
    So if some airline really were crazy enough to systematically turn on its most lucrative and loyal customers, surely, the market would solve that. 
    And, of course, if a bunch of airlines did it, the Department of Transportation stands ready to police that.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="281.980" stopTime="311.515">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    But usually what we say when a contract has no consideration, we don't say, oh, we're going to hold you to it anyway because the market will solve it. 
    We say the contract has no consideration, it's illusory, in just the way that Justice Ginsburg pointed out. 
    And the question is: If there's really no obligation on the part of the airline here to give that free ticket, if they can do it when they feel like it and not do it when they don't feel like it, why is there any consideration? 
    Why isn't the contract not illusory?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="311.515" stopTime="335.915">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    There -- there is consideration -- I'm not sure anything turns on this -- but there is consideration because this is not something where the airline says, look, we can do anything we want. 
    They say, look, if you present us with miles while you're still in good standing in the program, we'll give you upgrades, we'll let you into a lounge. 
    But if, pursuant to the contract, you abuse the program in our sole discretion, then you lose your membership status. 
    And that's what's happened here.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="335.915" stopTime="345.104">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You're not trying to enforce the contract anyway. 
    You -- you want to get out of the contract. 
    So you -- you ought to be happy to have it pronounced an illusory contract, right? 
    What do you care?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="345.104" stopTime="358.230">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    Well, that is true. 
    But I suppose the argument might be that you could, as a matter of breach of contract law, use this principle to interpret the contract. 
    And if that were an argument, it's an argument that's made under Count 1 of this complaint.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="358.230" stopTime="406.894">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Mr. Clement, you're making -- you're making an assumption. 
    The claim here is not whether he abused or didn't abuse the program. 
    His allegation is that the only reason you terminated with a contract was because you wanted to get rid of these high flyers in your merger negotiations with the other airline. 
    That's the same as saying they didn't terminate me because I abused the program. 
    They terminated me because I was of a certain race or I was a woman or I was handicapped or some other improper consideration. 
    So are you suggesting that this contract permits you to use that kind of self -- that kind of ground, one not grounded in the contract, but grounded in your whim and caprice?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="406.894" stopTime="462.731">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    Well, a couple of points, Justice Sotomayor. 
    First of all, I think it's -- it's really important to emphasize that the claim about pretext and this all being about the merger is actually not something that's made in the breach of contract count or the breach of implied covenant count. 
    That's pled actually in the misrepresentation counts. 
    Counts 3 and 4 of the complaint that everybody recognizes are preemptive. 
    Now, what's pled in contract Count 1, the breach of contract count, is that under the contract, somehow we don't have the ability to terminate somebody without just cause. 
    And that's the argument that the district court rejected on the merits. 
    Now, the implied covenant count, Count 2, is different. 
    It says that under State law, there is a duty of good faith and fair dealing and that duty is superimposed on the contract even if the contract gives one of the parties absolute discretion. 
    And those aren't my words. 
    Those are the words of Count 2 of the complaint at Joint Appendix page 51.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="462.731" stopTime="476.990">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Even if you have absolute discretion, isn't there a limit to that? 
    Isn't there a limit of reasonableness to that absolute discretion? 
    That's the whole question of -- otherwise, you have a contract with no substance.
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="476.990" stopTime="498.321">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    The way I would think about it, Justice Sotomayor, is ‶ absolute ″ might not quite mean absolute. 
    And the place to make that argument is under the breach of contract rubric. 
    That you can cite Cardozo and Lady Duff-Gordon. 
    But when you get to saying even if the contract's absolute, State law still superimposes a reasonableness requirement on the contract, that's the point at which preemption kicks in.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="498.321" stopTime="512.563">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is that entirely -- I mean, suppose the contract said 
    "in its absolute discretion and subject to no obligation of good faith. " 
    Suppose it said that. 
    Would State law still impose an obligation of good faith?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="512.563" stopTime="514.515">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    It might well, Justice Scalia, because--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="514.515" stopTime="516.717">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, it might well or it would?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="516.717" stopTime="519.669">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    --It depends on the State. 
    So the majority--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="519.669" stopTime="521.736">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, this State. 
    I mean, the State we're talking about.
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="521.736" stopTime="550.539">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    --Okay, Minnesota. 
    I -- as I read the cases, the rule in Minnesota is that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not waivable. 
    So there's a case that we found called New Amsterdam Casualty. 
    It's in the indemnity context, so I assume that -- and it says that in the indemnity context a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not waivable. 
    So I don't think you could do that, which I think underscores that this is not the parties agreeing to this. 
    This is having this condition superimposed on them by State law.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="550.539" stopTime="588.814">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is the choice we have here only between State law and no relief? 
    Or is there some theory under which either Federal common law or appeal to the DOT could give the flyer, the customer, some relief? 
    And, you know, we can all think of crazy hypotheticals. 
    Suppose the phone rings and he says: I'm John Doe, I want to talk to you about my airline, you've miscalculated. 
    They said: Mr. Doe, we've heard from you 15 times, you're -- you're out of this program. 
    It's a mistaken identity. 
    There are two John Does. 
    Can the innocent, good faith John Doe do any -- anything at all?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="588.814" stopTime="630.308">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    Yes. 
    The -- the good faith John Doe can do two things: One, as your question suggested, he can go to the DOT. 
    The DOT has the authority to investigate complaints about frequent flyer programs. 
    It exercises that authority. 
    It's discussed at pages, I think, 20 and 21 of the SG's brief. 
    They heard something like 289 of these complaints last year. 
    So that's -- so that's one place you can go. 
    The other place you can go in the cases like the mistaken identity -- I mean, if you followed up and certainly if you went so far as to bring a routine breach of contract claim, I assume that would get addressed in that forum. 
    Because airlines are not in the interest -- do not have an interest in getting rid of their most lucrative and loyal customers.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="630.308" stopTime="646.519">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but -- in part of that suit, wouldn't you have to -- the judge says, what's the underlying substance and you say, well, there's a duty of good faith dealing under Minnesota law. 
    And then you're right back where you started, unless there's some -- unless there's some Federal common law with Lincoln Mills or something like that?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="646.519" stopTime="663.879">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    No, I don't think there's Federal common law. 
    This Court I think essentially rejected that in Wolens. 
    I'm making a more practical point, which is in a real case of mistaken identity I think that would get sorted out in the process, certainly at the point where a breach of contract action was brought. 
    Because, again, if there's -- if there's a John Doe who really is a frequent flyer--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="663.879" stopTime="668.699">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I still don't understand the substantive basis for the breach of contract suit if you say we can't refer to State law.
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="668.699" stopTime="677.638">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    --You can refer to State law for the breach of contract. 
    You can't, we would submit, add the implied covenant of breach of good faith because that enlarges the bargain.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="677.638" stopTime="716.979">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Well, Mr. Clement, suppose that this complaint only had one count. 
    And suppose that they had said: Look, we have this contract and it gives very substantial discretion, it gives -- you know, by the words alone, it gives absolute discretion to Northwest, but that can't really be right because contracts have this implied covenant of good faith. 
    There's an implied duty to perform in good faith. 
    And that means that this discretion is narrowed in certain kinds of ways, that they can't terminate my membership for certain kinds of reasons. 
    And that's all the complaint said. 
    There was just this one count. 
    Do you think that would be preempted?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="716.979" stopTime="750.420">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    I think the reliance on the implied covenant in that context should be preempted. 
    I think that's the better rule. 
    If this Court wanted to adopt a narrower rule and say, look, it's really at the point that you try to bring a separate implied covenant claim, that's preempted, I suppose as a matter of adminstrability you could do that. 
    It might make some sense, because, I mean, you do have to take a practical look at this. 
    In the wake of Wolens, if you plead a routine breach of contract claim, you're going to avoid preemption. 
    The only reason practically you run the risk of preemption by pleading a separate claim is when you're trying to really get outside of the terms of the contract.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="750.420" stopTime="772.850">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    I guess what I'm suggesting is that the implied covenant here, it's just an interpretive tool. 
    It says that there are certain kinds of provisions that are written very broadly or very vaguely, and an implied covenant comes in to help us interpret those kinds of provisions. 
    And viewed in that way, it's just a contractual device that in light of Wolens ought to be permitted.
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="772.850" stopTime="817.129">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    Well, here's my thought on that, which is I think even the Respondents admit that in some States the implied covenant is much more than simply a rule of construction for the explicit terms of the contract. 
    And I suppose if this Court wants to say that the only way the implied covenant is not preempted is when it's just a rule of construction for the explicit terms of the contract, I suppose we could live with that rule and I think we'd certainly win in this case. 
    The reason I would suggest that the better rule for this Court to adopt is that the implied covenant should just be preempted even in that circumstance is because in that circumstance it doesn't add anything. 
    If it really is just a rule of construction for the express terms of the contract, you could get in the same place with the citation to Cardozo and Lady Duff-Gordon.

    I think they -- they say -- I'll try to find the -- the point where -- where I find this rebuttal. 
    But I don't think they do this. 
    They basically say that some States do apply this rule.

speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="844.062" stopTime="852.385">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.

speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="852.385" stopTime="867.145">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    Well, I may have misspoke. 
    What I meant was I think both parties agree, as they would have to, that in some States the implied covenant doctrine is used to directly impose public policy. 
    And so in Alaska that seems to be the case. 
    In Montana that seems to be the case.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="867.145" stopTime="873.116">

    How about Minnesota? 
    In Minnesota, isn't it just a rule of construction of the contract?
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="873.116" stopTime="896.414">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    We don't believe so, Your Honor. 
    I think -- I'm not going to try to tell you that Minnesota law is pellucidly clear on this. 
    But Minnesota -- the Minnesota Supreme Court case, the Hennepin case that adopts -- recognizes the implied covenant, cites the Restatement. 
    The Restatement quite clearly embraces a view of the implied covenant that goes beyond merely constructing the express terms of the contract.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I still -- I still have this problem. 
    You say don't -- now don't worry. 
    You can always bring an express contract action. 
    And I say, well, what law do you apply? 
    Well, you -- you have no State law and there's no Federal common law. 
    I don't understand how you can bring an action with no substantive law to inform it.
speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="913.776" stopTime="964.958">
    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    I may have misspoke, Justice Kennedy. 
    The breach of contract claim that you bring -- the routine breach of contract claim you bring is a State law claim. 
    So we don't have any quarrel with Count 1 of this claim, which views Minnesota State contract law to interpret the express terms of the contract. 
    Where we have a beef is with Count 2 of the complaint that says, even if the contract gives the parties absolute discretion, we are going to superimpose a duty of good faith and fair dealing. 
    And to complete the answer, since Minnesota has adopted the Restatement, the Restatement suggests that the way you find good faith is you exclude the possibility of bad faith based on community standards of fairness and decency. 
    And at the point that you're applying community standards of fairness and decency, it seems to me quite clear that you are not applying the parties' self-imposed undertakings, but something else.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="964.958" stopTime="978.468">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I suppose you could say that it is assumed that parties to a contract comport with community standards of fairness and decency.

    Mr. Paul D. Clement 
    You could try to wiggle there. 
    And my point would be the way to try to wiggle there is interpreting the express terms of the contract. 
    An implied covenant is different. 
    And I think if you take a step back and think about this context: When an airline reserves to itself the sole discretion to make a judgment about frequent flyers or about taking an unruly passenger off a plane, do you really want State courts applying community standards of decency to judge that, or is that something that should be judged by a complaint to the Department of Transportation? 
    If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

    Mr. Lewis S. Yelin 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In Wolens, this Court recognized that Congress enacted the ADA to leave decisions concerning airline prices, routes, and services to the business judgment of air carriers subject to market forces and limited oversight by the Department of Transportation. 
    In light of that statutory purpose, Wolens held that claims based on the State common law of contract are not preempted by the ADA to the extent they seek to enforce the voluntary undertakings of the parties.

    An argument like that could suggest, as Respondent argued in the lower court, that any time a party enters into a contract, the party endorses or at least accepts all normative principles of contract law. 
    That would include things like doctrines of unconscionability and other doctrines that impose extracontractual limitations on the parties' choices.

    Mr. Lewis S. Yelin 
    --I think the problem, Chief Justice, is that the notion of the doctrine of the implied covenant is extraordinarily broad and encompasses a number of different concepts. 
    It encompasses notions of reasonableness and implying limitations to discretionary grants of authority reserved in contracts. 
    It also encompasses in some States concepts such as notions of fairness or which extend beyond the intent of the parties.

    Let me change the hypothetical slightly. 
    Suppose the contract says that one of the parties reserves sole discretion to do something and then the contract goes on to say: And then in exercising this discretion, we don't promise to act in a reasonable manner. 
    But the State court says that, nevertheless, that has to be interpreted to mean that the party can only perform in a reasonable manner. 
    Then what would the situation be?

    I think the ADA would preempt exactly that sort of claim or a claim based on that sort of an argument. 
    The -- the crux of the ADA is to leave to the judgment of air carriers, subject to market forces, decisions concerning rates, routes or services. 
    And I'd like to underscore this point by pointing out that the interpretation that this Court gives to the ADA is not only going to control frequent flyer programs; it's also going to control things like contracts of carriage, which are--

    I absolutely agree with you that -- that a free market in price is at the heart of the Deregulation Act. 
    Given. 
    I also think frequent flyer programs are simply price discounts. 
    I also think that if you don't have contracts, you can't have free markets. 
    But I also think the State cannot, under the guise of contract law, regulate the prices of airlines. 
    If you allow that, you're going to have worse than we ever had. 
    It'll be 50 different systems, all right?

    Some States, like Illinois and Connecticut, use the doctrine purely, it appears to us, as an interpretive device to discern the intent of the parties. 
    Other States at the other end of the spectrum -- Arizona is one; we've cited a number of other cases in our brief -- used the same concept to encompass extracontractual principles.

    So I can -- I can work with that. 
    But you're -- you're asking me to go through each of the 50 States one by one to decide, oh, which -- which of these are really trying to discern the intent of the parties and which ones aren't.

    There has to be a State-by-State analysis any time you -- you have a contract claim applying State law. 
    There are variances among States in their contract law.

    With respect, Justice Scalia, I think that's not at all a difficult question.

    The State says: Regardless of what the contract says, even if it says in its sole discretion without any obligation of good faith, even if it says that, as a matter of law, there is an obligation of good faith.

    And they write right in their contract, you know, we're going to comply with the literal terms of this contract, but we do not promise each other that we're going to proceed in good faith or that we are going to deal with each other fairly.

    How is it self-imposed if the party has no say, that it's going to apply anyway?
speaker="adina_h_rosenbaum" startTime="1988.925" stopTime="2044.512">
    Ms. Adina H. Rosenbaum 
    Well, the terms of the contract are the self-imposed undertaking, and then this is the tool that's being used to understand and interpret the tools of the -- terms of the contract and then to enforce them. 
    And this is a widely used tool to interpret terms of contracts, particularly when there are discretionary terms within a contract. 
    That's something that's done in the vast majority of the States, and in fact the discretionary -- the cases where there are discretionary terms within a context is the quintessential application of the covenant of good faith. 
    A lot of the early covenant of good faith claims involved outputs or requirements contracts where the specific amount in the contract was not set and the covenant was applied to that sort of situation. 
    And scholars, in talking about the covenant, often specifically note that it applies to discretionary terms.

    I think that that's a situation that States struggle with given the at-will employment doctrine and they've viewed the covenant and the at-will employment doctrine as being in conflict with each other. 
    Here, though, the covenant and the contract or any other principle are not in conflict with each other. 
    The covenant is not being used to override any terms in the contract. 
    It is being used to help give meaning to the terms in the contract and to identify what the implicit restrictions are.

    Justice Elena Kagan 
    I mean, it might be, right, because people have different expectations in those two different situations, and that the at-will employment is so pervasive and so customary and so sweeping that the policy, the rule of an implied covenant of good faith doesn't apply there because we think everybody expects it not to apply there.

speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2138.040" stopTime="2155.851">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    An at-will employment contract is a contract that gives the employer sole discretion as to whether to retain an employee. 
    And here we have a contract that says that the airline has sole discretion to determine whether to terminate somebody from the frequent flyer program. 
    So what is the difference?

    Ms. Adina H. Rosenbaum

    So in the employment context, an employee, given the wide acknowledgment of the at-will employment doctrine, might not expect that they could only be terminated for cause.

    Ms. Adina H. Rosenbaum 
    --I think our standard is very similar to the one that the United States said. 
    It's about whether the covenant is going to -- whether the claim is looking at whether the parties breached the contract or whether it's looking at whether the contract itself violated the law. 
    So it's a question of whether the claim is actually interpreting the contract, and trying to get at what the parties -- what their agreement was, or whether the claim is really that the contract as the parties agreed to it violated the law.

    Suppose the supreme court of the State had an opinion that said we're going to be candid about this. 
    The covenant of fair dealing and good faith, it's not in this contract, but we will read it into every contract. 
    That is, if the State supreme court said, it's externally imposed, this is a rule that we will read into every contract because of the policy in our State that people should deal with each other fairly.

    That would be weird, isn't it, because in such a State, there might be a contract where the parties reasonably did expect this implicit term that limits something, a very broad conferral of discretion to operate.

    That isn't what your -- your complaint that I think -- paragraph 56, which I think is the key paragraph says, that the -- under the -- the law is, 
    "The contract law that you want to enforce is even where a party to a contract is given absolute discretion, it must exercise that discretion in good faith in a manner consistent with the reasonable expectations of the other party or parties. " 
    Now, that's, I think, what they're objecting to. 
    Because there, it sounds to me like I go in to, you know, get a ticket, my reasonable expectation is they're not going to charge me what they're going to charge, you know. 
    I mean, it's unbelievable. 
    But there -- but, you see, that's my reasonable expectation, and I'm the other party. 
    And so that clause sounds as if you could, under State contract law, govern the price according to my reasonable expectation, namely, the consumer, that might be a great idea, but I don't think that's the idea behind this act.

    I think there is a fair amount of uniformity across the States in how they actually apply the covenant of good faith, and in terms of applying it as an interpretation of the contract, and then especially in cases where one party is claiming that all of their performance under the contract is in their sole discretion and that they're free not to perform under the contract at all, you know, essentially where the contract would be illusory in applying the covenant specifically under those circumstances to ensure that there is meaningful performance that's required under the contract.

    I don't believe that's an illusory contract.

    That the parties would have reasonably expected that they were contracting to there being some sort of performance under the contract. 
    And, in fact, the principles at issue here are remarkably similar to the principles that were at issue in Wolens itself.

    That's because the contract was silent.

    There may be more deference given to the airline because of the discretionary term; but in both situations, the question would be, what does this contract mean? 
    And contracts include both their express terms and their implied terms and the covenant of good faith is going to interpreting implied terms, to identifying them within the contract and then enforcing them within the contract. 
    If an airline were able to just insert ‶ sole discretion ″ or ‶ sole judgement ″ within its contract, it would be able to entirely circumvent the rule that this Court set forth in Wolens. 
    Just by adding ‶ sole discretion ″ to its contract, it would never be held to any contractual duties or requirements.

    Ms. Adina H. Rosenbaum 
    --Well, there are separate regulations that apply to safety under the ADA, so -- and separate preemption doctrines that apply to safety under the ADA. 
    But besides that, this would apply to matters besides -- to matters besides frequent flyer miles and other sole discretion, issues in which the contract leaves an issue to the sole discretion of the airline. 
    I do want to respond to Justice Kennedy's question about whether someone can go to the Department of Transportation. 
    The Department of Transportation does have authority over unfair and deceptive practices by airlines, but this is -- that's very different than the claim that we're pursuing here. 
    That's a claim by an airline -- sorry, by the government, that doesn't give remedies to the specific consumer who was hurt. 
    And that also looks at whether the practice is unfair or deceptive. 
    And our claim here isn't that this was an unfair practice. 
    The claim here is that this is a practice or these were actions that violated the contract and what's being applied here are contract law principles about interpreting the covenant of good faith. 
    And the same thing was true also in Wolens. 
    At the time of Wolens, the Department of Transportation had the same ability to pursue claims for unfair or deceptive practices, but the Court recognized that that did not override the need for there to be a contract dispute resolution regime by the State courts. 
    And that's the same -- the same is true here whether or not the contract term at issue is expressed or implied. 
    And overall, like in Wolens, this is claim where if these sort of claims were preempted it would undercut the efficiency of contracts and the competitive marketplace that overall the ADA is meant to pursue. 
    People need to be able to rely on their contracts. 
    They need to be able to rely on the fact that the other party to their contract will interpret that contract in good faith according to the reasonable expectations of the parties where they will give them the performance they reasonably thought that they were securing when they entered into the contract. 
    Under Northwest's position here, though, that it has the discretion not to perform at all, people won't be able to rely on the security of their contracts. 
    And it's hard to imagine that when Congress enacted the Airline Deregulation Act it meant to undercut the efficiency of contracts in that way.

    --I'm not sure it would be different in a claim brought against the airlines. 
    I mean, maybe if you want to sue the credit card partner, the ADA has nothing to do with that. 
    But I would say that if you're suing an airline, the Airline Deregulation Act speaks to it. 
    But if the Court want to reserve THAT, I suppose it could. 
    I do want to make -- underscore that the implied covenant doctrine is very different from other interpretative tools. 
    It is non-waivable and, I think, in a world where you are trying to determine the difference between self-imposed undertakings and things imposed by State law, non-waivability is a huge strike against it being voluntary. 
    It also just is, you can bring in separate implied covenant claims. 
    You know, no one -- I've never heard of a contra proferentem claim, but implied covenant claim is routinely brought as a separate claim. 
    It just shows you really can enlarge the bargain in very real ways, and the States make policy decisions about whether to have it. 
    Texas doesn't have implied covenants as a general matter at all. 
    Some States have a valid public policy. 
    They have different views about at-will employment contracts. 
    And when Congress wanted to impose a duty of good faith and fair dealing on the franchise agreements between car manufacturers and automobile dealers, they passed a statute. 
    It's just statutory and policy oriented in a way that normal rules of construction are not. 
    Now, Justice Breyer, I certainly agree with your four premises. 
    If I had to state a standard, I would say the standard is that the implied covenant is only not preempted when it does no more than provide a rule of construction for the express terms of the contract. 
    But, of course, if that's all it does, then there's nothing to be gained by saying those claims are not preempted because you can still just get to the same place by citing Cardozo and Lady Duff-Gordon. 
    And there's a lot to be gained by adopting a more prophylactic rule because the claims that are brought in the real world are claims that I get a refund even though the ticket's nonrefundable. 
    I get $1,000 even though the loss limit was 500. 
    I get to sue you for redirecting my packages even though it was in your sole discretion. 
    So in the real world, the implied covenant claims are elastic and provide a basis for bringing the kind of claims that courts have almost uniformly correctly recognized are preempted. 
    The last question I ask you to think about is: Why is it the airlines don't put these covenants in as express covenants? 
    Why do they say sole discretion and not say sole discretion unless it violates reasonable norms of community standards and decency? 
    Well, the reason is you can't run a national, let alone international airline, if every one of your judgments about taking an unruly passenger off or taking out an abusive customer is going to be second-guessed by a jury applying reasonable standards of ordinary decency and morality. 
    So for that reason, we think the judgment below should be reversed and we would urge you to apply a more prophylactic rule. 
    Thank you.
