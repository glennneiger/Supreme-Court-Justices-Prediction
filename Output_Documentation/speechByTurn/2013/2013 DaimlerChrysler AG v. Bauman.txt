DaimlerChrysler AG v. Bauman

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-965, Daimler AG v. Bauman. 
    Mr. Dupree.
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="8.873" stopTime="50.262">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Ninth Circuit held that Daimler, a foreign corporation, is subject to general jurisdiction in California and thus may be sued in California on any claim arising anywhere in the world. 
    The Ninth Circuit reached this conclusion by attributing to Daimler the California contacts of a Daimler subsidiary, Mercedes Benz USA, a separate corporation that respects all corporate formalities and that is not Daimler's alter ego. 
    The Ninth Circuit's approach violates due process.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="50.262" stopTime="59.087">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Do we have to reach that question? 
    I mean, I guess the Ninth Circuit must have been interpreting the long-arm statute of California, right?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="59.087" stopTime="60.478">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    That's correct, Justice Scalia.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="60.478" stopTime="65.210">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Now, are there -- were there California cases that disregarded the -- the corporate forum?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="65.210" stopTime="78.142">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    California respects the corporate forum. 
    The Ninth Circuit applied what appears to be a Federal common law of agency that the Ninth Circuit admittedly developed solely for purposes of the jurisdictional inquiry.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="78.142" stopTime="84.343">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But the jurisdictional inquiry is conducted on the basis of the California statute, isn't it?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="84.343" stopTime="95.729">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    It is, but at the same time, the California statute extends to the limit of due process. 
    And so what the Ninth Circuit did was it construed what the permissible outer bounds of the due process clause was in this context.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="95.729" stopTime="105.710">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I see. 
    It's -- it's California's reference to the outer bounds of jurisdiction that causes -- causes this to be a constitutional case?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="105.710" stopTime="106.569">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    That's correct, Justice Scalia.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="106.569" stopTime="120.002">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    There's nothing in the Constitution, is there that would prohibit a State from adopting a rule that a parent is responsible for any acts of a wholly-owned subsidiary?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="120.002" stopTime="139.243">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there may be a constitutional limit; certainly to the extent that, say, California adopted a rule that said for purposes of some sort of liability, we are going to disregard the corporate forum, I think that could pose due process concerns to the extent that it is purporting to override, say, the corporate law of Delaware.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="139.243" stopTime="158.487">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, even on a prospective basis, your brief talks about notice and fairness and predictability; but if California said going forward, this is the rule that we're going to apply, is there any constitutional problem with that?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="158.487" stopTime="186.522">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    I -- I still think there would be, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    In other words, I take Your Honor's point about fair notice, if California said going forward this is the rule we're going to apply. 
    But at the same time, I'm not quite sure what in the Constitution would empower, say, California to essentially override, say, Delaware's corporate law and say for our State purposes, we're essentially going to rewrite the corporate DNA of a corporation that's chartered in Delaware in order to--

speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="205.375" stopTime="233.848">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    Well, Justice Sotomayor, typically this Court has applied a less rigorous due process standard in the tax cases than it has in the personal jurisdiction cases. 
    If one were to look at, say, Goodyear or McIntyre, of any of this Court's more recent jurisdictional decisions, it typically takes a much more rigorous view of the due process clause's limits on a sovereign's ability to adjudicate matters that arise outside the forum than it has in the tax context.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="233.848" stopTime="247.217">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    We would never get to this question if you hadn't conceded that there is general jurisdiction over the U.S. subsidiary, over -- what is it -- MBUSA.
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="247.217" stopTime="268.239">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    Well, Justice Ginsburg, I respectfully disagree that we conceded the point below. 
    I'm not sure, frankly, that we could concede something like that on behalf of a different corporation that's not a party to this lawsuit. 
    But it is true that we focused on the attribution question in the Ninth Circuit. 
    And at the end of the day, I don't think that that point affects the outcome in this case, because--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="268.239" stopTime="281.781">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But if there were nothing to attribute, then that would be the end of it. 
    If there was -- if there was not general jurisdiction over MBUSA, that would be the end of the case, wouldn't it?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="281.781" stopTime="286.686">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    --Yes, it would. 
    That would be one way to resolve the case. 
    Another way to resolve the case--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="286.686" stopTime="295.261">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But you didn't -- we can't resolve it that way since you -- you didn't challenge the general jurisdiction over the subsidiary.
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="295.261" stopTime="301.276">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    --Well, again, we did not argue that point. 
    Instead, we focussed on the attribution issue, but at the same time--
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="301.276" stopTime="302.522">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Mr. Dupree -- I'm sorry. 
    Please.
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="302.522" stopTime="317.802">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    --I was going to say, Your Honor, at the same time, I do think that that notion, that MBUSA was subject to general jurisdiction in California, was necessarily part of the Ninth Circuit's holding. 
    So I do think it is properly preserved for this Court's review if the Court elected to resolve this case on that ground.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="317.802" stopTime="341.181">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    And, Mr. Dupree, even if you waived that point, if I understand it correctly, you did not waive the point that even with all attribution in the world, there still is no general jurisdiction over Daimler. 
    In other words, you could attribute all MBUSA's contacts and you still would not have general jurisdiction over Daimler; is that right?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="341.181" stopTime="343.103">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    Justice Kagan, that is exactly right.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="343.103" stopTime="362.126">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    So in that sense, it really doesn't depend on the attribution standard, all these hard questions of is it an alter ego test or is it an agency test and how does the Constitution relate to State law, because we could apply any test we wanted, and there still wouldn't be general jurisdiction over Daimler in California.
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="362.126" stopTime="388.820">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    Justice Kagan, that certainly would be an acceptable route for this Court to resolve the case. 
    And Your Honor has it exactly right, in that even if one were to attribute the constitutional contacts of MBUSA to Daimler, you would still be left with a joint enterprise that plainly is not at home in the State of California. 
    It would still be a German corporation headquartered in Stuttgart that draws only approximately 2 percent of its overall vehicle revenue from California sales. 
    So yes.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="388.820" stopTime="388.914">

    Is that a reasonable--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    How do foreign -- foreign countries resolve this attribution question? 
    Would -- would we be standing alone or are there a lot of other countries that assert jurisdiction over the parent, if there is general jurisdiction over the sub?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="408.642" stopTime="415.559">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    By and large, Justice Scalia, most other countries respect the corporate forum and that includes parent/subsidiary relations.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="415.559" stopTime="417.700">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    By and large? 
    Who are the small?

    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    I'm not aware of anyone who disrespects it; and, in fact, our amici talk at length about how California's exercise of general jurisdiction in this case would not be appropriate in virtually any other nation. 
    I'm frankly not sure where what the Ninth Circuit did here would be viewed as tolerable.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="435.988" stopTime="503.447">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    How do we deal with that? 
    That's what's -- I mean, it's in your interest to argue that -- tell me how to deal with this. 
    It's perhaps true -- I think it's true that a State doesn't have to allow companies to have wholly-owned corporations. 
    Under the Constitution of the United States, nothing says they do. 
    Or a State could say, wholly-owned corporations? 
    Well, there's no limited liability. 
    Or they could say in certain kinds of accidents, there's no limited -- et cetera. 
    You see, they have lots of choice. 
    So what really seems to have been going on here is the Ninth Circuit, from your perspective, just really misstated California law by out to lunch. 
    When they say when we want it to be as broad as the Constitution, they don't mean, because we could get rid of limited liability, that that's what we do. 
    So, how can we deal with a circuit court that seems to seriously misstate the law of a State?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="503.447" stopTime="509.023">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    Well, I think the way this Court should deal with the Ninth Circuit in this case is simply to reverse it, Your Honor.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="509.023" stopTime="517.098">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I understand that that's what you would like as the bottom line. 
    [Laughter] 
    I would like to know the chain of reasoning that gets--
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="517.098" stopTime="544.508">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    The chain of reasoning, Your Honor, is simply that California, like all States, generally respects the corporate form, certainly with regard to liability determinations. 
    In fact, this is a point that Professor Brilmayer makes at length in her amicus brief, where she says that it is anomalous for a State on one hand to respect the corporate form as to liability determinations, but then when it comes to making these sorts of personal jurisdictional determinations, it applies a completely different standard. 
    So I think--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="544.508" stopTime="568.718">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Suppose -- but suppose we had a case of an accident on a California highway injuring California people and they sued charging that the Mercedes Benz was defectively manufactured. 
    Would there be jurisdiction over both the parent and the sub in that situation?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="568.718" stopTime="581.899">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    --If it were the case Your Honor hypothesized, I think there may well be specific jurisdiction available, depending on whether Daimler purposefully availed itself of the California forum.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="581.899" stopTime="585.585">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And what does that mean? 
    I mean, it certainly wanted to have its cars sold in -- in California.
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="585.585" stopTime="625.945">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    Right. 
    What this Court has said in its opinions in Asahi and then, of course, in McEntyre is that you look whether the corporation targeted the forum. 
    And in Asahi, Justice O'Connor's opinion identified several facts that could support such a finding. 
    For example, whether the parent targeted advertising at the forum, whether the parent designed a product specifically for use in that forum. 
    And, of course, this Court has said repeatedly that questions of specific jurisdiction are highly fact dependent. 
    And so in Your Honor's hypothetical, I think what the plaintiffs would do to establish specific jurisdiction over the foreign parent would be precisely to attempt to amass evidence showing that Daimler targeted the forum where they intend to bring the suit.

    --Counsel--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="626.537" stopTime="637.893">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, there was injury in the forum and it was caused by defective manufacturing abroad. 
    That's a typical basis for jurisdiction under long arm statutes.
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="637.893" stopTime="655.042">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    Well, certainly courts have exercised specific jurisdiction in that situation. 
    But, of course, as this Court's ruling in McEntyre illustrates, that's not necessarily always the case and there may, of course, be situations where a product does cause injury in the forum, yet the foreign parent is not necessarily subject to specific jurisdiction in that forum.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="655.042" stopTime="673.363">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, how -- how would you answer Justice Ginsburg's question if you were writing the opinion in your favor? 
    Would you say that in the hypothetical, Daimler Chrysler put in motion a course of events that caused an injury in California? 
    Is that the way our jurisprudence works?

    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    --Well, I think I would go back to what this Court has articulated, first of all, is the standard for specific jurisdiction, which is purposeful availment or purposeful direction. 
    I think as far as what constellation of facts--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="688.560" stopTime="704.948">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, Daimler has purposely availed itself of California jurisdiction by establishing the sub that -- that operates there by establishing Mercedes U.S., that it operates there.
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="704.948" stopTime="706.439">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    --Well, Mercedes--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="706.439" stopTime="712.071">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So -- so creating a subsidiary is not availing itself of jurisdiction?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="712.071" stopTime="722.471">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    --Well, Justice Kennedy, I think in some cases a subsidiary's work could give rise to specific jurisdiction, but I think that's not necessarily true across the United States in all cases.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="722.471" stopTime="735.323">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I agree. 
    And I'm asking what is the rationale that you would use to answer Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical in the -- in the opinion for the Court that is ruling in your favor?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="735.323" stopTime="751.863">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    The answer I would give is that in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical the foreign parent could be subject to specific jurisdiction if it purposefully availed itself of the forum and that very well could be an inquiry that turns on the subsidiary's activity.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="751.863" stopTime="760.782">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And my question is whether or not by creating Mercedes U.S., Daimler didn't purposely avail itself of the forum?

    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr.

    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    --Well, I think some of the amici, candidly, may overstate the purported confusion. 
    At the end of the day, veil-piercing law is certainly well settled and vetted in this country's legal traditions, and I think it is sufficiently capable of precise application in advance. 
    Corporations deal with that standard on a day-to-day basis. 
    And so although I take Your Honor's point that at the margins there may be room for debate as to whether a veil should be pierced in a particular case, I think by and large it's a general standard, it's a familiar standard, and it's a workable standard and it's a standard that people look to on a day-to-day basis.

   Argument of Edwin S. Kneedler
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1010.188" stopTime="1043.627">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    As several questions from the Court suggest, the Due Process Clause itself does not supply fixed rules for the attribution of forum contacts from one corporation to another. 
    Rather, such rules are the province of the positive law that creates the corporation and other substantive law such as agency that defines the relationship of that juridical person to other persons. 
    And those rules are the ones that the corporations themselves rely upon and that others who deal with the corporations rely upon.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="1043.627" stopTime="1095.795">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Could you tell me why we just don't rely on the tests we apply in the tax cases? 
    It's a Federal test and it says if you're functionally and economically tied together and you control the other entity, the parent controls the subsidiary, your earnings are subject to the Due Process Clause and can be taxed by an individual State. 
    It seems like a fairly simple test. 
    And if you break down the complicated California test, really, that was the essence it was getting to. 
    So why do we go to the vagrancies of State law and why don't we just do the true and tried?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1095.795" stopTime="1131.062">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    But in the instance you're talking about in taxation -- and this is related to a question the Chief Justice asked -- the due process clause does not itself prohibit a State or the Federal government from attributing substantive liability, for example, from a -- from a subsidiary to a parent, or, in the case of taxation, of choosing to look at the entire enterprise of which the parent corporation is the head. 
    But those are the results of deliberate choices by the lawmaking organs of the State, which they -- legislature, or when Congress does it, the Federal government. 
    They do not--

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --reflect a general determination that in all circumstances, the acts of the nation or the acts of a subsidiary should be attributed to the parent. 
    In fact, the general rule is quite to the contrary.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1142.575" stopTime="1183.917">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Well, in the situation of individuals, does the -- does the due process rule regarding taxation of individuals by a State align with the -- the ability of somebody to sue that person in the State? 
    Somebody -- for example, if someone is a partner in a law firm that has offices all over the country, they may be paying income taxes in many jurisdictions. 
    Are they subject to general jurisdiction? 
    If there's a -- if you have somebody who works in D.C. and never goes to California but has to pay some income tax in California, are they subject to suit in California for any--
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1183.917" stopTime="1184.573">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    No.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    No. 
    No, they are not. 
    And -- and for the taxation, there has to -- for taxation to begin with, there has to be some nexus between the individual and the -- and the State. 
    The rules that I think Justice Sotomayor was talking about in the Federal Tax Code has similar provisions, really have to do with the measure of taxation. 
    And in most of those situations, certainly, in taxation among the States, there is an apportionment formula. 
    Yes, the -- the overall income may be lumped together for purposes of -- of the initial step, but then there's an apportionment formula that says that -- in the Mobil case that's cited in the briefs, for example, that -- that Vermont can only tax so much of it, that portion that is fairly attributable to Vermont. 
    So in that sense, it's analogous to a specific jurisdiction. 
    You're looking at -- you're coming up with some formula to tie the taxation to the State that is imposing -- imposing the tax.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1236.865" stopTime="1271.054">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Mr. Kneedler, what do you think about this, that -- you know, as I've been looking through these cases, it seems to me that all these attribution issues and the conflict about attribution arises because courts generally have an improperly broad understanding of general jurisdiction and don't quite understand the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction. 
    If the courts -- if the Court here had understood that general jurisdiction applies when a company is essentially at home in a place, would any of these questions have arisen?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1271.054" stopTime="1307.039">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Probably not. 
    The court of appeals -- I think it's page 23 of its opinion -- says that the reason that it looked to the -- the question of whether the in-State activities of MBUSA were important to Daimler was that the importance is a measure of the presence, meaning essentially doing business within -- within California. 
    And as we point out in our brief, the Ninth Circuit's approach to this traces back to early New York cases that -- that address the question of doing business at a time when the business--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

    Yes. 
    Now -- but I think in a broader matter -- and also, I take the point that Justice Kagan made earlier that even -- even if MBUSA was subject to general jurisdiction or if we -- if that's accepted for these purposes, that doesn't mean that Daimler -- you wouldn't attribute MBUSA's jurisdictional status to Daimler. 
    You might attribute its contacts, if the appropriate rules for attribution of contacts work in that.

    Just as a way of getting you to state your general theory of the case, let me ask you: Do you have a recommendation as to whether or not we should remand this case?

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Yes. 
    In -- in our view, it's proper for the -- for the Court to look to background principles of corporate law at least as a starting point or as a presumptive matter. 
    And in this country, corporate separateness, under which a parent is not liable for the acts of a subsidiary, is the general rule. 
    There are established exceptions to that, traditional exceptions: The alter ego exception, and the situation where a principal is responsible for the acts of an agent. 
    Attribution on those bases, because they're traditional, would not offend traditional notions of -- of fair play and substantial justice under the due process clause. 
    Here, Respondent does not argue -- Respondents do not argue for an -- that alter ego would satisfy. 
    And as for agency, there's no argument here that traditional agency requirements are satisfied.

    It's an independent entity.

    In this case, at page 179A of the Joint Appendix, the agreement between Daimler and -- and MBUSA specifically provides that MBUSA is neither a special nor a general agent.

    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I'd like to begin with the question of what's in this case and what isn't, because the fact pattern in this case gives rise to multiple complicated questions, only two of which have been adequately preserved in this case. 
    And one of the questions that's not in the case, Justice Kagan, is whether or not, if MBUSA's contacts are attributable, they are sufficient to establish general jurisdiction. 
    This case has been in litigation on the personal jurisdiction issue for eight years. 
    Throughout that period, we have argued that if MBUSA's contacts were attributed to Daimler, they were sufficient in kind and quantity to support general jurisdiction over Daimler itself.

    Answer: No. 
    Daimler is a German corporation.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Russell, I'm still hung up on -- on why we have to confront a Federal constitutional question. 
    It doesn't seem to me that a State statute which says we want to exercise jurisdiction to the extent the Constitution permits -- I don't think that invites a Court to restructure standard State law and to say we're not going to observe the corporate distinction. 
    I guess you'd have to say we can hold the individual shareholders of a corporation liable, because that might not violate the Constitution. 
    I don't think that when California adopts this statute it means to change its standard law regarding corporations, regarding individuals, and so forth. 
    Why should we assume that?
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="1976.058" stopTime="1979.212">
    Mr. Kevin Russell

    --Now we're -- look at the odd thing. 
    It might not violate the Constitution. 
    I mean, it's the same question, but it is bothering me, too. 
    It might not violate the Constitution of the United States for a State to say we don't have limited liability in respect to the subsidiary corporation or the general corporation. 
    It's very unlikely to do that. 
    It's going to be a big problem to get investment in that State, but it might not violate -- it might not violate the Constitution as here, to say, you know, we are in California not going to have subsidiaries when a plaintiff comes in and sues on the basis of something that happened outside the country; but we will have it when, in fact, he sues on something that happened in California. 
    Now, a State could do that, I guess, but it's pretty odd. 
    And if you look what the -- what the Ninth Circuit said in its opinion, it never referred to California law directly. 
    It's all Ninth Circuit cases or Second Circuit cases. 
    The only thing it says about California is probably something that was quoted in that circuit case, something like that. 
    So, what am I supposed to do, because State law is up to the State? 
    How do I handle that?
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="2062.023" stopTime="2098.198">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    This case has been litigated on the interpretation of the California statute that says that California intended, notwithstanding what rules it applies for liability, to exercise personal jurisdiction to the furthest extent permitted by the Constitution. 
    And here it's not that difficult a question. 
    Here the question is, if Petitioner would have been subject to general jurisdiction in California had it conducted the same operations through a subdivision in the case, does the Due Process Clause give it a constitutional right to avoid that jurisdiction simply by conducting those same operations through a wholly-owned subsidiary.

    No.

    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    No, it certainly wouldn't.

    Well, but why should we -- now that the Federal claims are out -- I mean, when you started the suit you had a claim under the Alien Tort Statute, you had a claim under the Torture Victims Protection Act, but now those Federal claims are out and we are left with a claim under California law and Argentinian law. 
    Why should a Federal forum exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims once the Federal claims are out of the picture?
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="2192.003" stopTime="2200.015">

    Well, certainly we agree that if this case were remanded to the district court it would have discretion to refuse to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2200.015" stopTime="2218.383">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Wouldn't it be arbitrary for it to exercise personal jurisdiction when there is no Federal claim and the case involves foreign plaintiffs injured abroad, allegedly due to the activities of a subsidiary operating abroad?
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="2218.383" stopTime="2269.504">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    Ultimately, we don't think so. 
    I think you would have to take into account this case has been in litigation for eight years already. 
    I think that's a substantial reason for the Court to want to allow the case to continue. 
    I recognize that we would have a very hard time appealing from a decision that refused to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. 
    But again, on the question that the Court actually granted cert on and which was actually preserved here, I do think that the Court could simply hold that, look, attribution of contacts between a wholly-owned subsidiary and its parents is not so unreasonable as to violate the Constitution. 
    At the end of the day, the due process question is whether the defendant had sufficiently availed itself of the benefits of doing business in the State to warrant an exercise of jurisdiction. 
    It can do that either directly, through its--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2269.504" stopTime="2276.626">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Yes, but that test that you just -- the sufficiently purposeful availing, those are all specific jurisdiction questions.

    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    --With respect, I don't think that's correct. 
    Justice Kennedy's opinion for the plurality in Castro, for example, identified the underlying premise of both general and specific jurisdiction and availing oneself of the benefits of being in the State.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And Goodyear distinguished the two by saying general jurisdiction means it's equivalent to residence for an individual. 
    It's where you are at home. 
    And general jurisdiction was much broader in the days before long arm statutes. 
    But now that we have specific jurisdiction so you can sue where the event occurred, just as specific jurisdiction has expanded, so general jurisdiction has shrunk.

    I understand that there are very serious and important questions with respect to what it means to be at home in a State. 
    And that if Petitioner had raised those arguments below, it might actually have prevailed.

    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    --I don't think that's right. 
    I mean, this Court has recognized that look, the Due Process Clause requires ultimately drawing some lines, but it can't be done in a mechanical way. 
    Here, Goodyear provides a safe harbor to companies that want to make sure that they're not subject to general jurisdiction in California. 
    They can do so by selling their cars to an independent distributor, the way Petitioner used to do and the way that Toyota still does. 
    But with respect to--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2546.739" stopTime="2590.113">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But if you go -- if you go back to the -- to the foundation case of International Shoe. 
    That case recognized that you can be an agent for one purpose, but not for another. 
    So the people -- the salesmen who were promoting the sales of shoes were the agents of International Shoe for the purpose of promoting the sale of shoes. 
    They were not an all-purpose agent for the purpose of, say, dealing -- real estate dealings on behalf of the corporation. 
    So you could have an agency for one purpose, selling cars in California, but totally unrelated to torturing people in Argentina.
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="2590.113" stopTime="2623.801">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    --That's right. 
    But the -- but that I think we need to separate the two ideas of what does it take to make Petitioner at home in California. 
    Once it's established that it is at home in California, it is simply a traditional aspect of general jurisdiction that it will be subject to suit for things that happened abroad. 
    If this suit had been brought against Apple Computer, which is headquartered in California, I don't think we would be here today. 
    The question here is whether the -- the conduct in California is rendered insufficient by virtue of the fact that it was undertaken by a subsidiary.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    That is my problem, and I don't know what to do. 
    It's really -- Justice Scalia has been mentioning this problem. 
    You're seeing it through the lens of jurisdiction. 
    I'm not. 
    I'm seeing it through the lens of corporate law. 
    Five shareholders get together from outside California and they set up a corporation in California. 
    Why? 
    To insulate themselves from liability, particularly lawsuits. 
    Now, instead of those five shareholders, everything is the same, but now it's a German corporation and suddenly, they can't insulate themselves from the lawsuits in California. 
    I think it unlikely that California would have such a corporate law, whether it goes by the name of jurisdiction or some other name. 
    But that's a State law question. 
    So what am I supposed to do? 
    That's where we started this argument. 
    And that's what I--

    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    Well, Justice Breyer, if you think -- if you think that the -- the proper resolution of a case like this turns on issues that were not preserved below and have not been argued here, then you can do one of two things.

    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    We are not prepared to concede that at this point, although we recognize we have an uphill struggle to fit ourselves within the exception that's been left. 
    Principally, our argument would be based on the fact that at the time of suit, this was a dual American/German company with dual headquarters in -- in the United States, which is different than Shell. 
    But we're not prepared to concede it, but we're not asking this Court to resolve it.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If this is as -- as Justice Breyer and I seem to think, a question of State law, don't you think it's extraordinary that the Ninth Circuit could make such a significant holding on -- on California law without -- there is a certification procedure in California, isn't there?
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="2772.791" stopTime="2774.385">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    There is, although--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2774.385" stopTime="2802.435">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So why -- why wouldn't they have asked the California Supreme Court whether -- whether this jurisdiction statute was meant to alter corporate law or, you know, tort law, or, you know -- just imagine any change in law that would bear upon jurisdiction, and all those changes must be assumed to have happened. 
    Couldn't -- couldn't they ask that? 
    Is that what this California jurisdictional statute means?
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="2802.435" stopTime="2805.029">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    --Sure. 
    They could have asked that. 
    Usually they only ask those questions--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2805.029" stopTime="2806.215">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is it too late to ask it now?
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="2806.215" stopTime="2860.459">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    --It wouldn't be if you sent it back. 
    I mean, usually courts of appeals don't ask those questions unless somebody asks them to. 
    And here Petitioner never asked them to. 
    It assumed, as did we, that the statute meant that they wanted the most permissive attribution rule that's permitted by the Due Process Clause; and I don't think it's unreasonable -- that's an unreasonable interpretation of the statute. 
    I recognize that it's a little bit problematic that these statutes don't give greater definitive guidance; the Petitioner hasn't complained about that either. 
    And so on the premises on which this case was litigated, I do think you can decide this case by resolving two questions: First, on the assumption that if MBUSA's contacts are attributable to Petitioner, they are sufficient to make it at home, does the fact that those contacts are through a wholly-owned subsidiary rather than a subdivision make the exercise of general jurisdiction improper--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2860.459" stopTime="2900.958">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    If we assume for the sake of argument that there isn't a preservation issue regarding this in-home -- this at-home question, why shouldn't the rule be that unless a corporation is incorporated in the jurisdiction or has its principal place of business in the jurisdiction, the -- the acts of the subsidiary are not attributable unless it's an alter ego. 
    It's a nice clean rule; many of the prominent scholars in this area think that the American doctrine of general jurisdiction doesn't serve any good purpose. 
    Now that specific jurisdiction has been expanded, it makes us an international outlier. 
    Why shouldn't we have a nice clear rule like that, and everybody will know exactly where things stand?
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="2900.958" stopTime="2924.329">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    --Just to be clear, there are two parts to that rule. 
    There is one that's the assertion that ordinarily, you're only at home in the place of principal business, or principal -- principal place of business, or your place of incorporation. 
    And the other is, oh, we'll only apply that rule with respect to subsidiary contacts. 
    That additional thing, which is necessary to -- to shoehorn it into this case, I think, is very artificial. 
    So if this Court is going to--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2924.329" stopTime="2926.172">

    What is the additional thing?

    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    --That we will only apply that rule if the contacts, if I understand Justice Alito's proposal, we only apply that rule if the contacts in the State are through a subsidiary. 
    That's a very artificial gerrymander, honestly, to fit the facts of this case. 
    If this Court is going to say that the doing business theory of general jurisdiction is no longer good law, it should do so directly, it should do so when the case has actually been briefed. 
    It hasn't been briefed here.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    You did say in your brief that recognizing that other nations are highly critical of our expansive, one-time expansive, notion of doing business as a basis for general jurisdiction, you say that that shouldn't be taken into account as a basis for constitutional decisionmaking. 
    And yet what we are talking about is a notion of whether it's fair and reasonable to require a corporation to answer in a forum, and is what the other countries think unenlightening on what's fair and reasonable.

    How do you argue that it's subject to jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, not specific jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, which means over suits that have nothing to do with California or indeed, as here, over in the United States, have anything to do with anything that happened in the United States.

    It's--

    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    --But the problem is a corporation shouldn't be jurisdictionally better off simply because it's bigger than its competitors who are smaller and therefore necessarily do a bigger portion of their business in a smaller number of places. 
    I think there is a very significant fairness problem with the proportionality test suggested by the government, again never raised in this case. 
    Nobody ever argued that MBUSA didn't do enough business in California, and in fact it's done billions of dollars of business there and it's enjoyed the benefits of being in the State, of doing business in the State, to a far greater degree than many of its competitors, say Tesla, which is subject to general jurisdiction for suits for anything that it does anywhere in the world.

    --No. 
    Goodyear didn't purport to change anything. 
    I know you used a new phrase to describe the prior precedent, but it wasn't purporting to revise it, and I don't think that there was substantial argument in that case on that score.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    There would hardly be room for a decision next to Goodyear that says, oh, for general jurisdiction purposes it's enough that you have some subsidiary operating in the State. 
    The whole idea of Goodyear was to say there is one place you can always sue a corporation, one or two, place of incorporation, a principal place of business.
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="3215.371" stopTime="3235.021">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    Well, again if I can just respond to that idea. 
    The one consequence of that, and getting back to what I would say to Justice Kagan, is people aren't subject to general jurisdiction only in one or two places. 
    They are subject to general jurisdiction anywhere they set foot and are served with process. 
    And I think it is quite unfair to say--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3235.021" stopTime="3237.784">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But people can be only one place at a time.
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="3237.784" stopTime="3269.115">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    --But they go a lot of places over time. 
    And as a consequence they are in fact in the course of living their lives or even doing business in an unincorporated forum subject to general jurisdiction in a lot of places. 
    Again, this is an important question that hasn't been briefed in this case, it wasn't preserved below, and I think that you ought to decide the case on the grounds, on the premises on which it has been litigated for eight years. 
    And if you can't do that you ought to dismiss the case as improvidently granted or at least remand the case to allow a full airing of these issues in an appropriate forum.

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    If this 2.4 percent figure is important, wouldn't we get into impossible line-drawing problems? 
    What if it was 1.4 percent?
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="3278.519" stopTime="3284.626">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    Well, you do get into line-drawing problems in this area. 
    This Court has recognized that even in specific jurisdiction cases.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You think it should be billions of dollars, right, that percentage, right?
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="3289.047" stopTime="3290.672">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    I think billions of dollars is enough.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3290.672" stopTime="3294.263">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So we've got to pick a dollar amount rather than a percentage.
speaker="kevin_russell" startTime="3294.263" stopTime="3318.597">
    Mr. Kevin Russell 
    Well, you have to pick some metric. 
    I mean, this Court's cases have always been general. 
    They talked about minimum contacts. 
    They talked about systematic and continuous business operations in the State. 
    And the Court has always recognized that those are not standards that are capable of mechanical operation or bright line the rules. 
    If you think that you need to develop some new standards, you ought to do it in a case when it is squarely presented and adequately briefed. 
    If there are no further questions--

   Rebuttal of Thomas H. Dupree Jr.
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="3324.142" stopTime="3354.882">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    Just a few brief points. 
    First, with regard to Justice Breyer's question about remand, I think there is absolutely no reason for this Court to remand this case to the Ninth Circuit. 
    The issues as to attribution were fully briefed below. 
    They are fully briefed here. 
    I think that were this Court to either remand the case or dismiss the case, for one thing, the circuit split would persist. 
    The Ninth Circuit's decision in the event of a remand would remain on the books. 
    Even if this Court were to remand the decision of the Second Circuit which--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="3354.882" stopTime="3370.892">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Do you really care how we do it? 
    Given that so many issues have not been adequately briefed, conceded when they are obviously fallacious and unsupportable, why don't we just say simply exercise of jurisdiction is unreasonable in this case?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="3370.892" stopTime="3373.203">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    --Well, Justice Sotomayor--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="3373.203" stopTime="3389.931">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    The other side -- neither you or the other side have argued that there isn't a reasonableness component. 
    I know some of my colleagues don't think there is. 
    But both of you have proceeded in your briefing as if there is. 
    Do you care how you win?
speaker="thomas_h_dupree_jr" startTime="3389.931" stopTime="3543.284">
    Mr. Thomas H. Dupree Jr. 
    --Well, yes, Your Honor, I think we do. 
    I think we do. 
    And let me say this. 
    I think that with, regard to Your Honor's points about issues being waived or forfeited below, the only issue that even arguably, even arguably was operated below was the discrete question as to whether Mercedes Benz itself is subject to general jurisdiction in California. 
    The question that Justice Kagan and others were inquiring about, namely that even were one to accept the attribution theory and evaluate Daimler as a joint enterprise, would that render the combined enterprise at home in California, we plainly did not waive or forfeit that question. 
    In fact we expressly addressed it in our opening brief and we have been fighting in this case from day one to argue that, even if you were to attribute the contacts, there is no basis for jurisdiction over Daimler. 
    That question is squarely presented for this Court's review. 
    I also think that, as Justice Ginsburg and others have noted, there has been some confusion in the lower courts over the distinction between specific jurisdiction and general jurisdiction. 
    This Court saw it in Goodyear, for example, and I think that were this Court to resolve this case on the ground that Justice Kagan suggested or Justice Alito suggested, namely, that a corporation cannot be at home outside of the areas where it maintains its principal place of business or is incorporated, that it can't be subject to general jurisdiction anywhere else. 
    That would be a clean rule. 
    It would be a workable rule. 
    I think it's fully consistent with what the Court said in Goodyear, and it would provide clarity and guidance to the lower courts and eliminate the circuit split that currently exists over agency jurisdiction. 
    A couple other quick points. 
    Justice Scalia, I regret to report that neither the parties nor the courts below reproduced the text of the California statute. 
    The Solicitor General, however, to his credit did on page 4 of his brief. 
    It simply says that California may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of California or the United States. 
    And the Ninth Circuit panel on page 19A of the Petitioner's appendix said that, therefore, the question is this case -- in this case is simply whether the exercise of jurisdiction would exceed the permissible bounds of due process. 
    The last point I want to make, and we've been discussing legal issues, is just to remind the Court of the facts of this case. 
    This is a case involving Argentine plaintiffs suing a German corporation based on events that allegedly occurred in Argentina more than 30 years ago. 
    This case has no connection to the United States, and it has no business in a California courtroom. 
    The Ninth Circuit's contrary conclusion is indefensible, and for that reason, we ask that the judgment be reversed.
