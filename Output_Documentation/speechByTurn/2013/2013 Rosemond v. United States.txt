Rosemond v. United States

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-895, Rosemond v. United States. 
    Mr. Elwood.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="7.170" stopTime="25.298">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    It has long been a bedrock principle of American law that aiding and abetting liability requires proof that an accomplice acted with purposeful intent to facilitate or encourage the crime of conviction and that mere knowing assistance is insufficient.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="25.298" stopTime="40.075">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Do you agree that the jury could find the defendant guilty of the firearms charge under a proper instruction? 
    In other words, was there sufficient evidence so that if a proper instruction were given, there could have been a conviction?
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="40.075" stopTime="59.972">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    Even if the -- I think in this particular case, even if the jury had been given a proper instruction, it would have been a difficult charge to make out because the government never really argued facilitation after getting knowledge of the firearm. 
    There was never evidence of foreknowledge; the government never asserted evidence of foreknowledge.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="59.972" stopTime="112.423">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, I guess we can get into later to whether or not if you know a firearm is being carried and if you then facilitate the commission of the underlying felony by driving the car, participating in the transaction, whether that's sufficient. 
    But let me ask you this: Would the instruction that was given, which was at JA 196, would it be okay if Paragraph 1, 
    "The defendant knew his cohort used a firearm. " 
    I think there is a real problem with that, because it's retrospective. 
    Would the instruction have been sufficient if the defendant knew his cohort would use or was carrying? 
    Would that change it?
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="112.423" stopTime="128.116">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    Well, I think at least that would have required foreknowledge. 
    But I think it would still have been problematic because it would only have required knowing facilitation. 
    And courts, traditionally, have required intentional facilitation, that is, they intend to further the crime.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="128.116" stopTime="162.020">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You do not agree, then, that if you know that there's -- that there's a bank robbery afoot and you're cooperating in that, you're -- you're the wheelman, and you also know that the -- you know that the people who are conducting the bank robbery are carrying firearms, you say that there's no criminal liability for the firearms unless you intended them to use the firearms; is that your position?
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="162.020" stopTime="168.507">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    It's our position that you could infer from the fact that you're assisting the transaction involving--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Justice Scalia can -- his own question. 
    But the question is: What -- what does the jury have to find? 
    I know they can -- I know what they can infer, but the question from Justice Scalia is, you're the -- you drive -- you drive the car, you know firearms are there and might be used, is that sufficient? 
    And that's his question.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="189.518" stopTime="195.220">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    I -- I think that that would be -- that would support a verdict. 
    That would support a verdict. 
    The only question--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="195.220" stopTime="200.788">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Now, wait. 
    It would support a verdict -- you're saying it would support a finding of -- of intent.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="200.788" stopTime="205.092">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --That's correct. 
    But the question is whether you don't even have to instruct a jury--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="205.092" stopTime="214.632">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Let's assume there's a lot of evidence that he didn't really want them to use firearms, that there's no way you can say he intended them to use, but he knew that they had firearms.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="214.632" stopTime="219.001">
    Mr. John P. Elwood

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No. 
    No, no, you can't. 
    It's my hypothetical. 
    And you cannot conclude from that. 
    There is so much other evidence. 
    This -- this man hates firearms. 
    He does not like firearms. 
    There is no way he could have intended them to use firearms. 
    But he knew they had firearms.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="233.792" stopTime="252.187">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --You know, I hate to be accused of resisting the hypothetical, because in that -- in that case, I don't think it matters whether you have the subjective desire, like you think, boy, I sure wish those firearms weren't involved. 
    But because at that point, your goal is to facilitate and make sure that this bank robbery--

    Facilitate the crime.

    The whole thing with the gun.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So you don't have to -- you don't have to--
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="259.007" stopTime="265.827">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    But that is your -- we would say that that is the purpose in facilitating. 
    And the question is not just that. 
    The question is whether you--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="265.827" stopTime="273.181">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Okay. 
    So if you intend a crime -- if you intend a crime and you know that the crime is being conducted with firearms, that's enough.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="273.181" stopTime="279.671">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --I don't think that that -- I think that you have to have the fore -- the foreknowledge. 
    And I think that there are certainly hypothesize--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Beforehand. 
    Before -- you know beforehand that the crime is going to be perpetrated with firearms. 
    That's all you do. 
    You know beforehand, and you facilitate the crime.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="290.143" stopTime="301.184">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --I think that you -- the question is whether -- you can't even conceive of the circumstance where knowing -- that is, participation -- knowing that a firearm would be used or carried.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="301.184" stopTime="303.184">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Well, give me an example of that. 
    Give us--
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="303.184" stopTime="334.506">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    For example, if you agree to drive your neighbor to pick up drugs at some place in Philadelphia or -- let's make it Pittsburgh. 
    And then you drive him to West Virginia to spend the weekend dealing. 
    On the way there he tells you, the guy who distributed these to me, you know, he always carries a Derringer in his boot. 
    And at that point, you don't facilitate his use or carriage of the gun with respect to the drug distribution offense. 
    It has no role in -- in the crime. 
    And so I think you can conceive of enough circumstances--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="334.506" stopTime="342.911">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    --And I don't -- I don't understand the example. 
    The -- the alleged aider and abetter learns about this after it's happened? 
    That's the idea?
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="342.911" stopTime="350.517">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --Yes, but he's still facilitating the drug distribution offense at a time he knows that a gun is, you know, being carried in relation to it.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="350.517" stopTime="418.924">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Well, let me change -- let me -- maybe this is the same as Justice Scalia's hypothetical, but let me try it. 
    Suppose that two guys have a meeting and it's -- it's in a place that's -- where there's an electronic eavesdropping device. 
    In fact, there's a camera. 
    So it's all recorded. 
    So we know exactly what was said. 
    And the principal says, here's the deal, I'm going to rob a convenience store and I'm going to carry a gun. 
    And the aider and abetter says, well, all right. 
    I'm in on the -- you know, I'm in on robbing the convenience store, but I don't want anything having to do with the gun. 
    I think you should carry a baseball bat. 
    The principal says, no, that's the deal. 
    I'm robbing the store. 
    I'm carrying a gun. 
    Take it or leave it. 
    Are you going to drive me there? 
    And -- and the other guy says, I hate guns, I don't want to have anything to do with guns. 
    I -- I hate this idea about the guns. 
    They go back and forth. 
    And the -- the principal says finally, look, this is it. 
    This is the deal. 
    I'm using a gun. 
    Are you going to help me or not? 
    And the guy says, well, all right. 
    I'm going to drive you, but I want it noted for the record that I'm opposed -- I'm opposed to the use of a gun. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="418.924" stopTime="431.315">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    And at that point, it's his purpose to facilitate a transaction and to, you know, help it succeed and it's at a time when he knows that a gun will be used and that -- I think you can conclude that that is his purpose.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="431.315" stopTime="445.924">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    See -- so I don't really see -- I can't -- I can't think of a situation where a person facilitates the crime, knows what the crime is going to be, knows that a gun is going to be used but doesn't intend for the gun to be used.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="445.924" stopTime="446.690">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    The question is--

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    In those two situations, knowledge and intent, seem to me to be -- to be the same thing.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="451.828" stopTime="463.300">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --The question is whether there are -- because there are just no instances that are more like my hypothetical than like your hypothetical. 
    So you don't even have to bother troubling the jury about whether they had the intent.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="463.300" stopTime="466.670">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Well, I don't understand your hypotheticals. 
    If you could give it to us again.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="466.670" stopTime="486.832">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    Well, the point of it is that at a time when you are -- when you are still participating in the underlying offense, the drug trafficking offense, you know that a gun is being carried in relation to it. 
    But you don't have any intent to facilitate it. 
    You don't care one way or the other if it gets used. 
    You don't intend to facilitate it, and you don't facilitate it. 
    And the question is whether you--

    But you facilitate--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="487.417" stopTime="495.688">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, that's -- that's a conclusion. 
    The jury, it seems to me, could say you do facilitate it if in these hypotheticals you drive the car--
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="495.688" stopTime="497.107">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --But the thing is--

    --with knowledge that the gun might be used.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="499.392" stopTime="505.377">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --No, but the gun is not going to be used in your act of facilitation. 
    It may be used over in Philadelphia, and you aren't doing--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="505.377" stopTime="508.747">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, the submission is the jury can find otherwise.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="508.747" stopTime="509.981">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --And the question--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="509.981" stopTime="513.816">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    The -- the gun would never have been used if you didn't drive the -- or carried if you didn't drive the car.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="513.816" stopTime="537.181">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --But I think the jury could equally well conclude that you did not intend to facilitate the use of the gun and you did not facilitate the use of the gun. 
    And the question is whether you even need to trouble the jury with it. 
    Because the government's instruction conclusively presumes both knowledge -- or conclusively presumes intent from knowledge alone and it conclusively presumes facilitation of the gun from facilitation of the underlying offense.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="537.181" stopTime="541.385">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    --Or in my -- in my hypothetical, could a rational jury say he knew about it, but he didn't intend it?
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="541.385" stopTime="560.780">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    I think that in your case with the foreknowledge and where he, you know, facilitates, he carries the gun and he carries the person to the offense, I think that that would be a tough slog. 
    In a case -- but ours is a case where there isn't foreknowledge and the government never argued that he knew before the gun -- before the gun was fired that it was his associate who was the shooter.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="560.780" stopTime="571.035">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Well, in my case -- and I'll finish. 
    I want to ask another question about this. 
    But in my case, if the judge had given the instruction, it's enough that he knew about it. 
    He facilitated the crime when he knew there was a gun. 
    Would that be error?
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="571.035" stopTime="586.911">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    I think it would be error because you're instructing them on the wrong elements. 
    It might be harmless error. 
    But the point -- both sides agree here that you have to facilitate the crime of conviction and you have to intend that the gun be used.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="586.911" stopTime="609.276">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't think it's ever harmless error to not instruct the jury -- or to instruct the jury not to find one of the elements of the crime. 
    If, indeed, intent is necessary, it seems to me he has to instruct the jury to find intent. 
    It's not up to the court to say, well, there surely was intent anyway so it's harmless error. 
    The jury has to find intent.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="609.276" stopTime="617.716">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    I think -- you know what, I'm fine with it being a harmful error, too. 
    But my point was merely to note that I think that it is something that you have to instruct the jury on as a proper element--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="617.716" stopTime="619.066">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Excuse me. 
    But what are we instructing--

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --even if it winds up not making a difference.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="619.916" stopTime="722.649">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    --I think what we're driving at here, and I think this is the moment you're resisting, but to me, and as you can tell from my colleague's questions, if you know that someone's carrying a gun, and whether you want them to use it or not is irrelevant, if they take it out and use it and you have gone along with them in the crime, you're guilty. 
    Okay? 
    That -- that's what we're driving at. 
    Assume that I believe that. 
    Assume that I believe that if you have knowledge of the gun, and that I am participating in the crime with your knowledge of that gun, whether the knowledge is secured before the crime starts or during the crime, if I continue to participate in the crime knowing that you have a gun, then that's knowledge of the gun and intent to facilitate. 
    I thought the example that you were relying on here or the issue that got confused in the briefs was whether or not, from the sequence of facts in this case, you can actually discern that intent to facilitate the crime because the alleged shooter, which your client said was someone else, jumped into the car and the car took off before anybody could abandon the crime. 
    That's what I actually thought this case was about: At what juncture do you instruct the jury to say that you have to be a participant with knowledge of the crime? 
    But you're saying something different right now. 
    You're almost suggesting that there has to be a pre-knowledge that the gun will be used.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="722.649" stopTime="739.509">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    No, I don't think -- I don't think that there has to be pre-knowledge. 
    My point is this: That there are circumstances I think where you can know of a gun and be participating in the underlying -- underlying predicate offense and not facilitate the use of the gun. 
    And I--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="739.509" stopTime="741.478">

    One night you're doing it and you see that the guy is -- that the guy who you work for, his enforcer is coming by and you know he always carries a gun. 
    He walks behind you and, you know, he's present and around you for about 90 seconds, but during that time, you do exactly what you always did.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Elwood, you're dealing with all kinds of hypotheticals. 
    But in this case we had a jury determination that Rosemond was the person -- he was convicted of carrying ammunition, right? 
    There were two counts of carrying -- possession of the ammunition. 
    And couldn't one infer from that that he -- he possessed the ammunition, he was the gun carrier?
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="864.288" stopTime="913.371">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    Two things, Justice Ginsburg. 
    First, the government never raised this below and it wasn't pressed or passed on below, and so I think under Glover v. United States this Court wouldn't ordinarily consider that in the first instance, would leave it for remand. 
    But secondly, I think that it's not clear enough. 
    I mean, you can't say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error didn't infect that, too, because the jury was instructed four times that you can possess something through constructive possession, through a confederate. 
    And I think when the jury concludes that he is guilty of a possession offense, which is 924(c) as a possession offense, as an aider and abetter, and they marked on the judge's instruction that he used the gun, he carried the gun, that the jury could have believed that they were -- that he constructively possessed the gun and thereby constructively possessed the ammunition.

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    I think the only evidence of possession was that it was inside the gun that was fired. 
    And I think the jury rejected the idea that he was the shooter because the two eyewitnesss said that the shooter was someone else, that the shooter was the guy in the backseat, who was Ronald Joseph.

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --They are exactly the same. 
    The only evidence was that the cartridges were inside the gun. 
    And the evidence -- the two eyewitnesss who were at the scene said that the person got out of the driver's side, and the evidence suggests that Mr. Rosemond was on the passenger side, and that he got out of the backseat, and he was in the front seat. 
    So the -- the evidence, I think, is that he was -- he was merely in the car, not that he was a shooter. 
    And the jury, remember, asked: Do we have to answer question 3, which was the -- all the different ways you can use the gun -- if we find him guilty on an aiding and abetting theory? 
    Which certainly suggests they did not believe he was the shooter.

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    The government did not ever argue facilitation after the shots were fired, I suspect because -- they only argued that he -- that what happened afterwards was evidence he was the shooter. 
    I suspect because they appreciated that the offense was over with. 
    He was only charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. 
    When Mr. Gonzales took off with the marijuana and they lost control, you know, they went around afterwards looking for him, which, you know, there's not even very much evidence of that.

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    I -- I am not aware and the government hasn't cited any. 
    I mean, there's -- there's -- for different crimes, you know, there's -- there's different law about whether flight is part of the offense. 
    But in any event, the question is whether that would be aiding and abetting that crime, the possession offense or some distinct crime, or whether that would be being an accessory after the fact. 
    And that was never charged.

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    That itself was disputed. 
    But the question is, even if they're chasing him, that might be attempt to possess the marijuana to get it back. 
    It might be conspiracy to possess the marijuana, but that wasn't -- wasn't charged. 
    The only thing was possession.

    Well, it might be -- it might be an effort to continue the crime of -- in other words, it might make a difference whether the people who are being chased look and see two guys in the car or three guys in the car. 
    If somebody says -- and I realize you dispute these facts -- let's go get them and the guy jumps in the car, it seems to me that that's aiding and abetting the underlying illegal activity with knowledge, of course, that guns were used.
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="1123.655" stopTime="1140.200">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    I agree. 
    But first, that's not a theory that the government ever espoused. 
    They never argued that facilitation. 
    And secondly, I don't know that that would be facilitation of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute it. 
    That ended under the court's instructions when they lost control of the marijuana when Mr. Gonzales disappeared.

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.

speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="1158.428" stopTime="1200.838">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    We're not saying that. 
    We are saying that when you -- you have to instruct them did he facilitate the actual crime of conviction. 
    Because what the government is doing here, what their instruction does is it conclusively presumes that he facilitated the distinct offense, which this Court has said, the entirely new crime of 924(c), from the fact that they did the underlying offense. 
    Their favorite example in the brief is a mail fraud example. 
    But under the government's theory, because you engage in an act of mail fraud, you could be convicted of racketeering without any additional actus reus because that is a predicate crime to RICO. 
    And that's the thing is we're just saying you can't presume the full offense -- facilitation of the full offense from the fact that you just facilitated one element.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1200.838" stopTime="1218.985">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    So if there were not -- if the -- the drug offense were not illegal, there -- there wasn't a drug offense and then the -- the additional firearm element, it wouldn't be necessary for him -- for the defendant to facilitate every element of that offense. 
    It's dependent on the fact that there's this other criminal conduct.

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    We're just saying that they have to be -- the jury just has to be instructed to ask, did he facilitate the crime of conviction? 
    And they're asking a different -- they're asking a different question, essentially. 
    And it wouldn't present the same risk that you would convict someone twice and they'd serve two consecutive sentences under the hypothetical you suggest, but we still say they should be asked whether they facilitated the right crime.

    Mr. John P. Elwood

    Mr. John P. Elwood

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    That's right. 
    But it's -- I think our -- the reason why we think it makes a difference is because it's a different crime. 
    And the government is trying to get the jury to conclusively presume from the fact that you did the one crime, that you must also have facilitated the other. 
    And we just don't think that that is something that you can say with 100 percent certainty so you can remove it from jury determination.

    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Isn't criminal law -- isn't criminal law replete with crimes which have lesser included offenses as part of them?

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    There are some courts that apply this, our rationale to lesser included's as well. 
    But lesser included crimes are the same crime for Blockburger purposes. 
    You can't be sentenced to both the greater and the lesser. 
    And I think most courts require that you show the intent that the gun be used. 
    They don't as often require that you facilitate the discreet use of or carriage of a gun.

    Well, let me go back to my earlier hypothetical about the taped conversation.

    However, I'm not going to do one thing to help you get the gun or use the gun. 
    I don't want to -- I'm not going to.

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    Well, he may say that he is not going to facilitate it, but, depending on what his actions are, he may -- very well may facilitate it. 
    If he drives the gun and the person to the -- the crime, you know, that is an act of facilitation. 
    And so, you know, it doesn't depend on what the person says.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Thank you, counsel.

   Argument of John F. Bash
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="1534.983" stopTime="1609.813">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I'd like to start by defining exactly what the government contends the mens rea requirement is for aiding and abetting, and then give the Court an example -- two examples to show how it differs both from what Mr. Elwood is saying and how it differs from a knowledge standard. 
    Aiding and abetting requires an intent to facilitate or encourage the commission of an offense. 
    And I think that breaks down into two constituent parts: One, an intent to make some action easier or to encourage some action by the principal; two, the knowledge that the principal intends to commit a crime of which that action is a constituent part. 
    What Mr. Elwood is saying is something quite different. 
    It's that you have to intend that the crime succeed. 
    If that's true, all paid accomplices are out if they don't intend that the crime succeed. 
    If the -- if the bank robbers say, hey, can you look the other way, security guard, while we go into the bank, we'll give you a thousand dollars if you do it, that's not aiding and abetting under his theory if the security guard says, well, I only wanted a thousand dollars; I didn't care whether you ultimately succeeded in the bank. 
    We give an example in our brief: If the person actually gives the gun so it meets the actus reus requirement that Mr. Elwood has proposed, he actually gives the gun to somebody, not because he cares if that person commits the crime, which he knows he intends to commit, but as a favor for his friend--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1609.813" stopTime="1638.983">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    That's a very fanciful hypothetical, because the one thing the guard is going to know, that if the robber gets caught, he's in great jeopardy of -- of being caught himself and convicted. 
    Of course he wants the crime to succeed because he doesn't want the people to be there and being pressured by investigators or whatever to say, okay, you know, who was in on -- who was in on this with you? 
    So if you're -- if you're being paid for a crime, to assist in the commission of the crime, you want it to succeed.
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="1638.982" stopTime="1653.240">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    --Well, if your payment is not coming from the loot, I don't think that's really true. 
    But let's take that as true as given. 
    I mean, go back to my example about the guy that's just doing a favor for somebody. 
    Sure, you can use my gun to commit a robbery. 
    I don't have any stake in it. 
    If you decide tomorrow that you don't want to commit the robbery, that's fine with me.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1653.240" stopTime="1662.346">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    He has a stake in it. 
    If the guy is caught, the police are going to say, where did you get the gun? 
    He may turn him in or not, but it's certainly a danger, a danger that wouldn't be there if the crime succeeded.
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="1662.346" stopTime="1676.172">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    I don't -- I don't think that's the sort of intent requirement that Mr. Elwood is talking about. 
    I mean, I think he's talking about an intent that's abstracted from the idea that if you get caught, everybody might go to jail. 
    I mean, that sort of seems to beg the question of whether you're actually going to be liable for the gun.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1676.172" stopTime="1717.082">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, why don't we just take it that we have a crime, the underlying crime, it's a 48-month crime, and then if you have a gun in connection with that crime, it becomes 120 months consecutive. 
    And your position seems to be that all you have to prove is facilitation of the underlying drug offense. 
    And it seems to me to -- to get 10 years of your life for the government proving no more than the 48-month charge is a bit much.
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="1717.082" stopTime="1736.577">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    It's not proving no more than the 48-month charge. 
    And I'll just -- as a footnote, it's 10 years only if the gun is fired. 
    It's 5 years if it's carried or used, and which obviously creates a much greater danger to people's lives and property if it's fired. 
    But it's not only proving that you facilitated the drug offense. 
    It's facilitating the drug offense with the foreknowledge that a gun was going to be involved in it.

    Because as I -- when I read this, I thought, well, given these confusing facts, a jury might think that there's liability if he knew that a firearm was used, which is a very odd interpretation, but that's -- the instruction lends itself to that interpretation.
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="1776.971" stopTime="1785.494">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    Justice Kennedy, that is an odd interpretation and it's wrong and we do not contend that liability could be imposed if you learned of the gun only after your participation ended. 
    A couple points on that.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1785.494" stopTime="1790.798">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

    Mr. John F. Bash 
    Well, I don't think read in the context of the full instruction. 
    If you look at--

    Yes.
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="1799.986" stopTime="1833.074">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    I think it's possible, but I think if you read it in the context of the full charge and what reasonable jurors would think, you have the formulation right above that on page 196 that mirrors exactly the Peoni standard. 
    And I don't think reasonable jurors reading that in conjunction with the more specific instruction on count 2 could think that he could be liable if his participation ended only after the firearm was used. 
    And, Justice Kennedy, nobody below thought that, because Petitioner never objected on the grounds that the particular wording of this instruction allowed conviction if you gained knowledge only after your participation. 
    So at minimum--

    --Mr. Chief Justice, first of all, under Rule 30 it is not enough to propose an alternative instruction that does not contain the defect. 
    You have to lay out the specific grounds for your objection. 
    He did not do that here, so it should be plain error review. 
    That is doubly true here where his instruction had its own error. 
    His instruction would have required intentional facilitation of the gun, which is the question on this Court granted certiorari.

    Mr. John F. Bash 
    --I think the only way Petitioner fits that instruction into his view of the law is because the driver started out driving the people to the bank, so he says, oh, well, you are satisfying my actus reus requirement because you actually transported the guns to the bank. 
    But tweak the hypothetical a little bit. 
    Suppose the getaway driver is paid only to show up at the end and to, you know, ferry the bank robbers away. 
    He knows all along that it's going to be a firearm offense. 
    I'm pretty sure Mr. Elwood would say: Because you took no act facilitating the gun in that case, you only sort of showed up at the end, even though you knew a gun would be used, that that's not facilitation. 
    So I take your point, Justice Kennedy, that in a wide swath of cases it may not matter, but I think in some cases it is going to matter. 
    And -- take his intent requirement. 
    I mean, the person that lends the gun just to be a good guy, not because he cares about the offense, I'm pretty sure he is out. 
    And if the jury is convinced, hey, I knew he was going to commit a robbery or assault but I just did not care, if the jury is convinced by that, he is acquitted, and that can't possibly be right.

    The reality is in most cases you don't. 
    Occasionally you get a co-conspirator that will tell you, but in most cases you have just the actor. 
    A defendant is present during a crime, a gun is pulled, and he leaves with his cohorts. 
    You don't know if he had advance knowledge that the gun would be used because he wasn't carrying it and he may have done nothing but be present during the crime, left, and got a split of the money later, correct?

    Because your adversary keeps saying mere knowledge of the gun's being used is not enough.

    Mr. John F. Bash 
    --I think it's more qualitative than that and the question suggests it's purely quantitative. 
    It's qualitative in the sense that the facilitation can relate to either element. 
    So it can relate to the gun in particular or -- and this could be the guy that set up the drug deal knowing that a gun would be involved, or set up the robbery knowing that a gun would be involved. 
    I think you see in the courts of appeals cases here the practical difficulties that come in because, although most court of appeals, I think eight, have technically adopted the position that you have to facilitate the gun in a direct way, if you look a the actual holdings of the cases it doesn't differ in practical application from our approach. 
    It's -- there is one case, I think it's Price out of the Third Circuit, where the guy may have learned of the gun -- I may have the case name wrong, but the guy learned of the gun only as the robbery was -- was taking place, but he continued to participate in the robbery while his confederate brandished the gun, he collected the money and so forth. 
    And as far as your question about the practical problems, I think explaining to a jury what does it mean to facilitate the gun in a specific way during a crime like that is incredibly difficult. 
    I mean, we say in the brief: What if you are exchanging the money while the other person is brandishing the firearm? 
    Maybe that person--

    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Well, Mr. Bash, what about this case? 
    Suppose that there are two guys and they are talking about committing a crime, and they have the same kind of conversation that Justice Alito was referencing, you know, one guy says I want to bring a gun, the other says, no, I think that's a really bad idea. 
    But this time, the guy says: Okay, you've convinced me, it's a bad idea to bring a gun, I won't bring a gun. 
    And so then they go out and they rob whatever they are robbing, and in the middle of it, you know -- or they do a drug transaction, and in the middle of that drug transaction the guy who said don't bring a gun looks over and he realizes that, notwithstanding the promise, his confederate did bring a gun. 
    But there they are, they are in the middle of their drug transaction. 
    So the guy, you know, they're right -- they are handing the money to each other and the guy keeps on doing it, all right? 
    Is -- is that enough, even though, you know, there's foreknowledge, there's acts after he -- he realizes that the guy has a gun? 
    Is that sufficient?
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="2206.174" stopTime="2211.745">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    If the gun is drawn and the person continues to facilitate the drug crime or the violent crime, that is enough.

    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Well, what exactly would you want him to do at that point to not be convicted of this, of this offense? 
    Would you want him to just say, you know, sort of like drop everything, I'm out of there? 
    Is that the idea?
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="2223.936" stopTime="2246.601">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    Yeah. 
    Take this case. 
    This is an $800 marijuana deal. 
    It's a small-scale drug deal that happens all the time without firearms. 
    As Mr. Elwood says, usually this kind of deal is not done with a firearm; only 5 percent of marijuana offenses have a firearm. 
    Yes, if you are on that kind of small-scale deal and all of a sudden it becomes an armed offense, you do have an obligation to withdraw. 
    Now, of course, I think you might have a duress defense if you felt like if I withdraw I'm going to get shot, or something like that.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="2246.601" stopTime="2263.946">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    Right. 
    I mean, I guess that's the question: Is there always a reasonable opportunity to withdraw after you see that there's a gun in the offense that you didn't expect to be there? 
    And do you think that there has to be a reasonable opportunity to withdraw, or would you say, no, everybody has a reasonable opportunity to withdraw all the time; you can just leave?
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="2263.946" stopTime="2334.657">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    Two points on that. 
    First, I think a lot of that would come in through the duress defense. 
    I mean, if you really feel like, oh, my God, this guy has a gun and he might shoot me if I withdraw, it can give a pretty solid duress defense. 
    The other point I would say which is maybe a little tangential to the hypothetical, is there's a traditional doctrine of aiding and abetting law. 
    This is at 2.06 of the Model Penal Code. 
    It's in the LaFave Treatise and the Wharton Treatise, that if you countermand your assistance after you have assisted but before the crime is accomplished or completed -- for example, if your assistance was only encouraging and you start discouraging, or if you take all actions possible to prevent the crime -- for example, you assisted, you have a change of heart, you call the police to prevent the crime, you are not liable for aiding and abetting. 
    And I think that reflects a broader point, which is that the traditional common law contours of aiding and abetting work pretty well with the contemporary purposes and problems that this statute was designed to solve. 
    I mean, this is a statute about the mix of guns and drugs or guns and violence. 
    And I don't see why Mr. Elwood contends that if you assist one side of that equation or the other it is a different result. 
    I think if you assist either side of that equation, knowing that the equation is going to happen, by the principle, that is aiding and abetting. 
    It's aiding and abetting under the historical test, I think it's aiding and abetting under this Court's cases, and I don't see why it would be a different result here.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2334.657" stopTime="2369.980">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Bash, would you explain why in this situation the guy abetted a drug deal when there was no drug deal? 
    It had been thwarted. 
    The drugs were stolen. 
    They were not engaged in any attempt to sell the drugs. 
    That was a failed attempt. 
    So how is this done, abetting a drug deal, when the deal failed?
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="2369.980" stopTime="2435.004">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    Well, of course, the prosecution's principal theory was that he was the gunman; he brought it along to facilitate his drug deal. 
    But assuming the theory of the facts that the gun was fired after Gonzales absconded with the drugs, I mean, I think one way to think about it is like this: Suppose that what had happened is that Gonzales had gotten ten paces, and Petitioner or Joseph had tackled him and immediately snatched the drugs back. 
    I don't think this Court or courts generally would expect the government to charge two counts of possession with intent to distribute for that brief period in which someone snatches possession away and you get it. 
    That wasn't certainly what the prosecutor thought here, and it's obviously not the issue in this case. 
    The only way that question comes into this case is that Mr. Elwood is trying to say that the prosecutor understood that -- that you didn't need foreknowledge of the gun. 
    And that's not what the prosecutor understood. 
    The prosecutor understood that this offense could continue for at least some period after in which the Confederates gave chase to -- to reclaim the drugs. 
    And that may have been a wrong theory, but no one below ever understood that you could be convicted if you didn't know of the gun until your participation ended. 
    That's why Petitioner never objected on that ground, and that's why, of course, we submit that it should be reviewed for plain error.

    Mr. John F. Bash 
    I don't think so, because the judge never instructed that if you aid and abet, that's is the equivalent of constructive possession of -- of the bullets. 
    And, in fact, I mean, what constructive possession means is that you have the ability to exercise control over this -- over the ammunition. 
    So it doesn't gel with his theory that, oh, I didn't know about the gun until after the shots were fired. 
    I mean, I don't think anyone thought that you could get a conviction because the shells were on the ground or something and you could pick them up after they were fired. 
    The obvious view was that he was -- the person who shot the gun -- and at minimum, I think those convictions, because there were no aiding and abetting instructions on them, show that he must have known about the gun ahead of time if he could exercise, at minimum, constructive possession over the ammunition fired from--

    Mr. Bash, you know, what sticks in my craw a little bit about your position is this: Usually, we want punishments to -- two people and they do very different things and they have very different intents, we want them actually to be punished differently. 
    And what you're suggesting is that there is -- let's say a crime, two people are involved in it. 
    One person does almost everything. 
    You know, he does 90 percent of the stuff. 
    And the other person does just a little thing, but something, you know, that goes to the offense that helps facilitate the offense. 
    But it's really pretty small compared to the overall crime. 
    And then in addition to that, that person does not have really full-fledged intent, just has a kind of knowledge that this other person with real purpose of intent is going to bring a gun. 
    So -- so, you have a lesser act and a lesser intent, and notwithstanding that, you're saying that the person ought to be punished in the exact same way as his confederate.

    Mr. John F. Bash 
    We are saying that. 
    I think that -- that -- that gels with the historic law of aiding and abetting, which, as Judge Friendly said in a case we cite in our brief, Garguilo, assistance of even slight moment counts. 
    And--
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="2617.872" stopTime="2642.253">
    Justice Elena Kagan 
    But I just add, what I would have thought was that the actus reus can be very small, but almost to compensate for that, you have to have full-fledged intent. 
    You have to have a really kind of purpose of -- a -- a purpose that the crime succeed as opposed to just knowledge of -- of what will happen.

    Mr. John F. Bash 
    --Justice Kagan, I don't think that can be right for the examples I gave, paid accomplices that don't have a stake or the person who lends the gun to be a good guy. 
    And let me contrast that -- I never got to this example -- with what a pure knowledge standard would look like. 
    Suppose there was looting, and the defendant breaks into the -- a store to facilitate his own entry in the store to steal goods. 
    But he knows there's 20 people coming behind him, and he has now facilitated their entry into the store, too. 
    That is not aiding and abetting under our theory because he did not even bear the intent to facilitate, by which we mean the intent to make some step in another person's crime easier. 
    He knew it would do that, but that was incidental to an intent to facilitate his own crime. 
    So I do think the mens rea is significantly ratcheted up from what a pure knowledge standard would look like.

    Yes. 
    I think what that formulation masks is exactly what intent to facilitate means, and I think that might be part of the disagreement among the parties.

    That's also the formulation in the historical sources we cite at page 47 at Footnote 10 of our brief.

    And that -- part of the context, as this Court has said, is also just--

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Knowing that a gun would be used. 
    You had to intentionally participate knowing that a gun would be used.

    Mr. John F. Bash 
    --Basically a slight tweak, which is knowing that the principal bore the intent to use a gun. 
    Obviously, you can't know the future. 
    It's that you know that the principal bore that intent, which is a little bit different, but I think we're saying the same thing.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2898.336" stopTime="2910.743">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I -- I don't see how “ make the crime succeed ” helps you because you would say the crime that he has to help make succeed is the underlying drug offense, not the use of the firearm.
speaker="john_f_bash" startTime="2910.743" stopTime="2975.519">
    Mr. John F. Bash 
    No, Mr. Chief Justice, we wouldn't say that. 
    This umbrella instruction applied to Count 1 and 2. 
    The crime you're help making succeed is 924(c). 
    What I was saying earlier was that, what does it mean to help make a crime succeed? 
    It makes -- it means intent to make one -- at least one step in that crime easier, knowing the other person bore the intent to do the crime. 
    And I think that's how we normally think about it. 
    If there's an armed robbery, and you say, well, I'll drive the getaway car, I think you would naturally say in ordinary English you intended to help make that crime succeed even if you didn't bear a specific intent with respect to the gun. 
    I certainly think on -- you know, if this had been objected to below, it might be a different matter with Mr. Elwood, but he did not object to this below. 
    He didn't -- he didn't raise this -- this wording issue even in the court of appeals. 
    He raised a sufficiency challenge with respect to foreknowledge. 
    But he -- even in his court of appeals brief, he didn't say that the instructions in this case were wrong because it said “ used ” versus “ would use ”. 
    So I don't think the issue is properly here, but I think it would be a sensible resolution if the Court were to remand these case-specific issues after clarifying the basic standard of aiding and abetting to the court of appeals to work through the forfeiture and waiver of harmless error and so forth. 
    If there are no further questions.

   Rebuttal of John P. Elwood
speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="2979.971" stopTime="3024.431">
    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    One point that I want to emphasize is a point made by Justice Kagan, which is that traditionally because the actus reus is relatively small for aiding and abetting cases, that is exactly why courts have adopted a standard of purposeful intent. 
    And they have said that because the act of an accomplice tends to be less harmful and tends to be more equivocal than that of the principal, that they ordinarily require purposeful intent. 
    And as Professor Wayne LaFave said, who obviously doesn't have a stake in the case: 
    "Liability has seldom been imposed on the basis of knowing assistance. " 
    "The background rule is that it has to be purposeful intent. "

    I think--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3027.416" stopTime="3045.361">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    That is to say, I thought generally in the criminal law a person who commits an illegal act is liable for the known consequences of that act. 
    That is the general rule. 
    I can't think -- I mean, people use all kinds of terminology, different kinds of terminology, but I thought that's the basic principle.

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    --I mean, Nye &amp; Nissen, the -- Nye &amp; Nissen, which is a case of this Court from 1949, where the Court adopted the standard from the Learned Hand Peoni, that adopted the purposeful intent standard. 
    And Peoni is obviously a very important case as well. 
    But Hicks. 
    In Hicks, in 1893 this Court reversed a conviction because the jury instruction did not require proof of intent to encourage the crime.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    You use the word “ intent ”.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It's language. 
    I am sure you will find language.

    Mr. John P. Elwood 
    You know, on Rule 30, I won't pretend that it was a model of clarity in preserving the error about after-arising intent. 
    But I will say that there is no contrast. 
    I mean, that is to us just a sign of how messed up the jury instructions are. 
    But we did preserve, we say, our objection both with respect to the absence of facilitating the right offense, and the intent to commit the crime as opposed to knowledge that the gun would be used. 
    And so--
