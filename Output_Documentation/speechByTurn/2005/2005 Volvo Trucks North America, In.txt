    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    This case, calling for interpretation of a federal law, the Robinson-Patman Price Discrimination Act, involves specially ordered products, heavy-duty Volvo trucks, sold by franchised dealers through a competitive bidding process. 
    In this process, the retail customer states its specifications and invites bids, generally from dealers franchised by different manufacturers. 
    Only when a Volvo dealer’s bid proves successful does the dealer arrange to purchase the trucks, which Volvo then builds to meet the customers’ specifications. 
    Reeder-Simco, an Arkansas Volvo dealer, sued Volvo, alleging that Reeder’s sales and profits declined, because Volvo offered other dealers price concessions more favorable than the discounts Volvo offered to Reeder. 
    Seeking travel damages under the Robinson-Patman Act and compensatory damages under the Arkansas Franchise Practices Act, Reeder prevailed on both federal and state claims at trial and on appeal to the 8th Circuit. 
    We granted review on the federal claim to resolve this question: may a manufacturer offering different wholesale prices to different dealers be held liable under the Robinson-Patman Act absent the showing that the manufacturer discriminated between dealers contemporaneously competing to resell to the same retail customer? 
    State law protecting franchisees may provide, and in this case has provided, a remedy for the dealer exposed to conduct of the kind Reeder alleged; but the federal Robinson-Patman Act, we hold, does not cover Reeder’s complaint. 
    The Act centrally addresses price discrimination between purchases of products of light grade and quality who compete to resell those products. 
    Competition of that character ordinarily is not involved when a product subject to special order is sold to a customer-specific competitive bidding process. 
    Congress passed the Robinson-Patman Act in 1936 to combat perceived harm to competition occasioned by powerful buyers, rather than sellers; specifically, Congress responded to the advent of large chain stores, enterprises with the clout to obtain lower prices for goods than smaller buyers could demand. 
    Reeder presented three principle categories of proof at trial: first, Reeder compared concessions it received on four occasions when it bid successfully against non-Volvo dealers and thus purchased Volvo trucks with more favorable concessions other successful Volvo dealers received were bidding process in which Reeder did not participate; second, Reeder compared concessions Volvo offered on several occasions when Reeder bid unsuccessfully, again, against non-Volvo dealers with more favorable concessions received by other Volvo dealers who gained contracts, again, on which Reeder did not bid; finally, Reeder brought up two instances in which Reeder did bid against other Volvo dealers for a particular sale. 
    In one, Volvo initially offered Reeder and the other dealer the same concession; Volvo ultimately granted a larger concession to the other dealer, but only after that dealer had won the bid. 
    In the second instance of head-to-head competition that Reeder identified, Volvo increased Reeder’s initial discount to match the discount offered to the other competing Volvo dealer; neither dealer won the bid. 
    Mixed and matched selective comparisons of the manipulable kind Reeder presented, we hold, do not show the injury to competition targeted by the Robinson-Patman Act. 
    Reeder did not establish that it was disfavored vis-à-vis the other Volvo dealers in the uncommon instances in which they competed for the same sale, let alone that the alleged discrimination was substantial. 
    For the reasons just sketched and more fully drawn out in the Court’s opinion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Thomas joins.
