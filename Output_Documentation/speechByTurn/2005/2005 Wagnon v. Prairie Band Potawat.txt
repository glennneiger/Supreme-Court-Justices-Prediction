    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. 
    Petitioner, the State of Kansas, imposes a tax on the receipt of motor fuel by distributors within its boundaries. 
    Kansas supplies that tax to motor fuel received by non-Indian fuel distributors, who subsequently deliver that fuel to a gas station owned by, and located on, the reservation of Petitioner, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation. 
    The Court of Appeals determined that this application of the Kansas motor-fuel tax was an impermissible affront to petitionerâ€™s sovereignty and held that the tax was invalid under the interest-balancing tests that we set forth in White Mountain Apache Tribe versus Bracker. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Under our Indian tax-immunity cases, the who and the where of the challenged tax have significant consequences. 
    We have determined that the states are categorically banned, barred, from placing the legal incidence of an excise tax on a tribe or on the tribal members for sale made on reservation. 
    We have further determined that even when a state imposes the legal incidence of its tax on a non-Indian seller, the tax is subject to an interest-balancing test if the transaction giving rise to tax liability occurs on reservation. 
    But this case presents neither scenario. 
    Here, Kansas places a legal incidence of its motor-fuel tax on the distributor who first receives motor fuel. 
    As such, the tax is imposed on a non-Indian, and it arises as a result of an off-reservation transaction. 
    We have never suggested that such a tax is subject to interest balancing, and we decline to do so today. 
    Consistent with our cases holding that Indians venturing off the reservation are subject to nondiscriminatory state taxes, we hold that a state excise tax imposed on a non-Indian that arises as a result of an off-reservation transaction is not subject to interest balancing and that the Kansas motor-fuel tax is valid. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Kennedy joins.
