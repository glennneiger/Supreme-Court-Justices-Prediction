   Announcement of Justice Stevens

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    These cases are consolidated, and they come to us, respectively, from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    Employees at the food-processing plants involved in the cases are required to wear certain protective gear supplied by their employers while they are working on the assembly line. 
    The cases require us to decide whether the time spent walking to the assembly line from the place where they donned their protective gear and the time spent waiting to don that gear are part of the workday that is compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947. 
    For reasons stated in a remarkably interesting, 20-page opinion filed with the Clerk, we conclude that the post-donning walking time is compensable, but the pre-donning waiting time is not. 
    Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, and we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment at the Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit. 
    Our opinion is unanimous.
