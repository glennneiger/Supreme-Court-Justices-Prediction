    Justice Byron R. White 
    In this case which is No. 82-827 here from the Minnesota Supreme Court, the respondent Murphy made admissions to his probation officer that he had committed another crime prior to his most recent conviction. 
    These admissions were relayed to the authorities and Murphy wasn't indicted and convicted for the prior crime. 
    Over his objections, his admissions to his probation officer were used against him at his trial -- at his trial. 
    The Minnesota Supreme Court, however, on appeal held that the use of these statements against Murphy violated his rights not to be compelled to incriminate himself contrary to the guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. 
    We granted certiorari and for the reasons stated in the opinion we have filed, we reverse the judgment of the Minnesota court. 
    In our view, Murphy's rights were not violated by the use of those admissions. 
    Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens has joined and all that Part II-A which Justice Brennan has joined.
