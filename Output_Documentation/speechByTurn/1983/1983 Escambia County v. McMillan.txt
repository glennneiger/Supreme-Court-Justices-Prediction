    Mr. Charles S. Rhyne 
    Well, the order that you agreed to review was the merits of that at-large elections under the Florida Constitution and that is what I intend to present my argument and address to now. 
    Well, Mr. Justice --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="168.562" stopTime="174.974">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, I have to say it for myself. 
    It strikes me that the whole thing is moot or at least certainly premature.
speaker="charles_s_rhyne" startTime="174.974" stopTime="400.025">
    Mr. Charles S. Rhyne 
    Well, I would say that that order is illegal, null and void because the Court that issued it had no jurisdiction to issue it. 
    Now, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In this case, the appellee's claim is based upon a complaint that they have been denied access to the full and complete access to the at-large election system provided by the Florida Constitution and to the political process leading to the nominations and elections in the County Commission of Escambia County. 
    I should have said that Escambia County is adjacent to Pensacola. 
    It had 205,000 people in it in 1970, 233,000 in 1980, 19.7 of those are Black, in 1970, 16.20% of them were eligible voters, in 1980, 17.2 were eligible voters. 
    Of the eligible voters, 66.9 of the Blacks are registered, 69.7 of the Whites are registered. 
    So there's -- on registration and on really participation in the electoral process that way, they're pretty equal. 
    Now, first of all, in the second sentence of their brief, they say that they do not contend in this case that any statute or any part of the Constitution has been invalidated. 
    And so I address myself to jurisdiction. 
    We are concerned here with the State Constitution of Florida over which Escambia has no control whatever. 
    The State Constitution requires at-large elections in non-charter counties of which there are 62 and of which Escambia is one. 
    In connection with that constitutional provision, they have also adopted an election system which is (Inaudible) to carry out these elections. 
    And so, the requirement of at-large elections and the requirements for carrying it out are entirely state action. 
    And so we raise the question as to whether or not the requirements of Article III clause 2 or Section 2 Clause 1 of the Constitution has been met because the real controversy here is not between Escambia and these people who claim they have been harmed by the at-large elections which are and put in, maintained, operated entirely by the State of Florida.

    Are all those of the State of Florida? 
    And under the decisions of this Court, you have got to prove that the injury that you claim can fairly be traced to the challenged action of the defendant and not traced through independent action by some other party. 
    Now, you have independent action of some other party, the State of Florida here, that controls these elections, -- at-large elections internally. 
    The County has absolutely nothing to do with them. 
    The State prescribes them, the State carries them out.

    Mr. Charles S. Rhyne 
    Well, I -- I think also, Your Honor, this statement that no state statute or constitutional provision has been invalidated with the judgment below which is the second sentence in their brief is a statement that's very hard to defend. 
    The --

speaker="charles_s_rhyne" startTime="746.180" stopTime="816.569">
    Mr. Charles S. Rhyne 
    The Court of Appeals and about the third line of its decision says that the lower court declared this constitution and statute unconstitutional and then they affirmed it. 
    So that statement is wrong. 
    Now, the appellees throughout their brief have constantly claimed that it is Florida's Constitution, that's at-large constitution, that has caused some damage and statement after statement do they make in support of that claim. 
    For example, two years after this case was filed in their pretrial statement, they say that they're going to prove their case. 
    Plaintiffs contend the evidence will show intentional, invidious racial discrimination by the State of Florida, not by Escambia.

    -- this argument, as I understood the response, goes only to whether this is a proper appeal or whether instead it's a certiorari. 
    Again, it -- it doesn't touch the merits of the case. 
    I think all of us hope you will get to the merits pretty soon.
speaker="charles_s_rhyne" startTime="837.407" stopTime="1346.519">
    Mr. Charles S. Rhyne 
    All right, I will -- merely in my statement here about the constitutionality question and -- and go to the merits. 
    The aforesaid at-large election system carry forward and perpetuate the effects of past intentual devices employed by the State to discriminate against Blacks. 
    And so we say under those circumstances, under those conditions, this is Florida's Constitution, this is Florida's statutes and not Escambia's constitution, not Escambia's statutes. 
    And then under Article III, Section 2, Clause 1, the federal courts have no jurisdiction. 
    With respect to the merits, I would first of all address myself to something that they make a lot of in connection with the so-called referendum. 
    I assume that Mr. Justice Brennan because that's what you have in mind. 
    Now, the referendums were not suggested by the Blacks or because it was in discrimination against them. 
    They had had a referendum on whether or not to consolidate Pensacola and Escambia. 
    That had been voted down. 
    And so the Commissioners of the City of Escambia sought ways and means of -- of reforming and bringing up to date this whole area. 
    They're simply bursting at the seams. 
    You have an enormous port there, the largest naval-air station in the world, and they needed to reform their -- their government. 
    So, they appointed a charter study committee of five, one of whom was a Black to draw up a new charter for the County of Escambia as they have a right to do. 
    And this charter committee worked for two years. 
    And on the 20th of January 1977, they reported that they were divided three to two. 
    They reported the majority a plan of five commissioners being elected within districts into at-large and particular all the powers that all of these various local officers have to -- have to have. 
    I have written a lot of these charters myself, you have seen a lot of them. 
    Now, this charter by the majority was rejected by the minority on two major grounds. 
    Number one, they said “We do not need to charter. 
    It's too costly and too complex." 
    "We don't need seven commissioners. 
    Five is enough. 
    They ought to be non-partners and elected within the districts." 
    And so the Commissioners then appointed another study committee of five. 
    And that committee tried to put together the ideas of the two -- of the two defenders, and the three who were for this charter. 
    And so they worked for three or four months and came up with a new charter. 
    And they recommended five elected within districts. 
    They put in there the main thing. 
    They put in there that this could never be used to consolidate Pensacola and Escambia. 
    That seemed to be the major thing that bothered the people there then. 
    And they also revised throughout the charter. 
    And when they finished that revision, they called in their staff and had them go over it and finally by August, they were ready to go public, so to speak, with the results of the work on the charter. 
    And so, they announced that they were going to release a draft of this charter and publish it. 
    They published it in the newspaper. 
    It gave out 15,000 copies to various clubs, study clubs and things like that. 
    And they would then have eight public hearings. 
    Now, let me stop here to say the big difference between this charter study committee and a chartered commission under Florida law is, a charter commission, you're required to have 11 to 15 members. 
    They're supposed to work for 18 months and produce a charter unless the time is extended. 
    And then when -- they hold three public hearings and they turn the charter in, the Commissioners can't do anything about it. 
    They can't change it at all. 
    The Commissioners here made tremendous changes in this charter and one of them was to keep the five elected at-large. 
    Now, the other side pretends this was the-- the big thing that was before the people in connection with the referendum which I announced would take place on November 8. 
    They held these eight hearings. 
    They were shocked at the fact that only 15 or 20 people came out to the various hearings. 
    In one of these hearings, three Blacks did appear and say they wanted single-member districts, that Blacks could get a fair deal if they had single-member districts than if they had elections at-large. 
    And so, after discussion in advertising and this -- all that kind of thing and they finally adopted on the 14th of September, a final draft which was published in the newspapers and was given to anybody who wanted to study it. 
    And that draft was voted on, then in November and defeated. 
    And so then, we were into 1978 and we come to the pretrial statement of the appellees here. 
    And again, as in the complaint, a referendum wasn't mentioned in -- in the complaint or the possibility of having itIt wasn't mentioned in their pretrial statement. 
    The pretrial statement was just the one that I just read you. 
    It was all aimed at the State of Florida. 
    And so at the hearing before Judge Arnow, they asked each one of the commissioners that each testified as to why they favored at-large rather than single-member districts. 
    And the general purport of it was the problems are at-large and so therefore, the cure must be at-large. 
    And they --

speaker="charles_s_rhyne" startTime="1438.442" stopTime="1600.958">
    Mr. Charles S. Rhyne 
    That's an erroneous statement by the District Court. 
    So, then we go to the thing -- he held that on the consideration of the charter that the Commissioners had all testified that they kept five for good government reasons and he also pointed out that they filed a post-trial memorandum. 
    And once they said that they wanted to keep the five to protect incumbency. 
    The Court of Appeals, when they got that, they said they had read the entire testimony. 
    They found no evidence whatever of racial motivation on the part of the Commissioners and that protecting one's incumbency didn't mean Blacks require Blacks, and so therefore, reversed. 
    They did grant a rehearing. 
    They did grant comments only on the Rogers versus Lodge and not a -- not a rehearing at all. 
    And in -- in doing so, they decided that the Rogers versus Lodge was different from White verus Regester and Whitcomb versus Chavis and the other cases like Mobile versus Bolden and therefore, had given them a -- a broader way to uphold, give greater deference to the finding of district courts. 
    And they said, we're not taking back our statement about the incumbency and they didn't take back their statement about having read all the evidence and found no racial motivation. 
    They said they consider the broader range evidence. 
    The broader range of evidence was all of this discriminatory action by the State over the past 100 years. 
    Their brief, over and over again, talks about the discrimination, the Black Crow laws, the poll tax laws, the White Supremacy, primaries and all those things, Justice Marshall. 
    For the past 100 years, the discrimination against Blacks throughout Florida and they didn't tie that in to Escambia at all.

    Mr. Larry T. Menefee 
    Mr. Chief justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I would like to discuss the merits of the case. 
    There are two substantive issues one involving decision on liability and the second is involving the decision on the remedy. 
    First, concerning the decision on liability, we contend that the judgment should be affirmed under the doctrine of (Inaudible) and Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
    The District Court made an intentionally local appraisal was -- and the district judge lived in the community. 
    And on the basis of that concluded that the at-large election system had both the purpose and effect of deluding Black voting strength and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    The District Court had before it substantial evidence which in summary showed the following. 
    First, historically, the election structure had been manipulated at every opportunity to minimize Black participation. 
    Second, the two charter study committees in 1975 and 1977, which has been referred to in Mr. Rhyne's statement, had both made recommendations for single-member districts and the rejection of those recommendations was taken for the purpose of continuing the delusion of Black voting strength.

    Mr. Larry T. Menefee 
    That's right, sir. 
    Continuing with the list of the evidentiary factors that are in this record, there's a massive record of racially polarized voting. 
    It is my best judgment that over 200,000 groups of data were entered into the computer for the 168 regression analysis. 
    No Black has ever won election to the Escambia County until the elections this past fall under the single-member district plan. 
    There is substantial evidence of socioeconomic disparity between Black and White citizens. 
    There are evidence of significant barriers to Black candidate recruitment, Black voter turnout, and Black political participation. 
    Also the system features numbered place and majority vote requirements which have no rational basis other than to protect the entrenched majority briefly address the --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2734.921" stopTime="2756.639">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    When you say protect the entrenched majority, I think the Court of Appeals spent some time in this that several of the Commissioners voted against the new plan because of their desire to preserve their incumbency. 
    I -- I didn't see that that was necessarily a racial factor at all. 
    I mean they might well have wanted to preserve their incumbency against Blacks or Whites.
speaker="larry_t_menefee" startTime="2756.639" stopTime="2799.690">
    Mr. Larry T. Menefee 
    I don't think that factor standing is that -- I agree with you in the -- to that extent, Justice Rehnquist. 
    That statement of I want to protect my incumbency, I can't say that that is racially motivated. 
    I think the problem the District Court found is that the statements were inconsistent. 
    They did not stand four-square with the operation of the County. 
    It wasn't a very credible performance. 
    So that was their proffered reasons were disbelieved. 
    The District Court had not only the testimony of those four commissioners. 
    Members of those charter government study committees testified. 
    The transcripts of public hearings were before the district judge and the final reports of those study committees were there.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2799.690" stopTime="2820.980">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But I thought either the District Court or the Court of Appeals and I can't remember which, puts some weight in putting together the discriminatory calculus on the fact that they thought the -- the Commissioners were against the plan for single-member districts because the Commissioners wanted to hang on to their jobs.
speaker="larry_t_menefee" startTime="2820.980" stopTime="2897.503">
    Mr. Larry T. Menefee 
    Well, that factor is discussed I believe in both opinions, prominently also in the District Court opinion, but I know -- I don't believe -- I -- I do not -- I don't think any -- either of the courts equated the desire to maintain incumbency with a -- with that direct ratio. 
    It's not a straight linear -- linear equation, if you will, with racial analysis. 
    It is a contextual thing of the incredible testimony or lack of credible testimony that the Commissioners gave their testimony from the other witnesses that took the stand that were served on this committee, of written reports, the public transcripts, the actions taking place in the city and the school board near the same time, a long historical evidence and then the whole line of indicia that the Court considered in Rogers v. Lodge. 
    The -- the line of indicia that's come down from -- from White, White we registered through Rogers v. Lodge, the polarized voting, Black to Black candidates, socioeconomic disparity and -- and that sort of thing. 
    And all of that's in this record, plus this historical, both, if you will, ancient historical and contemporary evidence of intent.

speaker="larry_t_menefee" startTime="2926.186" stopTime="2958.735">
    Mr. Larry T. Menefee 
    I -- not in the record. 
    The -- the only explanation I've ever heard is -- has -- has been referred to an opinion so everybody can live in the same block, but that's the very inconsistency that the district judge focused on when he heard these Commissioners talk about how they'd go back into their district and they called it their district and see about their neighbors' road and repair this bridge or what have you. 
    And then run at-large and take an oath under the Florida Constitution to represent the entire county.

    When the -- during the period that the White primary was enforced, primary with voting was -- was that by district or at-large?
speaker="larry_t_menefee" startTime="2967.550" stopTime="3237.627">
    Mr. Larry T. Menefee 
    That on -- as the District Court called it anomalous situation from approximately the turn of the century, after all the -- most of the disenfranchising devices had taken effect. 
    Blacks were removed from the electorate. 
    Then they went to the situation where the all-White democratic primary was conducted from single-member districts. 
    But the general election which, in my part of the country didn't mean a whole heck of a lot back then, was conducted at-large. 
    They'd let Black folks vote in the general election, but not in the single-member district democratic primary which it was the effective, the election that really counted. 
    There are three principal historical era -- eras, if you will. 
    From the Civil War to the turn of the century, Blacks were allowed to vote. 
    They were registered and in some North Florida counties, constituted a majority of the voters. 
    The fear of perhaps Black getting elected and holding a county commissioner or school board office, they didn't even hold elections then. 
    They had them by gubernatorial appointment because the State of Florida was majority White. 
    Then once Blacks were disenfranchised, at the turn of the century, they went to this anomalous system of single-member district primary elections and at-large general elections. 
    Then World War II, veterans returned, Black veterans returned and want to participate in government, Smith, the all rights strikes down, the all--White democratic primary and the rules of the game are changed again. 
    This time they abolished the single-member district democratic primaries and go to the at-large democratic primaries. 
    So that -- those three major historical shifts, put in the context with the manipulation, if you will, of these charter government study committee reports, the very specific contemporary evidence of a similar change in the City of Pensacola Government in 1959 and the School Board of Escambia County in 1976, that's the contextual arena that the district judge had to -- made this finding (Inaudible) and that doesn't even touch the polarized voting and lack of Black candidates, no Blacks having ever been elected, the other factors that this Court has referred to in other opinions. 
    The -- I would note some of the other evidence in the record. 
    I've mentioned the substantial record on polarized voting approximately 168 regression analysis, not only did that measure a polarized voting and produced scattered diagrams for all of those elections, we also ran a test to measure voter turnout. 
    This was confirmed by other studies and it showed that Blacks turn out at a rate of approximately half that of White voters and this we think is a significant measure of Black political participation. 
    It's one thing to have a voter registration drive to urge people to go down and get their names into polls, but the degree that people are hooked into the political system, the degree that they vote and participate -- political scientists call it political socialization. 
    I grew up in a house where my parents sat around the table and we'd talk politics and you had a duty to go vote. 
    That's essentially the kind of institution that has not been present, as present in the Black community and it hasn't been present because Blacks haven't been seeking office or candidates who addressed the interest of Black citizens haven't been seeking office. 
    And we did run tests on some White candidates who had -- generally they were presidential candidates or outside of Escambia County jurisdiction. 
    The same phenomena occurs. 
    In many cases, Black voters will go to the poll and if there's a candidate that has addressed their interests, they will vote in that race. 
    But contrary to the behavior of most White voters, they would not pull the lever on all those other races that are on the ballot. 
    And that's what these social scientists or whatever talking about in terms of political socialization. 
    How involved are you in the system and you had the opportunity to work on a campaign or get involved with and see that your interests are at stake. 
    It's like, I believe, Justice Marshall referred to in Bolden v. City of Mobile casting meaningless ballots and I'm afraid that that's the way most of the Black voters in Escambia County, Florida view their situation under the at-large situation.

    Mr. Larry T. Menefee 
    Well, I think there are a number of problems. 
    With the disclaimer, that's not part of our case, but -- but proceeding beyond that to address it, yes, sir. 
    Certainly, Mexican-American citizens, like all citizens, can assert a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    In formulating a remedy, I think this Court has wisely adopted the policy of favoring single-member districts. 
    It's a -- it's a simple straightforward method. 
    If there are residential concentrations, if it has been shown that Mexican-Americans have been excluded from the political process over a period of time, substantial period of time, we're not talking about an episodic event that occurs once. 
    I'm not talking about (Inaudible), then yes, if it -- if the -- and if they'd state a claim, I mean if they'd come forward and -- and joined in the litigation, I'm not sure of the full range of your hypothetical, Justice Powell.

speaker="larry_t_menefee" startTime="3382.890" stopTime="3387.749">

speaker="larry_t_menefee" startTime="3389.147" stopTime="3517.145">
    Mr. Larry T. Menefee 
    Today, thank goodness. 
    Section 2 does have either standard purpose or effect. 
    So you -- you can prevail under either standard under Section -- under the amended Section 2. 
    But I think the fundamental question is found, effective representation. 
    And as this Court has had to deal with since Baker versus Carr, and Reynolds versus Sims, stay on effect of representation is, in those cases focused on numerical figure of maximum deviation from an ideal district. 
    Now, every citizen has a right to that and it is just as possible to gerrymander districts by having one giant district, having five smaller districts or even as one plan that was submitted and I think later withdrawn early in this litigation by the county. 
    We call it the ban to (Inaudible) plan, proposed having one district in the middle of the county that would be Black and the other four commissioners would be elected at-large from the rest of the county. 
    That plan was withdrawn perhaps after we named it the (Inaudible) in playing up to the South African homelands. 
    But these systems can all be manipulated. 
    It is as much a political decision to have an at-large system as it is, to have district system and as much a political decision is to how the district lines should be drawn. 
    So we have had -- this Court has developed a long line of cases from the one person, one vote concept and has had a rather easily manageable -- rather easily manageable standard judicially manageable standard of numerical equality. 
    But Black citizens have a strong claim to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and what this case shows is that at-large election systems can have and has had in this case for many, many, many years, far more than a decennial census, the opportunity to dilute the vote of the minority to deny the equal protection under the law. 
    If you have no further questions, Thank you.

    Mr. Thomas R. Santurri

    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, may it please the Court. 
    Florida law is clear that a county has no voice, can take no act except as directed by the Board of County Commissioners. 
    In this particular instance, an election was held. 
    The composition of the Board of the County Commissioners has changed what had previously been in the unanimous decision to carry forward the appeal on this matter has now changed and majority of the Board of the County Commissioners voted in a legal meeting to dismiss this appeal. 
    And --

    Mr. Thomas R. Santurri 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is a yes, but it's a qualified yes. 
    The former members, that is, all five members of the Board of County Commissioners and we have a five-member system in -- in Escambia County. 
    They were only in office but for the fact that the elections had been staged. 
    Those elections probably would have been heard or would have been had well before 1983 but for the order.

    On at-large basis, yes, and -- and I might point this out to the Court that the -- all the incumbents ran on a platform that was constituted of or consisted of saying that they intended to maintain this lawsuit and all except for one was defeated. 
    The three of the -- of the majority members, they made a very strong point that they had had enough of this lawsuit and they thought Escambia County had and they wanted to withdraw it. 
    Now, I did mention the majority of the Board of County Commissioners voted. 
    Florida does not recognize majority-minority positions on its Board of the County Commissioners. 
    There is one position of the Board of County Commissioners and --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well -- well what -- what you say will -- would make a great deal more sense to me if you're talking about an orthodox appeal where the county, say, had a money judgment against them or do we appeal from the District Court of the Eleventh Circuit? 
    Do we appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida? 
    And then a new group of commissioners is, like they say, this lawsuit just isn't worth what it's cost us. 
    Let's give up the appeal. 
    Surely, the -- the county ought to have the final say in that. 
    But here, in effect, if the principle you're contending for is correct, the District Court could impose a perfectly outrageous redistricting plan on Escambia County, put it into effect, the new commissioners all come into office by virtue of that plan. 
    When they get in, they vote to abandon the appeal. 
    So that in effect, the District Court's judgment is never reviewable.
