    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 40, William Joe Johnson versus Areas Avery, Commissioner of Corrections. 
    Mr. Warden.
speaker="karl_p_warden" startTime="24.494" stopTime="321.071">
    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I'm counsel for William Joe Johnson who is a prisoner in the Tennessee State Penitentiary in Nashville, Tennessee. 
    As of the time of this argument today, William Joe Johnson has served approximately three years in solitary confinement or in maximum security or in a segregated environment within the penitentiary. 
    This confinement is over and above that confinement called for by his sentence, which is a life sentence for the crime of rape. 
    The reason for this extraordinary confinement is because he has violated one rule of the Tennessee State prison system is that rule is here being challenged today, and that rule is that no inmate will advice, assist, or otherwise contract to aid another either with or without a fee to prepare writs or other legal matters. 
    The United States District Court that first heard this case determined that his confinement was arbitrary and capricious and that it was in violation of Title 28 United States Code Annotated Section 2242 and it was in violation of the United States Constitution. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court. 
    Our argument here today seeks to have the United States Court of Appeals reversed to have further enforcement of this prison rule ended and to have William Joe Johnson return to the general prison population and these lib -- these unnecessary restraints on his liberties ended. 
    Now, the basis for our argument is five-fold. 
    The two major points that we wish to make are that, first off, the State of Tennessee, by enforcing this prison rule and by providing no alternative assistance, has effectively blocked access to the Courts by those prisoners who are indigent and inarticulate or illiterate, and that to so prevent these people from being heard as a violation of due process, a violation of equal protection, and a violation of the First Amendment Freedoms of Speech and right to protect, right to petition for redress of grievances. 
    And, our second principle point is that this prison regulation is not a proper exercise of the state's limited power to regulate the practice of law for two reasons. 
    One, this is not the practice of law and, two, that even if it should be considered the practice of law, it's beyond the power of the strait -- of the state to restrict this particular kind of practice. 
    Our further points are that Title 28 Section 2242 of the United States Code, annotated, reflects the ancient common law right of one layman to prepare, sign, and verify petitions of habeas corpus for those who cannot help themselves. 
    And, the final two points, are that the petitioner does have standing to raise these issues and that was the holding of both the District and the Court of Appeals and, finally, that this is a proper case and circumstance for Federal Courts to intervene with state prison management. 
    And, apparently, this has been agreed to by the State of Tennessee in its supplemental brief provided that the Court finds that these regulations are in violation of federal right. 
    Now, as to our first point, it's clear that a prisoner who can employ an attorney will be fully and well-heard by whatever Court he wishes to petition, but it's equally clear that if this prisoner is indigent, that he only has then four alternatives. 
    One of these is to be able to talk some lawyer into representing him for free. 
    The second is to proceed pro se, the third is to get help from someone untrained in law, and the fourth is just to forget about it all together and let his claim go by the Boards. 
    Now, as to the first of these alternatives, if he can talk a lawyer into taking a case, all of us who practice law know what happens to the attorney who agrees to help one indigent prisoner, he's immediately inundated with letters from not only that prison, but from every prison in the country requesting similar aid.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, aren't there some states which provide legal services for prisoners?

speaker="karl_p_warden" startTime="333.678" stopTime="341.830">
    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    California has an amicus brief here, Your Honor. 
    I do not believe that California provides counsel for indigent prisoners.

    But some assistance?

    They provide the assistance of prison guards and chaplains, apparently, Your Honor.

    And the clerical stuff, do they -- don't they?
speaker="karl_p_warden" startTime="351.547" stopTime="355.373">
    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    They apparently, yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="355.373" stopTime="361.884">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And, apparently, the Courts have cooperated by setting up these forms to be with check lists.

    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    Yes, Your Honor, although --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="362.373" stopTime="362.655">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="karl_p_warden" startTime="362.655" stopTime="373.017">
    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    Although, I expect to argue a bit today that these forms are in fact not much better than the no assistance at all that the State of Tennessee provides.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="373.017" stopTime="378.392">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Who would might be?
speaker="karl_p_warden" startTime="378.392" stopTime="507.756">
    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    Your Honor, in the event that this attorney does receive these letters, what happens ultimately is that the claims -- the just claims and the unjust claims are like all going away splash kit. 
    Now, while we ought to applaud an attorney who is willing to help an occasional indigent prisoner. 
    We still cannot rely on causal or whimsical charity to preserve the constitutional guarantees of persons and fritz in the United States and it's not a sufficient answer here to say that prison authorities will help these people. 
    First off, there's no showing that these prison authorities, the guards, chaplains, clerical help, or any more competent to provide assistance that is a fellow inmate. 
    And, secondly, it's clear that the prisoner knows full well that the interest of his keeper and his own interests are not absolutely identical. 
    There is and there always will be a real credibility gap between the inmate and his keeper, and the prisoner is going to want someone he can turn to, someone he can talk to, someone he can trust, if not his lawyer, then his friend. 
    And, his friend is much more likely to be a fellow inmate than it is to be his keeper. 
    And, I think that millions and millions of dollars that the legal profession and the government has spent in the past few years trying to bridge the communication gap between the poor and the Courts, the legal profession, by moving law offices out in the neighborhoods and by allowing forms of lay intermediary assistance all show that this credibility gap here is a very real thing and ought to be recognized. 
    And, finally, on that point as on the side, if it is the practice of law for an inmate to help write petitions, why is it not the practice of law when it's done by a prison guard or a chaplain, as apparently is done in California? 
    The activities of --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="507.756" stopTime="536.840">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The difference, I suppose it's -- it doesn't go to your question, your rhetorical question, but the practice is, is it not, that people who indulge in the activities, in which your client was to indulge, actually charge their fellow inmates everything that's traffic or bare and, presumably, prison employees do not.
speaker="karl_p_warden" startTime="536.840" stopTime="602.104">
    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    Your Honor, there is not one shred of evidence in this case that my petitioner has charged anyone for his services. 
    I don't deny that prisoners could charge. 
    I would deny that it would be a proper thing to do, of course. 
    The activities of the petitioner here are attacked as being the practice of law and it's said that the state has the right to regulate the practice of law and that, since petitioner was practicing law, he can be properly stopped by the state prison authorities. 
    Well, we claim first that this is not the practice of law, that there was no claim here whatsoever to represent these prisoners in Court that there was no pursuit of these cases beyond the minimal help of helping them articulate what their claim was, that he did not stand and verify these petitions for the inmates, that he returned these petitions to the inmates and they signed them and verified them themselves even if they had to sign it with an “X” as happened in some instances.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="602.104" stopTime="613.473">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose he set up an office in Nashville and held himself out to do precisely this. 
    Don't you think, by association, it'd be a kind of concern by whether that was a practice of law?

    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    Yes, sir.

    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    Your Honor, I think that that's only one of the points before us today. 
    I think there's a very real question here of First Amendment guarantees and I think that goes beyond the question of -- raised directly by 2242. 
    I think that 22 --

    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    The District Court did that, yes, sir. 
    Your Honor, but they also found that this was an arbitrary and capricious act on the part of the federal prison authorities, which was a denial of -- as equal protection to those persons who could not articulate their own claim.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the next is we have to reach the constitutional claim?

    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    No, Your Honor, I don't think you would have to reach the constitutional claim. 
    But, of course, we had to raise the constitutional claim because that's one facet to our argument. 
    I don't' think you have to reach that in order to decide this case but, if I may say so, sir, I think you ought to.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="704.499" stopTime="709.324">

    I suppose so, Your Honor. 
    All William Joe Johnson has done in this case is to help these men articulate those things that they would have said for themselves if they had been able to say them for him -- themselves.

speaker="karl_p_warden" startTime="850.986" stopTime="955.522">
    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    This man comes closer, Your Honor, to being a modern day Don Quixote than anyone I ever heard of. 
    It seems to me that we have never doubted the common law right of one layman to petitioner or another layman when the one that's being held captive could not speak for himself and when the one who's doing the petitioning is not an officious intermeddler. 
    At most, William Joe Johnson here was a lay intermediary. 
    All he ever did was call the Court's attention to these men. 
    He did not solicit this. 
    He did not charge. 
    He did not benefit in any way, except the satisfaction that one human being gets from helping another. 
    But, even if this Court should find that his activity was the practice of law, and we vigorously maintain it was not, still the state's power to regulate stopped short of the power to restrict unsophisticated persons from seeking legal redress in the Courts with their claimed unlawful imprisonment. 
    Both Federal and State law provide a route by which an imprisoned person can petition for a release from imprisonment. 
    But, by effectively denying to an identifiable class of persons the right to use this law here by making the route impossible for the indigent, inarticulate, and illiterate, this post conviction remedy becomes illusory. 
    This is not just a deprivation of First Amendment rights, but it's also then a denial of equal protection of the laws.

    Well, sir, if I understand your question, then my answer is that they would have to have an absolute right to put him in solitary confinement for taking money. 
    There's no question in my mind about that. 
    But, I may as well add this to it too, that even if this Court should find that there is some right to counsel at this critical stage in the post conviction proceeding here, I think there might still be a constitutional question as to whether one prison inmate could turn to a fellow inmate and say you reckon ought to go to a lawyer.

    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    The state here has claimed a number of interests.One in prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law, one in keeping good order in the penitentiaries and I've spoken of that but I'd like to add this one thing. 
    There was no showing in this case, and there can't be any showing, that there -- that the fact that one prisoner helps another prisoner articulate his claim to a Court necessarily is going to create great disorder in a prison system. 
    In fact, I think it could be argued that these people who were in the penitentiary who are inarticulate, illiterate, indigent, who have no way to express these claims might very well be a greater source of disruption of the prison discipline than one that was allowed to go ahead and have his case heard by a Court.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you happen to know, sir, whether it's your regulation in Tennessee or typical rights?
speaker="karl_p_warden" startTime="1368.542" stopTime="1572.934">
    Mr. Karl P. Warden 
    Your Honor, I am of the opinion and impression, I should say, that it is a fairly common prison regulation. 
    I think California has it with the little variants of the form. 
    When I was in Utah recently, I saw something in paper out there that said they have it. 
    I think New York has it. 
    There are a number of jurisdictions that have it. 
    I can't tell you how many they are. 
    The state has also claimed an interest here which the prison authorities say fall on their side of the scale of balancing the interest and that is in keeping the Court dockets from being clogged. 
    What this rule prohibits was fine in equal impartiality, the legitimate claim, along with the illegitimate claim, and there certainly can't be any kind of a showing that a legitimate claim filed by an inmate who had inmate assistance clogs the Court any more than a legitimate claim filed by an inmate who has a lawyer to help him or by an inmate acting pro se. 
    And, this rule prohibits all of them, the legitimate claims and the illegitimate claims. 
    Under the very narrow view, I think narrow, of the State of Tennessee and the State of California, the presumed state interest here in prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law seems to be served in whole part by allowing people to appear either pro se or with attorneys, and this ignores completely the indigent and illiterate incompetent who can neither act effectively nor can they afford an attorney. 
    The statistics that are provided by the State of Tennessee show that 44% of the people in the Tennessee State Penitentiary are of below average intelligence and 22% of the people in the Tennessee State Penitentiary are of defected mentalities. 
    Now, these people might be able to scratch our something on a piece of paper, a lot of them can't even do that, but it just does not seem realistic to me to say that they can act effectively pro se, that they can call their claim to the attention of the Court or a lawyer in such a fashion that that claim would be understood. 
    And these people are the ones being discriminated against. 
    The State of Tennessee has provided no alternative means for these people. 
    The State of California has provided a series of forms that these people might use and fill out, but the central question on those forms that these people are to fill out for themselves is really the central question that must be answered in Tennessee, and that is that this inmate must be able to articulate why it was that he has been deprived of his constitutional right, just a simple statement of the deprivation of constitutional rights. 
    Well, I found it a bit difficult to pen a simple statement of a detriment of constitutional rights and I've had the benefit of a legal education, and these people matriculated in the streets and I don't believe it's taught there. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I have asked to preserve a few moments of my time.

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    On the question of federal statute, I have said in my supplemental brief that I really don't think that that's a serious question because, there, the statute says that application for writ of habeas corpus shall be in writing, signed and verified by the person for whose relief it is intended or for someone acting in his behalf. 
    I don't think that goes any further than the ministerial act of signing or verifying a petition to be filed. 
    I don't think that contemplated the preparation of petition. 
    So, I don't believe that that statute can be relied upon as was done by the trial judge, the district judge. 
    The Court of Appeals thought to the contrary and I think, certainly, that that's too broad an interpretation for that statute. 
    Now, on the question whether or not this is a practice of law, I don't think that answers the question because, certainly, the State of Tennessee can't regulate the practice of law in such a way as to deny prison inmates aaccess to the Court. 
    So, I think this is a different situation really from what it is on the outside. 
    I've tried to think, well, here are inarticulate people. 
    You have people who can't write their names. You have the same type of people on the outside. 
    So, why wouldn't the same rule apply? 
    Well, the only difference I could see, and I think this is favorable to the people inside the penitentiary. 
    They really have more calls, I think, the petition of course than the people do on the outside and I think that might -- that's justification for it. 
    So, I think, certainly, that any rule that the State of Tennessee has that would tend to deny these people access to the Court, we don't contest that. 
    We know that that would be in violation of a constitutional right.

    If the Court please, under the present procedure, since the adoption of our Post Conviction Procedure Act which was adopted after this case was started but before it was decided by the US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, we provide a form in the statute for the -- making a petition. 
    Then, in one of those sections, we provide that no petition will be dismissed until an op -- free opportunity has been given to freely amended with the assistance of counsel. 
    So, I say, that any man that can say my rights have been -- are being denied and signs his name to it and gets in Federal Court or in our State Courts is that broad. 
    Counsel will be appointed for him under the statute and that counsel will be given opportunity to amend it freely. 
    Then, if it can't be amended so as to make out justification or allege a cause of action, then it can be dismissed.

    I don't think that it should be given that broad interpretation or construction. 
    I agree that it's possible and I have learned that in a statute, in a regulation that I have ever experienced with, if the Court determined to give it a non-constitutional construction, it can be done. 
    I think that, I don't believe there's any question about that.

    Most laymen like the ability and it would be hardly necessary to include a special provision of law to authorize the employment of trained legal assistance in preparing papers. 
    If the Court please, that's not the -- it just says that it permits the more aggressive type to take advantage of the other prisoners who are not quite so aggressive.

    One, that's one reason. 
    The other is that all the prison officials, state and federal, that I've read about, and I think the cases that I've read are nearly enough to include all of them, they say it underlines prison discipline and morale that's impossible to repatriate or rehabilitate prisoners after they come on the influence of an -- of a writ writer who is unscrupulous, who is not deterred by the penalties of perjury, who uses the people for his own purposes rather than for the purposes that the penitentiary designed for, I take it, to reform people to themselves, and that rehabilitation is impossible once the writ writers get control of the members of the prison. 
    Here's what I look for them to go and this is what one of the Courts had to say about Hatfield versus Bailleaux. 
    Prison officials testified that if permitted to engage in such practices, aggressive inmates of superior intelligence exploit and dominate weaker prisoners of inferior intelligence.

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    No, sir.

    But if we -- but, this case seems to me, at least arguably, to be in a rather peculiar posture because I -- if we should vindicate the right of an inmate to consult with a fellow inmate for the first inmate's benefit, that's one thing but, here, what we're asked to do really, as I understand it, is to hold that an inmate has the right as a matter of regular practice, isn't that so, to help other inmates in preparing petitions for post conviction relief?

    It's a little puzzling as to whether it's a question of standing or something else, but I was just wondering whether that really is indifferent from the kind of case -- another case we have on petition for certiorari in this Court, I've forgotten the jurisdiction, in which an inmate himself applies for relief because prison authorities won't let him consult with other inmates and provides no alternative.

    Petitioner here is, if I correctly understand this, is asking us not only to release him from what, off-hand, seems to be a very onerous treatment by the Tennessee prison authorities, but he also asks us to establish his right to engage in the practice of furnishing this kind of advice and assistance to other inmates. 
    Do I correctly follow as this --

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes, sir. 
    It's insisted upon by opposing counsel that he has -- that the writ writer has that right because the inmate who has the cause has that right. 
    He cited authority for it. 
    I thought -- I didn't think that sounded too unreasonable, so I didn't question that. 
    It provided, it's found that it's necessary -- that this kind of help is necessary for prisoners.

    You didn't think that “what is too unreasonable”?
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="2536.632" stopTime="2596.477">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    For it to say that, that one per -- inmate had a right to assist another inmate who was absolutely without -- who was in need of his help beyond question, no question about his need, it'd be unreasonable to assume that or to find that the other -- the inmate who did know how to assert his right, that he could go to another person and have that person to assert it. 
    I think that, if I understand properly, they -- because of free speech they insist they have a right to be at the place together and use it and to disseminate it. 
    I hear that argument in -- about the right of the press in the Court to take pictures and things of that sort. 
    They say the public has the right to know and that because that we have a right to get that information and give it to the public. 
    I thought that was a similar sort of analogous thing and say the least of it, and I didn't contest it, maybe I should have.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2667.799" stopTime="2678.039">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But, part of the rationale of that case, as I understand, wasn't the great unlikelihood that their rights would ever be asserted otherwise.
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="2678.039" stopTime="2678.147">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2678.147" stopTime="2679.273">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Except through these --
speaker="thomas_e_fox" startTime="2679.273" stopTime="2792.210">
    Mr. Thomas E. Fox 
    That's right. 
    Well, we think now -- I noticed in stating the questions, I've stated a little bit differently from Mr. Fortas' question. 
    He says the right -- he's talking about the right of inmates to help others when there's no other aid available. 
    I just stated it broadly on the question of one inmate having a right to aid another. 
    If he insist now that it is not necessary and he doesn't have that right when there's other aid available, our position is that our post conviction statute now makes it awfully easy for any person to get into Court, either Federal or State Court, with his petition because he gets his petition up there and it's not to be dismissed until an opportunity is given to free the amended with the aid of counsel. 
    So then, he gets legal help. 
    One other question now about the type of punishment that was imposed upon the writ writer, I think that it seized to be punishment and it became a necessary measure for this -- for prison discipline or for the security of the prison. 
    This man said, and his counsel said it at the hearing in the Federal District Court, that he expected to continue to write writs without regard to what the regulations were or without regard to anything else, except when another means was provided. 
    So, in order to stop him not as a matter of punishment, he's got to be segregated or the prison officials have got to spend their time surveilling the other prisoners to see that they don't get his help. 
    So, it seems to me, like it's a lot easier and a lot more justifiable to put this man in prison and then spend the remainder of the ti -- or then you -- the officials have got more time to spend with the other prisoners, given them the help they need.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2792.210" stopTime="2794.577">

    I think that means solitary confinement, yes, sir.

    Mr. Thomas E. Fox

    If a lawyer has committed a felony and his in the penitentiary, he has proven he's untrustworthy, that he can't be depended upon, I don't -- and he's not a man of good character, so I don't -- that's one of the requirements for practicing law.

    I'm not really familiar with it, but I do know that, to be admitted, you have to show evidence of good character and, it seems to me, once you're put in the penitentiary you don't -- there's no longer -- the presumption has gone to say the least of it, that you -- not a man of good character.

    I understand that some of Mr. Warden's students, you can correct me on this, it was arranged for them to go in and hear the complaints and write the petitions for the people who were entitled to them, and they heard the complaints and they didn't come up with any petitions. 
    So, the next time they went out there, nobody came to see them. 
    They didn't have any qualms, and that's the sort of thing that we're trying to eliminate, are these petitions that one of the Courts, and I think it's in my brief, said that the petitions were stereotype. 
    I take it they meant that each petition had the same thing as all the others in it, and I -- it's evident that that's what happened. 
    These writ writers, everything that they know about the law they'd put it in the writ whether it's applicable to this particular inmate or to s -- or not.
