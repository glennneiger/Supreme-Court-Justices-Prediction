    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Mr. Justice -- Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    Yesterday afternoon, inquiry was made I believe by Justice White relative to the significance of some language in the trial court's order pertaining to the inability of the defendant or his counsel to prepare a transcript from memory. 
    The reason for this is the courts in Oklahoma have set this as one of the prerequisites for furnishing a free case-made and we think that it's significant for the reason that by implication it indicate that for this requirement to have any relevance, it must mean that if the defendant or his counsel could prepare a transcript that the court would consider it. 
    We'd like to further remind the Court that part of this record has already been transcribed. 
    That three of the witnesses that petitioner maintains or material had -- their testimony has already been prepared in narrative form, that the only testimony needed were the three witnesses that testified in behalf of the city and the defendant and we believe that this could be prepared in narrative form and we think that the courts, that the appellate court below would consider it in that fashion.

    Mr. Ratcliffe, as I read the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals, they didn't touch this at all.
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="90.984" stopTime="92.421">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    No sir, they did not.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="92.421" stopTime="94.497">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Was it argued to them?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="94.497" stopTime="101.207">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    I wasn't in that proceeding in that time and I don't know but it did not go to that.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="101.207" stopTime="108.024">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, don't you think if there was a procedure in the Court of Criminal Appeals, would you suggest that they would have mentioned in their opinion?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="108.024" stopTime="115.247">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Well, I'd like to think that they did. 
    They would have but if the question was not put to them I just don't know whether they would consider it or not.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="115.247" stopTime="121.071">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    They went on the merits and said that simply because this was an ordinance and not statute, you didn't get it, period.
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="121.071" stopTime="127.129">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Yes. 
    That in as much of this was a violation of municipal ordinance that there was no statutory authority for it --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="127.129" stopTime="134.744">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And if it had been the statute and the man had been given 90 days, there would have been?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="134.744" stopTime="142.856">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    The state law authorizes the furnishing of case-mades in those cases that are tried in the county and the District Courts.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="142.856" stopTime="145.267">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So that's the only point that they decided.
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="145.267" stopTime="146.368">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Yes. 
    However, we can --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="146.368" stopTime="148.093">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Do you support that?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="148.093" stopTime="148.722">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Sir?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="148.722" stopTime="150.506">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Do you support that?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="150.506" stopTime="151.438">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Yes.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="151.438" stopTime="152.404">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Why?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="152.404" stopTime="153.410">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Well, I believe that --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="153.410" stopTime="161.057">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What's the magic difference between the violation of an ordinance -- well let me first ask, does he go to the same jail?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="161.057" stopTime="161.813">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    No, sir.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="161.813" stopTime="162.808">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    He goes to a city jail?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="162.808" stopTime="163.927">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="163.927" stopTime="165.410">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But he has served 90 days?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="165.410" stopTime="166.654">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="166.654" stopTime="174.217">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And if he goes to the city jail and served 90 days and he's a pauper, no appeal?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="174.217" stopTime="174.303">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Well, --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="174.303" stopTime="182.978">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    If he's sentenced by a state statute, he goes to the state jail for 90 days, he gets a record?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="182.978" stopTime="184.062">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    That's correct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="184.062" stopTime="186.163">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And you said that's alright?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="186.163" stopTime="211.032">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Well, I say that in this particular case, that there's been no need or necessity shown that he have a reporter's stenographic copy of the record, that this was a case that was tried in less than a day, that it was not particularly complicated case, that there were just four witnesses, that this testimony could have been prepared in narrative form and submitted to the court.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="211.032" stopTime="221.670">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well would the -- would you have answered that in the brief if they have prepared a narrative out of their mind, would you have answered it?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="221.670" stopTime="224.885">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Well, I think we've been given opportunity to approve it.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="224.885" stopTime="233.247">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, I mean when the argument came up in the Court of Criminal Appeals, would you have had the transcript to work on?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="233.247" stopTime="235.812">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    If we have ordered one, yes.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="235.812" stopTime="239.258">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But the other side wouldn't?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="239.258" stopTime="241.784">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Well, no.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="241.784" stopTime="245.466">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And you don't see anything wrong with that?
speaker="giles_k_ratcliffe" startTime="245.466" stopTime="278.690">
    Mr. Giles K. Ratcliffe 
    Well, I don't know why there would be any necessity for us to have a transcript if we could stipulate and agree and approve on the narrative form statement of the issues. 
    And as I say, I can't cite you any cases where Oklahoma has held that they would consider it this way but by implication, I think that it's there, that it could be. 
    Thank you, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="278.690" stopTime="281.065">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
