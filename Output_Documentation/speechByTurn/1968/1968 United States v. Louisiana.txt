    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You may not be able to answer briefly because I notice according to the Government's brief there must be about 27 different issues here. 
    But I was wondering if you could tell us number one, in a very few brief word what your litigation is about?
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="52.655" stopTime="53.814">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And secondly, to what extent are you relying on my vain protest in the Circuit California case to sustain your case?
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="66.481" stopTime="168.801">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    I'll answer the first question Your Honor. 
    As you know this Court held in the first Louisiana case that Louisiana owned none of the marginal sea that our title stopped at the inland water -- at the inland waters that we own the inland waters under the doctrine of Pollard versus Hagan, and Pollard versus Hagan was in that case and in the California case limited to inland waters with the result we owned nothing beyond inland waters none of the territorial sea. 
    Following that, Congress passed his Submerged Land Act by which they confirmed and granted to the states a three-mile belt of marginal sea lying outside of its inland waters. 
    The -- it not only confirmed the grant to the three-mile belt but in cases where the state's boundary, historic boundary extended beyond three miles it confirmed it out to its historic boundary. 
    The second Louisiana case held that we did not have a historic boundary extending three leagues that we had contended. 
    Although, this Court held and the Government conceded in that case that we did on the islands within three leagues of the coast and that we also owned the water between those islands and the shore because they were so situated as to enclose inland waters. 
    Now, this case is to determine where the limit of the inland waters of Louisiana are, the inland waters that belong to this state under Pollard versus Hagan. 
    And once we determine where the inland waters are, then we measure three miles outside of those inland waters for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act.

    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    Your Honor, we have felt that we must accept the California case in holding that the Geneva Convention applies. 
    We may not agree with that but that was the holding of this Court. 
    Now, if you will remember this case -- this Court in the Texas case and in the Florida case awarded both Texas and Florida their historic limits, Texas goes out three leagues, Florida goes out three leagues but Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were brought into their shores into their inland water.

    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    Yes sir, but the inland water land Mr. Sachse argued yesterday is the limit of our inland waters. 
    It has nothing to do with our historic boundaries.

    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    We filed an alternative motion asserting an alternative coastline primarily in our position of the restrictive and narrow interpretation of this Convention that the Justice Department put on it. 
    They have come up with a line for Louisiana's inland waters that's virtually a shoreline. 
    And it's my purpose to point out to this Court that even -- that whether or not you accept the inland water lines and Mr. Sachse advocates there's no justification for the line that the Government continues.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="287.790" stopTime="303.261">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I take it would not limit it that your part of the argument in reference to the issue. 
    What I meant was if there's rest primarily on argument which is practically the same that I made in California case.
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="303.261" stopTime="393.171">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    Yes sir, to a great extent Mr. Justice to great extent. 
    We feel that the shores of the Gulf of Mexico and particularly Louisiana are so shallow, there's so changing. 
    There's no way the foreign commerce or any ocean going commerce to go anywhere in Louisiana because of the shallow waters. 
    We've had the dredged channel, the United States Government spent over $300 million dredging channels in to the ports of Louisiana. 
    There could be no commerce, they would be no port but for these dredged channels, this is a gently sloping shore, it is of no value at all to foreign commerce. 
    And we feel that these are factors that this Court must take into consideration in determining what are the inland waters of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. 
    Now, I have already alluded to the disagreement between the Government and I say that was the interpretation of the Convention. 
    Louisiana takes the position that the Convention is a general document that it could not possibly be held to cover every complexity and every detail of every coast in the world. 
    We think it's like the United States Constitution and that -- it must be interpreted liberally in order to make it work. 
    The Government on the other hand said we've got to stick to the letter of that document that we can't go beyond its four corners and where it silent it is prohibitive. 
    It denies to us principles of international law that are well established.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="393.171" stopTime="395.954">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would you repeat that when you say, the Government said --
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="395.954" stopTime="399.071">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    That where the Convention is silent it is --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="399.071" stopTime="399.695">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Voice Overlap) it is prohibitive?
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="399.695" stopTime="547.704">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    -- it is prohibitive. 
    For example, the Convention is silent on whether or not islands may be used to form that perimeter of bays or to enclose inland waters. 
    The Government takes the fact position that that means it is prohibitive that we may not use islands to enclose inland waters. 
    Yet, in every single instance of every bay that they have recognized along our coast they do in fact used islands to form the perimeters of those bays. 
    As a result of this type of narrow interpretation of this Convention, the Government has arrived of what we consider as shoreline. 
    It has changed the status of the inland waters of Louisiana from inland to the high seas. 
    It's changed the status of the inland waters which have been recognized by this Court to be inland. 
    A typical example of this is in Chandeleur and Breton Islands. 
    These waters are enclosed by the Chandeleur Island and by Breton Island. 
    The Government concedes -- now, listen to this, the Government concedes that these waters are inland but they say that they're inland only because of the concessions they made in this prior case where they admitted and conceded when we were arguing for a three-league limit. 
    They admitted that all of the island within three leagues with the territory of Louisiana and that all of the waters between the islands and the mainland was so situated as to enclose inland waters. 
    This Court recognized this in the first Louisiana case and pointed out that these waters had become vested in Louisiana at the time it was admitted into the union and our territory under the adoption of Pollard versus Hagan. 
    In the California case, this Court again recognized that these waters were inland. 
    It distinguished them from the Santa Barbara Channel which the Court had held connected two areas of the open sea. 
    In distinguishing these waters from the Santa Barbara Channel, it pointed out that Breton Island was a cul-de-sac that Chandeleur Island led only to Breton island if it led anywhere that neither served as a route of passage between two areas of the open sea and both was so shallow as to be navigable. 
    Now, the Government --

    But where is the mainland on that chart?

speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="569.974" stopTime="630.791">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    All of Louisiana's shoreline is out. 
    This is what makes it so difficult to apply this Convention without the use of a straight baseline system. 
    Now, these waters have been phrased not only that it recognized in the phrase of Louisiana case and in the California case. 
    They have been recognized as inland waters of Louisiana in case in 1905 before this Court involving a boundary dispute between Louisiana and Mississippi. 
    Even that Chapman Line which the Secretary of Interior Chapman drew in 1950 as the most landward position the Government could claim in these waters recognized that these were inland and enclosed the water outside the Chandeleur Islands. 
    They were again recognized by this Court in the supplemental decree in 1965 because we were awarded title to waters line outside of Breton Island. 
    But now, the Government says, the Convention has changed all of it that there's now no legal basis for holding these waters to be inland that the Convention is reclassified them into the high seas.

    Well, what (Voice Overlap) concession anywhere else?
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="679.827" stopTime="761.885">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    That's right. 
    It says, except for its concession in this particular instance these waters would be high seas that the Convention has changed the status from inland waters to high seas. 
    Now, we say that Congress never intended any such results. 
    We say that the congressional hearings and the hearings before the Committee on their adoption of a Geneva Convention, the Committee asked the State Department this very question. 
    Are there any waters which are now entitled but which would become high seas if we adopted this Convention. 
    And the State Department's answer was in the negative. 
    Now, we say that the Convention has not changed these waters that the Convention should be interpreted liberally and it should be interpreted so as to continue the principles of international law which were in existence prior to the Convention and which are not conferred to the Convention. 
    But if we're wrong and if the Government is right and if the Convention should be interpreted as to change the status of inland waters from inland to the high seas then we say that these waters must be recognized as historic waters which are accepted from the Convention. 
    The Convention expressly accepts the category of historic waters.

    If the Government contends that the Convention changed the status of inland waters and the Government contends that the Convention changed the boundary of this country and took away the territory of Louisiana and we say that if that's true and we don't think it is but if that's true, then we say that the act of Congress adopt in this Convention is unconstitutional.

    Is that what the Constitution provides?
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="802.496" stopTime="834.556">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    Your Honor, the Constitution provides, I believe, in Article IV that Congress may not take away the part of one state to form another state and that it may not add territory to the first state without its consent. 
    The second article provides that the power of Congress to seed and sell its own property, its own territory is an incumbent. 
    The cases have held under this that Congress may not change the boundaries of a state without that state's consent.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="834.556" stopTime="839.659">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="839.659" stopTime="880.755">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    There is no expressed provision in the Constitution saying that Congress may not take away the territory of a state and give it to a foreign nation. 
    But, we say that if it can't take away the territory of a state and give it to another state, it must follow that it can't give it to the family of nations. 
    And cases have so held in the California case, Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out that the contraction of a state's boundary in the name of foreign relations would be highly questionable and we have cited in our brief several cases in which the courts have held that Congress may not contract the state's boundary or cede its territory without the consent of that state.

    Does the Government's claim rested on in interpretation of the Submerged Land Act?

    Mr. J. B. Miller

    The Government --

    Merely on the treaty?
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="887.986" stopTime="993.776">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    Government's contention as I understand it is that by virtue of the adoption of the treaty that there is now no legal basis for these waters remaining inland waters but since they have conceded that they were inland waters in the earlier case that they do not deal that it is in the public interest to withdraw that concession. 
    Now, a similar situation exists in the Mississippi River Delta. 
    Your map number five will portray this area. 
    Louisiana's alternative coastline is shown in solid green and its three-mile limit is shown in dusked green lines. 
    The Government's coastline the more restrictive one is shown in solid brown where there are no brown lines the Government uses the shore as the line. 
    The Government's three-mile limit is shown in dusked brown. 
    Now, we all know of the importance of the Mississippi River. 
    This river extends not only through Louisiana, it goes all the way to the Ohio and the Midwest and the Missouri and the west. 
    This is a river that was responsible for the Louisiana Purchase. 
    It participated in the war of 1812 and other wars. 
    It's the most important waterway in this country. 
    Now, it is inland water. 
    Could the Government cede the Mississippi River to the foreign -- to the family of foreign nations and say this is high seas just by doctrine of treaty? 
    Certainly not, the treaty making power of Congress is limited to the constitutional power granted Congress. 
    The Government concedes that most of these waters are geographical -- geographic inland waters.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="993.776" stopTime="994.849">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What does that mean?
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="994.849" stopTime="1116.008">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    That means that under the Convention, they qualify mathematically as a bay. 
    For example, they say that West Bay in going to island bay qualify as bays geographically under the mathematical formulas of the Convention. 
    Louisiana cites that all of these waters are inland waters both historically and geographically. 
    And while the Government concedes that most of them do the major exception is East Bay. 
    They say that East Bay is high seas. 
    Now, East Bay is the most important bay in this delta area. 
    All of this area was formed by sediment. 
    It's continuing to deposit sediment. 
    This passage are changing, some of them being extended seaward others are regressive it's an ever changing area. 
    But going back to East Bay, the Government says that East Bay is high seas because it does not qualify under Article 7 of the Convention. 
    Now, Article 7 defines a bay as a well-marked indentation whose depth of penetration is sufficient to enclose waters, East Bay meets that test, it obviously has no mere curvature of the coast. 
    Another requirement is that the width of the bay may not exceed 24 miles. 
    East Bay is only 15 miles. 
    But Article 7 also requires that the area of the bay must be at least equal to the area of a semicircle, the diameter of which is a closing line of the bay. 
    Since East Bay does not meet this test in it entirety, the Government says, no bay its high seas. 
    We do point out at this point however that a substantial portion of East Bay does meet the semicircle test and this map shows a red line which satisfy the semicircle test and the Convention in every respect. 
    The Government even denies it.

    We do not depart from the Convention.

    Yes sir, if you adopt the Government's interpretation of it. 
    If you adopt our interpretation of it you do not. 
    Article 7 accepts the category of historic bays from this mathematical formula. 
    It is our position that if a body of water has qualified its inland waters throughout the history of this country if it has been the inland waters and territory of a state throughout the history of this country then it is historic inland waters and it is accepted from the mathematical requirements of this brand new semicircle test.

    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    The Government says they are historic bays that they are no longer inland waters and that they are high seas. 
    We say if that is a proper interpretation of this Convention then the Convention must be unconstitutional. 
    But we don't think it's unconstitutional.

speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="1374.805" stopTime="1471.368">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    In East Bay, that is true, yes sir. 
    Now, Louisiana claims East Bay as historic waters not only in the legal sense that we've just been talking about as having qualified as inland waters previously but also in the historical sense of exercise of sovereignty. 
    At the time of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and when Louisiana was admitted to the union in 1812 there was no mathematical requirement for a bay. 
    There was no limitation upon the closing line. 
    The only requirement was that the bay have the general configuration and characteristics of a bay and that its depth of penetration be such as to enclose inland waters along each sides. 
    Certainly, East Bay met this test and this map of 1838 shows a configuration of East Bay at that time. 
    Earlier maps show the same general configuration and we can assume that this was a configuration in 1812. 
    It's obvious that its depth of penetration was sufficient to enclose inland waters and it therefore qualified as the inland waters for the State of Louisiana when it was admitted to the union and became part of a territory of this state under adoption of Pollard versus Hagan. 
    Not only is this true but Louisiana's act of admission, its act of admission includes all of its inland waters. 
    It was described as being bounded on the south by the Gulf of Mexico not the shore but the Gulf of Mexico.

    Well, what page?
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="1522.019" stopTime="1813.297">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    On page -- it starts on 127, the Article the I referred to is number 6 on page 130. 
    It says before going -- after going through all the mathematical test of bays, it says, “the foregoing provision shall not apply to so-called historic bays or in any case where the straight baseline system is used.” 
    Now, going back to Louisiana's boundaries, each boundary was a Gulf of Mexico since East Bay was inland waters it was obviously not the Gulf of Mexico, it became the territory of this state in 1812 and remains the territory of this state under the doctrine of Pollard versus Hagan. 
    Now, towards the turn of the century, international law had begun to develop a limitation upon closing lines. 
    And the 10-mile closing line was mentioned with increasing frequency and several countries had adopted it. 
    This chart shows that East Bay in 1895 more than adequately satisfied even the 10-mile lines. 
    This map also shows another interesting factor. 
    Grande Pass is a peninsula in East Bay when the United States Government started the improvement of navigation at South Pass. 
    This Grande Pass was dammed off to force more water through South Pass. 
    As a result of this procedure, the sediment flow in the East Bay was curtailed. 
    Grande Pass subsided and eventually disappeared. 
    The 1922 coast chart shows this. 
    It shows East Bay after this occurrence. 
    The Passes at South and Southwest Pass had continued to go forward but Grande Pass had disappeared. 
    East Bay had a greater penetration than depth of penetration than ever before but for the first time its entrance exceeded 10 miles. 
    At that time, international law said, you draw a 10-mile line at the close -- at the nearest point within the bay which does not exceed 10-miles. 
    South Pass and southwest Pass have continued to grow, they're still growing. 
    In 1958, when the Convention was adopted this was a configuration of East Bay. 
    It was still a bay. 
    It still had the sufficient depth of penetration to be a bay. 
    It is long since then and the next map shows the 1968 depth of penetration and width at the bay. 
    Now, the Government says that the 10-mile rule never became international law. 
    We don't know, but we say this that if it never became international law then there was no limitation and East Bay remain the bay and inland waters of this state by virtue of its general configuration and characteristics as a bay. 
    It certainly had sufficient depth of penetration. 
    Now, we've shown that East Bay has been part of a territory of this state since the beginning, since 1812. 
    We say that the Convention cannot now divest Louisiana of this territory without the Convention being unconstitutional. 
    Since the time of historic bays is accepted from the strict, inflexible mathematical requirements that will inject international law in 1958, we say that East Bay is a historic bay by virtue of having always qualified as a bay throughout the history of this country and that Congress has no power to do otherwise. 
    It has no more power to disclaim title to East Bay than it does in Mississippi River or the District of Columbia. 
    But East Bay had not owned a qualified geographically as a bay. 
    The classic definition under international law of historic water is waters over which a nation has exercised sovereignty for a considerable period of time with an attitude of general toleration among foreign states. 
    Now, the Government says we've exercised no sovereignty but it confuses ownership with sovereignty. 
    It seems to imply that the United States must have openly and expressly asserted a clean that East Bay was a part of the territory of this nation. 
    This is not necessary, sovereignty does not mean ownership. 
    Sovereignty is authority, it's the exercise of power or control; it's less than complete territoriality. 
    This is made clear that the 1962 study of the United Nations which we understand the Government has adopted in the Alaska case but it's not necessary for this classic type of definition of historic waters that all conceivable acts of sovereignty be exercised. 
    It's only necessary that a nation exercise some act of sovereignty which is inconsistent with the concept of high seas.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1813.297" stopTime="1817.773">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is there a definition in the treaty of historic waters or historic bays?
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="1817.773" stopTime="1834.153">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    No, sir. 
    The Convention is silent on the definition of historic waters and it's our contention that that time was accepted from these mathematical requirements to serve as a safety valve for the various situations we're talking about as well as other situations.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1834.153" stopTime="1844.557">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I noticed that Article 7 that the reference says the so-called historic bays and historic is in quotes --
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="1844.557" stopTime="1983.276">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    That's the only time it's even mentioned Your Honor. 
    There is no definition in the Convention. 
    Now, the definition that is recommended by the United Nation is the classic definition that I'm talking about now, it's the exercise of sovereignty and that means that a nation has exercised some sovereignty for a considerable period of time. 
    That's the best time they could come up with was the word “considerable” with the general attitude of toleration by foreign nations. 
    But it's not necessary that all acts of sovereignty be exercise only and necessary that there will be -- the exercise of some act of sovereignty which is inconsistent with the concept of high seas. 
    In the Norwegian Fisheries case which held Norway's waters to be historic behind their baselines, the only claim that Norway ever made was the fishing. 
    They claim fishing rights and by virtue of those rights having been asserted for so long of time and the lines having been drawn, they were held to be historic borders. 
    Now, it is not inconsistent with the concept of high seas to exercise limited control which is permitted by the Convention within the contiguous zone. 
    As for example the -- to prevent the infringement of your custom laws, the infringement of your immigration laws or your sanitary laws, there is a fringe around the territorial sea and which you may exercise limited control to prevent violation of a nation's laws with in its own territorial sea. 
    But we're not talking about that here. 
    We're talking about the freedom of the seas and the freedom of the seas is where a nation may not exercise sovereignty unless its claim in these waters as its own and the freedom of the high seas which are set forth in the Convention on the high seas or freedom of navigation, freedom of fishing, freedom of flight, and freedom to lay pipe lines. 
    If sovereignty is exercised in any one of these theories it's absolutely inconsistent with the concept of high seas and can be justified only on a basis that the nation is claiming the waters as its very own. 
    Now, we --

    Do I understand your argument to the foreign States that Government is without constitutional power to confer to any other nation or to all the nations as part of the high seas, any submerged land that have once been considered as belonging to the Government?

    Russia claims 12 miles and the one thing that could never be agreed upon on this Convention was how many miles could a nation claim.

    I would have to presume that if Congress and the president so chose that they could do it as well as it did not infringed upon the boundary of a state. 
    I think it would be a disaster to do it but I think that this I have to admit that this power has vested in commerce.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2086.913" stopTime="2096.880">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, do you assume that the state has always owned the three miles from the coastal line so that the Government could not have been decide?
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="2096.880" stopTime="2370.901">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    No, sir. 
    This Court held in the first Louisiana case that Louisiana did not own any of the three-mile limit that we stopped at our inland waters. 
    Now, if you look at this next map, -- if you look at your map number 5, you will see that there is a three-mile limit beyond our inland waters. 
    The boundary of Louisiana stops at the inland waters. 
    But the Submerged Land Act -- the boundary of a nation stops at the three-mile limit. 
    The Submerged Land Act has granted to Louisiana the re sources under the three-mile belt but I cannot say that we actually owned the water of the three-mile belt. 
    But our boundaries are inland waters. 
    Now, we've discussed the classic definition of exercise of sovereignty. 
    We've shown that East Bay has qualified geographically as inland waters of this nation since 1803 in the Louisiana Purchase and since then Louisiana was admitted to the union in 1812. 
    This fact alone presupposes that all kinds of sovereignty were exercised all these waters. 
    If it formed part of a territorial of this state and this nation, there is a presumption that sovereignty was exercised over these waters. 
    And it is impossible at this late date to determine every single act of sovereignty that's been exercised by this nation, by this state, by the local authorities and everybody else but we will mention some. 
    Now, Mr. Sachse has already discussed the Act of 1895 as a basis of the inland water line. 
    The Government has objected to this and contends that this Act is limited to navigation that it have no effect whatsoever but anything else except navigation. 
    We violently disagree with that interpretation but for the purposes of our discussion of history of East Bay, we will assume that the Government is right and that it is limited to navigation. 
    Now, freedom of navigation is the first freedom mentioned in the Convention on the high seas, no nation may regulate navigation on any part of the high seas. 
    To do so, it can only justify it on the basis that it is claiming those waters as it's very own. 
    Now, Mr. Sachse has pointed ut that prior to 1895, Congress had adopted the international rule for the prevention of collisions on the sea. 
    These rules applied not only to the high seas, they also applied to the marginal or territorial sea. 
    Subsequent acts of Congress, treaties and the case of the Delaware make this clear. 
    The international rules applied to the high seas and the territorial seas. 
    The Act of 1895 imposed the inland rules only upon inland waters. 
    But it imposed the inland rules upon all vessels, foreign as well as domestic. 
    It says that all vessels must comply with the inland rules once they get into the inland waters and it authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to designate and define a line marking those inland waters to carry out the purposes of that act. 
    Now, the reason for the designation of this line by the Secretary of the Treasury, the reason for it was of course to regulate navigation. 
    But the effect of it goes beyond that. 
    It was a line marking the inland waters of this United States. 
    Now, in 1895 immediately after the passing of the statute, the Secretary of Treasury began his test of designating and defining these lines. 
    He picked the most important areas in the United States for his first lines in 1895. 
    He included Philadelphia Harbor and Delaware Bay, Baltimore and Chesapeake Bay, New York, Charleston, Savannah, Mobile and New Orleans and the Delta of the Mississippi River. 
    Among their first lines designated in 1895, there had to be some lines showing where our inland, the inland waters of this nation were so that we could enforce inland rules on one side and international rules on the other side, and he designated these lines in 1895.

    And there had been no concept of straight baseline before the Convention and the Court held that they will -- there were -- historic waters because Norway had controlled fishing inside those lines.

    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    Now, the 1895 line around the Delta was defined as commencing at the light -- Southeast Pass Jetty Light. 
    It ran thence to Pass (Inaudible) and thence to the (Inaudible) Island in the Chandeleur Chain. 
    It commenced again by separate description at South Pass East Jetty Light ran of Southwest Pass and thence north to shore. 
    This description was published in the Treasury Department Circular 127 of July 1895 and was also indicated on the United States Coast Chart 194 of that year. 
    And we have circled this in red and this map appears in the reduced scale in (Inaudible). 
    I'm sure you can't read it but that's what it says. 
    Now, this line enclosed all of the waters of the Delta including East Bay. 
    Similar lines were designated again in 1897 and 1900. 
    After 1900, the authority was transferred from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor. 
    And in 1905 and in 1907, the Secretary of Commerce and Labor designated similar lines making only such adjustments that were occasioned by the seaward growth of the Passes. 
    The Secretary of Commerce and Labor became the Secretary of Commerce. 
    And in 1917, another line was designated by the Secretary of Commerce. 
    The lines were again designated in 1927 and 1932. 
    Our next map shows a composite of all of these lines as well as in 1953, Your Honors. 
    At the time these lines were drawn, each and every one of them enclosed the entirety of East Bay.

    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    Yes, sir. 
    As a matter of fact, the coastguard tried to change this line last year. 
    They held hearings all over the Gulf of Mexico and there were such a furrow, there were so many objections by the shipping interest and the people who had economic interest in this area that they abandoned the whole project. 
    We have to have a line like this in Louisiana because of shallow waters, the small boats, fishermen who have been out on East Bay and outboard motorboat fishing. 
    And the Government says this is high seas in the 16-foot motorboat. 
    We can't even get to the shores in Louisiana without dredged channels. 
    There must be a line somewhere out there. 
    Now, we say that these lines qualify straight baselines under Article 4 of the Convention also because we think to do and we think that the Convention should be interpreted as in including lines such as these because this is necessary for the state in this country. 
    The waters of Louisiana so shallow, there's no way for them to be of any benefit to any foreign commerce, they're not like the Santa Barbara Channel. 
    The Santa Barbara Channel is 2000 feet deep.

    There was no agreement on the territorial sea. 
    Russia claimed 12 miles. 
    We claim three miles. 
    We could not agree but the United States has consistently asserted three miles and under their present position, this would make a substantial part of East Bay high seas. 
    We would assert no plain rule. 
    Now, the acts of Congress and regulations required that the inland rules be used by all vessels both foreign and domestic inside these lines. 
    There can be no doubt that the agencies entrusted with the enforcement of these laws commencing with the Secretary of the Treasury on up now to the coast guard did in fact enforced these laws and the Government doesn't deny that they did. 
    There can be no doubt that the inland rules of the road where in fact enforced inside these lines both on domestic vessels and foreign vessels and the Government doesn't deny that either. 
    And yet, that's not a single instance, there is not a single instance of any objection by any foreign nation or any foreign vessel to these lines. 
    Not only has there been toleration but we feel that there's been a complete acquiescence but this isn't the end of the story. 
    Louisiana has exercised sovereignty within these waters. 
    Beginning in 1870, Louisiana enacted extensive statute regulating the oyster, fishing and shrimping industry. 
    All of these statutes have been applied and interpreted as applying to the inland waters of Louisiana including East Bay. 
    Oyster leases have been granted in East Bay. 
    Some of the shrimp statutes specifically mentioned East Bay. 
    Arrests have been made in east for the violation of the shrimping regulations. 
    The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries patrolled East Bay in boats to enforce the regulations. 
    No questions have ever been raised not by the United States; no foreign vessel, not even the persons who were arrested. 
    Other control has also been exercised by the local officials of other activities and large oil field is located at East Bay and therein lies the problem. 
    Part of this oil field extends in to the part that the Government says this is now high seas. 
    This map is prepared by Shell Oil Company showing its facilities in this area. 
    It's obvious that the congestion virtually precludes (Voice Overlap) -- any foreign vessels.

    But Louisiana is not the only one has considered this bay to be inland waters. 
    The United States has always considered it to be inland waters and in 1940 when the Census Bureau undertook the re-measurement of the United States, they included all of East Bay as the inland waters of America. 
    This map shows the location of the line that was drawn by the Census Bureau in 1940. 
    Now, the Government we exercise no sovereignty, yet we control navigation so there's no freedom of navigation.

    We can file in the record reports of arrest that had been made. 
    We filed in the record that oyster leases that have been made. 
    Maybe we should ask the Government what facts they dispute, I don't know. 
    My time is running out, I want to cover one more area before I quit and that's Caillou Bay which is in your map number 21. 
    Caillou Bay again serves as an example of the restrictive interpretation of the Government. 
    The Government says that islands may not be used to foreign bays and yet they used the same mass of islands which we used as the western part of Caillou Bay to form the adjoining Timbalier Bay. 
    But they say these islands can enclose bays. 
    These islands are separated from the mainland by one foot of water, one foot of water going to coast job. 
    The maximum depth of water in this bay is 7 feet and most of the bay is about 5 to 6 feet deep, but they say this is like Santa Barbara Channel. 
    They say this is the same thing the Santa Barbara Channel which this Court held not to be inland water. 
    To show the difference, this is a coast chart of Santa Barbara Channel. 
    We have reproduced Caillou Bay at the same scale as this coast chart and this is Caillou Bay. 
    It's a small I don't even think you can see it. 
    But this is Caillou Bay that the Government says it's like the Santa Barbara Channel. 
    The depth of water in Caillou Bay is 5 to 6 feet deep. 
    The depth of water in the Santa Barbara Channel is 2000 feet deep. 
    Now, this is a kind of water we're talking about in Louisiana. 
    We're talking about tons, we're not talking about 2000-foot seagoing channels even the Chapman Line, even the Chapman Line, in 1950 drawn by Secretary of the Interior Chapman enclosed East Bay. 
    As a result, it had never even -- not East Bay, I'm sorry Your Honor, Caillou Bay. 
    This bay has never been considered as being in dispute and no moneys have even been impounded, it was never regarded as being disputable. 
    And then the first Louisiana case, the Government conceded that all the waters located situated between the islands and the main lands are inland water because the islands are so situated as to enclose inland waters. 
    Now, they say Caillou Bay is part of the high seas six-foot water part of the high seas.

    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    Now, I've mentioned the dredged channels before as being necessary for this state and in every single port that we have in Louisiana including the port of New Orleans it's been necessary to dredged channels in order to reach that port even the Passes at the river silt up and no one -- and no boats can get in without dredged channels. 
    This is a dredged channel off the coast of, I believe, its channel of Calcasieu and Cameron Parish. 
    This dredged channel -- similar dredged channel was held to be inland waters in the case of a Delaware. 
    This was getting its channel in leading to New York Harbor in which the Court said, it's as much the inland waters as New York Harbor itself. 
    Article 8 of the Convention provides that the outer most permanent harbour works which form an integral part of the harbour system shall be regarded as forming part of the coastline. 
    These are permanent. 
    They're cut into the bid of a Gulf of Mexico. 
    The United States Government has spent over $300 million and all shores in Louisiana dredging these channels. 
    They currently spend money maintaining these channels and these are not mere buoy channels. 
    The earth dredged out of these channels as deposited on the bank of the cut in the form of a spoiled bank and it impedes navigation. 
    But without the channels no vessel could navigate beyond a rowboat or an outboard motorboat or some other small type of boat but they're not buoy. 
    These channels are marked by tremendous steel and concrete towers that are sunk in the bed of a Gulf of Mexico at over 60 feet tall. 
    They are truly represents the outermost permanent harbour works which formed an integral part of the harbour system of Louisiana and under Article 8 of the Convention. 
    They're part of the coastline. 
    That article doesn't -- the Government objects to these because they are submerged. 
    That article doesn't mention anything about being submerged. 
    It says permanent harbour works. 
    The Government says we can't measure them from a low water line. 
    The Convention doesn't say anything about measuring permanent harbour works from the low water line. 
    The Convention says if they are part of the harbour works, they are an integral part of the harbour system. 
    They are regarded as part of the coast to Louisiana. 
    One more factor I want to mention in its decree, the Government is asking that this Court limit the effect to this decision to the Chapman Line and yet, they are claiming Caillou Bay beyond the Chapman line. 
    We think this decree must settle the lands underneath navigable waters which will confirm to the states by the Submerged Lands Act.

   Rebuttal of Archibald Cox
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="3711.832" stopTime="3773.702">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court. 
    I think it will be helpful in the beginning if I go back to the fundamental question in this case. 
    As we see it, the ultimate question is, where is the coastline of the United States located in the general area of Louisiana for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act? 
    The exact location of the coastline is important because the Submerged Lands Act confirmed to each state, the title to the resources not only up to the coastline but also for three miles beyond. 
    And consequently while we're fighting about where the line is three miles beyond the coastline that is necessary determined by the location of the coastline itself and it's more convenient to talk directly about the location of the coastline.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3773.702" stopTime="3779.285">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And you think of that as the coastline of the United States rather than the coastline of Louisiana, do you?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="3779.285" stopTime="4008.414">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    We say that the coastline for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act means the coastline of the United States. 
    Yes, sir. 
    The two -- the two would be the same for all purposes that so far as I can think but we do mean for international purposes Justice Stewart and that's why I emphasize the coastline of the United States. 
    Now, Section 2 (c) of the Submerged Lands Act defines the coastline as the line of ordinary low water along the coast which is indirect contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters. 
    There's no dispute of course about first part of the definition in this case. 
    That is to say the low water marked along the coast where the coast is in contact with the open sea. 
    Although, Louisiana denies that their coast is ever in contact with the open sea. 
    The critical question then is about the second part of the definition in 2 (c) of the Submerged Lands Act whereas the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters. 
    In other words, what are the inland waters of Louisiana and where is their seaward limit. 
    Now, in answering this question, the first step is to determine where one finds the definition of inland waters. 
    Where one finds the standard that he applies to the physical features of this coast in order to find the inland waters. 
    Our view is that you find it in the convent -- Geneva Convention of 1961 defining the territorial sea and the adjacent waters. 
    Louisiana's answer is that you find it -- our first answer is that you find it in the regulations issued by the coastguard for the purpose of telling vessels where they are to follow the international rules in navigation and where they are to follow our own domestic inland rules of navigation. 
    The difference is our illustrator on this chart and also on the small charts which I believe the clerk has handed to each member of the Court. 
    The green area is the area that was confirmed to the United States by the decree entered late in 1965 a supplemental decree which was virtually by consent. 
    In other words, it is the area more than three miles from the coastguard line. 
    The red areas here, a little bit here and then a bit over here and another area in East Bay are the areas that were confirmed to Louisiana by the supplemental decree entered in late in 1965. 
    The pink area we concede goes to Louisiana, there's no dispute about it. 
    Consequently, one comes down on to the white area between green and the pink or red, this long strip in here, sometimes 20 miles of the physical coast. 
    The dispute is over that area.

    This map in other words Justice White is a map that deals in terms of boundaries not in terms of the coastline. 
    Now, I should make one other point about the map. 
    Back in the pink line, there is a lot of white area which is of course water. 
    That goes to Louisiana too because it's never been any dispute about it. 
    There've been no funds impounded from it and consequently we didn't think it's worth coloring on the map.

    Those clearly are inland waters.

    Now, so the first issue in the case deals with the entire white area outside the pink and red lines and these were about the coastguard line will determine that.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    That's three miles from that dotted line as the coastguard line. 
    I come next I think into answering the question that was bothering you Justice Brennan. 
    The second part of the case that is assuming that we are right, that the coastguard line is not controlling. 
    The second part of the case then concerns -- we would then get the white area outside the blue line and that would be clear. 
    The second part of the case involves the area inside (Voice Overlap) between it and the pink and red. 
    In other words, Louisiana says they own out to that blue line under the Submerged Lands Act, under their alternative potentials whereas we say they don't go beyond what is pink or red.

    With their variance on the Geneva Convention, yes. 
    So that in the second part of the case what you have is a series of disputes about specific areas within the same years coming out then again this area here again here Caillou Bay, another application here get a ground each of these East Bay and so on. 
    Now, there are series of specific disputes about the meaning and application of the Convention and really have to be worked through one by one of those certain common questions applied. 
    Now, I planned to devote the first part of my argument to the question of the coastguard line.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4346.379" stopTime="4775.216">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    They say that the sea never comes within 20 miles -- 20 miles at spot, 15, 10 and others of the shore of Louisiana. 
    As I say, I plan to deal first with the coastguard line and then second was that of the more specific disputes as I have tied to. 
    With respect to the coastguard line, we urge first that United States against California should be decisive. 
    There, the Court held that Congress used the terms “coastline” and “inland waters” in the international sense as in it had used to be in prior decisions of this Court notably the first California case. 
    Second, that Congress intended the Court to fill out the meaning of inland waters in coastline by choosing the best in those practicable definitions. 
    And then third, the Court held that the best and most practical definition where those in the Geneva Convention ratified by the United States in 1961. 
    Now, those three rulings seem to us dispositive of the issue of these white areas. 
    Louisiana argues as I understand it that the decision in the California case was merely sort of permissive, a state could assert a right out to the line fixed under the Convention or it could if it wish assert a line out under some other set of rules going beyond the Convention. 
    That seems to us to be inconsistent of both with what the Court said in the California case and also inconsistent with what it actually did in its decree. 
    In the California case, on page 165 of 381 U.S., the Court said it is our opinion that we best fulfill our responsibility by giving content to the words which Congress implied that's of course implied in the Submerged Lands Act. 
    By imply -- adopting the best and most workable definitions available the Convention provides such definitions. 
    We adopt them for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act then the Court went on to point out, this establishes a single coastline both for the fenestration of the Submerged Lands Act in the conduct of our future relation. 
    This certainly doesn't sound permissive. 
    It establishes a single coastline where you adopt this definition. 
    It doesn't sound as if they were to be used on some occasions and then not on others if the state happened to prefer. 
    And of course the Court later on its opinion rejected California's claim to Santa Monica Bay and to San Luis Obispo Bay on the ground that they did not conform to the requirements of the Convention. 
    So, that it applied it both where it heard us as some of you will recall in Monterey Bay and it applied the Convention too where it heard California as in San Luis Obispo Bay and Santa Monica Bay. 
    When it came to the decree which the Court entered following the decision in the California case, it being on the original document, the decree were cited as used here in inland waters means I emphasized the “means”, means what is landward of the baseline of the territorial sea which are now recognized as internal waters of the United States under the Convention on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone. 
    The word “means” surely suggests that there were no alternatives. 
    Furthermore, on the next paragraph of the decree where the Court listed certain waters that it adjudicated to be inland waters of California. 
    It used the word that the inland waters of California include specific areas that were in litigation in that case. 
    Obviously, it didn't wish to prejudge California's claim as to areas we didn't talk about in that case are belonged to northern part of the coast. 
    I think again the contrast between “includes” in this paragraph and “means” in the other paragraph emphasizes that the word “means” when adopting a general formula was deliberate and indeed at least the “includes” point was pointed out in the supplemental briefs of the decree. 
    Louisiana's other argument as I understand it is that United States against California does not apply because her coast has unique features. 
    Of course the characteristics of all the coasts in states are in some degree peculiar. 
    The Alaska coast is entirely unlike the North Carolina coast or the Maine coast is entirely unlike the Louisiana coast, Connecticut coastline would be quite different from Oregon's and so forth. 
    If one said that a state may get out from under the Convention simply by calling attention to particular characteristics, then every state's coastline is drawn off with litigation. 
    The very purpose of the California case to have the same coastline for international purposes and for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act would be defeated and the Court and the Congress indirectly, I suggest, would be put in the position of playing favorites among the states as it used the Convention rules in one case and some other set of rule and another. 
    So, we think as I say that the California decision is controlling. 
    I should in that connection mention once more point, there are coastguard lines. 
    There are some of the bays in California was not along the whole coast as there is here in Louisiana. 
    Neither party in the California case thought had appropriate to invoke those lines. 
    They might've been invoked on both parties thought that they were irrelevant and we so stated to the Court as I remember it during oral argument mentioning the existence of the lines. 
    Moving along, --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4775.216" stopTime="4779.550">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Had there ever been any complete line or coastline drawn there?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4779.550" stopTime="4804.116">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    No. 
    No and of course Mr. Justice Black, there never was any complete coastline drawn in Louisiana until after the Submerged Lands Act was passed. 
    Alright, the line has vary from time to time at some times it is right along the east side of the delta here down on the east side of the delta.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4804.116" stopTime="4805.542">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Who draw it then?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4805.542" stopTime="4874.152">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    It was either, to begin with the Secretary of the Treasury, one states the Bureau of Navigation, and ultimately it came to the coastguard. 
    But this whole expands here that they now rely on wasn't drawn until after the Submerged Lands Act was adopted. 
    It didn't exist at the time the Submerged Lands Act was passed. 
    Indeed, at the time the Submerged Lands Act has passed, Louisiana's chart didn't mention that. 
    The line didn't even include this bay. 
    It ran a little bit up here down around the Chandeleur Island and then down roughly where the edge of the green is now, it isn't precise but it was roughly there. 
    And that was the only line from 1935 until 1953 appeared of almost 20 years according to our study of the record. 
    So, that the line Louisiana now is invoking was promulgated after the Submerged Lands Act was passed.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4874.152" stopTime="4878.312">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Was it drawn under the fifth of 1895 statute under those --

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Under the 1895 statute, yes Mr. Justice.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    That with changes due to the re-governmental reorganization but it was basically the 1895 statute. 
    Now, we say that even as an original question for getting the California case thereon that the coastguard line would be utterly unacceptable as the definition of inland waters for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act. 
    In order to put the two in proper relation, I think it's important that I go back and give a little bit of explanation of the history of the legislation dealing with the coastguard line and the various lines that have been promulgated from time to time under that legislation.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    To a few very brief references, yes. 
    I can elaborate from now or do it a minute later after I have -- I have it firmly in mind to refer the Court to.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4952.282" stopTime="4955.086">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Alright.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="4955.086" stopTime="5096.899">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    In 1864, Congress enacted a statute later incorporated from the revised statutes that promulgated certain rules of the road navigation rules for all United States vessels anyone the kind of statute that Justice Fortas referred to applicable earlier, applicable to vessels sailing the high seas. 
    And this applied to both naval vessels and to the merchant marine. 
    In the 1880's, there were series of international conferences on rules of navigation and they came out not with the treaty but with recommendations to the nations that participated in. 
    In 1890, Congress enacted a new statute which required all U.S. vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels to follow the new international rules. 
    That was to take effect some years later and in the end of all it became apparent that there was going to be some confusion because the old statute adopting the inland rules still applied somewhere and the new statute still apply to some vessels somewhere. 
    In 1895, having been advised to this problem but Congress enacted the statute that we're talking about it appears on pages 150 and 151 of the Government's brief. 
    It said that the old 1864 rules, the inland rules should be followed on inland waters and then it went on in Section 2 and the power of the Secretary of the Treasury and that's the authority that it is comes down to the Commandant of the coastguard, empowered him from time to time to designate and define by suitable bearings or ranges with lighthouses, light vessels, buoys or coast objects the lines dividing the high seas from rivers, harbors and inland waters.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, it was first made by the coastguard in a publication in 1943 referred to on page 33 of our brief, toward the bottom of the page. 
    The coastguard admiralty law enforcement manual and that begins by explaining what is meant by inland waters and high seas in the international or territorial sense. 
    And then it goes on and says navigation rule. 
    Now, it was consider another line of demarcation.

    Thank you.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="5343.565" stopTime="5431.423">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Now, let us consider another line of demarcation, something other than the line for international purposes. 
    As shown in chapter 5, there are different rules for navigation on the inland waters in the high seas but here we do not apply the previous definition but adopt a new one for a convenience. 
    Secretary of Commerce has fixed the series of lines and so forth. 
    Going over on page 34, quite obviously this artificial line does not truly separate the high seas from the inland waters of the United States. 
    It simply marks the area within which the inland rules apply and outside of which the international rules control. 
    Then, and you find this repeated in the coastguard publications over and over again. 
    I call attention to perhaps the most significant of all. 
    In 1953, when the Commandant for the first time promulgated any line along the part of the area from here to here, well, for the first time from here, he said, in putting out that regulation that it was drawn solely for purposes connected with navigation in shipping.

    The first explicit disclaimer and I'll indicate what I mean by explicit in a few minutes. 
    The first explicit disclaimer that we have reference to came from the Assistant Secretary of State and it's quoted on page 38 of our brief.

    That was the Secretary of State?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="5516.451" stopTime="5607.095">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    That was the Assistant Secretary of State and the circumstances were these, the Norwegian Government was putting together materials for the purpose of trying before the International Court of the famous Norwegian fisheries case. 
    So, they rode around the world asking everyone to provide evidence with respect to -- of where he in that country defined its territorial boundaries. 
    And the Secretary of State circulated the departments and collected everything. 
    They collected among other things from the Treasury Department references to where the various coastguard lines. 
    And he explained in the letter, I don't quote it off but he explained in part of it, the different departments had adopted different rules for the purposes in the United States and sent the coastguard regulations among them and then after that he went on and said and this is the part I rely on particularly. 
    It should be understood that the foregoing lines do not represent territorial boundaries but are for navigational purposes to indicate where the inland rules begin and the international rules seize to apply but there again there's a clear recognition of the very limited purpose of these definitions under the Act of 1895.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5607.095" stopTime="5627.726">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, what's the authority of the United States to proscribe those inland rules on the -- in the territorial within that coastguard lines what's this if it's -- there really isn't of territorial waters, what is the authority?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="5627.726" stopTime="5649.349">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, I think that there is some question whether they are valid within that area. 
    The coastguard takes the position that they are valid even though that is not inland waters and in some part of course is not territorial sea.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5649.349" stopTime="5651.982">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But your position would raise that question.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="5651.982" stopTime="5707.076">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    It raises that question, I would think if the Court would not pass judgment upon it or that being answer in two steps. 
    First, we do think it most unlikely that the 1895 statute was ever intended to give the Secretary of the Treasury a power to fix the territorial limits of the United States. 
    It just seems inherently impossible that in a little act dealing with navigation, a section would've been put in the only explanation was that it was done at the request in shipping interest in New York Harbor and that it would be for this limited purpose. 
    We just think inherently impossible that Congress would have said the Secretary has now fixed the territorial limits of the United States.

    Yes, but it seems to me strange first that it would've been given to the Secretary of the Treasury. 
    Second, that it was strange that it would be given simply in an act entitled, an act to fix the rules of navigation.

    Yes, but of course the international -- questions of international law that determine the territorial boundaries of the United States are primarily under the Department of State. 
    I think that it is quite likely and then there's one more point about the Act. 
    Of course it provides that the Secretary shall do it, shall issue these regulations from time to time. 
    This doesn't sound like fixing territorial boundaries for international purposes. 
    You don't make them fix territorial boundaries for international purposes from time to time.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well we asserted our jurisdiction over the resources. 
    We didn't purport to change the boundaries in terms of the freedom of the seas, as I understand it. 
    We said that we were entitled of the resources on the continental shelf but we didn't purport to change our boundaries in reference to the high seas.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    But we don't -- we were asserting authority under it and I suppose to structures that came up my interfere with navigation although there's always been a privilege to a restructures in the high seas for lighthouses, and other things of that kind without there becoming part of the territory of the United States. 
    That in any event today is covered by International Convention. 
    But let's -- it's quite possible I think well then what was contemplated immediately was that the Secretary of the Treasury would be guided by the territorial boundaries and that he was instructed for the convenience of navigation not to fix them but to find them. 
    But I suggest two different things, one is to apply the international rules and translate them into buoys, lighthouses and a like, and the other thing is to determine. 
    But a point of fact as I have suggested whatever the original intention was neither the Secretary of the Treasury nor anyone else has ever done this in terms of the International law. 
    From the very beginning, this we'd elaborate in our brief, the rules have been laid down in ways that do not conform either of this country or any other countries conceptions of international law. 
    They run to lighthouses, they take in large areas especially of the main coast from the beginning or Charleston Harbor in South Carolina which we're not conceivably inland waters under international law.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    No. 
    Indeed, Mr. Justice so far as anyone knows we have never asserted as against any ship flying the flag of another nation nor applied in any admiralty procedure involving a ship of another nation. 
    Well, the inland rules because of the collision or sailing in this area, I don't -- I can't say that the coastguard both hasn't ever hailed to foreign vessel neither can anyone say that it can but so far as this goes it is a paper thing. 
    But --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6016.377" stopTime="6027.984">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, let me make sure that I understand that. 
    What you're saying is that in that white area we have never attempted to enforce domestic regulations against foreign vessels?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="6027.984" stopTime="6057.133">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    So far as I know and of course and this is important on many aspects of the case. 
    Of course, as against our own nation there is under securities in Florida, a clear power to regulate fishing, shrimping, navigation rules or anything else. 
    Now, the --

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, I take it they undoubtedly do and I take it that we have the power to ask them to do it and if they acquiescence, well then that's that. 
    Furthermore --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6075.627" stopTime="6082.200">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    All the charts -- all the charts in the chart row of any ship would show that the inland rules apply within that line.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    They along the side of this line it says use inland rule.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    And they no doubt do conform. 
    Now, there are two -- well, I'm just speaking about the status of the rules today. 
    First, I want to emphasize that under Louisiana's view and under any view of Justice White that the validity or effectiveness of these rules depends upon these big inland waters in the international sense. 
    They are plainly invalid today because the Geneva Convention as of today plainly fixes rules inconsistent with the inland rules. 
    I and that Convention which we have ratified and undoubtedly takes preceding over anything the coastguard has done. 
    So that the rules cannot be sustained today on the theory that they somehow are fixing the territorial boundaries of the United States in the international sense, they're bound to be invalid under that theory.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6164.864" stopTime="6168.990">

    Well, then --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6169.620" stopTime="6172.863">

    With reference to the domestic aspect.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="6172.863" stopTime="6185.520">

    Well, but the question -- they are fixing what if they're to be limited for only domestic purposes that is to say they apply only to our vessels.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6185.520" stopTime="6189.075">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And so what's the boundary of the country?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="6189.075" stopTime="6201.003">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    But that is in the international question. 
    That's what the boundary of the country is an international question.

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6201.003" stopTime="6209.344">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The final analysis, it depends on the force that a government can exercise to fix its own boundary, doesn't it?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="6209.344" stopTime="6219.152">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    That was the original historical derivation of the rule, yes. 
    The theory was that the three-mile limit was a cannon shot from shore. 
    Now, --

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    That's correct.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    The plus effect that we have decided the case in that subject.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="6239.105" stopTime="6241.058">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    You have decided the case on that subject.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6241.058" stopTime="6241.204">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="6241.204" stopTime="6802.625">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    It seems to me that the reasons behind it are very sound. 
    I just want to give one more answer to Justice White and then I will come directly to that point. 
    Alright, there are decisions, Justice White, particularly the English case of Indianapolis which suggest that a nation has the power to set a rules in navigation requirements of navigation for vessels approaching or leaving their ports and if that, I don't want to overstate that line, if that is sound law and the coastguard relies on it, as I understand it, then that would validate these rules simply as the requirements of navigation because for all practical purposes the only vessels coming in here are going to foreign vessels coming in here are going to be foreign vessels going to the ports of Louisiana. 
    Now, I come to the question raised by Justice Fortas, what about Section 2 (c) of the Submerged Lands Act. 
    We say that it cannot have meant the inland water line as laid down by the coastguard or the Secretary of the Treasury for number of reasons. 
    First, the evidence is very persuasive that the term was used in the international sentence in reference to a general body of international law. 
    This was the flavor of the debate. 
    There are specific references to the courts used of the term in the early California case where it clearly indicated that it referred to use it in the international sentence. 
    And there is specific legislative history which Justice Harlan asked me about earlier with respect to the coastguard line. 
    There was testimony from Leander Perez of the delta area and an Assistant Attorney General of Louisiana which referred to the coastguard line. 
    Remembering that time, this line did not exist. 
    Indeed, under the regulations that out East Bay wasn't even behind the coastguard line. 
    And this was referred too in the testimony pretty much I think in passing at, did I say hearings on the Submerged Lands Act, if I did I was wrong. 
    It was referred to two Congresses earlier at hearings on previous bills. 
    Then, the matter was brought up again during the hearings before the interior committee of the senate on the bills that became the Submerged Lands Act. 
    And Senator Anderson cut-in and said, well, we've been all through that and we found that that line won't help us. 
    Well, that was the end of the discussion. 
    I added of course that a number of reasons it might not help but what happened was that it affected very little in the coast. 
    And it seems to me that it is most unlikely that Congress intended to give some official then the coastguard power to draw the lines that would be decisive for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act. 
    Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court. 
    The core of our position with respect to the coastguard line comes down to these three sentences. 
    First, that when Congress spoke of the coastline or inland waters in the Submerged Lands Act it used those terms with reference to international law and the territorial boundaries of the United States. 
    Second, that whatever may be said about the original purposes of the Act of 1895 or the meaning of the original instructions to the Commandant of the coastguard or the Secretary of the Treasury that he has not for years defined a line in terms of international law or the territorial boundaries of the United States. 
    And consequently, the Submerged Lands Act was talking about one thing, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commandant were talking about another thing, and that other thing is irrelevant for the purposes of this statute. 
    “Inland waters” isn't the word I might add that invariably must have one meaning. 
    Louisiana and the statute enacted in 1948 defined the term “inland waters” to cover only waters where the tide have been flowed and excluded all others from that. 
    We don't argue that's the meaning of inland waters for the purposes of Submerged Lands Act. 
    I simply show that this means that this term like others must be construed with reference to its context and what was intended to be done. 
    I move on therefore to the second part of the case to the areas behind the blue line which is Louisiana's outermost alternate plan and offshore of the red or pink which we concede to Louisiana. 
    Our position is that the status of those waters is to be determined by applying the Geneva Convention in a practical commonsense manner in accordance with its terms and that if something does not qualify as inland waters under the Convention that it is not inland waters for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act and that this is true of all our coast and therefore specifically true of the coast of Louisiana. 
    Now, in that connection I think it's worth looking at the Geneva Convention and calling attention to a few things in support of my proposition that it's intended to be universal and exclusive. 
    And since we omitted to print the full text that may be fairer to use, the text is printed by Louisiana which is in the appendix, the third volume of their briefs beginning at page 127. 
    I would call the Court's attention first to Article 3 on page 128. 
    Limits of the territorial sea, except as otherwise provided in these articles, the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low water line along the coast is marked on the large scale official chart. 
    So that unless one can bring himself within an exception elsewhere provided in these articles is low water -- is the coastline is the line along the coast, the low water line along the coast is marked on the large scale official chart. 
    I -- we're not this explicit that that is the line except is provided elsewhere in the articles. 
    Less any question arise, I should call attention to the word “normal” which it seems to us quite clear in this connection means the line according to rule, the line according to standard and not some word like “generally or ordinarily or usually.” 
    This is very clear from the history at one stage without attempting to quote exactly the predecessor of Article 3 did include words like “generally” and the word “normal” baseline was in the title. 
    Then for the specific and explained purpose of making it clear that there was no discretion except as provided in the Convention. 
    Those words “generally or usually” were strict and the explanation was given that the purpose of the Convention was to provide an exclusive uniform set of rules. 
    Alright, --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6802.625" stopTime="6809.382">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You say that word “normal” doesn't mean more or less the same thing that generally speaking would mean.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="6809.382" stopTime="6862.876">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Right. 
    I think it means according to standard, according to rule and I point out that this through many versions did not have normal in it. 
    The word “normal” was put in only by the drafting committee and only when it was decided to give up titles. 
    And for some reason it was put in that and I think it simply means the baseline according to rule. 
    It's in other words the drafting committee would've been authorized to make such a major exception. 
    Alright, now there are other articles that make it quite plain that the Convention was defining the territorial sea and contiguous zone in the coastline both inclusively and exclusively.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6862.876" stopTime="6874.603">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Before you lay that, your submission is that the word -- that in Article 3 would have the same meaning as it does have if the word “normal” were not there at all.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="6874.603" stopTime="6958.682">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Absolutely and I think the history shows that without any question. 
    The whole purpose of the Convention was to establish a uniform set of rules applicable to all nations. 
    Indeed, another incident that tends to show this Justice Stewart at one time there was an effort in the proprietary drafts to state what was international law and then new proposal separately, and it was decided that this should not be done because there wasn't enough agreement on what was international law, and that the only way to get rules eliminating everyone's discretion was to set them down in a treaty that everyone would adopt. 
    Another indication was pointed out this morning, this agreement, this treaty does not define the breadth of the territorial sea it leaves that to each nation. 
    And the draftsmen were very careful to avoid saying its three miles leaving anybody to claim more if he wanted to so as to leave the question what is the breadth of the territorial sea, of course, we have always taken the position that it's no more than three miles.

    Thanks very much.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="7377.329" stopTime="7536.248">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I was arguing that the exclusive rules must be found within the convention that it is to solve the terms of what is the coastline of the United States for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act. 
    I want to emphasize some of the implications of what I was saying so that can be no mistaken of. 
    First, I imply that arguments based on geological phenomena or economic uniqueness are irrelevant either in general or as applied to specific instances because the Convention that deals with one might call cartographic phenomena, the thing shown on the charts of merit and other considerations are irrelevant under it. 
    Second, I implied that the mere former theories of the United States with respect to international law, the rule as to bays or rule as to islands and so forth which we have from time to time advanced are no longer applicable because the matter has been frozen in the Convention and specifically Louisiana's arguments that under some rule espoused by the State Department at periods in our history before the Geneva Convention is simply irrelevant for the purposes of this case just as our theory with respect to Monterey Bay of the 10-mile bay that was held in the California case to be irrelevant because it was simply something that we had propounded prior at the time of the enactment of the Submerged Lands Act but was not embodied in the Convention. 
    Next, I specifically mean to imply the point I touched upon before that there is no basis for claiming straight baselines under Article 4 because neither the Congress nor the Executive Branch has ever promulgated straight baselines under Article 4. 
    Certainly, there has been none by the President or Department of State, the Commandant would hardly be the appropriate official but we don't --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="7536.248" stopTime="7537.855">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Has he done it?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="7537.855" stopTime="7563.669">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    But he has not done it we say and we say that for several reasons. 
    First, when he put out his lines he expressly said he was not claiming anything for territorial purposes. 
    So, we can't have been promulgating straight baseline under Article 4. 
    Second, the line --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="7563.669" stopTime="7568.834">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But whatever the purpose was has he outlined any straight line?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="7568.834" stopTime="7706.171">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, he drew the line three miles in shore, this yellow line, for the purposes of the finding the rules where the -- which rules of road should apply, yes. 
    He certainly did that. 
    His line even if he had attempted to draw it as a straight baseline under Article 4 would be invalid for two reasons. 
    And the first is no one can argue that this hard can impose as deeply indented or cut into or has a realm of islands along it within the language of Article 4 which limits the places where you can draw straight baseline. 
    Second, Article 4 limits the points between which you can draw a straight baseline and they don't include buoys, light ships and rangers bearing an underwater shows and things of that kind. 
    So that it's clear again that he couldn't have done it even if he was trying and of course what he did quite plainly wasn't that effort. 
    The fourth thing that I mean to imply by saying that the Convention applies in these leagues exclusive standard is that it is a very sharp limitation on or both historic bays and the evidence that will constitute in historic bay. 
    First, I want to emphasize that Section 6 of Article 7 applies only to historic bays. 
    It doesn't speak of other historic waters. 
    It's historic bays and one therefore must have something in the nature of the bay before this exception would possible imply. 
    But the kinds of evidence that will be sufficient to constitute on historic bay are very limited by --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="7706.171" stopTime="7729.614">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Excuse me Mr. Cox. 
    If you don't mind to interrupt that argument, it's a new one I know but I noticed that Section 6 of Article 4 says, the coastal state must clearly indicate straight baselines on charts to which due publicity must be given. 
    How is that to be read? 
    Does that mean if there is a line it must be stated by the state that it is a straight baseline?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="7729.614" stopTime="7736.813">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, I suppose that the state must assert, we are claiming this as our territory.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="7736.813" stopTime="7744.570">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Voice Overlap) Not that that we are claiming that -- we are drawing this line as a straight baseline?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="7744.570" stopTime="7817.959">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I would think that it was satisfied by saying we are drawing this line and claiming that all the waters behind it are our inland water. 
    But I think that it must make at least that the state that draws it is giving notice to all the world that it is claiming it as it waters and of course the state -- the coastguard has always indicated that we weren't claiming as our waters. 
    All that it is said is you should follow our inland rules asserted the limited purposes and not a claim I think it's our territorial sea. 
    Now, the other point I was going on to make was a that the kind of evidence that is necessary to show a bay to be in historic bay is limited to active assertions of jurisdiction doing something to somebody by the coastal state usually coupled with some kind of acquiescence by the others.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="7817.959" stopTime="7820.283">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    By coastal state you mean the nation?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="7820.283" stopTime="8029.214">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I mean in the international sense and indeed we argue that in a state in our sentence one of the 50 states is not sufficient, but I don't have to rest on that point here anymore than we had to rest on it from the California case. 
    Because the evidence that Louisiana invokes here for the purposes of claiming historic bays rather plainly fails to meet the test of anybody actively asserting jurisdiction. 
    Certainly, the advancing of abstract theories of international law that other nations didn't accept that we're not settled international law without ever applying them to particular areas cannot be regarded as the necessary kind of assertion of jurisdiction to constitute in historic bay. 
    Even more clearly, old maps like a commerce department map to which you were referred this morning which were drawn for limited purposes do not constitute an assertion of jurisdiction as against other states in the international sense. 
    Statutes in Louisiana purporting to regulate the taking of shrimp or oysters or natural resources, I and ostensibly applicable in these waters are not sufficient as the Court held in the California case because they do not involved an actual as enforcement of jurisdiction against a foreign nation. 
    Now, Louisiana -- the only specific things Louisiana refers to anywhere. 
    Our series of criminal prosecution under some of their natural resources laws, there are three answers to those points. 
    First, so far as we know all of those offenses under Louisiana law may well have been committed within the territorial sea, the three-mile strip within the bay. 
    Some of them, one can tell for the records, where within that three-mile strip. 
    Second, all of the defendants so far as the instances they gave us were concerned were residence of Louisiana and therefore presumably citizens of Louisiana and under this Court's decision in (Inaudible) and Florida, Louisiana has the power to regulate their conduct on the high seas just as much as anywhere else. 
    And the third point I mentioned earlier and that is that what one of our 50 states does in our view is irrelevant. 
    Now, against the background of those generalizations, I'd like to take what time I can on some of the specific areas that are in controversy. 
    We're talking now about material between blue lines and the pink or red and I start at the west edge of Louisiana --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="8029.214" stopTime="8053.512">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Incidentally, Mr. Cox, did Louisiana argue that at least to the extent that what is exercise of national sovereignty is involved here surely the drawing of the coastguard represents such -- wasn't that?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="8053.512" stopTime="8077.017">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, I think they did. 
    I would say that drawing of a line with the statement we are not exercising sovereignty, we are doing it for a limited purpose is not an acceptable assertion of jurisdiction because we're saying we're not asserting territorial jurisdiction over that.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="8077.017" stopTime="8085.305">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Although you yourself indicate I gather that even this assertion was questionable.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="8085.305" stopTime="8089.786">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I indicated that the question of whether we could enforce.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="8089.786" stopTime="8092.554">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So was an assertion of something I mean of some significance --
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="8092.554" stopTime="8128.369">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, of course we never did assert it and actually apply it and as a pronouncement we almost limit. 
    So that what it is, I insists or suggests isn't anything more that it purports to be of which was his statement? 
    We want and perhaps the statement we will require you to follow our inland rules. 
    Now, this was never challenged, there's been no violation that was tested in the Court so there was occasion in admiralty (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="8128.369" stopTime="8134.368">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, why wouldn't -- we will require you to follow, is that a self-assertion?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="8134.368" stopTime="8506.661">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, it's not if limited to the mere statement we will require you to follow and it was never applied to anyone. 
    I would think that was not an adequate assertion of jurisdiction because there's been no bringing it there. 
    Actually, so far as I can see the only error where this come into play that is that East Bay because that's the only thing that could be call it bay and that is why I don't mean a strict bay but a bay in loose sense and this area certainly can never be called a historic bay. 
    There's no bay about that and Article 7 paragraph 6 is limited to bay. 
    Alright, I was about to start at the west end of the coastline and take the segment which runs from Sabine Pass here to take their point which is on the coast about here. 
    You'll know that both that our line and Louisiana's line when it applies the Convention follows the coast except for these fingers reaching out, curiously they even reach out into the area that's already been adjudicated to be ours. 
    Those are the inland -- dredged channels to which Mr. Miller referred this morning and which Louisiana claims our part of her coast under the Convention. 
    These channels appeared down here at Sabine lake in Calcasieu Pass and that fresh water Bayou, but there are other points along the coast where such channels exist and consequently this is a recurrent problem and it seemed well to deal with it at the outset. 
    Now, first I must point out that Louisiana's statement on page 336 of the brief that the congressional history of the Submerged Lands Act clearly shows that both the Senate and House of Representatives considered dredged ship channels to be part of the inland waters of the United States is not accurate. 
    The facts are these, the history does show that at one stage the Senate Committee on interior and insular affairs considered and there was in the Bill a definition of inland waters which include all estuaries, ports, harbors, bays, channels, straights, historic bays, and sounds whether this included dredged channels or not is anyone's guess. 
    My guess would be that it use channels in the sense of the English Channel or some other body of water between an island and the mainland rather than something just leading out of perhaps 20 miles into the ocean but I can't say that I'm right but it certainly doesn't give I'm as right as they are. 
    The next thing that is clear is that this language was deliberately struck out of the Bill in an effort to leave the definition of inland waters entirely to Court. 
    So that no one can infer that there was any intention to include these errors and we come to consider the question therefore like all other questions in terms of the Geneva Convention. 
    The question turns on Article 3 and 8 of the Convention. 
    Article 3, we noted before except for where other was provided in these articles the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low water line along the coast. 
    Now, I ask you keeping that in mind the low water line along the coast to jump to Article 8 which begins at the very bottom of page 106 in the Louisiana appendix for the purpose of delimiting the territorial sea, the outermost permanent harbour works which form an integral part of the harbour system shall be regarded as forming part of the coast. 
    So that the question we have asked ourselves is whether a dredged channel leading out from a port is a part of the permanent harbour works within the meaning of Article 8. 
    We submit that such a channel even though marked by aids to navigation of buoys and some places, day beacons, lighthouses and alike is not part of the permanent harbour works that the term harbour works refers only to raise installations like piers and jetties and breakwaters which also a man-made are physical part of the coast. 
    I rest that conclusion on several things. 
    The first place I don't think just a matter of the ordinary use of words what would normally think of a dredged channel or a channel that's not been dredged that leads out from a part was covered by a river as part of the harbour works it seems to me an extraordinary use.

speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="8676.985" stopTime="8815.072">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I think you should say that an area of water is not to be assimilated under Article 7 to something that is spoken of as permanent harbour works performing part of the coast because the coast means in the convention and in usage in this area something above water if the notion was to make these water areas part of the inland waters. 
    The place to have dealt with that was in the sections on bays or inland waters, the most likely place to have dealt with it would be in the area of roadsteads because there the Convention, this is in the Article 9. 
    There, the Convention was dealing with areas of water of the coast in the sense there's something above the land. 
    And the Convention said that while we will make this part of the territorial sea, they didn't even make some inland waters. 
    We make them part of the territorial sea even though they lie more than three miles of shore and it seems to me that if there had been any intention to treat these areas of water with their lighthouses, towers, the distant points along them as belonging somehow to the literal state that that was the place to have done it. 
    Now, there was a proposal to make buoyed channels, didn't say anything about whether they were dredged or not. 
    To make buoyed channels, I gave them the same status as roadsteads and the International Law Commission rejected that which we think while not conclusive points in the direction of a showing and confirming the inference that I would otherwise draw that these water areas were not assimilated to something that it is above water.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I thought the question was whether this was an outermost permanent harbor work forming an integral part of the harbour system?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="8822.213" stopTime="8869.762">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, but one finds Article 8 saying that that shall be regarded as forming part of the coast. 
    Now I suggest that treating it as part of the coast strongly suggest that the draftsman had in mind things above the water. 
    Otherwise, it would've been extra ordinary to say that something that is nothing but a water area shall be treated as if it were something out of what. 
    That doesn't seem to being an exceedingly odd way to come out and the history I refer to I suggest confirms it.

    But the structures along those dredged channels are anchored in the bottom line.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Some are buoys, some are tripods. 
    The water isn't very deep. 
    They're not connected to one another. 
    They're just like to many lights and fixed buoys or fixed lights along the New England coast.

    Every hundred yards there was a structure anchored in the bottom of the ocean, you would say that still wouldn't suffice unless they we're connected above the water?

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Unless they were somehow connected above the water.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Oh yes. 
    Well, it would be very hard for other -- for vessels of any size to get into that harbor I presumably there might still be a harbor. 
    There certainly would be inland waters up in this area.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, I think I would say they were built to give vessels of greater draft that could previously get in access to the harbor like other dredging.

    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I would say harbour system means fixed structures above the water. 
    I don't -- for one thing remember we're talking about something there can be a low water line on and you can't have a low water line out an area sticking way out here. 
    It's a physical impossibility.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I'd like to ask you Mr. Cox before you go on. 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="9013.832" stopTime="9086.683">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    I thought a great deal about that Justice Harlan and I'd like to divide my answer into several parts always directing myself I think to your question. 
    First, it's entirely clear to me that the initial issue or the effect of the coastguard line should be resolve by the Court now. 
    Second, there a very considerable number of other issues which can't be elucidated by any further factual evidence and I think those should be decided by the Court now. 
    Also, I recognized that it might be of some aid to the Court or to have an experience Master and expert Master go through them and we know them out. 
    But despite that, I am very sure they would all be back here with as long brief and much the same argument if we all live long enough that the Court would be here and they would be back far it.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="9086.683" stopTime="9089.712">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, you seem to have about 23 questions.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="9089.712" stopTime="9090.224">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Yes.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="9090.224" stopTime="9091.860">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You want us to cite all of them?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="9091.860" stopTime="9214.270">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well I -- the reason I was going to say as against the advantages of sending it to a Master from the Court's point of view in terms of the total administration of justice if this case went to a Master with nothing decided with the coastguard line, no one would know what evidence to put in and what evidence not to put in, and the result of course would be everybody would dump in all the evidence that he could find and I think the total effect would be a worst morass and that the Court would have it all back in. 
    Now, the last part of my answer, Mr. Justice Harlan, is that there are some points that the argument where there appeared to be some questions of fact. 
    I don't think those are real questions put on the face of the briefs they seem to be here. 
    I do think that if the Court were to do the work of resolving the questions of law now that it would turn out that there were no significant factual differences among it. 
    So, on the whole, by urging, my recommendation is that the Court must face a large number I think all of these questions but I don't want to pretend that isn't the difficult matter of balance. 
    What I do want to urge very strongly is that authorities be given -- will be given all the guidance and that the Master be given if the Court decides to send it to Master. 
    All the guidance it can that is I think the question I've been talking about is one that can be resolve here. 
    I don't think this and many of the other questions can be resolve here if there remain some others then at least we can get part of the money distributed but we could focus on specific issues in the subsequent proceeding. 
    And I think it would be more efficient way to administer justice.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, Mr. Cox if I felt comfortable that there were no issue of fact that's been post between you and Mr. Miller with respect to the dredged channels and few more comfortable about your last observations and perhaps after we read the record (Voice Overlap) the transcript of argument, consider the briefs more thoroughly than (Voice Overlap) conclusion but I did not get that impression in the course of argument.

    Justice Byron R. White

    Do I understand it correctly that those red areas that was support -- are those red areas are more than three miles from the coastline some other?

    No.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="9269.764" stopTime="9271.110">

    And as you interpret the coastline (Voice Overlap)?

    As we interpret the coastline.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="9272.585" stopTime="9276.904">

    Is that true of that little red area in East Bay?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="9276.904" stopTime="9298.922">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Yes. 
    Let's look at this maybe we can see it better on the smaller one. 
    The reason is that remember when you draw the coastline, you swing a three-mile arc dot it from any low tide elevation.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="9298.922" stopTime="9301.519">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And any island?
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="9301.519" stopTime="9311.597">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Yes but it's not so much the islands here as it is low tide elevations within three miles of the (Voice Overlap).
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="9311.597" stopTime="9317.747">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the United States sticks with its concession on the east there on those, that string of islands going up.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="9317.747" stopTime="9325.262">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Yes. 
    I don't know whether I'm trespassing too much. 
    We do stick with it as we don't claim this.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="9325.262" stopTime="9334.650">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But that's another -- that would be another I suppose assertion by the United States beyond three miles.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="9334.650" stopTime="9336.641">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Well, at one time.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="9336.641" stopTime="9338.914">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In terms of the Geneva Convention.
speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="9338.914" stopTime="9457.072">
    Mr. Archibald Cox 
    Alright, at one time the State Department was asserted that a realm of islands within perhaps six miles or later perhaps 10 miles of each other an area like this did enclose inland waters. 
    This was the position that the United States in 1953. 
    Until the decision in the California case the view of the Government was that we should apply the position of the State Department in 1953. 
    So, we find it here. 
    Now, we'd learned two things later. 
    First, that that wasn't the international law but it was our claim that it wasn't the international law; and second, that we weren't governed by the position of the United States in 1953 but by the Geneva Convention as the Court held in the California case. 
    Other result was that there was nothing more than that we would've apply the Geneva Conventions but a lot of things can happen. 
    We had said the opposite to this Court and the Court relied on it. 
    We had -- there had been leasing and people had relied on it and we repeatedly doubt with Louisiana in this term and it seem to me that it was not suitable becoming for the United States having gone that far to suddenly say well we made a mistake, we're sorry we led you all into this but we insist now and backing out. 
    So, we think it's a purely practical matter while we did it, we're stuck with it and we ought to live by it. 
    And it's on that basis and no rule of international law --

    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    May it please the Court. 
    In the short time left to me, I'd like to point out to Your Honors that Mr. Cox is in error about East Bay, the navigation laws that the United States published in 1940 shows precisely that East Bay was considered inland waters of the United States at the time of its publication as you'll see on page 418. 
    He is in error also --

    It describes the lines just as there had been described before. 
    It isn't a chart, it is a book.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes.
speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="9527.218" stopTime="9645.069">
    Mr. J. B. Miller 
    But it is there. 
    He is in error in our opinion in his reference to the Annapolis which I think is so important in relation to Justice White's question because there, the brief said precisely that their right to regulate foreign vessels was limited to their own jurisdiction so to our inland waters. 
    We think it is perfectly clear that Justice Stewart raised a proper point with reference to the word “normal” in the Geneva Convention. 
    It couldn't have been put there meaninglessly by all the people who went to that Convention when the word “normal” indicates that if an abnormal situation exists a different treatment is to be accorded. 
    One final word, the State Department may have the right for our Government to act in determining whether our boundary is three miles, three leagues or a greater number of leagues from our coast. 
    But the Congress confined it to the Secretary of the Treasury not to the State Department the right the duty to mark the outer limit of inland waters and he did so. 
    And he did so by these lines which have been on published charts for years. 
    And when I asked the Commandant of the coastguard last year when he proposed the change of it if any, any foreign government, any foreign vessel, anyone else had ever protested that line, he said if there is such a protest we will advice you and none such has been given. 
    We say --

    Yes, sir and there have been large charts which showed all of these lines starting back from 1895. 
    This much of the line has been on the chart only since 1953 but the lines marking the points marking it had been there for many years designated and defined by the same federal authority.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is it your argument that you are -- those charts fall within the requirements of Article 3 that says along the coast as marked on large scale charts officially recognized by the coastal (Voice Overlap)?
