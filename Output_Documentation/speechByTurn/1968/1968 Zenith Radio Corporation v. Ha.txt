    Number 49, Zenith Radio Corporation, petitioner, versus Hazeltine Research, Inc., et al. 
    Mr. McConnell.
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="34.852" stopTime="136.911">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    I represent the Zenith Radio Corporation which is the petitioner in this case. 
    Respondents are the Hazeltine Research, Inc., a corporation which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hazeltine Corporation. 
    And, it was stipulated by the parties in this case in a pretrial stipulation that, for all purposes in this lawsuit and all purposes in the instant case, that the two corporations should be considered one and the same. 
    The instant suit was brought for the alleged infringement of a patent, a monochrome patent alleged to have been infringed by the Zenith Corporation. 
    And, both the District Court and the Court below, the Court of Appeals held that that patent was invalid and not infringed.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. McConnell, I'm sorry but you -- there is an issue that's submitted to us, isn't there, as to whether both Hazeltine Corporations are bound here or whether it's just a subsidiary and not the parent?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="151.983" stopTime="152.349">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    That's right, Your Honor.

    Is there a difference on that?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="153.233" stopTime="155.551">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    I'm going to reach that in the course of my argument.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="155.551" stopTime="161.283">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's why I didn't really understand why you made your opening statement because there is that issue.
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="161.283" stopTime="1158.542">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    There is that issue, Your Honor. 
    I simply made a statement because -- as part of the facts in the case that there was that pretrial stipulation and I'm treating, for this portion of the argument, the two corporations as the same. 
    In that suit, Zenith answered by setting up a patent and other patents of Hazeltine have been misused by putting them into foreign patent pools, which foreign patent pools had refused to license imports and had restricted commerce between United States and foreign countries, namely Canada, England, and Australia, contrary to the provisions of the antitrust law, the federal antitrust law that any restriction or any combination, conspiracy, or arrangement between competitors which restrain commerce not only between the states of the United States but between the comp -- the country of the United States and foreign countries, violated Section 4 of the Clayton Act, Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. 
    And, under those two sections, also Section 16 of the Clayton Act, alleging the same facts as we'd set up in the misused answer we filed in counterclaim and, in that counterclaim, asked for travel damages and asked for an injunction against the activities of these foreign patent tools. 
    After a trial and findings of fact in detail made by the District Court, a judgment was entered on April 5, 1965 pursuant to Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for damages which have been occasioned by the plaintiff or by the counterclaim in the amount of $19,042,173 for the loss of sales and profits in the Canadian market in the sale of home receiving sets in television and radio. 
    At the time the findings came down, Hazeltine obtained new counsel and came in and made various motions which are discussed in the briefs, purport of which was to reopen the case on evidence which was available at the time of the trial and for further proceedings on the claim that there were embargoes imposed by the government as opposed to private patent pools and conspiracies in England and Australia. 
    And, for that limited purpose, the case was reopened and after further hearing, on December 13, 1965, the Trial Court awarded petitioner trouble damages in the amount of $15,919,458 for loss of sales and profits in England and Australia during the damage period. 
    In the first judgment, an injunction was added against the continuance by the respondent companies and these pools for putting their patents in the pools or in any way furthering the activities of these pools, and this is important. 
    No supercedias was ever foiled to that judgment, even though there was an appeal, and since that first judgment was entered on April 15, 19 -- or April 5, 1965, Zenith has been operating under the protection of the injunction of the United States District Court in their activities in Kent. 
    On appeal or in entering the last judgment after the Trial Court had heard all the evidence that was produced on the original trial press, all of the different matters which were urged and argued in a three or four-day hearing on the motions to reopen the case and after hearing everything that was submitted in the case, Trial Court made this comment, "there could be no question in my mind that Zenith suffered damages during the damage period by a virtue of the pools which I have found and, reiterate, existed at the time of the damage period." 
    The Court of Appeals reversed both the judgments on the ground that there is no substantial evidence in this record that Zenith was injured by the activities of these pools in its business or property, and held as a matter of law that, on this record, Zenith was not even threatened with injury by the activities of these pools. 
    Now, the proof of injury to Zenith's business in Canada was, in a large part, documentary and I'm going into it in some detail in the course of this argument, and was not denied by any single witness or document in this case. 
    So, It is my submission to this Court that what is presented is whether on admitted facts, which we claim in the District Court, found was unequivocal in its proof of actual substantial damage to the Zenith Corporation, whether under those admitted facts, as a matter of law, the federal antitrust laws, namely 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, do not reach and have no sanction which will stop that country. 
    Now, before going to the individual markets, I want to -- if the Court will bear with me, I want to take just a few minutes to give some of the background of this conspiracy. 
    And, this Court in 1962 and in subsequent cases has held, namely in the Continental Ore case, that conspiracies which are designed to control a complete market and which are put together by competitors to exclude competition permanent should not be judged by taking particular parts of the proofs and examining them and passing on to something else, but that the proof should be looked at as a whole and, in the Continental Ore case, that it was highly relevant to go back and look at the proofs at the inception of the conspiracy and the proofs out of which the conspiracy was created to show its intendment, its purpose, its effect, and its result. 
    Now, I've been in this litigation with these pools on behalf of Zenith since 1953 and I'm not going to refer any of my own personal knowledge. 
    Everything I'm going to tell this Court with reference to the beginning is in this record. 
    And, may I say at the threshold of this case, the documentary evidence in this case came in by a pretrial stipulation without any objection that documents as to their varied, all admitted, no objection to them whatever, no contravening evidence of any kind, and some of it and most of it and the part I'm now going to talk about, put in by my opponents in the Trial Court. 
    From 1919 until 1935, through some-50 cross licensing agreements, the leading electronic companies of the world divided up the markets of the world, I'm leaving out the Iron Curtain countries. 
    I'm talking now about the free world countries where competition is possible. 
    Among those companies were the telephone companies: the Westinghouse Company, RCA, General Electric Company, English Electric Company, the Telefunken Company, the General Electric Company of Germany, GTS, the French Company, Standard Cables and Wireless, the Australian Company, and the Philips Company of Harland which we find everywhere which is the largest electronics company and probably the largest aggregation of capital and business in the entire world. 
    Now, all of these companies shoulder-to-shoulder and by cross licensing agreement divided the free world up into markets and part of that was the North American Continent which was assigned to the so-called radio group. 
    And, the radio group was composed of the telephone company, that's American telephone and telegraph company, General Electric, RCA, the Westinghouse Company, and the Philips Company. 
    Zenith came into conflict and confrontation with this worldwide conspiracy when, in 1933, RCA with 10,000 patents in the pool which was composed of patents contributed by all the companies that I have now mentioned, some-10,000 of them, asserted them against Zenith and demanded that we take a license. 
    And, we took the position and said so in our pleadings which are in this case that the whole industry in the United States had paid tribute to this pool for years and $1,300,000.00 or so have been paid in tribute to the pool, that the pools were illegal and we filed a suit in the United States District Court down in Delaware asking for a determination that the pools were illegal, and the case was before Judge Leigh, now dead. 
    Immediately, the pool countered with 63 patent suits against us in that proceeding. 
    Parenthetically, we got the trial and one of them, it took 18 months to try it. 
    If we tried them all, there wouldn't have been a lawyer left alive who'd ever had any connection with the case. 
    They countered out of that suit by suing Zenith in the United States District Court in Chicago on two patents: the telephone company, RCA and General Electric. 
    And, in that suit, Zenith counterclaimed and set up a suit for trouble damages claiming that they had been excluded from the market in Canada and couldn't sell their goods there because of the pool which was part of the overall conspiracy, the pool known as Canadian Radio Patents Limited. 
    That suit got down to trial that they go to trial on September 9, 1957. 
    The Sunday before it went to trial, the parties settled the case by paying Zenith $10 million, giving Zenith the patent rights inventing these black and white monochrome patents in all markets and in the -- and, the suit down at Delaware was dismissed upon there and, in effect, dedicate the patents, 10,000 of them, to the train. 
    Now, I brought that in for a purpose because Zenith is represented here as, in some way, taking advantage of the antitrust laws when, I submit, on the entire record, they have done very constructive service under the antitrust laws, and they free the entire American market so that, from that time on, and the relevance of this is on the damage proof that from that time on, we had a free market in United States. 
    And, with a free market, Zenith came from a little small company hardly known to the leading company in television and, I think, the second or third producer in the United States in radio.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, is there any issue as to the effect of the release that Zenith executed in this litigation that was settled that has a bearing on the present problem or are you agreeing that what the release operated to benefit Hazeltine? 
    Let me put to you this way. 
    Hazeltine was not a party to the litigation that you've just described which was settled, was it?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="1194.755" stopTime="1195.824">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    No.

    But, various companies who were members of the Canadian radio patent pool were parties.

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Well, I --

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    I haven't been frank with Your Honor entirely. 
    I believe that Hazeltine was named, if not in the pleading, certainly in the proofs as a co-conspirator.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1216.686" stopTime="1251.718">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright, well -- but, however it may be, as part of the settlement of that litigation, as I understand the papers before us, Zenith executed a release and that release, in substance, exonerated or relieved of the defendants, with whom Zenith settled, of liability for any past acts -- of any further liability to Zenith for any past acts. 
    Is that right?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="1251.718" stopTime="1263.151">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    No. 
    There is no such evidence in this record. 
    There is no release in this record. 
    There is some settlement papers in this record put in by my opponents, not me.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1263.151" stopTime="1292.928">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I -- one important issue here or if it is an issue is whether you do or do not, whether there is or is not agreement that that settlement operated to benefit Hazeltine as a -- as a joint tort visa or whether it did not, are you agreeing on that or is that an issue in dispute before this Court? 
    That's my question.
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="1292.928" stopTime="1343.068">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    There is an issue in dispute on that, first, as to the fact. 
    I don't agree that any release ever released Hazeltine. 
    Definitely, I do not. 
    Secondly, no release was ever pleaded in this case and no release was ever mentioned in this case until one year after the case had been tried, at which time, they came in with an offer of proof of a release. 
    Now, we cited cases in our brief that under Rule 8, I believe, and 15, affirmative defenses have to be pleaded in a case so the party opposed can meet them. 
    And, no such plea was made. 
    The case wasn't tried on any release theory.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. McConnell, you've got a very elaborate job and I -- here, and I don't want to interfere with you in this elaborate case, but I -- all I want to know is whether we do or do not have to worry about the effect of the release. 
    And, from what you tell me, I gather that we do.

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    During the trial or so close to it that the parties are there trying their lawsuit. 
    It's waived, and the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit has handed down three cases that says even a Court can't relieve them of the waiver. 
    There's nothing that can be done. 
    They've waived it, and the reason for it is we try our lawsuit on the pleadings and we go in there. 
    They put this settlement in to show that the two cases were different. 
    That's what they said. 
    They told the Court, why is it a different case? 
    That's the funniest plea of release I ever heard, and there was never any plea of release and there was never any evidence offered on it, and no Court ever opened it up either in the District Court or in the Court below to permit such a defense to be made. 
    And, I say the issue is not before this Court.

    Not in this respect and for a reason.

    No, the Court of Appeals said nothing about the release. 
    Alright, so much for the background in this case, I do want to say, however, that there is an anomaly from what I have said already, in that, some of the leading lawyers in this country: Whitney Norcimo or -- who's later President of the Bar Asso -- the American Bar Association and John K. Hill, leading lawyer in there, advised their clients to pay $10 million for damages suffered by Zenith up until 1957 and this lower Court now holds, as a matter of law, that sort of a conspiracy couldn't cause any damage whatever.

    As to the sufficiency of the evidence to support or show you have damage.
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="1591.111" stopTime="1790.013">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Right. 
    That's all the Court dealt with the parent, assume tacitly, I believe it had to, to reach this point. 
    And, the government has filed a brief here. 
    I mean, there really isn't any question really about the illegality of these pools under the decisions of this Court. 
    Alright, I first want to address myself to the Canadian market. 
    Were we damaged? 
    Was there substantial evidence of damage in the Canadian market? 
    In 1926, there was, put together up in Canada, Canadian Radios Patent Limited and it was composed of our competitors, people who sold radio and television sets in competition with us here and in Canada, if we ever got into the market. 
    I have never seen a case, and I'm sure this Court hasn't either, where the evidence of the conspiracy is written down sponsored and put in evidence by the respondents. 
    Usually, the conspiracy case we have to try is a case where he went for a conspiracy from a number of different acts. 
    And, this Court held in -- a long time ago in the Interstate Circuit case that the old days of proving conspiracy by having people gathered around the table had gone to a darker age. 
    Now, we prove conspiracies, particularly business conspiracies, by showing a plan which it is designed to destroy or interfere with competition and a joiner in it would not of its intent or purport. 
    That's what you have to prove, but we have nothing in the way of inference in that sort of proof. 
    But, to understand the impact on the damage issue, this Court has to see what this conspiracy was designed to do, namely to control a complete market, pursuant to an overall conspiracy to control all the markets of the world. 
    Plaintiff's exhibit 50 (a), which was put into evidence by my opponents, I didn't put it in. 
    They put it. 
    It was a report by the Royal Canadian Commission. 
    On a submission made by Canadian Radio Patents Limited where somebody up their distributor had complained that they were keeping him from importing sets into Canada, and they heard all the evidence and they issued a report and I want to read some of it, if the Court would bear with me. 
    This is the whole conspiracy so far as Canada is concerned.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What was the report? 
    Who made it?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    From what are you reading, Mr. --
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="1811.031" stopTime="2064.387">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    I am reading from plaintiff's exhibit 50 (a) which is found in the record at appendix 2811 and 2829-30. 
    Canadian Radio Patents Limited, hereafter called CRPL, was incorporated in 1926 for the purpose of acting as a patent licensing agency. 
    At the time of the presentation of its brief to this commission, it acted as a central patent licensing agency in the administration of patent rights in the radio, television, and general electronics steels in respect to patents owned by its then five shareholders: Canadian General Electric Company, Canadian Westinghouse Company, Northern Electric Company. 
    And, if I may interpolate it, Northern Electric Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Canadian-marked Coating Company which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the English-Canadian mark -- English-marked Tony Company. 
    And, Canadian Radio Manufacturing Company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Philips Company of Harland, enacted as licensing agent in Canada for RCA Victor Company and Hazeltine Electronics Corporation, the respondent in this case. 
    The portfolio in respect of which CRPL had the right to grant licenses consisted of 5,000 patents and, in the absence of a license from CRPL, it is doubtful if anyone could sell in Canada a radio or television receiver. 
    CRPL indicated that it does not grant a license to any importer of radio or television receivers except in the limited situation where the type or kind of radio or television receiver sought to be imported is not manufactured by any radio or television receiver manufacturer in town. 
    It is particularly in respect to this policy of CRPL in precluding importers from bringing into Canada radio and television receivers that the complaint was made to this commission. 
    It was stated to be the policy of CRPL to enforce its patent right against any person who sells in Canada an imported radio or television receiver which infringes any one or more of a patent in its portfolio. 
    Now, how did they enforce it? 
    And, the record is clear on it. 
    There isn't any denial. 
    They had patent agents and investigators, and they went around and they're shock to see if there are any imported radio sets. 
    If there were, they'd turn them in to the pool and the pool, then, started suits and most of the suits, according to the documentary evidence coming from the files of the pool, ended in an agreement by the distributer, never to handle a set again that was imported into Canada. 
    And, our res -- and, our distributers had to enter into such agreement, and we have a family name of Cosby. 
    Documents are in the case. 
    He had to agree that he wouldn't handle it unless it was licensed and the only way it could be licensed, and we have our answers replete with demands by Zenith to get licenses and they couldn't get licenses and, while it's said that we didn't formally asked for a license after 1953, we had a lawsuit that ran through 1957 which was designed to break up this illegal restriction on licensing and, and we did get --

    And, the District Court made a specific finding that there was nothing in the Canadian patent law which justified any such cite of a proceeding, and even if there has been and they could do it with their individual patents, it's elementary that when they join in a conspiracy with our competitors to use this as to stop our competition, and I'm going to get into that in a minute --

    The view of the other side took wise that under Canadian patent law, they had to restrict licenses for import, otherwise, they encourage different sanctions on their patent rights. 
    That was their contention. 
    Now, we tried it out on expert testimony and we had Canadian experts come down here, and there was not one single thing to it. 
    It was a complete sham from top to bottom, and the District Court so held.

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Yes. 
    Alright, as I say, they sent out these investigators to scatter out imports and then bring suits or write letters. 
    The record shows from their records there wasn't any denial to any of this. 
    Nobody from the pool ever got on the stand on any issue in this case. 
    Worrying notices were widely published in newspapers. 
    The pool boast newspapers from coast to coast carry the commandos total of 4,343,084 advertising messages to help put a stop to importation of cheap substandard imported radio blanketed at the Customs. 
    They were our potential customers in Canada. 
    Then, they sent out a warning note and they sent one out just shortly before the suit started, and this was addressed to importers, vendors, or users of radio and television receivers. 
    That's all people we could possibly sell to: an importer, a vendor, or a user. 
    That's our entire market. 
    Now, here's an inducement to boycott our product in the entire country of Canada. 
    We wish to bring to your attention that Canadian Radio Patents Limited is a central patent licensing agency administering various important Canadian patents of invention relating to radio and television receivers, and then they listed their licensee. 
    Of course, we weren't licensed. 
    So, we weren't licensed. 
    So, we weren't listed. 
    And then, they say "the above companies our working the patented inventions in Canada on a commercial scale and are preparing and willing to meet the public demand for the patented articles in Canada on agreeable terms." 
    Now, here is the threat. 
    "Canadian Radio Patents desires to inform importers, vendors, purchasers, or users of radio and television receivers which infringe patent rights owned or administered by Canadian Radio Patents Limited and are listed above that they will be held liable to Canadian Radio Patents Limited on account of said infringement." 
    Then, they sent out notices "only Canadian made Canadian sold sets are licensed under the basic patents of Canadian Radio Patents Limited." 
    My opponents in the Trial Court, in attempt to sustain the issue that Mr. Justice Black referred to, that there was some law up there in Canada which would justify this sort of comeback. 
    Put a man on a stand by the name of Gordon Fripp Henderson who was a member of a firm that had represented this pool for years and years and years. 
    But just a minute, before I get into that, Hazeltine put its patents in this pool in 1943 without -- with extensions up until 1963, past the damage period. 
    I don't know what's happened since because we have no proofs. 
    They say, now, they're not in it because they've been enjoined. 
    They say they filed an affidavit where they've done something about it, but there is no injunction now, which has never been superseded, to get out of the pool. 
    And, they're pleading here that because they're now obeying a Court injunction that that in some way absolves him from getting into this pool. 
    But, anyway, they got into the pool --

    Where was it? 
    What Court?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="2493.598" stopTime="2897.617">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    United States District Court in Chicago, entered by Judge Austin, I -- right after he made his little speech about the patent law where he finally weakened and, unwindless, admitted that there was nothing in the law that justified their position and retracted his whole position. 
    We went into the cross-examination of this witness, who was the attorney for the pool and who'd made the submission by the pool to the Canadian -- a Royal Canadian Commission, thoroughly familiar with all of it, worked for him for years, and years, and years. 
    I crossed examined him and I want to read some of his cross-examination because it shows the impact of this conspiracy and what it was intended for, what it was intended to do, and what had actually did do within this damage period, in which the Court of Appeals says, as a matter of law, can't under our antitrust laws constituted damage. 
    He said "my law firm presented the submissions on behalf of Canadian Radio Patents Limited and it certainly sought to say that Canadian Radio Patents Limited was not doing anything illegal." 
    He said that part was submitted on December 31, 1959, that's within our damage period. 
    Question: "Now, you told us this morning that you knew what the policy, the licensing policy of Canadian Radio Patents Limited was and then, as I understand you to state it, the policy was not to license import where there was manufacturing in Canada." 
    Answer: "That is correct." 
    Question: "Now, imports that came in within the electronics field would represent competition to the owners of this pool, would it not?" 
    Answer: "Certainly." 
    Question: "No question about it is there?" 
    Answer: "I would've thought not." 
    Question: "The portfolio in respect to which CRPL had the right to grant licenses consisted of 5,000 patents and, in the absence of a license from CRPL, it is doubtful if anyone can sell in Canada a radio or television receiver. 
    Was that considered?" 
    Answer: "Of course they considered it. 
    They wrote it. 
    They considered that aspect of the matter and they referred to it in the report." 
    And I said, "well, do you consider that a company like Zenith Radio exporting into Canada is competition for the members of the pool?" 
    "Well, I didn't get any answer to that. 
    So, I asked him another question. 
    "And that would include Zenith Radio Corporation, wouldn't it?" 
    Answer: "It would include anyone at that time who sought to sell in Canada radio receiving sets." 
    "And, you have told us that if Zenith is a competitor and if it doesn't manufacture, if there are manufacturers in Canada, then this pool will not license Zenith to import anything into Canada. 
    Isn't that right?" 
    Answer: "They will not license." 
    "The importation into Canada, in respect of the type and kind of television set or radio set that is being made in Canada, that is correct, and this includes home radio and television sets." 
    Question: "The report says it was stated to be the policy of CRPL to enforce its patent right against any person who sells in Canada an imported radio or television receiver which infringes any one or more of the patents in this portfolio, except in the limited area where permission has been granted to import the apparatus which CRPL agrees is not of a type or kind made in this country. 
    Is that what they arrived at?" 
    Answer: "It so states, the report so states." 
    "And, that was CRPL's statement, wasn't it?" 
    Answer: "That is CRPL that made the submission. 
    "That made the submission that that is what they were doing?" 
    "Now, under that, Zenith couldn't get a license to import at all unless they manufacture up there, could they? 
    I am talking about seeking to import something that is competitive with the members of the pool." 
    Answer: "And something that is being made in Canada?" 
    "Yes, by the pool." 
    Answer: "Then, their stated policy is that they would not grant a license to import." 
    They're competitors. 
    They're joint shoulder-to-shoulder with a great mass of patents. 
    Whether they're valid or not, they could keep the litigation forever and ever in forcing those patents. 
    And, by the way, the District Court found that the instant suit, which was brought in a Hazeltine patent which was in the pool, was brought pursuant to the pool. 
    Hazeltine came into this pool in 1943. 
    The record shows that they volunteered their patents to be used in litigation against importers, documentary evidence. 
    The record shows that they were in these pools by their own admission knowing that the purpose of the pool was to exclude importation. 
    No question about it, admitted by their general counsel on his cross-examination and upon his deposition. 
    And, they said they were in the pool, the Canadian pool, and they intended -- right in the trial they said they were in the pool and they intended to stay in that pool, flaunted their participation in the pool, and they said the reason for it was to get more bucks for Hazeltine. 
    Well, I suppose every illegal activity from the beginning of time down to date has had something about getting more bucks or more money out of the illegal activity, and that, certainly, is no justification with all due deference.

    The Court held the proofs established as a fact that, in the circumstances of this case, the Canadian Patent Act does not require the pool to refuse to license importation that's contended by plaintiff, nor does the Act penalize in any way a patentee who license for importation whereas, in this case, there's been carried on extensive manufacturing in Canada under its patents rules squarely.

    There was a time -- this is digression. 
    There was a time when Canada restricted imports under the patent law. 
    Then, they had a commerce of the different countries of patent companies, and they all recognize that they all had mutual interest in breaking down these patent restrictions, which is restrained trade between different countries. 
    So, they changed it and they said, under the Congress -- wasn't it Congress? 
    Congress at 24? 
    Well, anyway, there was a Congress that's in the record that, under that Congress, no country who wanted to stay at the time could put any restriction on patents or upon the import of goods which were patented.

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Exactly right. 
    So, we start to go into Canada and Mr. Wright testified, and no denial of his testimony, no witness got up on the witness stand. 
    And, they say we ought to brought some distributers in, but here's something I want to bring out before I get into this. 
    There was a conspiracy within a conspiracy. 
    They had distributor's organizations up in Canada which were cooperating hand-in-glove with this pool, and they comprised the people you have to deal with. 
    When you sell sets, you have to go to distributors. 
    And, the court below criticizes us because we didn't bring in distributors. 
    The distributors were all banning against us, and the record shows, by documentary evidence of their minutes, where they're trying to cooperate with the pool and say "tell us what we can do. 
    Tell us what we can do to help you and stop the import of American products into Canada." 
    They were all in it. 
    So, when we go up there, Mr. Wright testified and there's no denial of its testimony, and they tried to impugn its testimony and I've seen some funny things in lawsuits but never in my life have I seen witnesses attempted to be impugned by documents which are not in the evidence, which were never even presented until a year after the case had been tried where no ef -- no chance has ever been made to meet any of the documents which they claim impeach Mr. Wright's testimony. 
    In other words, ordinarily, cases are tried on a record made in the Trial Court and, here, they come in with pages of offers of proof with new counsel, trying to get a new grasp of the case a year after it's been tried and the Trial Court said that that -- these things all were available at the trial. 
    Why weren't they produced? 
    No excuse given.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3323.915" stopTime="3325.657">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Findings had been made then?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="3325.657" stopTime="3373.604">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Yes, the findings had all been made. 
    The case had been put to bed and a year had gone, and they come in with new counsel with this new attempt to try the case all over again, and the District Court wouldn't do it and rightly sought the matter of discretion with the District Court whether to reopen the case. 
    And, the new evidence rule is conclusive on all the sellers, whatever it was, was available at the time of the trial and never produced until a year after the trial. 
    And then, it's largely counsel's statements and what they would do and what they wouldn't. 
    I mean, ordinary cases are tried on the records made at the trial. 
    This is an exception, apparently.

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Yes, I am.

    And, the fact of damage, the way the Courts have been construing it, and I say that was always done, but the fact of damage is the foundation and you start from there with the proof of the actual damage. 
    What was the fact of damage? 
    The fact of damage, number one, we didn't have any licenses on pool patents. 
    Number two, everybody in that trade for years, since 1926 at least, had been conditioned to the fact that, without a pool license, anybody who handle sets was subject to suit, was subject to harassment, was subject to letters being sent out to the potential customers, not only of ours but of the distributors themselves, the user. 
    They were published in the trade papers. 
    They were published in the press.

speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="3547.645" stopTime="3799.957">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    After the 1957 settlement, as I said this morning, the Zenith Company undertook to go into the Canadian market with their radio and television sets. 
    Now, here are two contiguous markets, Canada and United States, fighting alongside each other so far as the boring areas are concerned, Canadian listeners can pick up broadcast from television and radio along the border of American stations. 
    There's no difference in the sets. 
    They had the same lines. 
    They had the same cycles. 
    Testimony was that the two products -- of the two products, that the American product was far superior than to the Canadian product, that the contiguous markets had essentially the same competition, although there was more competition in the United States market than there was in United States. 
    Mr. Wright testified that he went up there and tried to establish distribution in that market. 
    There was a ready demand for a product, survey had shown that, and he couldn't find distributors. 
    Distributors, as I pointed out this morning, were in these associations. 
    We have the minutes of some of their meetings tied up with the pool. 
    He couldn't get distributors for the reason that they had been conditioned like Pablo's dog for years and years to the sounding of the gong of the Canadian Radio Patents, the threat the constant inherent threat against everybody in the trade with the warning notices, with the investigations, with the lawsuits, and that was the market. 
    And, the pool was there, still in existence, run by a General Electric even though the government had started the suit against them and had gotten a consent decree whereby three of the conspiring companies had agreed to license their sets without importation which, by the way, negative any thought that there was anything in Canadian law that would prevent them from licensing for importation, but permitted the General Electric Company to continue to run that pool and General, I think, continued to run the pool with a permitted organization, managers, investigators, and what have you. 
    So, Mr. Wright testified that he couldn't get distribution, the kind of distribution to which a product of Zenith was entitled to in a market. 
    And, the reason he couldn't get it was because of the threats of the pool against the potential distributors which he tried to get. 
    He said he could get some distribution in the western provinces where there are very sparse settlements out there and some in the maritime province. 
    But, along the contiguous territories, he couldn't get them. 
    So, he had to use the hearing aid distributor. 
    We had a hearing aid distributor. 
    That's another product of Zenith. 
    We had a Canadian Zenith which distributed hearing aids and he used them to try and build up some distribution.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3799.957" stopTime="3811.531">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, in that period of time, Mr. McConnell, were you handicapped by the lack of licenses under any patents for importation into Canada --

    Yes.

    We didn't have them, and I'm coming to that in just --

    I thought -- what is the damage period? 
    When did it begin, 1959 in May?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="3836.425" stopTime="3838.717">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    1959-1963, May of 1959 --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3838.717" stopTime="3843.259">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    May of 1959 to May of 1963, that's right.
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="3843.259" stopTime="3971.754">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    So, he couldn't get distributors so he had to use his hearing aid distributors. 
    And, even under that impediment, he was able to sell some sets by 5% of the market, the proof show, as against 20% which Zenith was selling in the United States. 
    Where 90 more had gotten on their way up there then a man by the name of Bryan McConnell, no relation to mine, he ran the pool. 
    He was an employee of General Electric. 
    He ran the pool and he came to Mr. Kellee Arts, manager of our hearing aid company, and he said "what are you doing here? 
    Are you going to manufacture in Canada? 
    You can't import sets in here because we know that you got some licenses under your settlement in 1957, but we have other patents which you're controlling. 
    We have Marconi patents, we have Hazeltine patents, we have Philips patents, and they can't be licensed for import. 
    You have to manufacture in Canada." 
    No dispute to that Congress sanction. 
    McConnell doesn't deny it. 
    Nobody denies it. 
    It's a merit on this record that that's what he told us and that "we want diagrams of your sets to examine," and we gave them to him and he took them home and then he came back and he said "you are infringing these patents," and he sent us a notice within the damage period in which he, with regular notice, threaten the suit. 
    "You are infringing the patent." 
    That's the way you start an infringement suit, names the patents, and then encloses a pool license which is limited to manufacture in Canada.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3971.754" stopTime="3975.186">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you, nevertheless, went ahead into the Canadian market.
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="3975.186" stopTime="4058.488">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Yes, we went in but we only made 5%, and the Court of Appeals below seems to think that there must be a total exclusion from a market. 
    We're saying that the impedimenta of the pool and the effect that's it had to create boycotts of our product during the damage period was impedimenta which we were faced continuously, cumulatively, as this Court said in the United Shoe Machinery case. 
    And, true, we could've sued back in 1957 as they said -- this Court said in the Shoe Machinery case but we could still sue in 1959. 
    If the effect of this illegal conspiracy, which haven't been terminated, which is still existing, which is still continuing, which is still going forth, and the threat inherent to the whole trade and known to the whole trade, and the type was serious. 
    The testimony is that, under Canadian patent law, any distributor could have all of the product confiscated by the owner of the patents. 
    He couldn't sell them because he didn't have a license to sell them. 
    We took that risk and we took that risk, Mr. Justice White, relying on the enforcement of the antitrust laws of this federal government on my advice.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4058.488" stopTime="4070.532">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I gather, you prove your damages by saying that without the impedimenta you would've had this similar share to Canadian market to that you had in the United States.

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Wright's testimony wasn't denied. 
    Kaplan testified the same way. 
    It wasn't denied. 
    Nobody from the pool came in and said we could get distributors, nobody.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4098.082" stopTime="4102.841">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I suppose that there's testimony to show that you had the product to sell then you had volume enough to --

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    We are a competitor beautifully equipped to compete. 
    That's the rule that's been laid down in the antitrust cases.

    And, we were.

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    No, we couldn't get the distribution system because of an illegal conspiracy, and that's what we're complaining about, one of the things.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4124.455" stopTime="4132.792">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, but was there testimony suggesting that you put as much effort into developing a distribution system in Canada as you put in the United States?

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    No, because we were threaten with infringement suits on every single set we sold, and we have sold -- I don't know how many sets.

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Yes, but the potential liability still exists. 
    We could be sued on -- for the profit on every --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4157.504" stopTime="4162.631">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Was there testimony -- is there testimony indicating that you laid off the Canadian market?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="4162.631" stopTime="4169.252">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Exactly, by Mr. Wright. 
    He said he didn't dare develop it to sense.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4169.252" stopTime="4170.712">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You went ahead to some extent, but not --
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="4170.712" stopTime="4309.596">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    To some extent, yes, trying to preserve what market he had and, by the way, it's grown under the protection of the corporate decree in the District Court to $14 million a year, corroborating the testimony of Mr. Wright and Mr. Kaplan. 
    Now, I want to go back for a moment. 
    23 years ago, I appeared before this Court in the so-called Bigelow case. 
    It involved Jackson Park Theatre in Chicago, and we had a jury verdict and it went up on appeal to the same Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit. 
    And, the Court of Appeals said the only method of proving damages is to compare an open market for the close market and, for a quarter of the sensory, the motion picture industry had destroyed an open market in Chicago. 
    There was no such comparison. 
    And so, obviously, nobody could've made that kind of proof. 
    So, the card held that there was no fact of damage and reversed the case and came up here by certiorari. 
    And this Court, in that case, said that where wrongdoers, violators of the Act have destroyed an open market comparison, estimates can be used. 
    And, in that case, the only evidence we had was the estimate of our theater manager. 
    That, absent the restrictions of the conspiracy, we could've done as much business as a competing theater. 
    And, the Court held --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4309.596" stopTime="4312.093">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you did have the competing theater.
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="4312.093" stopTime="4326.131">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Yes, and we have an open market in the United States which is contiguous with the Canadian market which is comparable in all respects as to competition, as to markets, as to broadcast, and all the rest, and to compare one --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4326.131" stopTime="4330.813">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is there any new American competitors have plants in Canada?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="4330.813" stopTime="4347.323">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Some of them have gone in and some of them have failed, but the point in this case, Mr. Justice White, is whether or not we can be compelled to exceed to stopping commerce.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4347.323" stopTime="4378.828">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I understand that. 
    I'm just thinking about the damages. 
    Now, let's assume that America -- an American competitor of yours who has 10% of the American market builds a plant in Canada, just like his American plant, but he doesn't do it -- do -- and he tries to get 10% of the Canadian market, just like he's got in the United States, and doesn't do it, can't he somehow get more than 5%?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="4378.828" stopTime="4394.032">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    There's no such evidence in this record. 
    There's no such contention made in this record. 
    Nobody got into the witness stand and said "if you build a plant up there, you couldn't have gotten more than 5%." 
    No countervailing evidence to ours. 
    The cases say, "why, sure --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4394.032" stopTime="4394.685">

    On the estimate that's made --

speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="4409.545" stopTime="4433.125">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Well, the evidence that's available, and there is some inferences on the evidence. 
    There's the testimony of Mr. Kaplan that he made a survey and found it was absolutely utterly uneconomical to produce sets in Canada with Canadian labor and all the rest of it, and there was other evidence that three companies that went in there and tried it failed.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4433.125" stopTime="4441.823">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that may be. 
    And, which way do you run that, for you or against you?
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="4441.823" stopTime="4452.140">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    I run it for me because why should we be compelled to go into Canada in violation of the antitrust laws? 
    We have the protection of these laws, if Your Honor please.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4452.140" stopTime="4467.249">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So that, the company that builds a plant and fails to command a decent share of the market -- who builds a plant in Canada and fails to have a decent share of the market doesn't necessarily mean that that same company could've done better if it hadn't build a plant.
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="4467.249" stopTime="4491.341">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Well, may be so, Your Honor, but the Court below, the District Court, and the Courts of Appeals have said this time and time again, and you said it in this Court in the Bigelow case, the weight of the testimony of this kind is for the District Court, not to be weighed on some suppositation -- supposititious case of -- but, with all due deference now, I'm not --

    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    Or that's a difference of opinion, too. 
    Well, I have one further contention to make. 
    My time is running out. 
    We show by the inference in transposing it, and bear in mind, Mr. Justice White, that there was no objection to the inference. 
    The computations came in without objection.

    What I've been trying to get -- suggest that you get to is to tell us briefly, if you will, what their testimony says, if anything, with respect to the basis for that conclusory judgment of theirs.
speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="4722.641" stopTime="4876.834">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    The basis of their testimony was that the markets were contiguous, that the markets were essentially their claim, that the advertising in the United States overlapped into Canada, created a market for our product, that the competition was comparable, that our sets were better, that the shipping problems and terriers were not involved. 
    They took them all into consideration and, on the basis of that and with -- Kaplan with 40 years in the business and Wright, too, with 20-something, testified from their knowledge that they could've have done it and could've gotten the same share and there was no cross-examination and there was no other witness who testified any different. 
    And, the testimony stands uncontradicted on the record and the Trial Court adopted it. 
    Let me turn to 9 -- finding number 36, which is found on the back of the brief. 
    The foreign commerce of finding -- the foreign commerce of Zenith in -- has been drastically curtailed by the patent pools in England, Canada, and Australia. 
    The damages Zenith has sustained were estimated by experienced officials of Zenith, thoroughly familiar with the business problems and sales potentials in the markets involved. 
    They determine the approximate damages sustained by a thorough of each of the markets involved and all relevant factors including terrier, shipping costs, manufacturing problems. 
    Zenith's foreign commerce has been damaged by the pools in the following amounts during the four-year statutory damage period. 
    Now, that was based upon the same kind of testimony that this Court unequivocally said was proper in the Bigelow case and other cases since have said whatever its weight may be, it's competent. 
    And, it came in without any objection. 
    Nobody objected. 
    Nobody objected to the computations. 
    Nobody put on any countervailing evidence.

    Now, if you don't mind, could you tell us briefly at this point on the basis stated by the Court of Appeals for its conclusion that the District Court was clearly erroneous in finding the fact of damage?

    The consequence, and I can't understate this, the consequence of sustaining of taking away our protection from this injunction is that we can be sued on every single set we've ever sold under the pool patent and we are subject to a potential liability of any profit that we made on those sets and we can be forever barred from that market, and here are set three companies. 
    We, to see what this Court -- we've taken $10 million from the bank in 1957 and they wait to see who is going to get the business that Zenith has developed in Canada.

    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    Thank you. 
    May it please the Court. 
    Before starting on the main part of my argument, I would like to get a few basic points before the Court. 
    The first is that this case was tried before a district judge without a jury. 
    The second is that, after the trial, Zenith prepared and submitted findings for the judge to sign and the judge signed every single finding -- every single finding that he did sign was a finding prepared by Zenith and he didn't even change a comment. 
    The judge did not --

    Is that something new, Mr. Chadwell?
speaker="john_t_chadwell" startTime="5229.864" stopTime="5230.393">
    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    I beg your pardon?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5230.393" stopTime="5232.626">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is that something new and unique?
speaker="john_t_chadwell" startTime="5232.626" stopTime="5497.102">
    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    In this case? 
    Well, it's unique so far as the Courts that I've been practicing before is concerned. 
    The Court reversed on the ground that the findings were clearly erroneous. 
    That showed an impact on Zenith's business. 
    The Court followed the rule announced by this Court in Gypsum to the effect that a finding is clearly erroneous and, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing Court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. 
    And, the Court said that that was the situation with them in the Court of Appeals in this case. 
    Now, Mr. McConnell said nothing about England, although the amount of damages awarded by the Court on the English pool was approximately the same in the neighborhood of $15 million. 
    The reason, I think, that Mr. McConnell said nothing about England, the reason was that the testimony in connection with the English pool demonstrated, I think, to the Court of Appeals that the statements of Mr. Wright, President of Zenith, and Mr. Kaplan, Executive Vice-President of Zenith were not believable. 
    And, in the -- in connection with the analysis of the Court of Appeals of the record with respect to England, that fact is demonstrated. 
    These two men not only testified with respect to the English pool, they testified with respect to impact, as Mr. McConnell said, and with respect to the amount of damage. 
    They testified on those subjects with respect to the Canadian pool as well. 
    Now, the Zenith evidence submitted by Mr. Wright through Mr. Wright and Mr. Kaplan, is unbelievable on crucial issues in this case. 
    It was either repudiated and recanted by the witnesses themselves, it was shown to be incorrect by later evidence and undisputed findings, or it was directly contradicted by a contemporaneous documents which are in evidence. 
    Now, in connection with the English pool, the -- we went in on a motion to reopen the case as to the English pool upon getting into the case. 
    And, we made the motion on the ground that we would be able to show that embargos, governmental -- English governmental embargos prohibited and made impossible the importation of radio and television sets for 20 years before 1959 and there were, as a result, two separate hearings as to England. 
    The first was in 1964, after which the Court entered finding 36, read by Mr. McConnell exactly as submitted by Zenith, awarding damages in the amount of $24 million. 
    Now, that finding and that award in England was based upon testimony of these two men as follows. 
    I want to briefly summarize it and then show what they said when they came back on the second trial which was awarded to us limitedly on embargos as to England, but which we were not permitted to have as to Canada.

    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    I am talking now about the English pool, about which Mr. McConnell said nothing although his judgment includes about $15 million for England. 
    And, I'm taking up England first because I think that the testimony of these witnesses at the first trial before findings were entered compared to their testimony at the second trial as to England, after the Court reopened on the question of these embargos, shows that they were not believable witnesses, that they were not credible witnesses, and the review of the Court of Appeals of the entire record, I submit, brought out that fact. 
    Now --

    They did not expressly refer to the credibility of the witness as otherwise, although they could not have made -- some of the findings have been made without having serious doubts, grave doubts, as to their credibility. 
    And, I would like to outline to the Court what they said the first time and what they said the second time, and the extent to which they were contradicted by contemporaneous documents.

    It was not the acts of the pools, and their entire contention with respect to England was that they had been kept out for many years prior to 1959, that if they had been permitted to -- by the pools to sell during that period, they would've build up a business.

speaker="john_t_chadwell" startTime="5744.282" stopTime="6003.197">
    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    And I can't say the reason for it. 
    I assume, Mr. Chief Justice, I assume the reason was because they didn't, I think -- a case had been made up. 
    I'm sure that was the reason. 
    May I say that the -- first, it was said that for many years, as I said, Zenith had tried to import to England. 
    On each occasion, it was said the British pool threatened distributors until they seized buying Zenith products. 
    And, it was claimed that Zenith -- that the English pool had prevented Zenith from building up its market. 
    They testified that during the four-year period, 1959-1963, Zenith had in fact attempted to market its TV sets in England converted from the American standard, the 525-line standard in America, to a unique British 405-line system. 
    They testified that Zenith had so-converted its sets, and said sets converted to its English distributor with kits and parts to make conversions where necessary. 
    They testified further that the conversion was so simple. 
    Ramsey, the English Distributor, did it in his backroom. 
    That he had made such conversions, had made an effort to sell these sets after the embargo was lifted in 1959, but was unable to do so because he was precluded by the pool. 
    Now, that was the testimony of these men at their -- at the first hearing, precisely what I have said. 
    Now, they all -- with all -- then, they make two basic contentions by their testimony, that these things had happened, that that's what had hurt them, that that's how they were damaged. 
    Now, turning to the first point that, for many years prior to 1959, the pool had blocked Zenith's attempts to sell and that they had been unable to build up a market. 
    Now, the government's brief, the Solicitor General said that this contention of long exclusion of the pool was Zenith's basic theory of recovery which, indeed, it was. 
    Now, after the Court's findings were entered, as I say, we file this motion. 
    We urge that we could prove that there was nothing to this contention with respect to the impos -- the blocking by the pool in England before 1959 where there's nothing it, we could prove that government embargos was what did it and it was not the pools at all. 
    Now, on that motion and in the course of that argument, Zenith counsel denied that there were any embargos. 
    He objected to reopening the case on the ground there were no embargos and he said, and I quote from page 3034 -- 3035 to 3039 of the record, "there never was an embargo, never. 
    We can prove just the opposite." 
    Zenith's counsel further asserted to the Trial Court, "contrary to the representations made in open Court by counsel for Hazeltine, there never has been an embargo, that is, there never has been a governmental prohibition against importation of radios and television receivers either in England or Australia." 
    Now, that's what he argued to the Court. 
    That's what he said in opposing our motion to reopen, but the Court did reopened to enable us to put in proof of embargos limited to that question, and we did put in proof of the embargos and we did show that the embargos existed and that was the reason we were kept out of the English pool for 20 years, from 1930 -- 1920 -- 1939 to 1959. 
    That was proof beyond a doubt, and the Court then held that the iron curtain of the governmental embargos and nothing else kept Zenith out of England prior to June 1959 and out of Australia prior to April 1960, which was the date of lifting the embargos of Australia.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Which Court held that?
speaker="john_t_chadwell" startTime="6005.234" stopTime="6172.538">
    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    The trial judge held that. 
    Now, the testimony of Zenith's witnesses of exclusions by the pool prior to 1959 was, thus, shown to be untrue. 
    And, the government agrees that that was what was Zenith's basic theory. 
    Government agrees in their brief filed in this Court. 
    What was Zenith's basic theory was shown to be without merit on the basis of the governmental embargos? 
    It was Wright and Kaplan, these two men to whom Mr. McConnell refers. 
    It was Wright and Kaplan who led the Trial Court to believe that the pool had kept Zenith out of England during those periods, and I would like to make this reading from the record, this question on the second trial. 
    Question: "Now, is it a fact, Mr. Kaplan," this is cross-examination by Mr. Kayser, "that Zenith has taken the position from the beginning of this litigation that, for many years, it was excluded with a patent pool from importing radio and television sets into all three countries?" 
    The court, well, it has not only taken that position, but they persuaded the Court to so-find and Mr. Kaplan said, "that is correct." 
    When Mr. Wright was recalled he said "now, you told this Court that you had been excluded from England, Canada, and Australia for many years by the patent pools." 
    Answer: "yes, sir." 
    "You told this Court that, based on that exclusion, you were entitled to damages during the statutory period." 
    "Yes, sir, and, the fact is that they were precluded and kept out of England by the embargos and nothing but the embargoes." 
    Now, at the second hearing, faced with proof of the embargos, they testified that they'd known about the embargos all the time. 
    Now, they hadn't mentioned it at the first trial, hadn't mentioned it. 
    They said, "why, we knew about that all the time." 
    Mr. -- Zenith counsel, at the first -- at the -- in opposing our motion to reopen, what did he say? 
    He said, as I read to the Court, "there were no embargos. 
    We could prove that there were no embargos." 
    And, what did Zenith official say on recall? 
    They said that the matter had been discussed with their attorneys before they testified at the first trial. 
    They -- they'd so testify that they had taken the embargos into consideration in their first testimony and assumed that they were a complete failure, although they said nothing about it and their counsel, with clear instructions, had denied it. 
    Now, their second contention that --

    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    Well, I can't answer that, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    They -- I assume, as I said in a little while ago, that the reason they didn't put into evidence on that was that they thought a case had not been made up anyway. 
    So, they didn't do it. 
    That, it is a fact, that there was no proof of the embargos at the first trial. 
    There was in -- irrefutable proof at the second time after the Court, exercising his discretion, after the Court had reopened and let us put in evidence as to this question, and there was no question about it whatsoever.

    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    No. 
    There was -- I'm not saying there wasn't embargo during the damage period, sir, no. 
    During the damage period, the facts are that there was correspondence between the distributor, Ramsey, in England and Zenith which showed very clearly that the reason that Zenith didn't import to England during that period was because they didn't want to. 
    They were -- they had no intention of doing it. 
    They were waiting for the change in the television standards.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What was the real purpose of your argument on the embargo in light --
speaker="john_t_chadwell" startTime="6447.749" stopTime="6450.071">
    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    Yes, well, the purpose of it -- excuse me, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6450.071" stopTime="6450.381">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="john_t_chadwell" startTime="6450.381" stopTime="6697.491">
    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    The purpose of it was that we tried to reopen the case, and did reopen the case, to -- for the purpose of proving embargos, though they were denied. 
    We did that, and the reason we did that was that we wanted to show that their contention was incorrect, that the pool had been keeping them out, as finding 36 said, the pool had been keeping them out all these years. 
    The pool didn't keep them out. 
    It was the embargos that kept them out from 1939 until 1959. 
    They had contended that they were -- that they -- had the pool not kept them up -- kept them out all those years, they would have build up a market in England to a very high level which would have yielded them profits during the damage period that they were unable to earn. 
    Now, that is the reason for it, if the Court please. 
    Now, I want to say this. 
    This is a point specifically mentioned by the Court of Appeals in the Court of Appeals' opinion. 
    Their contention was that Zenith had intended to import TV sets to England beginning in 1959 but were blocked by the pool and, as I say, the testimony was the uncontradicted documents or the contrary but Zenith's counsel characterized Kaplan's testimony as being that he was able to convert to the English standard. 
    He was able to convert from the 525-line to the 409-line and it was so simple that Ramsey could do it in his backroom with a screwdriver, as Mr. McConnell characterizes, that they were converting these American-made sets to the English standard throughout the damage period and that they were trying to sell them, but couldn't sell them because of the activities of the pool. 
    Now, on recall, they were forced to say, contrary what they had said at the first hearing, no television sets had been converted by Zenith to the English 5 -- 405-line standard, no conversion kits had been furnished to Ramsey, as they had said, no sets had been adopted by the English distributor to the English 405-line standard, and no sets had been offered by Zenith in the English market at all. 
    Now, I think this testimony of Mr. Wright, when confronted with this testimony he had given at the first trial compared to what he said at the second trial, is revealing. 
    Question: "When you told the Court back in 1964 that Zenith had sent a few television sets to Mr. Ramsey which he had attempted to market, you did not know whether or not those sets were equipped to receive English television?" 
    "No, sir, I did not." 
    "When you told the Court that Mr. Ramsey had attempted to market these sets, did you know whether or not he did in fact attempt to market them?" 
    Answer: "I did not know specifically what he had done." 
    Now, the government agrees that there were variations in the testimony of these men. 
    I'm talking about the Solicitor General's brief now, that there were variations in their testimony, that they had modified their testimony by the 1965 assertions, and the Solicitor General states that this change in their testimony could justify the conclusion for the Trial Court that other aspects of their testimony were also unworthy of relief. 
    Now, in Zenith's brief to this Court, and I'm referring to their -- to pages 86-88, they quote from the some of the same discredited testimony about the distributor converting sets and asserts "there was no denial of this testimony and there is no other evidence in this record on the issue where the other evidence in the record on the issue is their recanting the testimony when they got to trial the second time."

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Chadwell, I -- based on some experience, may I ask you really, in the subs -- these people were not cross-examined in the first trial.

    -- after the findings were made, pursuant to permission of the Court and, I take it, your point must be that, on cross-examination which is really what it was, wasn't it, there was no cross-examination in the first trial was this man? 
    And then, substantially, on cross-examination, these men testified, as you have now here narrated and perhaps, in most, what you're trying to say to us is that the things that were brought out on cross-examination where more deviational, more deviant from what they said on direct testimony than as a common ordinary experience of lawyers and witnesses in the trial of cases.

speaker="john_t_chadwell" startTime="6812.031" stopTime="6850.602">
    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    I think the reason is that, when I started out, I wanted to show how they had buried their testimony with respect to the English part and where we had a second hearing or an additional hearing and did not have one on the Canadian part. 
    I wanted to show that because I think that has a bearing -- had a bearing on the decision of the Court of Appeals to reverse after reviewing the entire record. 
    Of course, I think the Court had serious question as to the credibility of these witnesses after noting the differences in their testimony at the two hearings.

    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    No. 
    They did not assume the testimony is correct. 
    As a matter of fact, they held that the real reason that Zenith did not export to England was that they were waiting for a change by the British Government in the television standards from the 405 to the 625-line which was an exceedingly important change which made obsolete all the television sets, unless they were converted at considerable expense. 
    And, the fact of the matter is that, during the damage period, in fact, in 1961 in the middle of the damage period, Ramsey wrote to Zenith and reported on the continued testing and examination of the 625-line standard.

    Mr. John T. Chadwell 
    And that is a point that I would like to discuss, which you've just briefed, although Mr. McConnell did not refer to it. 
    I think that the Court was right in relying upon the decision of the Gypsum case that a finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing Court on the entire record is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. 
    Now, that is the rule that has been followed in the question of the power of the Court of Appeals to reverse a decision of the Trial Court since the DuPont decision which, I believe, was some-25 years ago. 
    Now, the contention is raised here that the jury rule should apply in this case despite the fact that this was a case tried by the Court and without a jury. 
    The -- Mr. McConnell also has made that contention and that, I assume, is -- and I think also the suggestion of the Solicitor General. 
    But, for the -- there's no doubt at all that Rule 52 (a) makes the provision that I've referred to. 
    There's no doubt at all that, under the decision in the Gypsum case, the rule is that the Court of Appeals has the right to reverse even though there's some evidence to support the findings when they're left with this definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, and the Court said -- stated that it was left with the definite and firm commitment -- conviction that a mistake had been committed. 
    And, I must say, that the government, as much as it admits, that applying the standard -- the established standard under 52 (a) as gov -- as stated in the Gypsum case that the Court of Appeals was right in reversing on that ground if you assume that that ground is the correct one.

    That's what they wrote back and forth about it. 
    Finally, there was a firm statement by Mr. Ramsey that that -- they could not import and sell until the change was made. 
    Nothing could be clearer that there was a contemporaneous document, contemporaneous correspondence directly contradicting and directly contrary to the theory that Zenith was interested in and wanted to import to or export to England during the damage period.

   Argument of Victor P. Kayser
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7885.566" stopTime="7886.876">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Kayser.
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="7886.876" stopTime="8061.326">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    May it please the Court. 
    Before getting to the subject of Canada, I'd like to devote just another minute on the subject of England and, I think, possibly clarify what may be somewhat of a misunderstanding. 
    The fact is that, as to England, the testimony of Wright and Kaplan which had formed the basis of the findings was two-fold. 
    First, the testimony about having been kept out of England by the pools for many years, which was disproved by the later proof of the embargo, this was one part of their factual damage theory as to England, that the pools had kept them from developing a market by June 1959 from which developed market they could then profit. 
    And then, the second part of their assertion was that, in fact, during the four years, they were interested in an intent in going into England and does -- the testimony that Mr. Chadwell has referred to, having to do with the contention they built a few sets or converted a few sets and that the English distributor had tried to sell them, that evidence had been put in to indicate interest in the English market. 
    And, that was the evidence that they relied on to show interest and readiness to go into the English market during that four-year period. 
    Now, when they got back on the stand and were forced to admit that that testimony was not true, they were forced to admit it because we had taken the distributor's deposition and he admitted that there was nothing to it. 
    When they were forced to admit that there was nothing to their original testimony, that did two things. 
    Number one, it seriously impaired, we submit, their credibility on all aspects but, secondly, it knocked out the second of the two aspects upon which their English claim was based. 
    So, at that point in fact, they have no evidence in this record on which to base any claim as to England other than their -- they had this question of exhibit 220, the inferences to be drawn from that, which I will come to later. 
    Now, secondly, before going into Canada, I would like to answer the questions or respond to the inquiry this morning as concerns the matter of a release. 
    Now, if I --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Before you get to that, Mr. Kayser -- before you get to that, if I may interrupt you. 
    I take it that what you're really saying is that, with respect to England on your point two, as you've just stated it, it says if Zenith were a stranger that this is the only evidence in the record that goes to their desire to do business in England, their readiness and the ability to do business in England absent the alleged retraints.
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="8091.560" stopTime="8091.640">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="8091.640" stopTime="8104.125">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And that this evidence, with respect to the set conversion -- convertibility of the sets, being refuted, there's no evidence in that so --

    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Repudiated by the witnesses themselves.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="8105.793" stopTime="8110.584">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So, it goes to the question of the fa -- what has been called the fact of damages.

    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Yes, that plus --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, suppose if we should disagree with you on that without getting into the subtleties of that statement, if we should disagree with you on that, I take it that neither you nor Mr. Chadwell is submitting to us that the patent pool -- you're not trying to defend the legality under the antitrust laws of the patent pool and of Hazeltine's participation in it.
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="8141.482" stopTime="8171.382">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    I would like to answer that in two parts, if I may. 
    Number one, I should say that on the point of intent to enter, there is an addition to the fact that they have repudiated. 
    They recanted their testimony. 
    There is also, as Mr. Chadwell has said, there is the documentation in the record from Zenith's own bulk exhibit which clearly showed that, during this entire period, they were waiting for the perspective change of the broadcast standard.

    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Now, on your second question --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="8172.663" stopTime="8173.905">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- you've made that clear.
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="8173.905" stopTime="8203.303">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    On your second question, the fact is that we -- as shown in our brief, entirely cited from any aspect, we believe that it is -- that the record shows that, from January 1958, if they in fact had had an interest in entering the English market from then after the embargo and through the damage period, they could've obtained the license. 
    They never inquired where licensing could happen.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="8203.303" stopTime="8226.553">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes, but I want to be very clear on one thing. 
    Are you or are you not arguing that the English pool, let's take that, A and B, the Canadian pool are lawful or not unlawful with respect to the participation of Hazeltine therein?

    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    We -- frankly, Your Honor, as we have seen this case, we have not seen it fit to go into that question. 
    We consider that the issue of the fact of damage which was found in favor of the Hazeltine Corporations by the Court of Appeals is a threshold question.

speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="8258.962" stopTime="8285.478">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    On the Court of Appeals, we -- frankly, Your Honor, we made a very brief argument. 
    We did defend the legality of the pools. 
    We believe that they are lawful but there, again, our thrust was on the question, was Zenith in fact hurt and also on the issue of the amount of damages, as well as other several issues.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="8285.478" stopTime="8299.263">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Could we take your briefs in the Court of Appeals on the question of legality as the total of your argument here if we come to that?
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="8299.263" stopTime="8306.928">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I -- as I say, we did not brief it exhaustively there and we have not briefly exhaustively here.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="8306.928" stopTime="8323.755">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I would've thought in the Court of Appeals you would have to reach it exhaustively because you had the findings against you. 
    And, I would think that you'd want to prove to the best of your ability that these were legal, if they were legal.
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="8323.755" stopTime="8439.397">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Your Honor, we -- faced with the situation into which we had been thrust there, frankly, we had to form a judgment as to what emphasis to place. 
    We had a client who had the judgment of $34 million against him. 
    We felt it was clear that, irrespective of the question of legality which, certainly, I need not say. 
    And if an area like this is a very complicated area. 
    It was a matter of judgment to put our thrust where we thought it was the most clear that the judgment below -- judgments below were wrong, and that's what we did. 
    Now, on the issue of release, I think, it, and I will spend just a moment on that but, it should be clear that the releases were in fact pleaded in the District Court by leave of Court and before entry of judgment there. 
    And, we have covered that point in our reply to the Solicitor General's brief where the point was made. 
    Also, I think it should be pointed out that, on Zenith's reply brief filed in this Court on page 16, Zenith admitted that the Trial Court permitted the filing of the briefs -- of the pleas as of a date a year after the trial and then properly overruled a motion to dismiss the counterclaim on these grounds. 
    The releases were, in fact, pleaded admittedly after the original trial but before judgment by leave of the Trial Court.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="8439.397" stopTime="8442.796">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why were they not pleaded in the first trial?
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="8442.796" stopTime="8707.301">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Your Honor, again, we were not counsel but I think the reason they were not pleaded at the first trial was because, under the theory of action which was set forth in the original counterclaim, there would've been no conceivable basis to plead them because, as set forth in that counterclaim and in that motion to file it and, in the affidavit of Mr. Carodi, counsel -- one of counsel for Zenith, it was recited that the acts complained of which formed the basis of this counterclaim which was not filed until 1963, three years after the answer had taken place, after the filing of the answer. 
    Well now, that was a span of three years before filing of the answer, and I would submit it would be quite obvious that, under those circumstances, the release would have no possible applicability. 
    And, it was only after, as we pointed out in brief, Zenith switched its theory of action to claim not that the action in the past three years had caused damage but that, by reason of the Acts going back to 1926, as you -- if you heard, Zenith had been damaged in the effect of those. 
    It wasn't until that point that the release became applicable and, at that time, when we got into the case we pleaded it and we're permitted to plead it. 
    Now, as to the question of Canada, I think we must remember that the issue that we have here is whether or not there was a damaging impact by the Canadian pool upon Zenith's Canadian business during the four-year period. 
    And, by reason of the testimony given by the Zenith witnesses, the final ultimate issue or question there is, we believe, as the Solicitor General correctly stated it, namely whether Zenith was unable to obtain a full-fledged Canadian distribution system during the period from June 1959 through May 1963 and, if not, whether such inability was attributable to the actions of the Canadian pool. 
    Now, that is the issue as to Canada as to fact of damage. 
    Now, we've heard a great deal this morning about this alleged gigantic international worldwide conspiracy and, incidentally, the proofs and the findings do not support that. 
    But, in any event, we have heard that language about these alleged conspiracies or giant conspiracy. 
    Well, there are several observations to be made there. 
    First, Mr. McConnell has said, as to Canada, that its evidence is almost entirely documentary and, yes, it is and it is all before 1957. 
    Secondly, I think we should remember that Zenith is not entitled to any recovery here by reason of any alleged illegality of the Canadian pool or any other pool or by reason of any overt act which may have been done. 
    It is entitled to recovery. 
    It is asking that it'd be paid money. 
    It's entitled to that only if it can show that there was an impact -- a damaging impact by those pools upon Zenith's business during the four years. 
    Now, what does the record show, incidentally, as to Canada after the 1957 releases? 
    It shows, yes, as Mr. McConnell says, it shows that there was a trade builder ad in August 1958 warning about infringement, but it also shows that Mr. Wright sent a telegram and a letter, a very strong letter, to the Canadian pool and said "we are fully licensed under all Canadian patents which the pool controls. 
    Thus, we consider this advertisement detrimental and, if you ever send another one or issue another one, we'll see you in Court." 
    And, there never was.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, how did this suit get started?
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="8840.207" stopTime="8871.437">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    This suit has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the foreign business of Zenith or with the Canadian pool, the English pool, or the Australian pool, and I think, possibly, I would like to turn to that point since the question is raised right now because Mr. McConnell, when he was asked on that question, said "yes, there was a finding to the effect that there was a connection between the instant patent suit and the Canadian operation."
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="8871.437" stopTime="8874.354">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    He finally said it was on domestic production.
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="8874.354" stopTime="8977.621">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Yes, that there was a connection. 
    However, the number of the finding he gave you, which I believe was 32, had absolutely nothing to do with the domestic litigation. 
    Further, the finding which Zenith itself submitted and was entered in this case, finding number 13, after reciting the domestic activities of Hazeltine Corporation including a reference to the incident suit, said that Zenith's -- the injury to Zenith's business and property from the domestic suit and these other activities was $50,065.00 namely the cost of defending the litigation, and there wasn't a word in any of those findings which, in any way, purported to connect the domestic situation or the domestic suit with the Canadian situation. 
    And, in fact, not only is there nothing in the record, but when -- in the colloquy which I had with the Trial Court in March on the reopening, that's referred to at page 26-27 of our brief, he made it quite apparent that, in his opinion, he did not understand that there was any connection between the domestic activities of Hazeltine Research and the foreign activities of the Canadian pool. 
    And, the Court of Appeals, accordingly, said quite correctly, we submit, that there is no evidence in this record to indicate any connection and that, in fact, the Trial Court never took that suggestion seriously.

    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    We don't think it does, Your Honor, but Zenith has argued that point in its briefs. 
    They think it's totally irrelevant. 
    There is no connection. 
    To get back to the Canadian situation, the question of this correspondence, the question of this trade builder, and it's apparent that Zenith never considered it, offered threat to it because when it filed its answer in this case in April 1960, some-years to month later, if it had felt that these acts constituted a threat and damage to it, it would've been a compulsory counterclaim required at that time. 
    And, there never was any such compulsory counterclaim until May 1963 when they ascribed their damage solely to acts occurring after April 1960. 
    Now, Wright was asked by his counsel as to exactly what were the clouds or difficulties or effects which the alleged activities of the pool had on Zenith's business in Canada.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What about the distributors?

    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Mr. Justice Marshall, this is part of my next point.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Good.
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="9083.533" stopTime="9247.428">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Wright testified as to two alleged effects of the Canadian pool and its activities during the period, and he said they had to do with the holding fact on advertising and promotion and they had an effect on the ability to get distributors. 
    At least that is the way Zenith has characterized that testimony. 
    Now, on the first point of holding back on advertising and promotion, I submit that that point is no longer in the case because when we got Mr. Kaplan back on the stand in November 1965, we asked him about Zenith's advertising in Canada, and he said it was typical to what you would expect in the new market. 
    In fact, he implied it was a bit larger and, further, Zenith only did a 218 in this case. 
    Shows that we're, in fact, substantial expenditures and advertising, radio, television, newspapers, magazines, billboards, you name it, they used it. 
    The Government feels that -- has indicated that they recognize the rights that this is out of the case and we most certainly agree, but I think it should be pointed out, and the Court of Appeals took note of this fact, that this was evidence given by a witness later shown to be untrue by his own fellow executive. 
    We turn then to the second question, that of whether or not has -- and the government, I think, put it fairly, whether or not Zenith was in fact unable to obtain a full-fledged Canadian distribution during the four-year period. 
    And, I submit, that is the crux of Zenith's entire claim as to Canada. 
    Now, Zenith asserts that Mr. Wright testified that he tried to get distributors but he had problems. 
    He could get some at western Canada but he couldn't get them in the other portions of Canada because of the Canadian pool. 
    But, actually, if you read Mr. Wright's testimony very closely, you will say that even though someone might get that impression, he didn't say that. 
    He made some comments to the effect that the August 1958 trade builder ad, things of that type, would cause a serious problem of getting distributors, but he never testified that, in fact, there's a single -- that there was a single instance where he had failed to get a distributor or where a distributor had left Zenith.

    Is there any finding on that testimony in the Trial Court?
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="9252.301" stopTime="9315.746">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    No, Your Honor, that's one of the things that the Solicitor General pointed out, that you couldn't tell what the Trial Court's supposed theory was. 
    That may very well have been the theory that they should be awarded damages because the pool, for many years prior to that, had prevented them from building up a mature market. 
    Of course, as we pointed out, any damage based on that theory is gone, is not relevant because of the 1956 releases. 
    Secondly, it is said that Wright testified that he could get distributors in the western Canada but had trouble elsewhere. 
    But, the fact is that, if his testimony is examined, all he said was that they could get distributors in western Canada. 
    They had a less success in the central and eastern provinces, but he didn't say why. 
    And, as a matter of fact, as we shall show in a minute, he didn't have trouble getting distributors anywhere in Canada.

    We shall show in a minute the fact is that he did -- that Zenith did not have difficulty getting distributors. 
    By 1959, they were boasting they had a nationwide network of distributors, effective and vigorous at all levels. 
    So, Wright's testimony, as I shall show in a moment, was not true. 
    Now, the --

    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Not as I recall. 
    No, the findings had to do with this pre-1957 period but there was, of course, as Zenith no doubt relies on, this very broad conclusory finding about drastic curtailment.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="9365.082" stopTime="9509.353">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Kayser, may I ask you this? 
    One of the questions before us on this branch of the case could be phrased this way. 
    Was there a basis for the Trial Court concluding that, on account of threats by the pool to prevent the importation into Canada of products, Zenith products manufactured in the United States, Zenith was unable -- Zenith was deterred, prohibited, prevented, or -- from shipping its products into Canada and selling those products there, number one. 
    Number two, because of the activities of the pool in Canada, the distributor that Zenith was unable to obtain a full-fledge distribution system, as you have put it, and that Zenith -- And, third, that was an adequate basis for a District Court conclusion that Zenith wanted to and, but four of the activities of the pool either with respect to prohibiting forbidding importation or with respect to threats against distributors, Zenith would have distributed and sold its product in Canada. 
    Should not about what it comes down to in this branch of the case? 
    You've got two points. 
    One, the pool or the finding 29 with respect to the pool activities in prohibiting importation of product made in the United States and, two, the distribution system. 
    And, either of those at this remote distance, I suggest to you, arguably might support a finding that the pool has damaged Zenith in violation of the antitrust laws. 
    And then, the question is, has it demonstrated the -- what the model damage is and, if so, what is that?
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="9509.353" stopTime="9534.671">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that I can agree that there is -- there was a record which would justify any conclusion of the fact of damage because, granted a pool policy, we nevertheless have the fact that Zenith considered itself fully licensed, took that position, and was never in any way interfere --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="9534.671" stopTime="9602.171">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But, as I think my brother here -- was developed in the colloquy with my brother White, the pool nevertheless took the position that it would not permit the importation of Zenith products into Canada. 
    Zenith could go up there and start a factory. 
    But, however it may be, I'm not asking you to agree to the conclusions right now, Mr. Kayser, but is this the correct analysis of the issues before us, that is to say that whether there is an adequate basis for the District Court's findings on pool prohibition of importation, whether there is an adequate basis for what seem -- what is arguably implicit in the District Court's findings, namely that the pool threatened distributors and, third, whether there's an adequate basis for the finding that, but four of these restraints, Zenith would have sold its product in Canada.

    I think --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="9602.198" stopTime="9604.819">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Are those the issues before us?
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="9604.819" stopTime="9748.385">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    I would think so, Mr. Justice, depending on what you mean adequate basis. 
    I think, certainly, this is -- there is the issue as to the effect of Rule 52 (a) but, striking aside from that, yes. 
    Now, I would like then to come back to this matter of alleged inability to get distributors. 
    Now, the Solicitor General in his brief recognized that the proof on this issue, I believe he recognized that it was lacking or certainly of very low standard, and he made the comment "no person can be certain whether Zenith would've been able to obtain a Canadian wide group of distributors notwithstanding the pool." 
    He made that as a comment and as a justification and as an argument for possibly supporting the decision of the District Court. 
    But, may I please the Court, this brings us to the subject of Zenith's annual reports which, yes, are not in evidence but they were in existence. 
    They were in an offer of proof, made before entry of judgment. 
    They are in the transcript before this Court. 
    We believe, and Mr. McConnell recognizes, the Court may take judicial notice of them and we believe, respectfully, that they are inescabpable unless the truth is to be ignored. 
    I think, respectfully, that there is a very basic question presented here, granted that these annual reports were not put in evidence during the trial. 
    That's undeniable, but the fact is that these are contemporaneous documents out of the Zenith files. 
    They are the highest record of its stewardship to its shareholders and they --

    I represent the Zenith Radio Corporation which is the petitioner in this case. 
    Respondents are the Hazeltine Research, Inc., a corporation which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hazeltine Corporation. 
    And, it was stipulated by the parties in this case in a pretrial stipulation that, for all purposes in this lawsuit and all purposes in the instant case, that the two corporations should be considered one and the same. 
    The instant suit was brought for the alleged infringement of a patent, a monochrome patent alleged to have been infringed by the Zenith Corporation.

    Now, Zenith's counsel has tried to dismiss these annual reports by saying, well, a corporation doesn't have to cry on its shareholder's shoulder but, of course, what he overlooks is that these reports beginning 1957 are really a very, very revealing year by year history of Zenith's operations, and they are in direct conflict either with the testimony of the witnesses or any inferences which anyone might seek to draw from that. 
    And, on this matter of crying on the shareholder's shoulder, the fact is that Zenith did exactly that. 
    For --

    And with respect to other things like Japanese competition and so on?
speaker="victor_p_kayser" startTime="10270.422" stopTime="10517.578">
    Mr. Victor P. Kayser 
    Japanese competition, they also talked about the problem of the carafe in Canada, exchange control ratio. 
    In 1957, as they said, the cartel was annulled and they had never mentioned it again, all the problems in the cartel. 
    So, it really is a very, very revealing history. 
    Well, now, I would like to spend my remaining four-and-a half minutes on the -- on behalf of the Hazeltine Corporation raising the jurisdictional question which is also before this Court. 
    And, I must do so very briefly and make only the points as quickly as I can. 
    First, that Hazeltine Corporation, the parent, was never named a party to the litigation, was never served of the process, never filed an appearance, and the litigation was solely between Hazeltine research and Zenith Radio. 
    The only purported basis for holding the parent liable was the stipulation entered into May 7, 1963 and, as Mr. McConnell himself said this morning, that stipulation was between the parties, namely Hazeltine Research and Zenith, and Hazeltine Corporation was never a party to it. 
    And, it should be noticed also that in the counterclaim filed in this case which was some-three weeks after the stipulation, although Zenith referred to Hazeltine Corporation as the parent, it never named it as a party and, in fact, in the claim for judgment for treble damages, a judgment was asked only -- a judgment against counter-defendant Hazeltine Research, never Hazeltine Corporation. 
    Now, the fact is also that both Zenith and the Trial Court knew that Hazeltine Corporation was not before the Court. 
    Zenith, in its brief constantly distinguished between the parent and the subsidiary, said that Mr. Dodds represented the subsidiary, not the plaintiff. 
    The trial judge himself, in a colloquy, when I raised the question that Hazeltine Corporation was not a party, what did Judge Austin say? 
    "Well, of course, Hazeltine Corporation wasn't a party to the lawsuit." 
    That's the trial judge speaking. 
    Now, finally, and I think this is really very significant in this picture, the first time Hazeltine Corporation even knew that there was any thought that it was to be bound by the judgments, was the day after the original findings calling for the enormous award of $49 million were entered. 
    And then, Hazeltine Corporation heard about it over a Doll Jones tape to the effect that Zenith counsel has advised that he intends to ask the Hazeltine Corporation be bound by the judgment. 
    The reason for this, I suggest, is obvious. 
    These findings for $49 million were 15-16-times the network of Hazeltine Research, in fact, substantially greater than the total assets of Hazeltine Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
    But at least, Hazeltine Corporation had more assets that Hazeltine Research and, therefore, Zenith decided at that point that the judgment should be asserted against the parent. 
    They succeeded in getting the Trial Court to do that, even though the Trial Court himself had admitted that Hazeltine Corporation wasn't a party to the lawsuit. 
    I -- Your Honor, I see I still have a moment more of time, but I would ask if anyone has any questions. 
    I've hurried to finish within my time. 
    Unless has any, I shall sit down.

speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="10542.143" stopTime="10783.680">
    Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell 
    I will, Your Honor. 
    After this case had been submitted, and we've heard about the findings being entered, Hazeltine entered the findings. 
    They presented complete findings of every aspect in this case. 
    And, in those findings, time after time after time, they asked the Trial Court to approve Hazeltine Corporation's entry into the pools, the use of their patents in the pools, that there was no illegal use of Hazeltine Corporation's patents, foreign patents, and Hazeltine Research, Inc. had no foreign patents. 
    They were the patents of Hazeltine Corporation. 
    If they had entered those findings, I couldn't have said one single word about their not being res judicata. 
    I was there. 
    They presented them. 
    We'd stipulated that the companies were the same and they were there asking for relief from that Court, and it was owned. 
    You talk about the findings being written, but they wrote findings. 
    The Court asked both sides to present findings. 
    They wrote them. 
    We wrote them. 
    And, the Court entered our findings and it's done and approved by the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit. 
    Further than that, all of their officials were there during the whole course of the trial and knew that the two companies were stipulated to be one and the same, and that Hazeltine was there. 
    Their counsel for the parent cor -- company trying to justify their participation in these pools, trying to get a complete bill of health from the District Court on their violation of the antitrust laws. 
    And, there isn't the slightest question in the world about that and the rule is that a party that comes in and asks relief from a Court submits itself to the jurisdiction of the Court. 
    Not only that, this isn't a case where a judgment was entered against somebody who wasn't there, off in a left field somewhere. 
    They came into the Court before a judgment was entered and they raised the contention that we're not bound by what's going on in this Court, and they raised the question of whether or not the submission that these findings brought them into the case. 
    And, they lost on that issue and the District Court said they were in the case. 
    True, he referred to the stipulation, but here we were dealing with a situation in the stipulation. 
    And, why was the stipulation entered? 
    We don't have to speculate about it. 
    They presented a stipulation in which they said, for the purposes of this suit, these two companies are to be considered the same, and why? 
    They spelled it out, to avoid the necessity of looking through the corporate veil from the subsidiary to the parent. 
    That was why. 
    So, he wouldn't have to go into the -- I could've made the proof that they were -- one was the agent of the other. 
    One was the alter ego of the other. 
    No problem of proof, they were there. 
    This isn't a case where you're trying to hold somebody who wasn't there. 
    Thank you.
