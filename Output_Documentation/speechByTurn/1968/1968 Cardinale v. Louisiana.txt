   Argument of Nathan Greenberg
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="47.912" stopTime="52.847">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Alright. 
    Mr. Greenberg, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="52.847" stopTime="338.032">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    My name is Nathan Greenberg. 
    I’m an attorney from Gretna, Louisiana. 
    I represent the defendant in this case, Philip Cardinale, Jr. who was the petitioner in this Honorable Court for a petition for a writ of certiorari. 
    The petitioner was convicted of the crime of murder in Plaquemine Parish, Louisiana and he was sentenced to death. 
    For his appeal, we originally perfected some-14 Bills of exceptions which we took to the Supreme Court of Louisiana and we are here before Your Honors today on what would probably amount to two of the Bills of exceptions which have been combined together in one 
    The Crux of the issue before Your Honors today is the effect of testimony relative to prior offenses of the accused where the accused has not taken a stand in his behalf and where, actually, we submit that the use of the prior convictions in this case was to show nothing more than a disposition to commit crime which, we submit, would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now, the way this developed in this matter was like this. 
    The accused turned himself in, in Tucson, Arizona. 
    And, while he was in custody, he was interrogated by the police there. 
    Now, this was pre-Miranda and subsequent Escobedo. 
    So, the Escobedo rule applies. 
    During the course of his custodial interrogation, the petitioner volunteered that he had previously been convicted of an offense in Louisiana, which offense was actually a crime against nature, that after he served his time in New Orleans Parish Prison, that he went looking for the girl who had charged him with this crime, according to him, allegedly with a gun for the purpose of killing her. 
    Now, he did not find the girl. 
    He did not commit any offense in connection with it, and his statements relative to the prior offense or, generally, that let’s see-- I’ll see if I can read it. 
    During the course of his custodial interrogation in Tucson, Arizona, he referred to a prior conviction occurring in Louisiana, which, prior conviction was for a crime against nature occurring on July 12, 1963 and causing the petitioner to be sentenced to serve three months in a parish prison on March 25, 1964. 
    Petitioner further stated, during the course of his custodial interrogation, that after he served his time in New Orleans Parish Prison, he went looking for his alleged prosecutrix with a gun for the stated purpose of killing her. 
    However, he never did find her and, therefore, no further offense was committed. 
    Now, in essence, what we have here is a situation where this reference to the prior offense serves absolutely no useful purpose, we respectfully submit. 
    The only purpose that this link could possibly serve, we submit, is to try to prejudice the jury to show the jury that this defendant is a bad man. 
    This, of course, is why we’re here before Your Honors today because, here, we had a situation where this could very easily have been separated from the remainder of the statements of the accused. 
    This could very easily have been excluded, notwithstanding the fact that we sought to exclude it from the time it first came up. 
    It came up in the opening statement. 
    It came up in the interrogation of the police officer. 
    It came up in the closing argument by the District Attorney. 
    Notwithstanding the fact that we sought to exclude at each level of the proceedings or each stages of proceeding, it was admitted and it was repeatedly referred to in the closing argument.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Did you seek to exclude it on the basis of the United States Constitution or just as a matter of state?
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="344.733" stopTime="373.702">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    In the District Court, if Your Honor please, this trial occurred in May of 1966. 
    This was prior to the ruling of Your Honors in the Spencer case and, of course, we’ve picked up the language of the Spencer case which, I believe, was in 1967 as a basis of relying upon the application for the writ to this Court and the wording of the dissenting opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Warren.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="373.702" stopTime="377.008">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, but I’m-- I think you understand my question.
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="377.008" stopTime="378.903">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="378.903" stopTime="387.721">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Wondering if you-- the time you raised or, in any event, when for the fede-- when you raised any federal question in this case.
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="387.721" stopTime="389.751">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Upon application for the writ.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="389.751" stopTime="391.051">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of certiorari in this Court?
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="391.051" stopTime="495.309">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Yes. 
    In the Trial Court, what had happened was that the states ought to justify the admissibility of the conviction on a basis of propensity or pattern and, of course, we argued to the Court at this time that there was no pattern because the prior offense was crime against nature and this, of course, was murder. 
    And, of course, the only reference to the alleged looking for the prosecutrix with a gun and so forth related to an incomplete offense. 
    Now, we did not succeed in this respect. 
    The state then came in and sought to justify the admissibility of the testimony on a theory that this was a part of the entire confession, and the entire confession as a whole must go in, that Louisiana has such a statute requiring this that the entire confession go in. 
    And, since this defendant said this, regardless of what it was, it must go into evidence. 
    And, of course, we respectfully submit that this should not be so. 
    For example, suppose the defendant made a statement reflecting upon character or integrity of jurors, for example. 
    Should this go in because it’s a part of an alleged confession? 
    Should the prosecution be entitled to use this as an attempt to prejudice the jury against the defendant? 
    We respectfully submit that the issue in this case is quite simple and the issue is to what extent the evidence of prior convictions should be allowed to go in on behalf of the prosecution.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But, as Mr. Justice Stewart asked you, was the federal question which you raised here decided at all in the lower Courts?

    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    No, sir, it was not.

    That is correct.

    Where do we get jurisdiction to hear the case?
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="513.910" stopTime="536.282">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Because of the contention that the constitution was violated with reference to the admissibility of the evidence per se, in other words, the Louisiana Supreme Court held that the confession must be considered as a whole.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="536.282" stopTime="546.112">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    When the case comes here from the state Court, doesn’t our jurisdiction depend on the State Court having decided a federal question?

    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    The federal question, if Your Honor please, in connection with this matter was not raised in the State Court for the reason that there was no-- in the Trial Court, there was no expression which actually hit this on the button as it did in the dissenting opinion in the Spencer case which came out after this trial in the State Court.

    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    We submit that the constitutional issue is present, if Your Honor please. 
    This is a question where we have raised a federal question. 
    Perhaps the state may not passed upon up but, even though the state may not have passed upon it, it has been raised in connection with the application for the writ.

speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="808.786" stopTime="896.443">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Well, if Your Honor please, the issue which we raised herein is one which really developed since the trial of this case. 
    This case was concluded, I believe, on May 5,1966, and the issue which was raised was actually pinpointed in Your Honors’ decision of the Spencer case which was decided by this Honorable Court in 1967. 
    And, insofar as the focusing of attention on this issue was concerned, at that time, the Bills of Exceptions had already been signed, the appeal had been lodged in the State Supreme Court, and there was no way in which the issue could be raised at that time for the very simple reason that, under the state practice and procedure, we have to raise the Bills of Exceptions, the basis of the objections to the admissibility of the evidence, have them signed by the Trial Court, and then we take the appeal. 
    So, there was really, we submit, no way in which we could raise the issue at that time because the matter had already been tried, submitted, and the Trial Court had lost jurisdiction.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="896.443" stopTime="901.173">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you take any comfort out of the opinion of the Court in the Spencer case?
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="901.173" stopTime="987.139">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Yes, sir, we do. 
    This is the entire basis of the application for the writ. 
    We respectfully submit that the opinion in the Spencer case, both majority and dissent, would clearly indicate that the position of the defense in this case was correct that it would be violative of the Due Process Clause. 
    In the Spencer case, in the majority opinion, the majority stated petitioners do not even appear to be arguing that the constitution is infringed if a jury is told of a defendant’s prior crimes. 
    And this, of course, is exactly what happened in this particular case. 
    The Spencer case was a habitual criminal and multiple offender situation out of Texas. 
    And of course, here, we don’t have this case at all because, here, we have a situation where the only thing which is involved here is the question of the defendant’s prior offense coming into evidence where a defendant has not taken the stand, has not sought to offer any character evidence or anything of this type and what, in essence, has occurred is that the prosecution says “Well, since you, Mr. Defendant, made this statement during the course of this confession, we are entitled to bring it into evidence.”

    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    We submit that this actually leaves our question open. 
    And, as was pointed out in the dissent, it leaves the question open here and, as was stated in the dissenting opinion-- I have the language quoted in the brief. 
    “While this Court has never held that the use of prior convictions to show nothing more than a disposition to commit crime would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, our decisions exercising supervisory power over criminal trials in Federal Courts as well as decisions by Courts of Appeal and of State Courts suggest that evidence of prior crimes introduced for no purpose other than to show criminal disposition would violate the Due Process Clause and this, of course, is exactly the situations which--

    However, if Your Honors want some research on this, we would be glad to check the matter out and submit a supplemental brief in connection with the issue. 
    We came up solely on the basis of the prior offense coming into evidence which we felt was an unconstitutional Act on the part of the prosecution. 
    We raised it in a different vein. 
    There isn’t any question about that. 
    However, it really is a question of approach.

    Well, in the event, our rights of appeal would be terminated because we came up here in the normal course of the appellant review.

    Resort to habeas corpus in the Federal Court system to present the issue. 
    In other words, it would be just like a situation where, subsequent to Miranda, for example, a defendant was tried and he didn’t have adequate counsel and then he came in and sought to review it by way of habeas corpus in the Federal Court system.

    Only in the civil law area?
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="1337.367" stopTime="1346.046">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Yes, sir. 
    However, insofar as the law of crimes is concerned, it’s taken from the common law.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1346.046" stopTime="1352.709">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That’s interesting. 
    I suppose you’re sure about that?
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="1352.709" stopTime="1499.002">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Oh Yes, sir, absolutely. 
    Our civil law is based upon the Code of Napoleon which, in turn, is based upon the Code of Justinian. 
    However, in the law of crimes, our law is taken directly from the common law. 
    It is, of course, codified by statute today. 
    We respectfully urge Your Honors’ consideration of the issue which is raised and which was-- as was pointed out and raised for the first time in this application for a writ. 
    We respectfully request the indulgence of the Court for additional time within which to file a supplemental brief to research the issue raised in connection with the matter of jurisdiction. 
    It is, of course, true that the habeas corpus remedies which are available to petitioner have not been utilized. 
    However, we felt that in as much as the time for appeal had not yet run and in as much as the opportunity til-- still presented itself for this case to run began through the course of the appellate review, that we should ask for the application of the writ of certiorari, which we did. 
    And, of course, we realized that we did not raise this constitutional issue in the District Court or in the Supreme Court, but the issues is, nevertheless, existed in one which, we submit, should warrant Your Honors’ attention to the matter. 
    We submit it is a matter of prime importance. 
    It’s a matter which would have great effect in connection with prosecution of criminal cases, not only in Louisiana but in other jurisdictions. 
    What is the effect of prior offenses where the defendant has not taken the stand, has not put the issue of his character or reputation at evidence, and in the course of the confession, the defendant refers to the prior offense and the prosecution brings us out as a part of the confession as a whole. 
    We submit that the evidence which was taken in this case would warrant Your Honors’ taking cognizance of the matter and reversing it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1499.002" stopTime="1516.019">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose the purpose of the statute that requires that if any part of the confession is offered by the prosecution, then the entirety must be offered was, at least arguably, to protect the defendant in the case, wasn’t it?
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="1516.019" stopTime="1577.137">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Well, there isn’t any doubt in my mind, but that this was the intent of the statute. 
    As a matter of fact, we have cited the statute in the brief and, of course, here one phase of the statute is used against us, and this is the statute. 
    Every confession, admission, or declaration sought to be used against anyone must be used in its entirety so that the person to be affected thereby may have the benefit of any exculpation or explanation that the whole statement may afford. 
    So, actually, the exculpatory proviso of the statute is one which really requires the utilization of the confession as a whole and, here, the confession as a whole is being used to show that the defendant is a bad man.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Hufft.

    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    If Your Honor please, I represent the state in this matter. 
    Before starting out, I’d like to point just one brief comment with respect to Spencer. 
    Spencer was decided in January 23, 1967. 
    We argued this case before the Supreme Court of Louisiana in December 1967 and the opinion was handed down in January 15, 1968, almost a year after Spencer. 
    Now, just to review when --

    What would say-- you mean, that Spencer --

    And, Spencer was not relied on--

speaker="preston_h_hufft" startTime="1822.551" stopTime="1876.422">
    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    Spencer was not relied on. 
    The only constitutional issues raised, federal questions raised in the state proceedings was one on the question of the search warrants by the que-- of evidence and this Supreme Court that just decided the Warden case which was in point, and the State Supreme Court used that and disposed of the question of the search warrants. 
    He also raised the question with respect to Miranda that this case was instituted prior to Miranda, and the Supreme Court of our state made note of the fact that the Johnson case would apply since we got started before hand and, also, took special note, as we had also briefed, that even if this case had started after Miranda, this case met the test of Miranda. 
    I know that to really picture that the images go into the facts so we’ll see exactly what we’re dealing with here.

    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    Yes, well they were-- it’s one of the cases that-- it’s a California case about the drunken driver. 
    They did cite it, sir, in their opinion.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1892.199" stopTime="1894.505">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And had to do with hair and the blood of the victim?
speaker="preston_h_hufft" startTime="1894.505" stopTime="2121.207">
    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    Right, sir. 
    That, of course, the Warden case came in and we decided on the Warden case to eliminate all questions. 
    That was one of the cases cited, but the Warden case was compelling because we were-- they objected to the fact that we had issued search warrants in order to search for evidence, and we raised the Gouled case and the Warden case came out directly on point and we had no trouble whatsoever, at least our State Court didn’t, disposing of that question. 
    Now, these are the facts of the case. 
    This man lived in Marrero, Louisiana which is a Parish in Jefferson, right across the river from Louisia-- I mean, New Orleans. 
    Plaquemine Parish adjoins Jefferson Parish and also, in a little tip, adjoins New Orleans Parish. 
    This man came across the river from Jefferson Parish, went into the downtown area of New Orleans, picked up this girl in a bar, had-- this is the victim I’m talking about now, had several drinks with her, went from place to place. 
    During the course of the night, one witness identified that the man, the defendant, had stopped in for gas and then sped off and he heard the scream of a woman in the car that helped her out. 
    She was being held in the trunk. 
    It then develops that the defendant was-- admits being at the scene. 
    He admits the fact that he had blood on his hand, his car, his clothes, and the scene at which we found the victim. 
    He rode around town that night, finally fled the State of Louisiana, and we issued a warrant for his arrest. 
    Based on the information, the people who had seen them together at the bars and the nightclubs, the service attendant who recognized him, recognized his car, and so forth and so on. 
    He fled to finally wound up in the State of Arizona in Tucson. 
    One night, just walking down the street in Tucson, he flagged two policemen and said “Take me in, I’ve committed a crime.” 
    They said, “Wait a minute, let us give you your rights” and they gave the man his rights under Escobedo. 
    “In fact, you don’t have to say anything you say it, it can be used against you and you have a right to contact an attorney,” and they took the man in. 
    The man then still didn’t know what his choice, well at least the police didn’t. 
    The police had a difficult time to verify the choice because the man said that he had committed a crime in New Orleans Parish. 
    Well, not knowing to him, he had just crossed the line and had murdered the girl in Plaquemine Parish. 
    So, the police in Tucson didn’t’ really had the opportunity to either check his stories and see why he was wanted. 
    Now, in Tucson, talking to these policemen, in which, our State Court, and the Trial Court also, said it was a very relaxed conversation. 
    He was a man who wanted to get something off of his chest. 
    He’s a man who flagged the policeman down, the man who wanted to talk about something that had occurred, to talk to the policeman who knew nothing about it. 
    And, our Court and the State Supreme Court ruled, of course, the Johnson case was applicable where they said even in the-- over and above the Johnson case, they felt this confession met that comment in the Miranda case, that you don’t have to stop a man when he walks to the police and flags you down and wants to get something off of his chest. 
    So, in this writ, there’s no issue raised whatsoever as to the voluntary nature of this confession and this confession meets all the tests of being voluntary. 
    The only issue arises are the following testimony in which this police officer from Tucson gave the defendant’s confession. 
    Included in that confession, was this comment and I’ll read it for the Court. 
    This is the police officer talking.

    They asked him if wel-- weather or not he had walked in this-- I’ll just put it this way now. 
    During the course of his relating the confession, when the police officer arrived at the point in which he was then going to relate this comment relative to the previous incident, the defense objected and has a long protracted argument. 
    And, after the Court had ruled that this was admissible on the basis that it was part of the confession and under the state statute, it-- the confession had to be used in its entirety and this was admissible. 
    So, this picks up right after the argument in the decision of the trial judge that that question was admissible.

    There may have been.

    I believe there was a particular question because it has been raised at-- earlier in the preliminary statement, in order to introduce the profession, it had been mentioned in the preliminary statement and an argument had ensued on that basis. 
    This statement had been mentioned when the judge took under the questions whether or not the confession was voluntary, and this comes now for the first time that the jury has heard this actual testimony and I would imagine to say it was in the form of a question, knowing the stopping, so as to make certain that all the arguments are presented thereto.

    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    Well, Mr. Justice, I’ll say this. 
    We had two bases upon which we said this testimony was admissible. 
    Were very strong then and very strong now. 
    This testimony was admissible because the law said in the State of Louisiana that, to use the confession, you’ve got to use the confession in its entirety. 
    Secondly, and we argued very strenuously and still do here, that this testimony was appropriate, was admissible because it intended to show motive and intent.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2339.959" stopTime="2340.108">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That --
speaker="preston_h_hufft" startTime="2340.108" stopTime="2341.446">
    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    This was one of those instances --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2341.446" stopTime="2343.549">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That he made a business of murdering women?
speaker="preston_h_hufft" startTime="2343.549" stopTime="2345.773">
    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    That’s what I -- when you look at the circumstances--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2345.773" stopTime="2347.848">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is that what you -- the impression you were giving the jury?
speaker="preston_h_hufft" startTime="2347.848" stopTime="2372.079">
    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    Well, again, the circumstance is so. 
    When you read his statement in which he says exactly what took place in this prior incident, what took place in a crime in which we’ve charged him, they’re almost identical incidents. 
    And, we show that this man, on the basis that someone would complain against him, and these are his very words I’m going to read you, “would take a gun and kill that person for having complained against him.” 
    And, we say that’s essential.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2372.079" stopTime="2375.247">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So, you’re not leaving -- you’re not relying on the statute.
speaker="preston_h_hufft" startTime="2375.247" stopTime="2379.803">
    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    Sir, we had two bases. 
    The statute said we had to do it and we also say it’s admissible.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2379.803" stopTime="2381.575">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I see.
speaker="preston_h_hufft" startTime="2381.575" stopTime="2485.629">
    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    Now, this is the man’s statement, if I get back to it. 
    “Yes, he did. 
    He told me that, several months prior to this taking place, he picked up a woman whom he described as a prostitute downtown in New Orleans, that after having several drinks together, they had intercourse and then, in his statement in his own words, she went down on me. 
    He then said that an argument-- that after an argument that she slapped him and he backed-hand her. 
    Then, he said that, a while later, she signed a complaint against him for backhanding her and that he received the sentence of 90 days. 
    Of which, he did 45. 
    He said that, immediately after getting out of jail from doing the 45 days, that he went out and got a gun and looked for two or three nights for her downtown in the area where he had first seen her with the intention of killing her because she had signed a complaint against him.” 
    Present case, the facts almost identical because we have no witness to say what really happened in that argument view because this victim we have wasn’t quite as fortunate as the first woman. 
    He didn’t find her. 
    The victim we have in the second question was murdered. 
    Now, that was the -- this is the entire statement. 
    That -- what I just read is the entire statement the jury heard with reference to this. 
    We say that, under our statute, we had no alternative. 
    We had to produce he’s statement in its entirety. 
    So, where the lower Court ruled, that’s the way the Supreme Court of Louisiana ruled in a long line of decisions.

    Yes, I noticed here that, actually, the state knew about the previous offense and its relationship with this other woman, as appears on page 509 of the typed transcript, that that was elicited by -- from the police officer, the Tucson police officer, by question of the prosecuting attorney.

    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    Yes, as I said before, if Your Honor please, they had given the background when this was mentioned in the old case in which we had to mention, in order to have it, appear in the trial and use it. 
    When it was mentioned that it was considerable argument as to whether or not this police officer could state this part of the confession, when the confession was heard by the trial judge as to whether or not it was voluntary, argument ensued on this particular point. 
    When the thing was founded presented to the jury, the trial judge had ruled. 
    It went on into the confession and then came this point, and it came at this point with the question where it was stopped on the basis that defendant, again, raised their objection when it was being presented to the jury -- the presence of the jury. 
    He objected three times. 
    And, it was in the course knowing when these objections were coming out and affording the defendant the opportunity --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes, I understand, but I suppose that it’s at least arguable that the question is, what is the confession? 
    Now, when you have a written confession that is a confession, when you have a police officer testifying as to what the defendant told him, I suppose it’s questionable as to what is the -- it’s arguable anyway that, what is the confession within the meaning and intendment of this Louisiana statute? 
    He might have told him all sorts of things that, all lawyers would agree, are not admissible in the course of the conversation between the defendant and the police officer, isn’t that conceivable?

speaker="preston_h_hufft" startTime="3019.155" stopTime="3235.134">
    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    Thank you, sir. 
    That the Spencer case applicable in this instance would uphold this statute of the State of Louisiana, and I refer to this particular language in the statute that it would be wholly unjustified, encroached by this Court upon the constitutional powers of the states to promulgate their own rules of evidence to try their own state created crimes in their own State Courts. 
    I also point out that the Berget case was -- this Court decided after the Spencer decision, I take no issue with that case either. 
    The Berget case found that there was a specific federal constitutional right involved. 
    The question of this defendant had been denied the right of counsel in one of his state prosecutions, and that this Court wasn’t going to allow error to be piled on top of an error and allow him to be denied it at a second time and, rightfully so, in the Berget case. 
    We also take the position that even under the minority decision in the Spencer case, that this evidence which we introduced meets the test that this Court was talking about in all of its decisions. 
    This information was essential. 
    This -- under the state law in which this man was being prosecuted, he was charged with murder. 
    Under our State Code, murder is the killing of a human being when the offender has a specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm. 
    In furtherance of carrying out our responsibility to prove intent as a necessary ingredient of the crime of murder, this evidence was inadmissible. 
    I’ve cited several state cases directly on point in which they deal with the question that when intent is a necessary ingredient of the crime charged, it’s something which goes to the determination of the issue directly before the jury with respect to intent, that it is admissible in a long list of cases in our jurisprudence, and those cases have also been recognized by this Court that they are exceptions to that general rule. 
    We say we fall under it, number one, because it’s our statute. 
    It would not be within the providence of this Court to rewrite that statute under Spencer. 
    Secondly, even if this Court were to say that that statute would be unconstitutional, we say that this evidence is admissible. 
    On the other decisions of this Court and other State Court, on the basis that we were showing motive and intent, and when you look at the brief -- in my brief, if Your Honors please, on page 18, I’ve laid side-by-side the facts in this case in which we charge this man with murder and the facts of the previous incident. 
    He’s come across the river, the same area of town, picks up a girl in the same area, has drinks with her, commits certain acts, one winds up where she complains, he gets a gun and goes out with intent to kill her because she complained of his conduct. 
    And, we say the second girl wasn’t quite so lucky.

    Now, we say this draws a definite parallel and this is essential information. 
    It was information that the state was required to put in, in order to prove intent and we carried our responsibility with respect thereto.

    Mr. Preston H. Hufft 
    Well, all I say is that’s the conclusion I reached, and that’s why it’s not mentioned in there, if Your Honor please. 
    I make this argument when we mentioned Witherspoon before. 
    I mentioned it here because some question was raised as to whether or not a state had shifted its position in a question raised about fairness. 
    I know the -- in the Berget place, we were -- the Court says we are not be concerned with the question of good faith, but I wanted to bring up one thing with Witherspoon. 
    We have met the requirements of Witherspoon in this very case which was long before this Court decided Witherspoon. 
    We have a statute similar to Illinois and Louisiana. 
    We had a man who said he was opposed to capital punishment. 
    We questioned the man until he finally reached the point when he said “Well, I couldn’t, under any circumstances,” and we allowed that man go and we did not charge him, and such a juror did serve in this case.

   Rebuttal of Nathan Greenberg
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3510.433" stopTime="3511.734">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Greenberg.
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="3511.734" stopTime="3581.883">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    May it please the Court. 
    I merely would like to call two matters to the Court’s attention. 
    At page 4 and 5 of the appendix, we set forth the chronology of events and, in the bottom of page 4, it indicates that the case was concluded Friday, May 6, that the defendant -- of 1966, the defendant was sentenced to death on July 19, 1966. 
    And, on October 6, 1966, the per curiam on the Bill of Exceptions were signed by the Trial Court. 
    Now, under Louisiana law, the rule which was in existence at that time was that, upon signing of the Bill of Exceptions, a Trial Court is divested of jurisdiction and any Bills filed thereafter and presented to the judge for his signature in per curiam come too late and cannot be considered on appeal. 
    And, this is the decision of State versus Harrell, 228 Louisiana 434, 82 Southern 2nd 701. 
    Now --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3581.883" stopTime="3585.604">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is it true they even recommended that there’d be admissions to get into a law?
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="3585.604" stopTime="3653.269">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Yes, sir, absolutely. 
    Now, the law has since been changed in Louisiana. 
    We now have a new Code of Criminal Procedure. 
    However, this case was tried prior to the effective date of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
    Spencer versus the State of Texas, which focused attention on the issue raised herein, was decided -- or it was rather argued on October 17 and 8, 1966 and was decided January 23, 1967 which, of course, was subsequent to the taking of the appeal, the filing of the Bills of Exceptions, and the rendition of the per curiam by the Trial Court. 
    And, we also wish to call Your Honors’ attention to the decision of O’Conner versus Ohio decided by Your Honors in 1966, 87 Supreme Court 252, 385 US 92, in which case Your Honors actually took jurisdiction of a matter which have not been raised in the Trial Court and held that, since the defendant was not in the position to literally foresee the action which Your Honors were going to take in this particular case --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3653.269" stopTime="3655.705">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That’s got something to do with the comment rule.

    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3655.922" stopTime="3658.811">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You had a comment rule on the defendant’s failure to testify which is --
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="3658.811" stopTime="3660.101">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Yes, and we respect--
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3660.101" stopTime="3664.205">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Really the Spencer case, it’s more of the Spencer dissent that you rely on, isn’t it?
speaker="nathan_greenberg" startTime="3664.205" stopTime="3677.628">
    Mr. Nathan Greenberg 
    Yes, sir. 
    We actually pinpoint the issue in the Spencer dissent which, literally, focused its attention on it. 
    We respectfully urge favorable consideration of our application. 
    Thank you, Your Honors.
