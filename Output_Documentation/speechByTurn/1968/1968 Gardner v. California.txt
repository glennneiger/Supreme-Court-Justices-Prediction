Gardner v. California
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="13.873">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 73, Robert Newton Gardner, Jr., Petitioner versus California. 
    Mr. Rickershauser?
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="13.873" stopTime="210.512">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court. 
    This is a case involving the right of an indigent California prisoner to a free transcript of his hearing out of petition for habeas corpus in the California Superior Court. 
    That petitioner alleged insufficient access to legal materials and to the courts. 
    The issue in this case is whether under the facts of the case, petitioner can obtain an adequate appellate review consistent with due process and equal protection under the California habeas corpus procedures where a non-indigent prisoner could have purchased this transcript. 
    But the appellate procedures in California relating to habeas corpus cases are not conditioned as a matter of law on the availability of that transcript. 
    Following the hearing, the Superior Court denied the petitioners petition for a writ of habeas corpus. 
    Petitioner then filed a written motion for a free transcript alleging his lack of funds, his need for the transcript to prove his case claims in the California Supreme Court and to assist him in the preparation of his case. 
    Petitioner did not then and does not now complain about the hearing, but instead contends the evidence will prove his habeas corpus contentions. 
    Petitioner in his motion raised the federal questions presented here citing authorities. 
    The Superior Court denied that motion by written order stating among other things that none of the proceedings in that court would be of concern to the California Appellate Courts. 
    Petitioner sought review of that denial of his motion for a free transcript by petitioning for writ of certiorari in the California Court of Appeal, which was denied. 
    Petitioner then sought a hearing in the California Supreme Court which was denied. Both of those denials were without opinion. 
    Petitioner then petitioned this court for a writ of certiorari, which was granted after a response was filed by the State of California upon request. 
    This court then appointed counsel, the only time the petitioner has been represented in these proceedings by counsel except at the hearing on his petition for the writ of habeas corpus in the California Superior Court. 
    It is a transcript of that hearing for the purpose of presenting his contentions for habeas corpus to the California Appellate Courts, this Court and if necessary the lower federal courts that petitioner is here seeking. 
    It seems clear under various decisions of this Court most recent prominent one of which is Long versus District Court 385 U.S. 192 that if the Californian habeas corpus procedure was a traditional appellate procedure, equal protection would require that this transcript be furnished to petitioner so that he could have the same means of pursuing his remedies as man with means to purchase the transcript. 
    The difference if any, in this case is that habeas corpus in California is termed as a theoretical matter to be an original writ procedure in each of the court's of California and theoretically --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="210.512" stopTime="239.120">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You say that is theoretical, that is fact; isn't it; in other words and it works. 
    It may work to the benefit of the applicant because if this is not an appeal but rather an original new application for habeas corpus in the second court then the applicant is free to bring in additional material, which he would not normally be free to do, if this were simply a review of the District Court action.
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="239.120" stopTime="286.895">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    That is true Mr. Justice Stewart but in practice it seems to me we have to look at the California procedure and see how it usually works and I think we will see that is very much like an appellate procedure in the usual case and of course even if it isn't I think the petitioner has shown his need for that transcript to prepare for the appellate court review, but if I might I'd like to point out that even though the petitioner is theoretically able to proceed and either the Superior Court or the Appellate Courts of California in an original proceedings, as a general matter and the usual practice as established in the State's brief here as referred to, is that the Appellate Courts will require him to start in the trial court. 
    So the next aspect --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="286.895" stopTime="289.864">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's not unlike the Federal system I expect.
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="289.864" stopTime="290.576">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="290.576" stopTime="326.111">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Where I think I'm right in saying that under the statute an original writ of habeas corpus could be brought either to Federal District Court or before a Circuit Judge or the whole Court of Appeals or before any Justice or before this whole Court, but the practice is that it's authorized by the statute of Federal system to transfer any such applications filed in the particular Circuit Judges or Supreme Court Justices to transfer it to the District Court, is that more or less the California practice?
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="326.111" stopTime="343.152">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    I believe the more common practice is to deny the application for habeas corpus, it's referred to a footnote in the State's brief on the ground that he should proceed in the trial court, absent some unusual circumstances of the trial court would not act.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="343.152" stopTime="353.923">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of course in the Federal system, there is provision for appeals from denials of habeas corpus and as I understand it in California there's no appeal from a denial.
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="353.923" stopTime="356.349">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    There is an appeal by the State if the petition is granted.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="356.349" stopTime="359.572">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, I'm not appealed for the denial asset of habeas corpus is that correct?
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="359.572" stopTime="383.758">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    Well, that is correct. 
    However, in many times the subsequent proceedings in the Appellate Court have the same effect as an appeal, because the Appellate Courts often limit their review to the record before the trial court and that is all that was asked here since there was no complaint about the hearing in the trial court or that it was insufficient or that additional evidence would be required in the Appellate Court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="383.758" stopTime="400.825">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, as I read your trial judge's order, he may clear that the appellate court if it so minded was free to ask for the transcript of what had gone on in the habeas corpus proceeding in the Trial Court, didn't I read that correctly, I don't have it.
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="400.825" stopTime="429.589">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    That is correct Mr. Justice. 
    The Appellate Court could have ordered that transcript. 
    Our position is that in order to get the Appellate Court to take the case is essential to this indigent petitioner to have that transcript available both in aid of preparation of his case and in establishing his case at the discretion of the Appellate Court to take it or not because --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="429.589" stopTime="433.027">

    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    No sir. 
    This petition for habeas corpus contented that he was denied insufficient access to the Courts and to legal materials, which had it been established, I assume would have then proceeded to attack his prior conviction and well he's in on two different crimes one of which he pleaded guilty to.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="465.957" stopTime="494.920">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Rickershauser, do you know whether this procedure that my brother Stewart was talking about is peculiar to California whether there are other States and if so how many? 
    You have the same procedure that is to say that don't permit appeals and post conviction proceedings, but that do provide for original proceedings in the Superior Court.
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="494.920" stopTime="505.596">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    I'm sorry Mr. Justice Fortas I do not know the answer to that question. 
    I'd attempt to supply it if you would desire me to do so.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="505.596" stopTime="507.973">

    I would be interested in having that, yes.

    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    Alright.

    Where does that show in the record that the Appellate Court denied a hearing on your application?
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="657.681" stopTime="680.415">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    Well, the only proceeding that's before the court in this case is the request for the hearing. 
    I believe the court could take notice of the fact that two other petitions for certiorari are pending in this court at this time relating to the subsequent proceedings in this petitioner's attempt to obtain habeas corpus --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="680.415" stopTime="702.412">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I thought what we had here and perhaps not quite wrong, I thought what we had here was simply the denial of the trial court to supply your client a free transcript of the hearing to be used by him in his new application for habeas corpus in the appellate court. 
    I thought that's what we had before us here.
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="702.412" stopTime="745.095">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    Well it's really arguable I guess what you have before you because the petitioner took that denial to the California Court of Appeal by writ of certiorari and then took that to the Supreme Court of California by petition for a hearing, both of which were denied. 
    He then came here for a writ of certiorari which was granted. Direct to the Superior Court of California although we have treated it in our brief as directed to the Supreme Court, I think it would apply to either case, either court. 
    Now subsequently he has pursued his habeas corpus remedies in the California appellate courts and has filed some petitions for certiorari. 
    Those -- that is not this case, those cases are pending here.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="745.095" stopTime="767.045">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But this case is an attack, is it not upon the denial of the trial court by request for a free, for a free transcript of the habeas corpus proceedings in the trial court to be used by your client, he says necessary for him to have in order to file an application for habeas corpus in the appellate court?
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="767.045" stopTime="907.829">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    That is correct Mr. Justice. 
    Point where I was discussing that the fact that the California procedure has developed appellate similarities, I do not think is required in establishing our case. 
    We do not ask this court to say that California in fact has an appellate remedy; we're just showing that it has some of the same aspects and is therefore makes the need for this transcript even greater under those circumstances, and it is not always the tradition to grant separate hearings to consider these records separately. 
    I think the basic considerations underlying the transcript cases, which are that an indigent prisoner is to be afforded an adequate means of review in the appellate courts as a man with means, require the furnishing of this transcript. 
    It seems to us that the facts of this case uniquely demonstrate the essential aspect of this transcript. 
    This petitioner in his habeas corpus petition is asking, is claiming that he is denied access to the courts. 
    This is obviously a problem with complexity in which the courts must weigh his liberty and his rights against the right of the institutional authorities to run the prison, a complex problem and it is exceedingly -- it is almost unbelievable that a man who had means would not purchase the transcript of this hearing in the trial court in order to assist him in the preparation of his papers in the appellate courts. 
    And also to demonstrate to the appellate courts how it is that he was denied access to, which would certainly be of assistance to a court in determining whether or not there was the kind of denial of access that would be a deprivation of his rights. 
    It is our view therefore that there is that kind of invidious discrimination between the prisoner of means and the prisoner without means that the transcript cases have discussed.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="907.829" stopTime="931.548">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Rickershauser, do you know what happens in the Supreme Court of California when a habeas petition is filed, and the court decides to hear it, does the court hear it, suppose the evidence has to be taken, do they ever take evidence before the court, do they appoint a master?
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="931.548" stopTime="942.928">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    My understanding Mr. Justice Fortas is that a master is appointed or a referee, and that a transcript is obtained of that proceeding, which is then reviewed by the court to the extent necessary to reach a decision.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="942.928" stopTime="950.275">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    hey don't customarily then rely on the transcript of the lower courts?
speaker="charles_e_rickershauser_jr" startTime="950.275" stopTime="1029.297">
    Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr. 
    Well there are circuit court, Court of Appeals cases in which they have relied on it, and I am sure they would in this case had they granted a hearing because the petitioner doesn't seek to establish anything beyond that transcript. 
    This isn't a case where he is asking for the transcript in order to comment for errors that he might then urge on in an appellate court. 
    I can't, that's obviously some speculation as to what they would do. 
    I would like to mention one or two of the state's contentions, first one of which significant seems to be that there are not sufficient particular allegations of the need for the transcript. 
    We feel that a layman with a problem such as this trying to establish that he does not have adequate access to the courts when on the face of it he is in court, has alleged all that any layman ought to have to allege in expressing his need for this transcript, especially when he contends that he is willing to rely on it and that he had a fair hearing in that trial court.

    The difficulty I have with that here is that there is no adequate alternative that we are able to determine to and none has been offered. 
    The only discussion if any is that the petitioner alleged with particularity what happened at the hearing. 
    This I think is an undue burden upon him, one that a man with means would not assume and that they're, therefore that there is the kind of discrimination without alternatives that the transcript cases require in this court and an opinion below should be – the decision below should be reversed.

   Argument of Jack K. Weber

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Weber.
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="1581.871" stopTime="1627.626">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    Mr. Chief Justice, May it please to court. 
    Permit me to begin by attempting to distinguish Long versus District Court of Iowa and to explain something of our California procedures in the process of doing that. 
    The obvious distinction between Long and the situation here is that California does have habeas corpus and Iowa had an appeal procedure. 
    However permit me to emphasize the significance of that difference. 
    When you have an appeal although it is possible to hear the matter on a clerk's transcript, in the ordinary case, the focus is on the trial court below, the proceedings there, and the reporter's transcript of those proceeding and --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1627.626" stopTime="1633.781">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You are talking about an appeal from a denial of habeas corpus, you are not talking about an appeal from a conviction?
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="1633.781" stopTime="1723.192">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    That's right, yes sir. 
    And the focus of the court is to review the proceedings below to determine whether or not there was error and in order to do that you look at the transcript. 
    However in California we have an entirely different procedure where the proceedings below are entirely tangential and collateral. 
    There the court doesn't necessarily review the proceeding below, it receives allegations from the petitioner and it tests those allegations to determine their sufficiency and because of that, because the court relies on allegations it does not necessarily need a transcript to resolve the issues. 
    There is another aspect of this difference also. 
    The habeas corpus procedure has multiple stages, the first stage is a pleading stage, after that the court gets into the process of determining the truth of the allegations that it has not denied the petition. 
    Thus in this initial stage, the court does not require proof, it does not require evidence, it does not require a procedure for submitting the matter in any particular way. 
    It can proceed to determine the sufficiency of the allegations just by reading the allegations and this is the normal, the meaningful and the usual way to proceed in habeas corpus matters.

    Mr. Jack K. Weber

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Do you know Mr. Weber the answer of the question or not, Mr. Justice Fortas just asked whether other states have the same procedure?
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2398.833" stopTime="2435.741">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    I made a very quick canvas of laws of the other states and there are a few, I think there's about five or so that still retain the common law procedure, many of the others have adopted by statute an appeal procedure, some others have converted writ review procedures into something that is virtually or equivalent to an appeal. 
    I think North Dakota has something that they call a Power of Superintending Control which is in effect a kind of appeal procedure.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2435.741" stopTime="2465.885">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But at the time this appellate procedure was established in California, habeas corpus did not have the scope that it has now, did it? 
    In those days all of -- you could prove on, habeas corpus was always necessary for the state to prove, as in a warrant of arrest had been issued and the man had been then arraigned and so forth and if those things had been complied with, the writ is denied, isn't that right?

    A moment ago, a moment ago you referred to what would go on in the Supreme Court of California after the petitioner files his petition for habeas corpus there after it is denied in the lower court.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, as a matter of practice, if I petition for habeas corpus in the Superior Court and I am denied after a hearing and then I file petition for habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of California, well in the Appellate Court and then the Supreme Court. 
    I finally file one at the Supreme Court of California and all I do is make the -- put the same allegations in it that I put in the Superior Court, that's all I did. 
    Now if the Supreme Court of California thinks those allegations are sufficient to grant the writ if they are true, what do they do at that point?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the Supreme Court of California at that point if they think that they need some that if there is some; they need to find out whether these allegations are true or false. 
    Do they ever call for the transcript of the lower court?
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2602.420" stopTime="2606.580">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    I don't recall any cases off hand where they have called for the transcript.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    So if their exclusive method of resolving evidentiary conflicts in the Supreme Court on petitions for habeas corpus where the state and the petitioner cannot agree from the facts. 
    The exclusive method resolving those is by having a hearing there before a referee and they make their own resolution of the facts.
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2631.104" stopTime="2644.944">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    That's generally speaking true although it's possible that one of the parties will supply a transcript of what occurred to the court, so that it can use that in making determinations of the fact.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2644.944" stopTime="2658.419">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And if, but I don't suppose that if either party refused to accept that transcript, I suppose there would have to be a new hearing?
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2658.419" stopTime="2679.520">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    Well, I don't know of any cases in which the California Supreme Court has dealt with that particular problem overtly. 
    I suppose that if it was a certified transcript by a reporter there wouldn't normally be any issue as to its validity, it doesn't -- it's not something that arises too often.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2679.520" stopTime="2706.289">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But do you think there is any more or likely that the Supreme Court would grant a petition for habeas corpus filed in that court if the petitioner there can make allegations about what went on in the lower court?
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2706.289" stopTime="2723.307">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    I think that the likelihood of a hearing in the State Supreme Court would depend on the substantive claims more than anything else. 
    It would depend whether he has sufficiently stated that he has been deprived certain constitutional rights.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2723.307" stopTime="2745.543">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if you were representing an individual petitioning for habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of California after a denial in the Superior Court? 
    Would you think the transcript of what went on before the Superior Court in that evidentiary hearing there, would that transcript be useful?
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2745.543" stopTime="2761.555">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    In most cases, I think it would not. 
    There is some possibility that you could find something in there that might interest or intrigue the Supreme Court, but I think that possibility is sufficiently remote and speculative that it would be out waived --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2761.555" stopTime="2811.330">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Hold on Mr. Weber let's take a rather simple case. 
    Suppose his allegation is, I was tried and convicted and did not have the assistance of counsel and that's his petition for habeas corpus in the Superior Court, there is a hearing in the Superior Court or does it, at the conclusion of the hearing the trial judge concludes that the fact that is contrary he did have the assistance of counsel. 
    Now he then goes in the Supreme Court with the identical petition, I didn't have the assistance of counsel at my trial and suggesting that in the face of a finding to the contrary that the Supreme Court would be interested with the transcript to go ahead and have it's own hearing in that petition.
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2811.330" stopTime="2825.863">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    Well, there if the allegation was sufficient they would call for a rule to show cause and the state well, I suppose it responds, he did have counsel and you would say I suppose you would say --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2825.863" stopTime="2835.106">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Justice Marshall you might have the transcript and you could say or without the transcript you could say it was found in the contrary in lower court.
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2835.106" stopTime="2839.622">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    Well, you could just get the records from Superior Court filed from the original trial.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2839.622" stopTime="2860.164">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if you did what if you did get the record and you attached a part of the transcript to your return, so he did have counsel and here is what was found by the Superior Court.
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2860.164" stopTime="2875.778">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    Well, if the court would normally rely on the Superior Court's records unless they are disputed by the petitioner in some way, I suppose that if he says that the records are a lie that some sort of a hearing would be necessary to determine the accuracy of the records.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2875.778" stopTime="2891.106">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So are you suggesting though then that hypothetical case, the Supreme Court might not deny on the basis -- deny the petition or deny a hearing on the basis of the hearing in the Superior Court?
speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2891.106" stopTime="2913.347">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    I've never known the Supreme Court to expressly deny a hearing based on a hearing in the Superior Court. 
    Of course, I don't know of any cases in which they've discussed the points at all. 
    So that it is largely a matter of trying to guess what goes in the minds of the justices there.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Weber suppose all of the facts stated in the petition in the Superior Court were true; would the Supreme Court -- would they be sufficient to grant a hearing in the Supreme Court.

speaker="jack_k_weber" startTime="2937.202" stopTime="2976.458">
    Mr. Jack K. Weber 
    Well, this is an unusual situation, because between the time that the petition was presented in the Superior Court and the time that the Supreme Court received the substantive allegations, it came down with a major pronouncement in this area affecting inmate rights and that determination was against the petitioner, so that the legal situation had changed considerably and I think that the State Supreme Court could have utilized its very recent decisions to deny the petition without a hearing in this particular case.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2976.458" stopTime="2990.427">
    Justice Abe Fortas
