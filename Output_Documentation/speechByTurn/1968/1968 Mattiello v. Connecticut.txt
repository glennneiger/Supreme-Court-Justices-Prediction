    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 150, Francis Mattiello appellant versus Connecticut. 
    Mr. Grosby.

    Mr. Robert N. Grosby 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The appellant in this case was arrested in March of 1966 and charged with violation of Section 17-379 Connecticut General Statutes -- statute causing the arrest and imprisonment of someone who is in manifest danger of falling into vise or is living a vicious life. 
    The appellant file a demur to this information on two grounds. 
    One was that its terms are vague and uncertain in meaning, thereby depriving here of due process; The second ground for demur was that the statute discriminates against certain females; that is unmarried females between the ages of 18 and 21 without basis for its support and thereby denying equal protection. 
    On the same day, the demur was filed, the State of Connecticut filed a substitute information alleging two additional charges. 
    One was violation of Section 53-219 of the general statutes that statute entitled “lascivious carriage and fornication”, and Section 53-175 of the statutes which is the disorderly conduct statute, the demur was overruled, the plaintiff pleaded not guilty to all charges elected a trial to the Court was found guilty of 17-379, guilty of 53-219, and not guilty of disorderly conduct. 
    And her sentence was commitment to the study -- the Connecticut State Farm for Women. 
    I think all parties agree that these sentences were concurrent under applicable Connecticut law.

    How is that work by look to the Connecticut statute and found some difficulty? 
    Well, I -- as far as the city is carriage charge, they maximum term that she could get is two years (Inaudible) arise under the manifest danger although never the statute, she got a free of sentence.

    And then how they concur it?
speaker="robert_n_grosby" startTime="158.855" stopTime="192.320">
    Mr. Robert N. Grosby 
    Except this way that at the time of sentencing, the applicable law was that the sentence on lascivious carriage could also be for three years to the reformatory. 
    Recent developments particularly the cases we cited in our reply brief, two federal District Court cases and two Connecticut Superior Court cases have held that by compelling a three-year sentence on lascivious carriage, that say discrimination against the female because boys can only be convicted for two years under the applicable statute for boys. 
    So, that --

    And -- Well, not with respect to 17-379. 
    17-379 Your Honor deals only with manifest danger. 
    Now, 17-360 says that a female over the age of 16 who has been convicted of a misdemeanor and lascivious carriage as a misdemeanor can go to the Connecticut State Farm for three years. 
    17-390 says that a young boy who is convicted of a misdemeanor can go to the reformatory for two years. 
    Therefore, subsequent cases --

    Mr. Robert N. Grosby 
    Yes, sir. 
    The young boy convicted of lascivious carriage or fornication could be sentence to two years at the reformatory while a young girl convicted of the same statute could be sentence to three, and these cases in our reply brief said, this is improper and that two is the maximum sentence for girls as well as boys. 
    So, that it appears that the sentences were no longer concurrent when this new law was developed.

    We take the position that two years have expired and that if the maximum sentence on lascivious carriage which is two years has expired and the only thing that's holding her now is her conviction on manifest danger and therefore, we take the position that if you reverse that conviction, she'll be set at liberty.

    Ah, the lascivious carriage commitment statute as supplied by recent decision as two years. 
    The manifest danger statute says until age 21. 
    We do have interpretations and they're in the record that three years is the maximum on either. 
    So, that she is liable for the lascivious carriage statute until June 9, 1969 and the lascivious carriage conviction is maximum sentence we feel has expired on June 9, 1968.

speaker="robert_n_grosby" startTime="437.546" stopTime="554.389">
    Mr. Robert N. Grosby 
    Yes, sir. 
    Oh, I think the Court anticipated the jurisdictional question when you raise the four questions that you asked us to answer in connection with our further jurisdictional statement and to clarify this once again. 
    We take the position that the sentences are separate sentences that she's serving her sentence under lascivious carriage and manifest danger at the sentences at once initially were concurrent that her maximum sentence on lascivious carriage has expired and that she is only on parole on a conviction on manifest danger. 
    Our brief on the merits that makes three points; the first one was whether manifest danger statute is a penal statute and we cover that because the appellate division of the Circuit Court in its memorandum decided that that is not a penal statute, it's a remedial statute, and therefore it was not necessary for them to take up the constitutional questions. 
    We claim that this is a statute that provides for the deprivation of liberty and therefore the due process provisions of the constitution must apply whether Connecticut chooses to call as remedial or penal. 
    Our second point is that the terms have vise and vicious life rendered that manifest danger statute avoid for vagueness because they fail to avoid the accused. 
    They steer clear standard of conduct. 
    Now, we claim that this statute is so vague that an unmarried female of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning, and we claim that the trier of fact has no standard by which the judge a case and there's no standard by which to charge the jury.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="554.389" stopTime="559.456">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Have there been any Connecticut decisions construing the statute?

    Mr. Robert N. Grosby 
    No, sir, I have not. 
    I listen to the argument yesterday of the construing by the Illinois Supreme Court of that statute but we have none. 
    There has been no adjudication and there's no way that any of our courts have ever set forth a definition of manifest danger falling at the vise or vicious life.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think vise lascivious may -- to either go on, could even imagine a situation that would be covered by this provision I guess vise or a vicious life?
speaker="robert_n_grosby" startTime="642.067" stopTime="726.711">
    Mr. Robert N. Grosby 
    I do sir. 
    I may have some personal precollection as to what is vise or vagueness and I'm sure a trial judge would too. 
    But until there's a definite definition by a statute or perhaps a construction by of court, I think its void on its face and this is the position that be raise squarely by our demur. 
    And this is why we presented no facts to the appellate division. 
    The third point in our brief is that the manifest danger statute applies only to men -- only to girls and not to men. 
    A young man cannot be convicted of his habits of falling into vise or vicious life. 
    He must first be convicted of a substantive crime and the same with married women in order to be -- convicted a married woman must first be convicted of a substantive crime before she could be sent to the reformatory. 
    We submit that female vises are no more dangerous than male vises and we see and confine no substantial or natural difference germane to the subject, which justify a sexual differentiation.

   Argument of George F. Carroll, Jr.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Carroll.
speaker="george_f_carroll_jr" startTime="858.819" stopTime="957.379">
    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    There is really no quarrel about the facts as recited by Mr. Grosby. 
    The state does however wants to -- I would do respect correct two things in those facts and that is the age of statute. 
    53-379 was originally passed in 1905 in substantially its present form and Mr. Grosby's reference to the states brief in terms of legislative history really was in connection with 17-360 which is the commitment vehicle statute. 
    So, that the statute really goes back to 1905, the words “manifest danger” falling in to habits of vise, but that's when they first appear as far as I know in our law. 
    There is another dispute or -- I don't think it's really a dispute but it disparity in facts. 
    This girl was 17 when she was convicted and as I set forth in our brief, her birthday was April 15, 1949 and there's a great deal of confusion even in the record and in the decision of our appellate division. 
    I believe they say that she was 18 but that is incorrect. 
    She was born 1949 convicted in June of 1966.

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr.

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    So, you have a certain dilemma there and in our brief in appendix A, we set forth in Attorney General's opinion in which he said the numbers of the statutes were different then, but I don't think there's any quarrel about this. 
    If the girl becomes 21 first, then she has to be release or three years.

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    Which ever is earlier and I set that forth in my brief as an opinion but it's but -- just by the Attorney General's opinion and I don't think there's any real quarrel about that. 
    Now, in terms -- if your question her age would have an effect on that. 
    In other words, if she's 17 as I claim she is and she was, she's born 1949, then her time would be up in three years that when she reach 21. 
    So, she'd be release in -- or she'd be free from parole in June of 1969.

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    And that's our main argument if I may that this conviction and sentence stand an independent state grounds; namely the conviction on lascivious carriage charge under 53-219. 
    Now, that is -- that statute was -- she received the concurrent sentence and the sentencing provisions again are under 17-360. 
    The same sentencing vehicle or the same sentencing maximum sentence, namely the three years are applicable to this girl and she was discharged of which she was convicted lascivious carriage at the same trial was not appealed. 
    There's no appeal from that statute. 
    There's no habeas corpus involved in it. 
    And in addition to Mr. Justice White's noting the fact that there is no comparable statute for men not only of the sentences to different agree maximum sentences are different, but there's no statute comparable to manifest danger falling into habits of vise for young men.

    It's also that those decisions are not binding here at all. 
    This statute, 53-219, is not before the Court at all and that's why under the line of case is cited in the brief, I claim that render for threshold of this whole case, the Court is met by a conviction without infirmity on another statute with the concurrent sentence because there's nothing here before the Court that says that the limitation on 53-219 conviction is two years as far as -- especially as far as young girls between 16 and 21 are concerned. 
    There's nothing to that effect before the Court when that girl was sentenced --

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    I think vise is prefers more clear. 
    And if I may just to expound from that, a federal case which didn't involved with criminal conviction but did say about vise that nothing is -- well, I'll paraphrase it, nothing is more clear that promiscuous and uninhibited sexual intercourse is vise that that's -- if anything is vise, that's it. 
    And you see here unfortunately, we don't have the facts before the Court to or the record of the conduct of this young woman to measure against the words of the statute because I think this is a type of statute that in certain cases could be applied in nonconstitutional manner. 
    It is not unconstitutionally void for vagueness on its face but that the Court should have the benefit of the conduct to measure against the words of the statute. 
    And after all, isn't that only logical because the reasons for the statute being void for vagueness and therefore denial of due process are to, primarily that the actor doesn't know what conduct is proscribed. 
    Well, I say that the record of this case would reveal that this actor or any actor would know that the conduct would come within the purview of the word “vise”, but not having that before it is another reason.

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    Oh, well, yes I do because under our practice in the case that I've cited in my brief called State versus Sol is that you cannot -- the overrule by a demur to the constitutionality of the statute then proceed to a full trial and be convicted and then appeal the overruling of the demur without any evidence before the Appellate Court. 
    That's our law under the case of State versus Sol. 
    I should add as I did in the brief however that the Court said but anyhow, we're going to look at the situation because of the constitutional issues that were involved. 
    But they clearly set forth in the Connecticut law and namely there shouldn't be here or shouldn't be in the Connecticut Appellate Court in this form because the demur, having been overruled, then the trial, and then the conviction Mr. defense counsel made a motion dismiss that on the appeal, the record of that trial should be before the Court.

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    I'm sorry, I'd certainly wouldn't deny you that prerogative -- I would say though, and that's why I think I cast this more in terms the practical difficulty of applying a statute to a set of facts that are non-existing. 
    I think Justice Frankfurter said one case is like playing hammer without hammer. 
    And I think that's what we have here and I think their statutes are come under free speech restrictions that this Court can look at it and has looked at and said these are patently and on their face unconstitutionally void for vagueness. 
    But I don't think this is that kind of statute. 
    It's talking about conduct which is not within the constitutionally protected area and I think in that type of case and the cases that I cited in my brief on this point that the Court should have the facts before it, and if it doesn't that's fatal.

    Yes. 
    The commission of misdemeanor including the prostitution, intoxication, drug using and disorderly conduct, and third unmarried girls between the ages 16 and 21 or manifest danger falling into habits of vise which was the other -- which was the commitment provision for the conviction under Section 17-379.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1974.449" stopTime="2004.276">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, all right now, tell me in summary if you don't mind just how -- just on what theory keeping those statutory sections in mind you contend that appellant here is serving a three-year sentence as a result of her conviction of the crime of lascivious carriage?
speaker="george_f_carroll_jr" startTime="2004.276" stopTime="2105.221">
    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    If I may just take Section 17-379 which was the actual conviction for manifest danger falling to habits of vise, 17-379 says, “Any unmarried female between the ages of 16 and 21 who is in manifest danger of falling to habits of vise or leading the vicious life or who has committed any crime upon the complaint maybe brought before the Court and committed. 
    And then it goes on to say in effect that she maybe committed to the Connecticut State Farm for Women until she's 21. 
    In this Section, it doesn't mentioned the Connecticut State Farm for Women, but there's no question that that's what it's talking about, the institution that it's talking about. 
    So, she's convicted of 17-379 -- she's convicted of manifest danger under 17-379. 
    Under 53-219, she's convicted of lascivious carriage. 
    And either the words in 17-379 or who has committed any crime or the words that I read before in 17-360, the commission of misdemeanors including prostitution, etcetera, are applicable. 
    And she has committed under the maximum three-year sentence in 17-360 for the crime of lascivious carriage as well as for the manifest danger falling into vise charge under the two statutes, 53-219 and 17-379. 
    17-360 says she has to stay there for a maximum of three years including parole.

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr.

    That's the maximum sentence since three years is the maximum sentence. 
    And there's confusion in 17-379 which says 21 but as we said earlier I don't think there's any question that as to this young lady, 17-360 three-year maximum is applicable because it would be longer than that to make to have her attain 21 and the lesser is applicable. 
    So, under 17-360, she has a maximum exposure of three years on both the charges of which she was convicted.

    Yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2403.939" stopTime="2477.578">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, we have before us as I understand the two problems. 
    Let's see if I get this correct. 
    First, is this Chinese puzzle of that -- of extrapolating the six months sentence for lascivious carriage in to a three months commitment to the State Farm for women, if its three months and we regard that as a sentence and you get an exact identity with the length of the sentence under the danger resulting from being a female statute. 
    And if that is so, then we have the problem of concurrent sentences because of lascivious carriage conviction is not before us. 
    Then, if we can consider the raise up solacritor criminal statute, the danger of being a woman in Newhaven of Connecticut, then I suppose that -- then we get into the questions that Mr. Justice Black was raising. 
    Is that a correct analysis of it?
speaker="george_f_carroll_jr" startTime="2477.578" stopTime="2531.483">
    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    That is correct analysis but I don't think that the sentencing provisions are really not much of the Chinese puzzle. 
    Maybe I'm going more by practice than by what's spelled out. 
    But I think but I think if you read 379 and 360 and 53-219 that there's no question that she is properly sent there for three years under 53-219. 
    And these decisions mentioned by counsel, I don't believe that fact in this case. 
    And I just -- if I may add a word on the vise. 
    When we're talking about vise, I think it's clear from the context of the statute; the other language in the statute that it's criminal vise -- have a vise of smoking cigarettes or all kinds of vises which were used more even incuriously than that of course, but the whole context of this is talking about criminal vise and the type of vise we think of when we think of a vise squad and --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2531.483" stopTime="2543.866">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose you have in Connecticut specific criminal statutes and ordinances making illegal that sort of criminal conduct --
speaker="george_f_carroll_jr" startTime="2543.866" stopTime="2544.345">
    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2544.345" stopTime="2553.507">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The sort hard core conduct that everybody seems to be agreed here is covered by this is also covered by specific criminal statutes, is it not?
speaker="george_f_carroll_jr" startTime="2553.507" stopTime="2592.142">
    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    I think most of the cases that have come up under this would be covered by specific criminal conduct, yes sir. 
    And I think it's broader because of the fact that this category of young person was regarded as being in need of particular treatment. 
    Now this, were drinking involved in the case to this type of drinking may not have -- on her part may not have fit a specific criminal crime -- criminal offense in Connecticut, but she was at the time of 16-year-old girl drinking wine while this other business is going on. 
    That particular conduct which was in the record, I mean the testimony.

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr.

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr.

    The word “vise” must be read in the context of the general statutory scheme and injuncts the position to the phrase “or who has committed any crime” which is in this statute.

    Mr. George F. Carroll, Jr. 
    Well, it's a matter of interpretation.

    Your Honor, it certainly isn't and it applies into much more in aqueous things in cigarette smoking.

    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    We do have a procedure in our state whereby the appellee has the right to present evidence to the Appellate Court so that the state did have enough opportunity in this case to present the record of the transcript to the Appellate Court have they chose, in which case would be before you. 
    Mr. Carroll also said that the sole case requires evidence. 
    We take issue with that. 
    We claim that the sole case has decided by our Supreme Court was a constitutionality case with respect to application and not in toto as we claim here. 
    Mr. Justice Black indicated whether there were any decisions under this or any cases under this statute and in our appendix, we indicate that between eight years of 1961 to 19 --

    What about parole to the sole case, I notice that the opinion of your appellate division sets up and I'm reading -- I'm looking now at pages 14 and 15 of the brown appendix; sets out the rules of the sole case at some length, and says on page 15 the rule stated in the sole case with I think it is precision and particularity were ignored by the appellant in case before us, then goes on to say but we do not rest our decision on that ground alone which would imply to me that the decision is rested alternatively on that ground and that would be inadequate state ground, would it not?

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3330.191" stopTime="3347.484">
    Justice Abe Fortas

speaker="robert_n_grosby" startTime="3347.484" stopTime="3472.497">
    Mr. Robert N. Grosby 
    I think they we've shown in our appendix that only 47 of the 560 or 8.4% are referred juvenile court in the period from 1961 to 1967. 
    We were bound by the Connecticut law and the cases which are not in our brief of Lyford versus Torkington, 115 Connecticut 600, Renick versus Wakka, 4 Connecticut's superior at 259, and 4 Connecticut's superior 436 in Vina versus Wakka, 17 Connecticut Supplement 365 from attacking the lascivious danger statute. 
    This is the independent state grounds of problem and we felt that the first time that we could've don't this was when your decision was announced in Payton versus Roe, although Payton versus Roe does not appear to be a concurrent situation, and yet it might be that the Payton versus Roe doctrine quite supersedes someday. 
    The case is suggested as still being the lower and Mr. Carroll's brief on page 6 that is the Hirohashi and the Pinkerton matters for several reasons. 
    Assuming for a moment which we don't concede that the lascivious danger situation is still three years, we claim it's two. 
    But assuming that it's three, we think there's a compelling reason to consider an appeal or habeas corpus on one concurrent sentence. 
    This might have to do with period of probation, the period of parole, it might have to do in getting a job even if this girl have to serve three years in lascivious carriage. 
    If she was convicted of manifest danger of falling into vise, this could have some effect on her future job holding ability or an effort to get a job. 
    And I think perhaps your Payton versus Roe case is one that may we reopen this whole situation on independent state ground.
