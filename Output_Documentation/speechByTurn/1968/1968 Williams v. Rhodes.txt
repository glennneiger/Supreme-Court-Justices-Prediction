    Mr. David J. Young 
    First of all, the appellants would like to express their appreciation to the Court for the dispatch and vigilance with which they have scheduled this case, the case that may very well need additional remedial relief to protect the most basic of all of our rights in society, the right to vote. 
    We recognized that this has been an inconvenience to the Court but we are grateful that we have scheduled the case so expeditiously. 
    We place this case before the Court in urging fashion because we believe that the integrity of the 1968 presidential election is at stake. 
    We believe that the transcript evidence before the Court amply demonstrates that plaintiff's candidate Governor Wallace has sufficient voter support in Ohio that his chances of carrying that state are very substantial. 
    We -- the transcript evidence shows polls that were taken and they were placed before the lower court and each of the answers to those polls was prefaced on the condition that if Governor Wallace's name appears on the ballot they would vote for him. 
    On the other hand, it would appear to us and from the evidence in the transcript that if the plaintiffs in this case are relegated to the federal court relief of write-in status, this Governor Wallace's name is taken off the ballot in Ohio that his supporters in that state might as well forget about those 26 electoral votes. 
    Thus, we appear before the Court today seeking relief that's not only essential to the protection of the equal protection of the law rights of the voters in Ohio of the candidates of the minor political parties but also a protection of the integrity of this presidential election and an order which will convince at least 452,000 voters in Ohio that they cannot be fenced out of the democratic elective process simply because their views do not agree with the views of the majority party.

    The petitions that were before the lower court are not required by Ohio law to be registered voters.

    Mr. David J. Young 
    No, I do think that the write-in does protect certain fundamental constitutional rights when the --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="330.701" stopTime="332.098">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But not by itself?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="332.098" stopTime="580.526">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Not and of itself, no and perhaps I might get ahead of myself and explain why. 
    I think that a very significant aspect of the inadequacy of the relief afforded by the lower court in this case is demonstrated when one reviews the election laws in Ohio and their relationship to the methods of write-in voting. 
    In Ohio, we have an excess of 13,000 precincts of with polling places. 
    The elections of such are governed by the 88 counties in the state. 
    Each clerk of the Board of Elections then and that Board of Elections selects the voting method that he feels would best suit his county's conditions. 
    Now, the problem is that there are five different voting methods scattered throughout the state of Ohio in this 88 counties and 13,000 precincts may review them just real quickly. 
    First of all, the basic paper ballot and of course the difficulties of a write-in, statewide write-in campaign aren't too great with that ballot because that simply has an extra space and rather than checking the space with the name on it; one writes in the name in the extra space and then checks it. 
    Moving from there however, we move to what we call the synthesized paper ballot that is used in the county -- Hamilton County with the third largest country in the State of Ohio with City of Cincinnati in that county. 
    They used a synthesized ballot the record shows. 
    It's a punch card that has four holes on the pointers of that synthesized ballot. 
    In order to -- now, the reason I have those are these are counted at the Secretary of State's office. 
    They are transported to the Secretary of State put on the machine and they push a button and just all go down to the machine and the synthesized votes are recorded. 
    Now, when a voter in Ohio would approach the booth to use that kind of a voting device, he would be given a cigar or lighter kind of apparatus that he would stamp his choice for the name of the candidates. 
    And on this stamp makes the marking that's recorded in this machine. 
    If he wanted to write in, he couldn't use this apparatus. 
    It writes too large. 
    There would be pencils available. 
    Now, if you pick up the pencil first and started to write in, there's no written instructions in the booth or on the card to show that the pencil would not record any of the votes for all of the other candidates. 
    So, if he -- he couldn't use the cigar lighter-kind of apparatus to write in, he couldn't use the pencil to mark the other ones. 
    The only way of voter in Ohio in this election would know what to do would have to be asked the voting officials. 
    So, this is going to -- and then of course they'll have to call out all of the synthesized cards with any writing on them and count them twice. 
    From those two methods, we move to the three voting machine methods. 
    The first one as the record demonstrates is the Shupe (ph) method which probably is the easiest to use in write-in situations. 
    It is the voting machine that has the offices listed vertically in to the left and then the candidates to the right. 
    It's quite simple to use the write-in process in those because the little door that you lift up to find the paper is just to the left of the office. 
    And so you just go over then write-in but the more frequently used automatic voting machine has its candidates and officers horizontally across the top and it has a little box some place else where you have to lift up doors to find the place to vote. 
    You have to correlate a number that's attributed to a specific office and go up some place else on the machine and lift up a door that relates to that number and then write-in your vote. 
    For this particular year, there's a major problem the little slants where you write-in slant in this direction for a right hand voter and a left handed voter would almost have to stand on his head to get up and write-in on that space.

speaker="david_j_young" startTime="591.745" stopTime="648.033">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Not in this case. 
    The final voting apparatus that I would discuss is the coil voting machine. 
    This will present the problems also because it hasn't -- it's really a tabulating machine as the record shows. 
    A voter picks up an IBM card, this is later counted by an IBM machine and he puts this IBM card into this tabulating -- into this marking apparatus, a glass plate fits over it and it magnifies the markings on this ballot and then you go through and turn the card around and then when you get to the office that you want to vote for you punch it and it makes a mark on the ballot. 
    In order to write-in, you have to get that card out of the machine and get it back down and write. 
    Now, I would be pretty simple to most people but I think a lot of people might not realize how they're going to write with that card inside the magnified apparatus.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="648.033" stopTime="651.243">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Where is that apparatus, Butler County?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="651.243" stopTime="837.380">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes, and I think down south in one of the other counties that maybe Sam can tell us later on. 
    I think that's down the southern counties in Ohio. 
    What I think that an explanation of these five different kinds of voting devices suggest if the other frustration of trying to mount a statewide voter education campaign of how you're going to go in and exercise the write-in right to vote. 
    It would be extremely difficult for some people even to accomplish it in many voters with many of the apparatus would have to discuss this with the voting officials and reveal in essence who they're seeking to vote for when they're trying to determine how to use this write-in device on these machines. 
    The record before the Court indicates that Governor Wallace's supporters have obtained ballot position for him in all 49 states. 
    He has been certified in a 49 states now and of course if we include the temporary order this would be 50 states. 
    But for this litigation and that's why it was broad this year, in the Presidential Election Ohio would -- could shamefully alone is the only state in the country denying ballot position to a presidential candidate who could demonstrate sufficient voter support to satisfy any reasonable any qualification requirement -- ballot position requirement established by any state. 
    We've demonstrated to the Court. 
    We hope that Ohio's election laws are more harsh and more discriminatory as they relate to the independent and third party candidate and voter than any other state in the country. 
    Mr. Sikes was doing some computations for me. 
    When we look through the voting laws in all 47 states where some form of a signature petition was used, the three others -- there were three states. 
    One of them the convention which used Alabama (Voice Overlap) -- the total requirement in District of Ohio (Inaudible) were signature petitions were used. 
    The total requirement and this included Ohio of signatures was 1,052,867. 
    When you subtract Ohio's requirement from this, 433,100 it takes 619,000 signatures using our methods to get on the ballot in 46 states and 433,100 a pretty close to that I figured just to get on the ballot on the State of Ohio and after you get those signatures before the Secretary of State you still can't get on the ballot and we hope to demonstrate that later on. 
    Just the 15% requirement that we'll be talking about is 75 times higher than the percentage requirement in the State of New York. 
    30 times higher then the ballot position requirements in each of the average of the each of the five states bordering on the State of Ohio.

    Mr. David J. Young

    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="931.673" stopTime="946.600">

    Mr. David J. Young 
    I don't -- I wouldn't agree because here again I think the mere denial, the first attempt, was an independent nominating petition. 
    The mere fact that that is denied was taken away from voters in the State of Ohio in 1948 in and of itself would justify relief in this case, it seems to me even if --

speaker="david_j_young" startTime="981.069" stopTime="992.084">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes, if they said that we must go through a political party process then we would have to show that the 15% is unconstitutional.

    Mr. David J. Young 
    That's correct.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, why you would've -- you would've had to worry? 
    Let's assume if Ohio had said these other provisions are wholly unreasonable we want to apply them to you but you still have to get your petition in before the primary you wouldn't satisfy it.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1078.577" stopTime="1151.205">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Now, I'm not making myself clear Justice White because the Ohio could not have said that. 
    The law says, the petition must be in 90 days before the election. 
    Now, if you knockout those other laws, there would be no requirement that it be in on February the 7th, August the 7th would be perfectly satisfactory. 
    There is no statute in the State of Ohio that requires the 15% to be in 90 days before the primary. 
    That only comes about if you uphold the other party primary provisions which would be prohibitive against this party. 
    If you threw those statutes out, the 15%, 90 days before the general election would be satisfactory under Ohio law. 
    I know it's very complicated but this comes about by an interrelated reading of this statute with the political primary statute. 
    It's only by inference from the primary statutes that we get this necessity of filing 90 days before the primary. 
    One could read the laws I suggest the average lawyer for 50 hours and he would never realize that that petition had to be in 90 days with a primary because there's -- unless you understand every single election statute you don't get to that result.

    But you do concede Mr. Young, do you not that because of the interrelationship and interoperation of the various Ohio election statute the word “election” does mean primary election under Ohio laws, don't you?

speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1169.494" stopTime="1190.291">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    No, it would mean that election first in some instances.

    Yes, we concede in this case in order to get on the ballot if they weren't all these other unconstitutional statutes we would've had to file on February 7, 1968. 
    Yes, no question about that. 
    The State of Ohio throughout this case and in its briefs that are before the Court at the present time have conceded the motivation, the reason for the adoption of the key statutes that we're concerned about in this case. 
    As to the legislation, amendments that occurred during -- back in 1948 to 1952 which completely eliminated the right of nomination of independent candidates. 
    They have stated that independent candidacy is an evil. 
    And then they explain it's an evil because people end up voting for someone they really shouldn't vote for. 
    And that these statutes back in 1948-1952 were designed to stamp out that evil to wit independent candidacy. 
    As to the political party laws, the State of Ohio states that it is a legitimate purpose to prevent third party candidates or third parties from interfering with the chances of the two major party candidates to get a clear cut victory in election. 
    We concede those motivations also and we do not believe that they withstand the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We do not believe that these are legitimate or permissible state policies.

    Mr. David J. Young 
    That's correct. 
    Shall appoint its presidential electors, our constitutional history tells us that subsequent to about the 1870's that no state has appointed its presidential electors by the legislative body doing so but rather they have appointed their presidential electors by either -- by one form or another of letting the electorate vote for them. 
    So, when I read that section, I do note that the state could appoint but when I read it in conjunction with what the -- this Supreme Court has stated for example in the Harper case that once a state exercises a constitutional power by delegating that two the voters in the state that that delegation must comply with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of United States.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1395.778" stopTime="1427.033">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the constitutional provision that you and I now talking about, you didn't -- it goes on and say and it says, each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct in a number of electors. 
    You would concede I suppose that the -- a state today could constitutionally provide through its legislature that its electors be named by the state legislature, would you?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1427.033" stopTime="1433.543">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    I -- I'm just probably so but as I read this Court's decisions I'm not 100% --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1433.543" stopTime="1449.112">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, we're dealing -- we deal here with a written constitution and then in this respect the constitution is very explicit that says, each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of electors.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1449.112" stopTime="1449.520">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Certainly, but pardon me --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1449.520" stopTime="1454.782">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Apparently, they must begin with that, must we, in consideration of the issues before us in this case?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1454.782" stopTime="1605.158">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    That's certainly correct. 
    Now, I did not include in my reply brief but on the day that I had to file it I called opposing counsel and noted that with reference to that argument I should've cited one case by this Court which I feel comes closes to answering that particular contention and I gave the citation to counsel last Friday and that's the case of Katzenbach versus Morgan. 
    The Court will recall this was the New York case where the State of New York was attempting to uphold its literary test -- literacy test requirement as a qualification to voting and as against the federal legislation the Voting Rights Act which stated that if one attended Puerto Rican schools and went to sixth grade and wasn't taught English that they could not be barred from voting. 
    Now, one of the arguments presented in that case was the fact that the State of New York by reason of direct constitutional grant, United States constitutional grant had the power to establish qualifications of voters in election for United States -- members of the United States House of Representative and United States Senators. 
    So in another words, in this instance, the state like a state would be doing it if we're appointing electors was doing exactly what the United States Constitution told it to do. 
    And I have this real brief little quote here that I think comes very close to answering this requirement. 
    It starts up by recognizing under the distribution of powers affected by the Constitution. 
    The state established qualifications for voting for state officers and the qualifications established by the states for voting for members of the most numerous branch of the state legislature also determined who may vote for United States Representatives and Senators and then cites some authorities. 
    But of course, the states have no power to grant or withhold the franchise on conditions that are forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment or any other provisions of the Constitution. 
    Such exercises of state power are no more immune to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment than any other state action. 
    Now, as I read that this Court is saying that regardless of the source of whether the state is regulating the qualifications simply by reason of the reserved powers in the state in the Constitution or because of some constitutional grant of authority like they were doing in the Katzenbach case but still that the restraints of the Fourteenth Amendment still apply.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1605.158" stopTime="1632.689">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    On a Katzenbach case first of all the -- we were dealing I think with an Act of Congress which we don't have here. 
    And secondly, we were not dealing, I think with this explicit provision of the Constitution not giving permission to the states but saying -- setting forth explicitly how the electors shall be chosen by the states and they shall be chosen, they shall be appointed as the state legislature may direct.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1632.689" stopTime="1633.824">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1633.824" stopTime="1642.948">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Those are two very obvious and evident first blush differences between this case and the Katzenbach case, aren't they or am I mistaken?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1642.948" stopTime="1661.561">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Those are differences I don't see the distinction the same as you do Justice Stewart but certainly they are differences. 
    It seems to me that that section that you are referring to however does not go on and say, the state shall appoint in such manners it will direct without regard to the protections of such and such and such and such.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1661.561" stopTime="1692.468">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, of course the protections of such and such and such and such didn't exist at the time this was written because they didn't come along with 1860's after the civil war. 
    But certainly, before the post civil war alterations in the United States Constitution it would've been clear I suppose would it not that under the Second Clause, Section 1 of Article II of the Constitution, you wouldn't have any case at all. 
    You wouldn't have any argument either, would you?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1692.468" stopTime="1693.892">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Before the Fourteenth Amendment?

    Before the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments.

    I don't think we would have.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1699.848" stopTime="1718.981">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And so the question is here really, is it not how much if that all the post civil war amendments have modified the explicit provisions of the Second Clause of Section 1 of Article II?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1718.981" stopTime="1753.695">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    I'm not sure that that would -- we would have to say modification because I don't read that original provision is saying in such manners they shall direct discriminatory or otherwise and no case of this Court has ever held to my knowledge that simply because of that provision that once the state went forward with their appointment and appointed by way of delegation to the electorate, they could do it a discriminatory fashion. 
    The old case that we cited by our opponents McPherson versus Blacker, it seems to me even in that case which yes it was after the Fourteenth Amendment.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1753.695" stopTime="1754.700">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, 1892.

    Mr. David J. Young 
    Went on and indicated that there was no discrimination alleged in that case.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1760.087" stopTime="1813.505">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, isn't that -- do you really want to rest on the argument that you just elaborated based on Katzenbach against Morgan? 
    I thought your argument was that if the state chooses in effect to delegate this power to the electorate it must then do it on the basis which preserves equal protection rights to all voters that is to say that you once have to take the step of a state choosing who vest this constitutional apart which I read as my brother Stewart does but once a state chooses to vest that in the voters it has to provide that the right should be available to be exercised by the voters on that basis of equality.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1813.505" stopTime="1822.935">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    That is precisely our position if I need plenty other answers suggested that was otherwise then I hope you disregard it, that is precisely our position in this case.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1822.935" stopTime="1825.950">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, we were kind of off and left field then weren't we?

    Mr. David J. Young 
    Well, --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1829.609" stopTime="1855.923">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now, that you're very clear -- now, that you're clear, what's your position is, could the legislature to say to the voters, we're going to delegate you -- we're going to share this power with you but you're not going to get it at all. 
    We are going to let you choose between -- to choose between the candidate of the Republican Party and the candidate of the Democratic Party.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1855.923" stopTime="1884.739">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    And once we conceded that after the state begins delegating to the voters that the Fourteenth Amendment protections apply, that seems to me that kind of delegation clearly must fall because there would not be a legitimate and permissible state policy to limit presidential candidates or presidential electors only to those who in here to the beliefs of the republican or democratic parties. 
    So, it would be my (Voice Overlap).
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1884.739" stopTime="1907.078">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Although the legislature could say, to pass along and say the electors shall be chosen by the legislature of the state that they shall be chosen as between the electors for Democratic Party and the Republican Party and each year, each presidential year the legislature just chooses between the candidates of two parties.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1907.078" stopTime="1925.579">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    I feel that would be blatant violation of the Fourteenth Amendment just as much as they said, you must choose between Jewish and Catholic -- members of the Jewish and Catholic religious faith. 
    I don think there's any justifiable, permissible basis for establishing such distinctions and I think that such a delegation would fall and should fall.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1925.579" stopTime="1930.640">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Can there be any restrictions at all (Inaudible)?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="1930.640" stopTime="1996.137">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Any restrictions, we do concede, yes. 
    We think that the state has indicated by this court in many, many cases the Carrington case and others that it is -- the state has performed the historic function of protecting the ballot, protecting the integrity of its elections, making sure that citizen's right to vote was really meaningful and they had proper methods for voting accuracy and all the rest. 
    So, we do feel that a state made a place of restrictions on all of these items but that in order to prevail and in order to withstand constitutional challenge that these must be reasonably or rationally related to a permissible state purpose. 
    I think that in the case at bar -- in the case at bar, counsel and the State of Ohio has said what their purpose in one of the statute says. 
    Their purpose is to stamp out independent candidacy. 
    Now, the statutes they adopted was rationally related to that first purpose. 
    But it seems to me the second half of the proposition fails that that purpose is not a permissible state purpose.

    I have not come up with a theory that would put it into the Due Process category. 
    It seems to us that the Equal Protection Clause was so applicable here.

    You don't rely on the First Amendment?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="2044.281" stopTime="2081.733">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    The First Amendment is significant, it's not a significant to ballot position but it is significant in this whole area because of the free speech right and any -- it seems to us any legislation that prevents organization in free participation of minority parties in the political spectrum interstate can if the regulations are not reasonably related to a permissible state policy and it isn't permissible just to discriminate against them, it's got yet some other reason. 
    That in that instance if it denied participation which our laws do in Ohio then it seems to me where impairing a free speech rights too.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2081.733" stopTime="2097.549">
    Justice John M. Harlan

    Mr. David J. Young 
    The Due Process? 
    Okay. 
    Gives us the right to organize but we want to go further than just organize and just participate. 
    It seems to me that what we really need in this instance is ballot position and the reason we aren't getting ballot position is because of a -- laws that are discriminatory that do not provide equal protection of the laws and that's why we have based it but certainly this analysis would suggest that perhaps we could've place some more emphasize on the Due Process Clause. 
    I concede that.

    Mr. David J. Young

    I do see it, it's a very substantial distinction when I explain it, I want to make it perfectly clear that we have no objection to the Socialist Labor Party appearing on the ballot.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2204.972" stopTime="2210.157">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But I'm trying to get at the theory of this and this it seems to me to be the quickest way to do it.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="2210.157" stopTime="2254.244">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Once we start out with the proposition recognizing because of the state historic function in controlling its procedures that it can come up with some reasonable regulation related to a legitimate policy. 
    It seems to us if we accept that proposition that the state could establish some reasonable requirements preliminary to obtaining ballot position practically every state in the country does this. 
    Now, if it's a number requirement, it has to be the size of the number has to be carefully scrutinized to make certain that the true purpose and effect isn't just discrimination rather than making certain that we don't have -- I mean we couldn't let every citizen have his name on the ballot.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2254.244" stopTime="2300.883">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I understand that but we're faced with the practical situation here and I notice what I must say a bit of surprise that in your paper you asked us to direct the Ohio legislature to formulate some sort of requirements that would be lawful and constitutional. 
    Do you really mean that that this Court should direct the Ohio legislature to do that? 
    I believe that appears in your reply brief. 
    And would you -- and is that the way you would as practical matter make the distinction between your case and the Socialist Labor Party case?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="2300.883" stopTime="2307.618">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Perhaps the way you've asked the question I would direct them that if they are to be requirements that they'll be reasonable requirements --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2307.618" stopTime="2310.846">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, that's not what I'm asking you, you phrase it in anyway you want to.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="2310.846" stopTime="2311.502">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes, I do think so.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2311.502" stopTime="2379.176">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I'm asking you how we go about in making a distinction between those. 
    Let's assume that Socialist Labor Party has 200 members all told something like that, it's been suggested, and you've got all these members hundreds of thousands of them as a matter of constitutional theory, the function of this Court could we make a distinction and it's so held or what is it that you're asking us merely to say to Ohio that its statute is unconstitutional because it is discriminatory against so-called independent parties and independent candidates. 
    And therefore, it must grant relief and that -- and the relief ordered is not the relief order to be ordered by the -- this Court is not the relief order merely ordered by the lower court which is a write-in but that the names of the both parties must be printed on the ballot.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="2379.176" stopTime="2460.811">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    It seems to us that when one brings a case like this before the Court, he must need two objectives. 
    First of all, demonstrate the unconstitutionality of the legislation as being challenged. 
    And secondly, demonstrate by reason of principles of equity that the Court should grant equitable relief. 
    Now, if a party came before the three-judge District Court in Ohio and said, we have one member and we don't want any more members and then one came in with 450,000 signatories on a petition. 
    It seems to us that a court of equity could make a distinction on these grounds as Justice -- Judge Kinneary did in this case. 
    His distinction was that this party has demonstrated that it has sufficient voter straight can be any constitutionally permissible number figure. 
    He did not find that the other party had demonstrated that it could meet constitutionally permissible standards. 
    Then, the Court of Equity must decide and take it the clearer case the one man party in the 450,000 is at state law that kept this one man party off the ballot or is it just the mere fact that they aren't large enough to be on the ballot. 
    So, it seems to me that once you concede reasonable number's regulations then it seems to me you get to the proposition that in plaintiffs coming before Court of Equity and asking equitable relief that a judge will look to their strength and to see whether the laws themselves or would kept this party off the ballot.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2460.811" stopTime="2474.539">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, you think -- do you think that the Court should make a judgment as to whether the number of signatures on your petition are appropriate for equitable relief, is that what you're saying?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="2474.539" stopTime="2488.497">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    That is certainly something that this Court would consider. 
    I would assume that the facts in the case and whether they have shown to the Court that equitable relief is appropriate and I think the numbers are -- is probably the one of the biggest factors in this case 452,000 signatures.

    Mr. David J. Young 
    Well, perhaps then and that's exactly what I'm saying.

    It seems to me that if this Court were to say to the Ohio General Assembly that unless you revise your laws to permit reasonable participation by independent and third party candidates that there can be no elections under those laws. 
    This in effect is directing the State of Ohio to revise its laws. 
    This is really what I'm saying and perhaps I should've given that answer to Justice Fortas. 
    It seems to me that this is as much direction as any other form of direction. 
    And with the Ohio Legislative Service Commission, these are laws that were adopted back in 1948. 
    There's no question in my mind right now that upon proper order of the Ohio General Assembly would be delighted to bring its laws up-to-date like the laws of every other state.

    Yes.

    Mr. David J. Young 
    The Socialist Labor case was filed in January of 1968. 
    And ours was filed on July 29, 1968. 
    So, we have the two extremes that one situation of a lawsuit having been filed early and one in July 29, so it seems to us that there certainly was adequate notice and time to defend in this case.

    Mr. Young, you said that the legislature would welcome an opportunity to take another look at the 48 statute. 
    Why didn't you file in the state court to give them that opportunity?

    Mr. David J. Young 
    When the time for filing this lawsuit came about the Ohio Supreme Court was not in session. 
    It has been my personal experience that they are not able to get back as quickly as has been accomplished in this case. 
    We fear that first of all --

    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes, we certainly do but in this case, in February of 1968 the plaintiffs were operating under the assumption that if they proceeded forward and obtained 15% signatures that they would get ballot position for the candidate.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2779.935" stopTime="2783.646">

    Did your clients make any effort to comply with the law other than to go out then they get signatures?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="2823.549" stopTime="2864.555">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes, there are two early requirements in to get ballot position in a case like this if one uses the new political party technique. 
    One of them, one has to file or a subversive kind of affidavit and then there's an investigation and hearing to make sure that these people are non-subversives and this was done in this case. 
    The material was presented to the Secretary of State back in, I think it was May and the Secretary of State conducted an investigation and certified this new political party pursuant to that provision of the law.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2864.555" stopTime="2875.341">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How about the other provisions or qualifications such as the hierarchy of the party in the state? 
    Did you undertake to fulfill that application?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="2875.341" stopTime="2912.236">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    The petition that was prepared for circulation in this case did they make provisions for the calling of a state convention and holding of a national convention. 
    By the same token, it gave alternatives the possibility of delegating the power to call the state convention to three people named in the petition as distinguished from first electing county chairman in all of the counties throughout the state having them to party functionaries. 
    The petitioners delegated the right to call such a convention to the three people named in the petition.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2912.236" stopTime="2918.019">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The only question was to whether that conforms to a state bar?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="2918.019" stopTime="2989.207">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes, the Secretary of State would not accept that in this letter. 
    By July -- no, wait a second, by the middle of July of this year, the petitioners in this case had somewhere between 300,000 and 350,000 signatures and it appeared quite clear to them that they would have no difficulty getting the -- an excess of 433,000. 
    At that time, a request was made of the Secretary of State of Ohio, if we meet this signature requirement we'll be placed on the ballot. 
    And one of the things that he noted was that this new party could not call a state convention which would he select electors and the reason he said that they couldn't call a state convention it's because the Ohio statutes require existing office (Inaudible) attendees at the convention who are apportioned based upon this party's vote at the last election and this is what the Ohio laws provide. 
    So you see, -- he's saying that you haven't had and you aren't going to have a convention and you don't have people that can attend the convention. 
    Therefore, you cannot certify electors to me. 
    So, this was one of the reasons provided by the Secretary of State for refusing. 
    So, he took the position that our form of holding a convention would not satisfy Ohio law.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2989.207" stopTime="3007.951">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I was wondering why it couldn't -- why you couldn't have gone in to the Court though prior to the 29th of July to have these matters determined so that the state would have ample time to either conform to its election laws or to change them?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="3007.951" stopTime="3048.557">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Well, first of all it seems to me that we did not have in this case a question of interpretation of state laws. 
    Once you understand them, they do bar ballot position. 
    That seems to me that plaintiffs have a decision of whether to seek relief in the federal or in the state court. 
    Quite frankly, I would have advice in any given time to file a lawsuit such as this before three-judge federal court. 
    It has been a traditional forum as of late for these kinds of cases and I see no -- since it was not -- since we don't have an interpretation of state law question but really a constitutionally -- validity of state law. 
    I personally see no objection to the federal court forum.

    Mr. David J. Young 
    I am in somewhat of a difficult position Justice Warren because we did -- when you say May, we came into the case July the 23rd and filed it six days later.

    Yes, anybody.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="3072.215" stopTime="3100.809">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Well, it seems to me that when they first became convinced that regardless of whether they accomplished this petition requirement or not that they would not get on the ballot. 
    You see they went for, what they first started out they were organized -- this party was organized in January of 1968. 
    It recognized that the method of nominating petition had been denied in Ohio. 
    You couldn't get on the ballot by independent nominating petition; I think it could in other states.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3100.809" stopTime="3118.221">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, at that very point, if you wanted to challenge the state's assistance that should be a party rather than an independent candidate you could've filed right then. 
    I mean that is perfectly fair that you have to be a party, you couldn't petition yourself on to the ballot. 
    That was clear wasn't it?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="3118.221" stopTime="3119.266">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    No, question about that.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3119.266" stopTime="3125.134">

    No question about that.

    So these -- and also there was no question but -- that what if you were going to be a party that you have to be a party and there was no question that you had to get 15%?

    Mr. David J. Young 
    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3137.519" stopTime="3141.027">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You could've raised these questions very early.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="3141.027" stopTime="3142.630">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    I think when you look at the posture --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3142.630" stopTime="3145.378">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Without any confusion whatsoever.
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="3145.378" stopTime="3198.856">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    I don't think -- I think that there would've been as much confusion then as there would've been when we filed a lawsuit but any petitioning group that's trying to accomplish ballot position, it seems to me files itself in the posture of doing everything possible to go about it and getting all the ballot without filing a lawsuit. 
    I mean this, any candidate throughout the country is really trying to accomplish its political objectives and if they can get on the ballot usually by using an alternate as is the case in many other states. 
    There are the states that have denied independent nominating petition but turn around and give you a political party method, it's practically the same or it's attainable. 
    These people apparently thought, I say apparently because I wasn't there then, apparently thought, we can meet the 15% even though it's -- even though it's burdensome we've got our strength to meet the 15% and I assume that's why they went forward hoping that they could get the 15% and get on the ballot and not have to file a lawsuit.

speaker="david_j_young" startTime="3266.482" stopTime="3319.025">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    My only answer can be is that they felt that they could meet substantial compliance with the statutes. 
    They went forward full steam ahead when they learned that even with substantial compliance that they wouldn't get on the ballot. 
    They filed a lawsuit as timely as possible. 
    They filed a lawsuit in sufficient time to allow the Court to adjudicate this case. 
    The case has been able to come all the way up to the United States Supreme Court in time to grant relief. 
    Justice Stewart was able to order temporary relief without disrupting the Ohio ballot. 
    So, true, the lawsuit is late but is it late solely that 400,000 voters in Ohio's right to suffer should be denied. 
    I agreed that the lawsuit is late but I don't think it's too late to -- I don't think relief should be denied just because these people didn't file earlier. 
    I don't think the Doctrine of Laches would be applicable when we're talking about the voting rights of an excessive 400,000 citizens in Ohio.

    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes, it seems to me that's precisely yet. 
    I having found this lawsuit late made a difficult for my friend Sam Lopeman to defend it I'm sure. 
    But I don't think that the rights of any Ohio citizens have been prejudiced because temporary relief has been granted much later than that. 
    So, we feel when you look at this case as question of the rights of 400,000 -- 450,000 voters the Doctrine of Laches would not be applicable.

    First, I would like to clear up a typographical error that appears in our brief on page 19. 
    The error was discovered too late to change. 
    It was discovered while the messenger was delivering these briefs to the Court and he misunderstood the direction. 
    On page 19, it should be November 1967, the 1968 should be crossed out and November should be left instead of 1968 being crossed out.

    What point do you cite them on?
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="3577.636" stopTime="3768.092">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    The proposition that an appellee may argue any -- may use any argument to support in order of a trial court even if that order is -- even if the argument is inconsistent with the basis for the order. 
    The Ohio election laws require that a candidate for president must be nominated by a national political convention to which delegates have been selected in an Ohio primary. 
    In Ohio, in order to qualify as a primary -- as a new political party, the group seeking to qualify must present signatures of 15% of the total vote of those voting in the last gubernatorial election. 
    These requirements reasonably protect a valid state interest. 
    As we point out in our brief, at any given time there's a substantial number of disaffected people, disaffected with the candidates or the programs of the two major parties. 
    This group is obviously issue oriented and by signing an independent nominating petition, they are at most expressing some adherence to a principle. 
    In the interest of preventing any would be candidate or leader from coming in and grabbing this group without a contest. 
    The Ohio law requires that the candidate submit himself to a primary election. 
    This gives the disaffected, this more or less cohesive group the right to choose its candidate just as the primary laws give the members of the republican and democrat parties the right to choose their leader. 
    The 15% required dovetails with this primary requirement by preventing a would be leader from coming in circulating qualifying petitions obtaining only a few numbers and thus limiting those who would vote in the primary to those signing. 
    Of course, he would select the people who would be expected to support his candidacy. 
    Another would be leader with parallel political philosophy might be deterred by the initial filing from filing another qualifying petition. 
    This would -- the requirement that a primary be held supports the logical state interest in preventing a disaffected group from splintering itself. 
    It prevents -- it aids the disaffected in reasonable go of remaining to some extent cohesive. 
    So, they might be affected and in addition, the state has an interest in knowing the extent of the disaffection so that it may accommodate this disaffection within the system if that is possible.

    The three-judge court found that probably as early as 1964 and certainly by November 1967 the appellants had been fully briefed by the Secretary of State and as to the requirements for ballot position in Ohio. 
    Consequently, that the appellants had adequate time after November 1967 to file a declaratory judgment action questioning the Ohio statutes which they feel are invalid. 
    And if that had been done and if these statutes have been determined to be invalid there would have been time for the Ohio General Assembly to reconsider the laws and amend them to comply with any order which would hold -- which would've held these laws invalid.

    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    Equal protection after -- well, first, the state is not -- the state legislature is not required to have an election and that is clear after McPherson versus Blacker and this was affirmed as recently as 1951 in Ray versus Blair in this Court. 
    But if the Court -- if the state legislature is not required to have an election at all when it does have an election --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4467.955" stopTime="4471.053">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Lopeman, you may continue your argument.
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="4471.053" stopTime="4587.548">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    When the argument broke for the luncheon recess, I was considering the application of the Equal Protection Clause to the Article II powers vested in state legislatures. 
    We agree that the Equal Protection Clause may very well apply some limitation to the power of the state legislatures to direct the appointment, the manner of the appointment of presidential electors. 
    We believe that that power may be limited in such a respect that the state legislatures could not disqualify anyone from being an elector on the basis of race. 
    However, no claim has been made that the Ohio procedures violate these kinds of equal protection guarantees. 
    We do deny however that there is any limitation on the legislature's power based on the principle that electors should be chosen on the basis of popular support of candidates. 
    This -- the McPherson case recognized and appellants can see that the legislature has the right to appoint electors. 
    When the legislature does appoint directly, it cannot appoint on the basis of popular support for the simple reason it doesn't know the popular support, no election having been had. 
    The argument is could be made however that once an election is held that some other kind of equal protection limitation suddenly appears. 
    Equal protection is not particularly applicable to elections. 
    It applies equally to the legislature when it appoints directly or when it holds an election. 
    There's no reason in --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4587.548" stopTime="4604.094">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    On the question of equal protection, do you make any distinction in these two cases that were hearing argued today? 
    That is in the result to be achieved that one could prevail and the other could lose?
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="4604.094" stopTime="4680.045">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    Not on the equal protection, Your Honor. 
    Both must fail on the equal protection because equal protection is not applicable. 
    However, in a situation where there is no right to have a vote but a vote is nevertheless had for example, the situation in Georgia where the -- this Court in Fortson held that there is no constitutional right for the governor of a state to be elected by popular election. 
    Nevertheless, Gray would suggest that there is some kind of limitation based on equal protection that applies to this situation. 
    However, this other kind of equal protection is not representative government for if it were, how can this Court explain Fortson when although the election was not required to be held. 
    When it was held, this Court allowed the legislature to disregard the result of that vote and select the candidate receiving the least popular votes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4680.045" stopTime="4696.223">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then you don't concede that if Ohio provides for an elected process to get on the ballot for the presidency that that must be in accordance with the equal protection?
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="4696.223" stopTime="4699.995">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    No Your Honor, I'm not saying that I'm saying that there are, there may be some requirements --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4699.995" stopTime="4711.935">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Would you think the opposite -- do you say the opposite that they are not required to honor or to equal protection if they have an election?
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="4711.935" stopTime="4851.822">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    They are required to honor some of the guarantees contained an equal protection race, religion, belief but they are not required to hold the election on an equal protection basis of representative government or any theory that the electors chose unless be the result of popular support of the candidate because in the Fortson versus Morris case it's impossible to reach that result. 
    The election was held, the -- this Court allowed the legislature of Georgia to select the candidate not receiving the most popular votes. 
    Representative government in this situation such in dissimilar, analogous situation of the right of the legislature to select presidential electors and the additional provision that they need not have an election requires that if an election is held it has to meet certain constitutional equal protection safeguards. 
    We cannot discriminate against the voter. 
    We can only discriminate against the right of the voter to have his candidate, have a chance to win which is exactly what happened in the Fortson versus Morris case in this Court. 
    Going back to the reasonableness of the laws of Ohio we would suggest an additional reason for the requirement that a primary be held and the requirement of 15% support and that is the experience in Ohio in the years 1944 and 1948 and the presidential electors -- elections in those years. 
    The elections were very close in both years. 
    A third party by taking support away from one of the two major parties who had a chance to win the election could distort the result of the election in Ohio by giving the entire electoral votes of Ohio to the least popular candidate.

    The state legislature pursuant to Article II has not limited that but has provided that in order to participate, there must be a showing of the possibility of substantial political effectiveness, that's the 15% requirement. 
    It's a balancing by the state of the competing interest, one, the interest in not distorting the popular vote of those who may win and giving some voice to the party that may be effective though it can't win.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Lopeman, is there a distinction between the right of a candidate to appear on the ballot, have his name appear on the ballot and the right of a political party? 
    Now, there is in the Ohio election law as I read it, there are elaborate requirements for a party to appear -- to get its name on the ballot as to have a primary and so on. 
    And it has seem to me perhaps to be arguable that there is a reasonable distinction between what a state may do with respect to requiring a political party to qualify on the one hand and allowing an individual candidate to qualify on the other hand. 
    For example, when the other case is before us a California -- a California case I noticed that they have separate procedures for qualifying a candidate you say, he can be placed on the ballot by receiving a certain number and a relatively modest number as I recall it of a signatures but a political party for a political party in California has more onerous requirements. 
    Now, the order that has been in or pending final decision in this case provides that Ohio shall show -- enter on its ballot. 
    Both the American name of the American independent party and the name of Mr. Wallace and his vice presidential candidate would point to them asking about is whether the -- it is or you would make any argument to the effect that the Ohio requirements are certainly valid and reasonable with respect to a political party, do you see even though we might conclude that they are not reasonable and constitutional with respect to the qualification of an individual as a candidate or his electors?

    Well, I understand that argument but on the other hand if you assume that the state's power has to be exercised reasonably. 
    I know you don't make that assumption in one leg of your argument. 
    But if we should arrive at the conclusion that the state's power has to be exercised reasonably, is it possible to say that the -- on analysis of the Ohio law is that state is exercising its power reasonably with respect to a political party but arguably not reasonably with respect to the candidate?

    That's correct Your Honor and a good example --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That's interesting.
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="5814.393" stopTime="5820.153">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    The good example -- a good example is the situation that we know exists in Israel a very small --

    Israel?
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="5820.728" stopTime="5838.910">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    And if it can exist in Israel today it could've existed in Ohio in the early 1950's, a small religious party in Israel requires the two major parties to conform with its religious philosophy --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5838.910" stopTime="5847.147">

    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    It would be the same if this kind of thing happened in the State of Ohio and what I'm suggesting is this Court does not have a standard to answer the question whether this is good or bad. 
    And certainly, the standard of representative government does not answer this question.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5863.352" stopTime="5868.459">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    We still have Fourteenth Amendment and First.

    Representative government does not, cannot answer this question whether a tyranny --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5876.112" stopTime="5891.412">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I think that Fourteenth Amendment of Due Process can argue -- can answer the question to whether you can restrict the right to vote to one political party. 
    Wouldn't you agree?
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="5891.412" stopTime="5898.814">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    Not for presidential electors, Your Honor. 
    The Article II power would exclude the right to make this restriction.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5898.814" stopTime="5906.202">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So, if in 50 states they decided that only democrats can vote republican be rather out of business, would it?
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="5906.202" stopTime="5906.697">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    Well, the answer --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5906.697" stopTime="5907.775">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Wouldn't they?
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="5907.775" stopTime="6092.196">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    Yes, that's true but the answer to this kind of unfairness in the legislature is electing a new legislature and when the legislature is elected by one man, one vote we can be reasonably sure that this kind of thing will not happen. 
    Finally, where do we get the idea the representative government applies to presidential politics when the whole process is not representative. 
    The electors are selected in the states as a unit. 
    The popular vote frequently differs from the electoral vote and certainly there's no mathematical coalition. 
    Again, one man, one vote does not apply. 
    There is a further distortion by the provision that each state gets two electoral votes for each senator, thereby, increasing the representation of the smallest state over the larger states. 
    If there is no majority in the Electoral College and the election goes to the House of Representative the winners are decided on the basis of each state having one vote and this is certainly over states or over emphasizes the political representation of the smallest states. 
    And finally, they -- the Electoral College may choose or the House of Representatives may choose among the three highest candidates. 
    It is not limited to the highest. 
    So, the value of one man, one vote doesn't apply. 
    Since it is not a part of the system, since the electoral collegiate principle does not include representative government why must we say that any one part of it must. 
    For these reasons, one that the Ohio -- that the Ohio General Assembly has given broad clarity power pursuant to Article II for the question that this Court really doesn't have standards to answer the questions involved in the interrelationship between third parties and presidential politics. 
    For the reason that the Ohio laws are reasonable and are reasonably designed to accomplish a valid objective. 
    And finally, that the cases in this Court show definitely that although when an election is not required to be held, if it is held it must have some fairness but that does not include the right to maximize or equalize the chance of the voters candidate winning and I again emphasize Fortson versus Morris for these reasons, this Court should affirm the order of the United States District Court.

    -- if this petitioners had questions about Ohio election laws, these other laws that have been referred to. 
    First, let me say that they do not relate to third parties. 
    The District Court did not find they're related to third parties. 
    The Ohio Supreme Court in Beck versus Hummel says that the Ohio election laws will be liberality construed and that this Court should probably not consider initially the constitutionality of the election laws not considered by the court below. 
    If they had questions about these laws, they should've filed the declaratory judgment action sometime prior to February of 1968. 
    Further, if they were clear about what the laws required they should've gone out and gotten signatures on their petitions prior to the filing date which was sometime in February 1967 to qualify their party as a political party in Ohio. 
    At the same time, they could've encouraged people who were signing these petitions to run for county committees and state committees.

    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    If the requirement that a party in Ohio must have a primary, a party primary to get on the ballot then clearly they would've had to file the petitions sometime in February 1968 because it would be impossible for a party --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6247.693" stopTime="6270.894">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No, but hypothetical is that the provision requiring a primary in the Ohio law is unconstitutional. 
    If that were true if we were to conclude that it was unconstitutional, what then of the fact that they did actually get the 15% of signatures but they did not get them until after that February date?
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="6270.894" stopTime="6276.159">

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Because as I understand your adversary he argues that if all these provisions keyed to the primary are unconstitutional. 
    Now, then the 15% requirement should be read as satisfied so long as the signatures be collected 90 days before the general election.
speaker="charles_s_lopeman" startTime="6297.530" stopTime="6330.344">
    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    Well, insofar as the District Court did not consider these questions did not decide they were unconstitutional. 
    It's not for this Court but as a representative of the Attorney General of Ohio. 
    I'm telling you that these requirements other requirements of law fairly read do not deny ballot position to third parties or make it impossible for third parties to qualify.

    Number two, will the effect of this Court's order mean that if the voters of Ohio vote for the American independent parties ticket that the electors will vote, will pass their ballot for Mr. Wallace and Mr. Griffin?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="6481.801" stopTime="6489.579">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    I think I can answer that by staring at the back that Ohio has no requirement that the electors vote for a person to whom they're pledged.

    Alright, now, next -- may I get to my next question if you care to. 
    As to say, if this Court orders that the American Independent Party appeared on the ballot and the names of Mr. Wallace and Mr. Griffin appear on the ballot. 
    What will be the effect of this Court's order in the event that the people of Ohio cast their votes for give that ticket a plurality of their votes?

    Mr. David J. Young 
    If you allow me to repeat what I have read in the papers I'll be glad to tell you that. 
    I'm not a member of this party; I can tell you that it's my understanding that Governor Wallace will commend the electors to vote for Curtis LeMay as Vice President of the United States.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6626.309" stopTime="6634.121">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Griffin originally selected before you started it lawful?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="6634.121" stopTime="6696.015">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    The petitioners who signed this petition of 450,000 people gave to the three men who are named in the petition, the authority to call a state convention or in the absence of a state convention to make the selection. 
    A state convention was scheduled when it was indicated the results of that convention would not be recognized then it was exercised by the other three. 
    But a state convention was called, was scheduled to be held and the Secretary of State indicated that he would not respect the results of that convention and I think this answers the other point as to whether all of these other laws do apply to third parties. 
    Exhibit 13 in the transcript shows that the Secretary of State said that's why he didn't let them on the ballot because of those requirements. 
    So, and my answer is that I do not feel that the electors in Ohio were pledged that as for the vice presidential candidate they could select Curtis LeMay rather than Marvin Griffin in Ohio.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6696.015" stopTime="6698.667">

    Are they obliged to vote for Wallace?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    As a matter of law --
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="6708.332" stopTime="6708.348">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6708.348" stopTime="6709.209">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- that's what we're talking about?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="6709.209" stopTime="6802.095">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes, I think they're free to vote for whomever they please in Ohio. 
    In Ray versus Blair, this Court held that a court could. 
    I mean a state could establish pledge requirements to participate in a primary. 
    This Court left open whether the question of whether electors are really free even if there were such a requirement to vote for whomever they seem fit but there's no suggestion it seems to me in any decision by this Court that if a state has no pledge requirement that the electors must vote for anyone. 
    Theoretically, they could vote for whomever they saw fit. 
    One of the final points that I would like to raise is the matter of relief that was touched upon before. 
    The temporary order rendered by Justice Stewart would, in these appellants' standpoint satisfy the temporary problem that exists. 
    It seems to me we have two problems; what about the 1968 Election and what happens henceforth? 
    The order rendered by Justice Stewart has been complied with. 
    The Secretary of State has notified us that if that order is not changed, everything is ready to move with the name of Governor Wallace on the ballot. 
    If this Court finds that it's difficult to render a final decision as to what's going to happen in future elections prior to say October the 15th then we would think -- seek a temporary order affirming that what has been accomplished by Justice Stewart for the 1968 Election because that has already complied with.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6802.095" stopTime="6805.726">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, but you're not -- for a moment suggesting that that's a reversal, are you?

    No, no sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6807.627" stopTime="6820.949">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You mean it's your understanding it certainly my understanding that the state could with equal convenience and he is complied with an order which would in fact affirm the action of the District Court?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="6820.949" stopTime="6867.287">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    There're no -- you made that perfectly clearly to us and the order does that this Court is free to order Governor Wallace off the ballot but what I'm saying is that all steps have been taken and if no other order for example of this Court were rendered he would be on the ballot in the November 1968 Presidential Election. 
    I know the Court is troubled by the fact that we did not file this case sooner. 
    The only thing I can say is that under the old law that was changed, 38 days after we filed our case these people could have gotten on the ballot with 29,000 signatures as compared to 452,000. 
    In other words, if these laws hadn't been changed 38 days after we filed our lawsuit, they still could've gotten on the ballot in Ohio with only 29,000 signatures.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6867.287" stopTime="6869.466">

    Was that as a party or just a candidate?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes. 
    Pre-1948?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="6876.563" stopTime="6882.463">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Pre-1948, sixty days before the election with 1% of the signatures someone could get on the ballot.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6882.463" stopTime="6883.265">

    As a candidate?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="6883.265" stopTime="6895.186">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    That's correct, yes. 
    And this was the method first sought in Ohio by these people and when it was foreclosed then they moved in the political party direction.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6895.186" stopTime="6907.793">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The laws and actually after 1948 simply limited independent candidates, they didn't really affect the laws applicable to parties, do they?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="6907.793" stopTime="6909.610">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    That's -- except to the indirect --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6909.610" stopTime="6916.839">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If that was I know that you could no longer be an independent, the only way you could be a candidate on a ballot would be through the party machinery?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="6916.839" stopTime="6994.339">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Yes, before 1948, all of the parties used the independent nominating petition technique because that provided that even though you were technically an independent candidate you'd put a label. 
    So, all of the political parties in Ohio before 1948 used the independent nominating petition technique but they were allowed to put a label next to the name. 
    So, that's how there was this free -- there was this flourishing of independent parties under the prior system. 
    Just a final point, I see my time is up, I do hope this case is not decided on the basis that it is possible to get on the ballot in Ohio. 
    This group had over 2,700,000 throughout the country, 450,000 signatures in Ohio at adequate strength that comply with any kind of a requirement and it isn't a question of time, I've cited in my brief but there's just no way. 
    They're completely barred from these statutes and I hope whatever decision is rendered is rendered on recognition that independent and third party candidates are barred and barred effectively from participating in presidential elections in Ohio. 
    I hope that at least as far as the temporary relief by October the 15th, we can receive an order confirming the order of Justice Stewart and that the situation by order of this Court or upon remand will ultimately be cleared up in Ohio so that will have free elections not --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I'm not sure I understand you. 
    What is -- what would be effect of a final order, why do you make a distinction between a temporary and the final order here?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="7004.118" stopTime="7028.307">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    Because there are two questions before the Court, the matter of temporary relief and ultimate relief. 
    Mr. Lopeman's statement suggested to me that unless you order his name off the ballot by October the 15th, they're going to have a hard time taking it off. 
    So, it seems to me you got a time pressure on the temporary question before you but not as much time pressure on the ultimate relief question of how do we handle all the future elections in Ohio.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="7028.307" stopTime="7050.698">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, do you mean to say that if we rule on the merits here and your opinion will be deciding something about the -- well, will have to be deciding constitutionality of the Ohio statute as applied in this case or generally in either event, wouldn't we?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="7050.698" stopTime="7051.624">

    Yes, yes as --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="7051.624" stopTime="7071.734">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And what you're saying is that one would be an interim order and the other would be a final order but we would not in any case be adjudicating whether there is such a thing as the American Independent Party as a formal Ohio party under Ohio laws for future purposes, is that right?
speaker="david_j_young" startTime="7071.734" stopTime="7081.099">
    Mr. David J. Young 
    I don't think it's necessary for the Court to make that adjudication because even the name appearing on the ballot as it does now with the label would be much the same as the old technique that we used in Ohio.

    Suppose this one is the last day and we just -- after we confer this, this is how we can do it?

    Mr. David J. Young 
    Here's the situation you have before you is that the lower court all three judges of the federal district court below found Ohio's laws were unconstitutional. 
    They were unconstitutional insofar as they denied ballot position to independent candidates and to third party candidates.

    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, this is the companion action in the case below the appellants were plaintiffs in the District Court in the Southern District of Ohio, they are the Socialist Labor Party of America and its Ohio members. 
    They brought suit to challenge an Ohio electoral system which completely excluded them from participating on an equal basis with the other political parties in Ohio or even an unequal basis. 
    Their rights as a political party were in effect obliterated by a series of Ohio election laws. 
    They challenged those laws, a declaratory judgment favorable to their position was rendered, right in voting was provided for the November 1968 General Election, ballot position was denied. 
    From that branch of the opinion denying ballot position, we appeal. 
    Socialist Labor Party of America is a national political party with roots reaching back into the 19th century. 
    It advocates the Socialist reconstruction American society and it advocates that this be brought about to the ballot. 
    It has never used any other means but peaceful constitutional means to advance it to position. 
    Accordingly, it places great emphasize on elections. 
    It is currently in its 20th consecutive presidential campaign. 
    In 1964 presidential elections, it was on the ballot in 16 states conducted a write-in campaign in nine others. 
    Similarly, it has been on the ballot in Ohio going back into the 19th century. 
    Now, the party in Ohio has modest numbers pursuant to the request of the District Court documents were submitted which show to the parties members equal in some approximately 108. 
    These documents also show that the party distributed in single year and this is customary approximately a quarter of million of a pieces of literature leaflets. 
    It is a small party but an energetic one.

    This may be the case but at any rate t is certainly possible at this juncture to print paper ballots, there's plenty of time for the entire state.

    The reasons that the Socialist Labor Party did not bring its suit earlier, now, the documents submitted to the Court this question is covered in reports to the state conventions. 
    Party was anxious to test the constitutional of these laws some years passed. 
    It simply didn't have the resources, in 1946, it qualified for the ballot in Ohio had to file 30,000 signatures to qualify its candidate for governor, it filed 45,000. 
    And what happened? 
    The Board of Election said, not enough signatures had been filed. 
    The party had to file mandamus action in Ohio Supreme Court and finally got an order and put their candidate on the ballot but that exhausted the party's resources. 
    It's a small party and it's not affluent party and it -- for over a period of years it attempted to get counsel which could pursue this action and was unable to finance it. 
    And this case it has been brought by the Civil Liberties Union, that's the only way the party has been able to advance its position and challenge these laws.

    We really don't think there should be any until it's proven that a problem has been created.

    Now, I submit if you have a small political party and it's not on the ballot, if it's not able to meet qualifications, its rights have been impaired.

    I understand Ohio's argument in the previous case as to the source of the right it asserts correctly or incorrectly, it cites Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution. 
    Now, what are you doing? 
    What source are you talking about for these “rights”?

    Alright, Your Honor --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="8049.335" stopTime="8053.072">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Because I presume you're talking about some asserted constitutional right --
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="8053.072" stopTime="8053.131">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="8053.131" stopTime="8055.616">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- federal constitutional right, from where?
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="8055.616" stopTime="8155.109">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    We based our rights on a number of sections of the Constitution but primarily on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We'd like to develop that in this way, Judge Kinneary in District Court said this, he said that if the Wallace party is not placed upon the ballot that it will not have equal opportunity and that it's the electors, the people of Ohio will support that party will be treated as second class electors. 
    And that's not right and if the party therefore should be placed on the ballot but in the same breath he said that the Socialist Labor Party because it is small does not have a similar right. 
    Now, we submit that this type of philosophy is alien to basic constitutional tenants and guarantees and I want to illustrate an example in any other area involving the Bill of Rights fundamental rights. 
    This type of doctrine doesn't apply. 
    For example, assume in a southwest -- a community in the southwest part of this country a restaurant which has a policy in segregation. 
    Assume that the restaurant, the owner of the restaurant will not permit Mexican-Americans or Negroes to eat in that restaurant and a class suit is brought by representatives of both groups. 
    Now, what would this Court think if a court said, well, yes, the policy denies the members of those groups equal opportunity and then it treats them as second class citizens and it will not be permitted? 
    But, it will not be permitted for the Mexican-Americans because in this community they are substantial section of the population, a substantial minority. 
    But on the other hand, the policy will be permitted for Negro-Americans because there is small minority, that's exactly what we have here.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that exactly what you have?

    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    The state legislature is run by two political parties and to them the words “third party” are anathema. 
    Their desire is to perpetuate the type of monopoly a political power which they have enjoyed over the years. 
    The legislators feel --

    That's not true for the courts I'm sure.
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="8383.716" stopTime="8394.617">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    It's -- the courts are much more detached but the federal courts we have much greater faith and their willingness to be guardians of the constitutional rights of third political parties. 
    There is a spirit which pervades Ohio --

    Well, no. 
    The party attempted to assert its rights over the years but it did not have the resources. 
    This was the major cause of its delay, documents have been filed with this Court of reports to convention the Socialist Labor Party where the question is raised again and again. 
    The party did go to Court in 1946 but it cost a lot of money. 
    It just didn't have that kind of resources. 
    This is the problem of the small political party in America. 
    It doesn't have a lot of affluence, it doesn't have a lot of memories and its rights are taken from it.

    Well, except the general provision of the Equal Protection Clause has to be treated some way practically, we cannot construe it because it's never been construed which means each particular class has to have exact the same treatment under all of circumstances but you do claim that application here.

    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    No, we do think there has to be a practical application but the question is what is that practical application for the State of Washington a hundred people can meet on a convention and the party is on the ballot. 
    In the State of New York 12,000 signatures can be obtained and a party is on a ballot. 
    The State of Colorado 300 signatures can be obtained, the party is on a ballot. 
    There's a series of states like this where it is possible for the third political party to share on an equal basis where the other political parties in the state's electoral process but now all of a sudden in Ohio they've got this horrendous requirements and the state as well we have a right and we say, no they don't have a right. 
    If the other states can carry on in the way they have and have a successful electoral system and make room in their process for the participation of third parties, why not Ohio, why not the other states.

    It has not done so in this instance and therefore, since it has not done so in this instance, is it your argument? 
    You are -- you should -- this Court should so declare and should order that you got a place on the ballot because the write-in position ordered by the lower court is not adequate.

    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    Your Honor, to be perfectly candid well, the question of placing the party on the ballot is central at the same time our transcendent concern is this, what you referred to is an extreme position is the position which we feel ought to be urged upon the states. 
    We're not talking about this Court legislating for the states only setting ceilings because what's going to happen supposing that this Court can decide it --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I understand that -- excuse me sir, I'm just -- I'm trying to -- what I'm trying to get from is your view as to this point, suppose that we don't go along with the -- what I've called the extreme position, suppose that we take the position however that lower court was right in saying that the Ohio law is unconstitutional because although Ohio could make reasonable regulations and set up reasonable classifications, these are not reasonable, do you see?
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="8674.018" stopTime="8675.004">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon

speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="8685.463" stopTime="8704.969">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    It would suffice for our purposes for the 1968 Elections because we would then argue as follows that in the absence of any restrictions constitutionally viable restriction imposed by the state, the Court has no right to set up its own and to keep a political party off. 
    Therefore, the District Court here shouldn't place the party on the ballot. 
    So, we would meet that proposition --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="8704.969" stopTime="8706.613">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright, that's what I'm trying to get --

    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    Yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="8706.694" stopTime="8730.448">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- and in other words, your position would be that since by my assumption the statutes unconstitutional this Court should not then say that 100 members of the political party is not enough but we should then say that in all of parties before us are entitled to relief, is that your argument?
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="8730.448" stopTime="8767.827">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    That's correct Your Honor, yes. 
    But now, let me -- that would be one branch of the argument but the second branch is this, in the absence of guidelines, we all know what the tests are now. 
    The tests are -- any statute that's going to regulate the accessibility of the ballot to third parties as we understand it, the judicially determined tests are it must meet necessity, equality, and reasonableness. 
    Most perfectly obvious there's a wide variation as to what these words mean. 
    Your Honors have heard counsel who has said that the test can be such almost anything the legislature decides is constitutionally permissible. 
    We don't agree and the problem we face now even if this Court --

    Elector could -- these days, the right to choose the electors?
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="8774.351" stopTime="8788.755">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    Well, we're referring to the percentage of signatures that it might require. 
    We -- as far as the elect choosing of the electors we think that if the legislature is going to have electors chosen by popular vote it's got to do it pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="8788.755" stopTime="8795.748">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you don't think that legislature could permit the choice we make between A and B, and between A, B, C, and D?
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="8795.748" stopTime="8898.273">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    No, we do not, we think that all parties have to share and that if any are going to be kept off it's going to be on a reasonable basis in compelling necessity has to be shown which it never has been shown with respect to small third parties. 
    The cost for example placing a small third party in the ballot is negligible. 
    It's simply a matter of the printer setting some type. 
    This country and the states spend enormous sums of money on many other things of dubious value. 
    And when it comes to election which is the heart and soul of our constitutional system that's no time to practice economy. 
    The democratic process can't be measured in dollars and cents. 
    The member of the small third party is taxed. 
    His taxes flow into the public treasury and out of this treasury come the funds to pay for the ballots. 
    Now, why should he be taxed, this is a due process argument enforced the paper ballots which exclude this party. 
    He has just as much right to have his party on the ballot if he can meet minimal standards as the large parties just as the small minority has just as much right to have a protection against segregation laws as the large minority. 
    There's -- that's an invidious discrimination and we again urge and again repeat that in state after state it is possible for third political parties to be on the ballot. 
    We are concerned what Ohio is going to do in Ohio. 
    The words “third party” are anathema. 
    That state legislature is going to go back and if this 15% requirement has been knocked out, they are going to consider well, what's the next highest one we consent. 
    We don't want a multiplicity of suits. 
    We would like to have the manner settled the guidelines, the test of necessity, equality and discrimination are not precise enough. 
    And we would hope and urge that the Court will develop clear guidelines which would preclude arbitrary action.

    No, it's a different but it's in the area of voting rights and it says in voting rights whenever there's any impairment or infringement it cannot be constitutionally warranted unless necessity is shown. 
    And that we've quoted those cases in our brief and we think that this Court has said that any impairment has to be meticulously scrutinized. 
    Well, now, if other states are able to have election laws which permit third party participation then we have to meticulously scrutinized those days which impose higher restrictions because what is happening is this, these legislators are precluding competition. 
    They are setting standards so high that third parties and independents cannot compete not just because of their fear of these parties but also because of the splitting votes.

    Now, if you have some individual who for example did not file his nominating petition in time. 
    And then depends upon a write-in vote, there will be an inequality there but it's not a serious matter. 
    It was his fault he didn't file in time, it's a one time only proposition and there is inequality but at least he has the chance but for a political party which regularly election after election that goes to polls, certainly it should have as much opportunity as a larger party.

    Mr. Lopeman, I want into this pretty carefully some time ago and I would agree with you at the extent that it's rather ambiguous as to what they asked. 
    They recite in the body of their complaint their desire against such relief, I would agree with you of their prayer is not very clear. 
    I don't have it in front of me but as I finally understood it, it was rather a conditional prayer. 
    They asked first that the legislature be directed or be given an opportunity to do something about this and then they said, if the legislature fails to act then we ask the Court to give us that really, was that about right?

    Mr. Charles S. Lopeman 
    As a practical matter, it is impossible at this time to -- for the State of Ohio to comply with an order granting the requested relief. 
    Mr. Gordon has apparently canvassed 10 Boards of Elections.He mentions Cuyahoga County, he does not mention that he checked Franklin County or he was advised that it was an impossibility. 
    I have asked the Secretary of State before filing this motion if it would be possible. 
    He has advised me that it would be impossible. 
    Nothing this Court can do short of setting back the election date can result in them appellants getting the relief they request. 
    Further, we feel that the arguments presented by this appeal are the same as the arguments and questions presented by the appeal in Williams versus Rhodes and therefore since four argument has been made, we do not wish to make any further argument at this time. 
    We would respectfully request this Court to affirm the decision of the United States District Court.

   Rebuttal of Jerry Gordon
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="9768.539" stopTime="9773.463">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gordon.
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="9773.463" stopTime="9804.858">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    May it please the Court. 
    I'd like to first again emphasize that the Socialist Labor Party, small though it was and is, was on the ballot many, many times in the course of Ohio's history, documents have been submitted to the Court. 
    What we actually ask is that the party's right to be restored that were taken from it and we'd like to emphasize this that in many other areas of voting rights do primarily to the contributions of this Court there has been great advance and progress, rights have been given to Negroes to vote and to women to vote and we had the reapportionment case --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="9804.858" stopTime="9806.535">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, this Court didn't give them the right to women?
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="9806.535" stopTime="9811.113">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    Oh! 
    Except the women but on the apportionment cases and on theory matter and the whole members --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="9811.113" stopTime="9814.676">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Part of this Court gave Negroes the right to vote, that's in the Fifteenth Amendment?
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="9814.676" stopTime="10044.036">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    Well, because so there are many other cases such as Louisiana versus United States where the right was circumscribed by the way it was implemented by the actions of local boards of elections. 
    And the Court has struck that down and issued decrease and in that case, incidentally the Court said that a decrease should not only prevent -- illuminate the discrimination which had existed up to that point but to prevent future discrimination as well. 
    This is the type of decree we seek because otherwise we're getting to go back to Ohio and go to through the same -- same experience we've had before. 
    We consider inevitable the Court has seen the resistance and hostility of these appellees and these pervades Ohio to third parties. 
    We asked for a restoration of these rights and the year 1908 in Ohio, the democratic candidate for governor got a half of million votes that republican candidate got a half of a million votes and the Socialist Labor Party got a small votes, 797 but it was on the ballot. 
    It didn't bankrupt Ohio. 
    It's possible for small groups of people to enjoy these kind of rights and there's no reason why they shouldn't. 
    We note in other areas of fundamental right such as the First Amendment. 
    A speaker who addresses a small crowd is permitted to speak just as the speaker who addresses the large crowd and we would never be suggested that the rights can be circumscribed and the words of Terminiello versus Chicago. 
    To circumscribe those rights you'd have to show it produces a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience. 
    All that we're told is well, there's a certain inconvenience to have a small party on the ballot. 
    That's not our reason to deny the right of that party to compete on an equal basis with the larger political parties. 
    What we asked most of all is for some guidelines to the state to prevent a repetition of the experience that this party has gone through where it went for decades, enjoying ballot status and now is denied that status. 
    And we believe that the guideline should be that states can regulate the accessibility the ballot to third parties but not more than as absolutely necessary and if this can be spelled out with some greater clarity in precision and has been before, this would certainly advance the cost of participatory democracy and the rights of small groups to participate. 
    We have today many small groups in this society who feel strongly have burning feelings about issues and are capable of causing substantial disruption. 
    Do we want to channel the discontent and the dissent in to the electoral process, I say we do. 
    But if we're going to say to those groups, yes, if you are not satisfied with our institutions the way to express your dissent to sue the political parties but do it through either the democratic or republican party, we're not going to channel the discontent through this type because they're not going to -- they're not going to participate on that basis. 
    They should be encouraged to form the wrong political groups and it should not be prohibitive and the requirement should be minimal so that it's easy for them to participate on the political process. 
    We think this is a very important policy consideration which should inspire the Court to make the accessibility of the ballot easy and to encourage groups to participate in this area. 
    Finally, we don't think that this, what we feel to be an invidious discrimination of the small versus the large should be dignified by excluding the Socialist Labor Party from the ballot in the November 1968 Elections because it would be saying in effect. 
    This has been the main rational the District Court and in this Court's decision granting temporary injunctive relief where the point was made there had been some delay. 
    What was quoted in that order was what the District Court had said about the small size of the party? 
    We would hope this Court would not dignify a position which says that the larger groups shall enjoy these rights but the smaller groups can --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="10044.036" stopTime="10065.236">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Gordon, what do you say to the representation -- professional representation by the representative of the Attorney General of Ohio that it's now a simple impossibility to give you the relief that you asked for 1968 and I'm not now talking about your laches perhaps it's all my fault but we're dealing with the fact not a theory as he represents it us, what do you say on that?
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="10065.236" stopTime="10113.313">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    We did call Franklin County. 
    We included that in the brief we filed to the court Saturday. 
    We were never told that it was impossible. 
    We talked to Vernon Bob of the printing company and he did indicate some very large problems as far as reprinting strips for voting machines. 
    There's no question about that and it maybe that they wouldn't have time although he said, well, maybe some other printers could do it but then there's limitation -- there's limited number who can. 
    But we say this and we make this categorical statement, there is time to print paper ballots in every county of the state. 
    There's no question about that and Franklin County is elsewhere. 
    We've got plenty time before the election to do that. 
    And if members of this Court were prepared to make such an order in McDougal versus Green which is 12 days before the election, certainly with twice that time here there's time, Cuyahoga County has started making its paper ballots for --

speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="10125.628" stopTime="10153.136">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    We would say if that's what's necessary it should be not. 
    It's that important, it's not important to tell the people of Ohio we have seen these two cases come up together from the very inception in our case is the senior case. 
    It's then important to tell the people of Ohio that both groups shall be given relief and not one or the other. 
    We would favor both groups on the ballot and if there is a certain disruption of the electoral process that's a small price to pay for democracy. 
    That's a small price to pay for --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="10153.136" stopTime="10155.291">

    For a total disruption of the electoral process and all?

    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    No. 
    We state in our brief that if we had waited -- if we sought relief now, obviously we wouldn't expect much response from the Court.

    Well, let me ask you this Mr. Gordon, you have two prongs to your case. 
    One of them is that these statutes are unconstitutional; the other is that you want some temporary relief. 
    Now, if the Court should determine that these statutes are unconstitutional but that it's too late to afford you the remedy that you asked for, wouldn't you win this case? 
    Wouldn't major source of your argument be satisfied and wouldn't you win to all practical purposes?
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="10260.651" stopTime="10286.294">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    Your Honor, we will only win this case if this Court take steps to preclude a recurrence of the experience that we have had in Ohio where the rights of these party were obliterated only if guidelines are established that will prevent, that will establish ceilings on the Ohio legislature because otherwise it's just as inevitable as it is that day follows the night, we will be back in Court in 1969 again challenging the new statutes which they passed.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And that is no matter how late you come to this Court you had 20 years that you could've test to this if you wanted to as a national party because you have been a national party for 20 years but you think that regardless of the exigencies of the situation that you can come in just as late as you want and without regard to the disruption of the election process you can say to us in order to do your duty, you have to give us temporary relief.
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="10315.747" stopTime="10331.767">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    We say this Your Honor that the temporary relief was granted to the Wallace group on September 10. 
    We got the order in September 11. 
    We immediately notified and asked the Secretary of State to place the Socialist Labor Party candidates on the ballot, he declined, we notified him, we gave him notice of the filing of a motion.

    That was a temporary relief that can be changed by the judgment of this Court?
speaker="jerry_gordon" startTime="10342.017" stopTime="10391.761">
    Mr. Jerry Gordon 
    That's correct Your Honor but the point is that there is still time and this we think is the crucial question. 
    We recognize this, that this Court has to weigh the competing equities and one thing it's going to take in to consideration is the state of preparation of the printing of the ballots. 
    We recognize that, all we're saying is this, that the factors on the other side outweigh this consideration and the factors are these, that a small group, the rights of a small group should be respected to the same extent as a large group and as long as it is still possible for that small group to have a place on the ballot, it should be where the place the ballot and this would dramatize by placing the Socialist Labor Party in the ballot it would dramatize the Court's adherence to that basic principle. 
    We think the language in the opinion which says that when you don't -- when you have to rely on write-in voting and you're not on the ballot that makes you a second class elector and denies your equality --

    But there are these other factors which outweigh it. 
    We think it would be a grave tragedy if the one party, the party stand on the opposite ends of the political spectrum. 
    We're not anticipating what this Court is going to do we know better than that but we're just saying this -- we -- our position is all party should be on the ballot that if the ballot is going to be opened the time to do it is now, not later. 
    I don't want treat any further this question of whether we raise this in the court below because I think we documented it in the papers that we filed. 
    We agree that the prayer could've been somewhat clear but we have documented in the brief, filed it Saturday that we certainly did request this believing this relief and as a matter of fact the District Court did say that the main objective of both cases is for valid status. 
    We think this question is so important that you cannot impair rights of small groups without showing a compelling necessity, it never has been shown. 
    Therefore, if Socialist Labor Party like the democrats or republicans should enjoy equal rights and if this is an election race, the race should start at the same place. 
    Thank you very much, Your Honor.
