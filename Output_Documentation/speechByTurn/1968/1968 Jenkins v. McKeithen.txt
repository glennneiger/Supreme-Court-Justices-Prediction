    Yes.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Simons you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="j_minos_simon" startTime="50.949" stopTime="530.135">
    Mr. J. Minos Simon 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The case presents for the consideration of the Court, the validity of the state statute enacted by the 1967 legislative session of Louisiana and the issues presented are composed and framed by the pleadings in as much as the lawsuit instituted by the plaintiff was dismissed in connection with a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants in this case. 
    The decisions relies upon the holding of this Court in the case of Hannah versus Larche which involved an interpretation of the Commission on Civil Rights or the Civil Rights Commission that was enacted by Congress recently and also partly relies upon a decision of the highest court of the State of Louisiana interpreting or given its own interpretation of what this Court held in what is the effect of the particular statute in question. 
    And that decision was made, rendered in Martone versus Morgan which is before this Court on rehearing. 
    It's docketed on -- under Number 216 of the 1968 term of the Court. 
    The plaintiff in substance complains that the Act as a matter of law is unconstitutional and also as administered against him. 
    The plaintiff alleges that he is a member of a trade union and that the Act in question has been administered discriminatorily against him and members of the union in question resulting in repressive action. 
    I submit to Your Honors that the Hannah decision did not involve the type of legislation that is involved in the case before you. 
    And I think perhaps a very quick reference to the essential structure of the Commission that was created by this Act as well as its function we illustrate the point that I am emphasizing at this time. 
    The Act was passed as an emergency act in the State of Louisiana and apparently resting under the allegation that there were some labor strife in the community of the state capital of Louisiana. 
    Now, the legislator in the enactment of the statute created what is designated as the Labor Management Commission of Inquiry. 
    Significantly, this agency or this Commission operates in an ad hoc basis. 
    It operates only when the Governor of the State demands or request that it operates and it investigates only in that area outlined and delineated by the Governor himself in requesting the investigation. 
    It's significant to point out that all of the officials of the State Governor from the top to the very bottom, every employee, every agency, every department, every commission are impressed to do cooperative service with the members of this Commission by virtue of the provisions of Section 880.6 sub-paragraph (d). 
    I should like to also emphasize that the investigative forces of the Commission can be assigned to the state police and during that assignment, they have all the powers of state police. 
    The Commission itself has endowed itself or has been endowed with plenary powers of subpoena. 
    It could take depositions anywhere in the United States and also it may compel obedience to its orders through the process of contempt proceedings. 
    Equally significant is a fact that this Commission expressly does not have any power or authority or jurisdiction to investigate the whole hearings or seek to ascertain the facts or make any reports or recommendations as to any of the strictly civil aspect of any labor problem or dispute. 
    It is limited exclusively to the -- to investigating and determining the existence of any criminal law violations both of the state and the federal laws that may occur in the area of labor management relations. 
    Not only this, but it must conduct public hearings as to any such inquiry. 
    It can conduct or hold executive sessions but then only on the request of one commission member who in his opinion may feel that there may be a defamatory content or incriminatory content to the investigation. 
    However, it has full powers I stated to bring all witnesses before it, to interrogate these witnesses as to the existence of any crime whether they are of federal or state origin. 
    These hearings must be public and furthermore, it is charged with the responsibility of making findings and these findings relate to the existence of or probable existence of criminal law violations and also to pronouncing official judgment when individuals who may be involved in the criminal law violation in question relating to labor management offense. 
    Not only is this Commission under the mandatory duty of making these public findings but in addition to that, this Commission is under the mandatory duty of publicizing these findings. 
    So that and then furthermore, after it has conducted these public hearings, after they had made these public findings and after there's publicize these public findings, it then becomes its mandatory duty to report its findings and recommendations to â€œproper federal and state authorities charged of the responsibility for prosecution of criminal offenses." 
    I submit Your Honors that this piece of legislation establishes a public body that has: one, an accusatory function; two, that it must make and it can make official or pronounced official judgments on individual and that it must publicized both the findings as to the existence or probable existence of criminal conduct and as to the individuals who may be involved and that furthermore, that this is the part of a criminal process. 
    Now, essentially, it is an inquiry and to blame workers if the authorities or the authorities charged of the responsibility of instituting criminal proceedings themselves should not decide to do so. 
    The Commission has the authority to direct the chairman to proceed directly with the filing of such criminal charges both of the federal and the state authority. 
    And also the Commission may request to the Governor, request the Attorney General to utilize all the powers of its office in the supervision of all the district attorney throughout the state to carry out the recommendations and the findings made by --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="530.135" stopTime="553.816">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But I take it in the long run, as far as filing of charges is concerned that the action of the Commission is only a recommendation and they can't themselves effectively file a -- they can file a complaint with the law enforcement officer I suppose like any citizen can but they can officially launch a criminal action.
speaker="j_minos_simon" startTime="553.816" stopTime="556.551">
    Mr. J. Minos Simon 
    The case is not in the technical sense of the word.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="556.551" stopTime="564.976">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean the law enforcement officer still has to make his decisions whether actually to file a charge than is it to the criminal proceeding?
speaker="j_minos_simon" startTime="564.976" stopTime="579.786">
    Mr. J. Minos Simon 
    That's correct Your Honor. 
    Of course, my position is by then that's somewhat in anticlimactic because the individual involved has already been found guilty by the Commission and his guilt it was preceded by a public hearing where --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="579.786" stopTime="588.138">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the Commission has arrived that it's opinion of the matter I take it but it certainly doesn't bind the law enforcement official I take it.
speaker="j_minos_simon" startTime="588.138" stopTime="592.488">
    Mr. J. Minos Simon 
    I'm sure it doesn't bind the law enforcement official technically.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="592.488" stopTime="595.267">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It doesn't even bind him to file a charge.
speaker="j_minos_simon" startTime="595.267" stopTime="621.149">
    Mr. J. Minos Simon 
    It doesn't even bind him to file a charge but I'm sure that in the ordinary affairs of public government where that same district attorney by virtue of the provisions of the statute himself is impressed cooperatively as a member of this Commission. 
    In other words, he must cooperate with his commission. 
    Every state or officer, every employee of the State of Louisiana are impressed cooperatively into service with this Commission.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="621.149" stopTime="623.117">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Does Louisiana use a grand jury?

    Mr. J. Minos Simon 
    Yes, sir, Louisiana does.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="624.180" stopTime="631.445">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I suppose there are some crimes that require an indictment by a grand jury?
speaker="j_minos_simon" startTime="631.445" stopTime="641.681">
    Mr. J. Minos Simon 
    Murder is one of them. 
    Capital offenses require that otherwise, the district attorney may file charges involving anything short of capital offenses.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="641.681" stopTime="651.053">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I suppose then that the grand jury might reject indicting someone even though the Commission had recommended it.
speaker="j_minos_simon" startTime="651.053" stopTime="663.857">
    Mr. J. Minos Simon 
    I'm sure that's a possibility, Your Honor. 
    But as a practical matter, with all of the prior publicity with the public condemnation that attaches to the individual and to the crime involved --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="663.857" stopTime="672.703">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you suggest that as a practical matter, no prosecutor could afford to reject one of these recommendations in so far as filing the complaints?
speaker="j_minos_simon" startTime="672.703" stopTime="729.538">
    Mr. J. Minos Simon 
    It would be my judgment but it would be hazardous position for him to assume. 
    He would have to be very courageous, independent-minded public prosecutor to resist and repel the force that would be generated by all these prior publicity because this is an open hearing. 
    While the Commission may conduct executive hearings, it cannot refer to that or use that evidence as part of its findings unless all that evidence heard in executive hearing is heard anew in a public hearing, and of course during these public hearings, you have the television people, they are with their cameras writing their way and publicizing all that is going on before the Commission. 
    And furthermore, there are no effective rules of evidence, of meaningful rules of evidence. 
    The Commission hears anything, hearsay evidence, opinion evidence, innuendos, just anything it chooses to hear it hears because there's nothing to regulate the scope and the character of the evidence which it brought forth.

    Mr. Jenkins' interest is number one, that he is a member of the labor union which has been singled out by the officials who have administered this Act. 
    The pleadings will indicate that Your Honor and I stated the issues are composed and framed by the pleadings. 
    This was dismissed on a motion by the defense to dismiss. 
    The pleadings state that he is a member of Teamsters Local Union No.5. 
    Yes, in our investigation if Your Honor please, he has been charged with four separate offenses in connection with the investigations and he charges all -- pardon Your Honor. 
    The charge was in the name of the district attorney of one of the parishes of Louisiana.

    Well, he didn't allege that he had been -- that he had done something or something that happened which actually did not occur, if Your Honor please. 
    But what he does allege which is of great significance, I think, is that this Commission has embarked upon a course of conduct designed in purpose to destroy the labor union to which he belongs by maligning it, by maligning its members, scandalizing them, by attempting to destroy this labor union and discredit all of its members. 
    Now, I think Your Honors have recognized in your several decisions that the right to belong to a labor union is a constitutionally protected right under the First Amendment. 
    And furthermore, I think you've held that the right to belong to a -- or to belong to an association and the right to be free from defamation is also a constitutional protective right that one has and to that extent then we show injury to a constitutionally protected right.

    Well, if Your Honor please, this is not -- the ultimate charge in itself is not the gravamen of the complaint. 
    It is that there's a public pronouncement of guilt. 
    One is branded as a public enemy, preceded by a public hearing where persons are sworn. 
    Whether there's no compliance with the rudiments of fair play and due process, there are no meaningful rules of evidence and then after he is found guilty as such and that guilt is publicized. 
    And that guilt, and that finding forms part of a process of a criminal prosecution because the whole objective, the whole aim, the whole purpose of the hearing is to bring about the criminal prosecution of an individual after he has been found after he has been found guilty of the charge that's ultimately is alleged against him.

    Now suppose I want to get back to Justice Harlan's question. 
    Suppose a legislative committee were set up and for this precise purpose that is to say to ascertain whether criminal laws have been violated and to name specific persons for that purpose. 
    Do you or do you not consider that that would be within the legislature's constitutional prerogative?
speaker="j_minos_simon" startTime="1530.415" stopTime="1641.307">
    Mr. J. Minos Simon 
    I believe that in that context where there's no purpose to gather evidence for the purpose of enacting legislation or their remedial character where the sole function is to make an official for public judgment as to guilt or innocence of citizens. 
    I think that in that context, even if the legislature is acting, that the rigorous demands of due process must be complied with, that the individual have the right to cross-examine witnesses and have a right to the effective assistance of counsel and all of the panoply of due process that is envisioned by the Fourteenth Amendment of -- to the Constitution. 
    But this is not the end product or the end result or the ultimate purpose of this particular legislation. 
    They go one step further. 
    They have a mandatory inescapable duty of then proceeding to present this to the state and federal authorities charged with the responsibility of instituting criminal proceeding. 
    Now, this is far removed from legitimate legislative investigation where evidence is gathered. 
    No formal judgment of guilt or innocence as pronounced but evidence is gathered to be called and sifted and to be considered for the members of the legislature for the purpose of attempting to this due remedial legislation. 
    This is not involved in this particular case. 
    The whole purpose is to first, publicly condemn and that's preceded by a formal hearing where the oath is solemnly told and then there is condemnation and not only condemnation but there is an additional step where the committee, the executive committee will then go forward and file and present this to the authorities charged with the prosecution of criminal law violations. 
    In addition to this it has the authority itself to go forward and file these charges.

    Hannah for example wherever there was a defamatory content or an incriminating content, Hannah went into executive session, it had to.

    The contrary is true in this case. 
    This Commission must conduct public hearing. 
    If it goes into executive session, it cannot utilize what evidence it has developed in that session and if it seeks to do so, it must represent all anew, all this evidence in a public hearing. 
    There was some claim.

    There have been statements of bribery by state officials and otherwise or attempted bribery of Mr. Partin. 
    There are criminal charges pending the state courts involved in the very same thing.

    Furthermore, the Governor stated that anybody who would give testimony in support of the conspiracy charge involved in this particular case in the Martone case, will be charge with perjury. 
    With Mr. White, the undercover agent signed his affidavit, within 30 days, he signed the affidavit that was filed in the federal forum, the Federal District Court. 
    Within 30 days, a member of the Commission filed perjury charges against Mr. White's statement based upon his allegation that these people were involved and were involved in the conspiracy to commit murder.

    Mr. Ashton L. Stewart 
    Well, I wouldn't say so, no more than any other commission, no more than any other legislative commission or committee, they can make observations. 
    The statute says to make findings and that's whatever the legislative commission --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And what is your idea be it defined then, we find (Inaudible) what? 
    Guilty of violating such and such a statute, what would your word be?

    Mr. Ashton L. Stewart 
    Well, I would think that would be sufficient judgment.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    To say that he's guilty.

    Mr. Ashton L. Stewart 
    They could find -- that would be a finding. 
    A finding would encompass such --

    And then you give him all the due process after that.

    Mr. Ashton L. Stewart 
    Well, if we have a situation as we have here with these conditions going on and with the jurisdiction of the district attorneys and the grand juries limited to parish limits, they needed something because this industrial complex encompass far more than one or two parishes. 
    They needed some help. 
    What were they to do? 
    They certainly publicize by making everything public. 
    The public of course could judge very well if anyone was doing something unfair then I think that was one of the statutory features of this statute was public and not private.

    Mr. Ashton L. Stewart 
    Well, I know that Dean Morgan and Dean Abe have resigned and three labor members they resigned and I believe so, subsequently here recently, the governor haven't accepted their resignation so they came back and they have now been holding some executive meetings. 
    I do not know. 
    I do not represent the Labor Management Commission. 
    I'm just handling this litigation and I'm not familiar with what they are doing in such as it. 
    We would like to say that there's nothing in the record to show that any of these charges against Mr. Jenkins were filed by this Commission that is the assault charges. 
    There's nothing in the record to show his -- the allegation that was read was that these charges in conspi -- were filed in conspiracy with the Commission. 
    The affidavit of Mr. George with reference to the murder count is quite different I think than saying that he had made that allegation. 
    He says that he was advised that these various men could be shot and killed by members of the labor -- by members of the Commission of Inquiry at the slightest provocation and the amount of it would make it appear to be an act of self defense and we would like to add here that all of the allegations with reference to the administration of the statute and we've argued it at length in our brief have no causal connection with the administration of the statute. 
    They charge for example that Mr. Jenkins himself was filed on by the district attorney that has no causal connection with the Commission because they can't do that and it's not that they did it. 
    He does not allege that. 
    The causal connection is lacking to where they say that the Commission is threatened to kill these six people. 
    That has no causal connection with the administration of the statute. 
    There are many other things that they have alleged here that they have passed her that have no causal connection with the administration of the statute and we would like to touch on the lack of jurisdiction here and mootness and one of the basis of the lower court's decision. 
    Here, this plaintiff has not alleged that he was about to be called or that he has been called or that he was being investigated or it was about to be investigated. 
    He has said that he was suing as a member of a class and he hasn't even alleged so far as we can read his petition that any members of the labor union that he belonged to were subpoenaed or were about to be subpoenaed or were being investigated.

    No sir. 
    My understanding, the Commission has no authority whatsoever to file any information such as out against a man. 
    We have cited in our brief, and only the district attorney can do that or the grand jury.

    They have no authority to do that. 
    They have no control over the district attorney.

    Mr. Ashton L. Stewart 
    Oh yes, that they could conspire to such as that but only the district attorney can make that decision, only the grand jury. 
    Are there are any other questions? 
    Thank you, sir.
