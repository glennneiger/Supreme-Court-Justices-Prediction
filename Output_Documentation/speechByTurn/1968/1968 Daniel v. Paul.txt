    Mr. Gallman, you may continue with your argument.
speaker="james_w_gallman" startTime="13.092" stopTime="146.666">
    Mr. James W. Gallman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. Yesterday, we were discussing the Nixon Farm which under the calls was improved and became a more of a place of business as we've observed from the record. 
    The -- with the advent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Paul chose to operate their establishment under the guise of the private club as this evidence from the record here. 
    This was rejected out of hand by the District Court and does not even a serious question in the District Court. 
    It does have one surprising effect of the case though that I think is followed it all the way through. 
    If we look at the record in the commencement of the case, we see that it counsel for the plaintiff or for Mrs. Daniel and Mrs. Kyles intended the trial based upon the private club exception of the 1964 Act. 
    Now, this fell flat a gain in point in this regard, and that after, I think the record reflects at adequate proof was not brought in concerning the connection of this business with the commerce so that the Act apply. 
    Now, the District Court in view that number one, that there was no coverage under the Act because this is not a place of entertainment. 
    It considered it a place of participation or exercise or such as that and not one where the one is entertained. 
    And it assumed that perhaps some of the items at the place of business had moved in interstate commerce.

speaker="james_w_gallman" startTime="173.081" stopTime="174.572">
    Mr. James W. Gallman 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="174.572" stopTime="176.115">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So, that is out of this case.
speaker="james_w_gallman" startTime="176.115" stopTime="480.978">
    Mr. James W. Gallman 
    I believe so. 
    There was further the question of what connection the so-called lunch stand, snack bar or what have you here had this -- with the establishment. 
    That is would it be come under 201 (b) (4) or 201 (b) (2) restaurant and cafeteria and lunch counters sold about so, principally it gave in selling food for consumption on the premises. 
    The lower court felt that this business of swimming and sun bathing and so on, and that the food that was strictly incidental and not a major enterprise of the business. 
    It also rejected the idea that there were two establishments here and so as to say that under subsection 4 that there was no covered establishment that would rankly entire establishment for that the cover of the Act. 
    When this case got to the Court of Appeals, the reasoning was the same. 
    There, the Court of Appeals looked at the two requirements or coverage under the '64 Act, namely the commerce connection or the offer to serve interstate travelers. 
    Now again, I'd advert to the fact the record below was not developed with respect to the offer to sell/serve interstate travelers. 
    There simply no questioning about it. 
    It is true that it could be inferred from the testimony of Mr. Paul that they would serve any white person without inquiring about their origin. 
    But there is no searching inquiry at all as to whether they would restrict their service to dam sealers of the area, that is would leave the interstate traveler go elsewhere. 
    This really is considering the geography of the matter, a remote and isolated lunch room if that's what we're talking about. 
    It's some 12 miles from the city. 
    It's hard to get to as I explained yesterday hard to find. 
    The Court of Appeals then approached it from the standpoint of what did the record show with respect to commerce, and I know that Court had in mind just as the Assistant Attorney General have here that common sense wise, the business must have some connection with interstate commerce. 
    But are we dealing with the question of whether there is sufficient connection in the area for Congress to legislate? 
    Are we dealing with the question of whether under the provisions of the Act, a substantial part of the food served at the lunch room which it serves as moot in interstate commerce? 
    Now, there were four items mentioned. 
    Hamburgers, hotdogs, softdrinks, and milk. 
    It's argued by petitioners here that three of the four items had interstate arguments. 
    There was no evidence about it. 
    The District Court without any evidentiary support at all said that he suppose that some of the ingredients for the hamburgers, I suppose the flour had interstate origin. 
    The drink I think he laid aside because of the legislative history of the Act indicating that it's the inquiry about the food, not about the drink. 
    He said that there's some of the ingredients obviously came from out of state I'm sure, as a matter of common knowledge, but it's not in the record. 
    I'm satisfied or I feel my common sense tells me that this establishment sold cigarettes, that it sold candy, that it sold some other items, gum, mints, item such as these, but it's not in the record. 
    As a matter of fact, the record indicates the absent. 
    So, I think this is what they get to when we look for coverage under the Act. 
    We find that it was thought of as a case where there would be a serious contest over private or public exemption, and then law and behold, that fell through. 
    And I've that the same experience myself that you think your case true, but did not go ahead and introduce a necessary evidence to show coverage under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="480.978" stopTime="485.363">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Does the record show what kind of beverages were sold, what were they softdrinks?

    Mr. James W. Gallman 
    No.

speaker="james_w_gallman" startTime="487.353" stopTime="489.779">
    Mr. James W. Gallman 
    They were softdrinks. 
    I think it reflects that too.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="489.779" stopTime="490.896">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Didn't have a liquor license?
speaker="james_w_gallman" startTime="490.896" stopTime="500.024">
    Mr. James W. Gallman 
    No. 
    No, there's no liquor --the -- it's indicated that no beer was sold. 
    Of course, Arkansas is a --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="500.024" stopTime="501.077">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    More or less dry state is.
speaker="james_w_gallman" startTime="501.077" stopTime="792.587">
    Mr. James W. Gallman 
    -- package type of state you cannot dispense liquor buy to drink. 
    But this place is always been noted for no alcoholic beverages of any kind. 
    So, the Court of Appeals approach is this. 
    Now, Judge Henny does dissented in the Court of Appeals. 
    He was quite so sure that Judge Mahaphy, the majority judge, was wrong about this lack of evidence concerning movement of the food in commerce. 
    He wanted to look at some Arkansas statutes that permitted or might be use to prevent so-called integration or admissions of Negroes to the so-called place. 
    As saying well, there is an ominous enforcement act in Arkansas that might be use to prevent this sort of thing so we can say that this practice, this discriminatory practice of the falls resulted from state action. 
    So, he but his disagreement only with this conclusion and contended of course all the while that there was sufficient evidence that interstate commerce had furnished the so-called lunch room. 
    Now, the other question I think it deserves comment here is the question of what about this place of entertainment? 
    Basically, this is a participant type amusement park, if we could call it that. 
    I'd rather call it the farm but the record doesn't reflect that. 
    But it doesn't have rights, it doesn't have the things that you had in the Fifth Circuit case of milk, where you have 11 or 12 complicated rights manufactured out of state and brought in without any question. 
    Here, our record concerning the equipment used for boating and boating only that the evidence do is not clear is to where that came from. 
    Now, there is some indication that they have about a dozen boats that called puddle boats. 
    I don't know what they are exactly, except I think of a kind where children get only have some wheels, some pedals, they push and the puddle in the rear of the boat makes it go. 
    Now, I think that's what it is and I'm not sure they have yatch whatever that is. 
    Now, this is a very minor part of the activities as I understand the record. 
    It suggested that these where perhaps purchased out of state. 
    Judge Mahaphy in his opinion said that it was common knowledge, boats was made in Arkansas. 
    There was a reference to an Oklahoma boat company to whom the Paul's paid a royalty. 
    But it is not clear whether if one ends in -- at one point, the question is from whom did you purchase the boats or did you purchase a yatch? 
    They say the same company, meaning the same company to whom the pay the royalties. 
    But there's not testimony about rather boats was made, where the sale was made, where the boat came from, did it come from Oklahoma and Arkansas, there's nothing about it. 
    Now, assume that the briefs that this indicate some interstate contact with reference to that and for that reason, we ought to say that the entertainment here, these boats, move in commerce, and that therefore, this activity ought to be a covered under subsubsection 4 of the Act of two or one of the Act. 
    We suggest that it's not anywhere near like the Miller case that Judge Mahaphy in his opinion was correct that the evidence concerning movement with reference to amusement and entertainment movement in interstate commerce is not there. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals did not have authority and has not have a possibility of drilling on the applicability of the Title 42 Section 1981 and 1982.

    Yes, sir. 
    On a Friday night perhaps a Saturday night between the last day of May and perhaps Labor Day or one of those two nights, the establishment would have a dance. 
    The testimony is that a local band would play for that dance and we would not have entertainers who has move from another state to Arkansas to present the performers. 
    These were so-called amateurs or local musicians. 
    Of course, if you want to know what I know about, that would say that the jukebox played in intermission when the band quit.

    No, sir. 
    To return to the question of Mr. Justice White, the cabaret tax was applied and it speaks of entertainment was applied to places where a jukebox furnished the music for dancing. 
    And there was no performance as such and those cases do exist that I know of. 
    As I've said, the question of the application of the 1981 was not before the Court of Appeals. 
    It appears in the language brought enough to prohibit all discriminatory contract, all discriminatory action concerning contracts. 
    The Government I think raises some very searching questions in its brief concerning the impediments that might exist to holding that 1981 or Section 1 of the 1866 Act, might it itself be sufficient here. 
    I noticed that they caution the Court that perhaps this should be characterized here as a sort of public contract and that the 1866 Act if it has liability ought to be looked at as referring to so-called public title contract.

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please Court. 
    With reference to Mr. Gallman's last point concerning the disposition of the Lake Nixon property. 
    Rumor came to our attention sometime in December after this Court had granted certiorari that the property had been disposed of. 
    Where upon I call the former attorney for the Paul, Mr. Robinson, I believe his name was. 
    He indicated he was not then their attorney, he's understanding was that they did not wish to pursue this case. 
    However, he recommended and since he didn't know anything more, I might talk with Mrs. Paul and Mr. Paul. 
    So, I took this extraordinary step of calling Mrs. Paul directly and asked her whether she had in fact disposed of the property. 
    Her answer was “no”, that the thought it was under contract but the deal had not been consummated. 
    And that is as much of I know and that was of as of late December, 1968.

    Mr. --

    I think it is sufficient for this Court if it wishes to undertake to look at this case the way it look to the case as Hamm versus Rock Hill. 
    There, there was no evidence as to the origin of the food involved and yet, this Court in a divided opinion or a divided court undertook to say that the facilities in Hamm as well as a companion case where in fact opened to the public. 
    They were located neither or five and dime in South Carolina or department store in Arkansas. 
    And that was sufficient that court felt to demonstrate that in the ordinary course interstate connections could be shown as to the origin of the food. 
    We think that situation is particularly at here because the District Court seating at Little Rock very close to Lake Nixon undertook to say that as far as he was concerned, there was sufficient -- a connection with interstate commerce to demonstrate that some of the food at least had originated outside the state. 
    Therefore, our position of course is the case is not moot and the complaint I might mention inclusion, those run against successors in addition to the Paul's, who believe that might get situation here. 
    I have no further comments unless the Court has some questions.

    Did the district judges conclusion that it was -- did involve interstate commerce to allow evidence under to rely on common knowledge?

    With reference to the food, there was no evidence, what the court found was that some of the ingredients in the bread had originated outside of the state as far as he was concern, and that ingredients in the softdrinks are similarly originated outside of the state. 
    But there was no testimony with reference --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now, which ingredients?
speaker="conrad_k_harper" startTime="1581.141" stopTime="1599.438">
    Mr. Conrad K. Harper 
    He did not specify which ingredients. 
    Although, I might indicate that on file with the court are some 20 photographs of Lake Nixon. 
    Some of which show Coca-Cola signs and it may have been had that in mind when he said some of the ingredients of softdrinks originate outside of Arkansas. 
    Thank you.
