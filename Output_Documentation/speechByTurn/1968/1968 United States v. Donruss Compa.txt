    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    May it please the Court. 
    I believe the impression was left yesterday that a taxpayer in this case accumulated a substantial amount of funds and the sole purpose was the avoidance of tax but that was not the decision of the court below. 
    The first inquiry is whether the accumulation exceeds the reasonable needs of taxpayer's business. 
    But this phrase has come to me in the fixed, definite, and certain needs of the business or written obligation of the taxpayer. 
    It's a test which the Government has tried to restrict as closely as possible.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="53.940" stopTime="76.493">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But we know, do we have that before us or don't, isn't the matter issue before us the Government's request for an instruction the denial of that instruction then the action of the Court of Appeals in reversing for further procedures pursuant to the standard that it laid down?
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="76.493" stopTime="77.346">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    I think you're correct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="77.346" stopTime="84.122">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And all of these being with respect to the question of purpose or intent.
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="84.122" stopTime="186.350">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    That's correct. 
    This issue is not before the Court but I think it's pertinent in terms of the effect of what the Government proposes to ask this Court to set the test because in circumstances like this, the jury found that the taxpayer did not have fixed and definite purposes but they held that he did not have a tax avoidance purpose. 
    The taxpayer stated that he had plans for expansion, he intended to buy stock in a distributor and the theory we can infer believe that this was the purpose motivating his conduct. 
    So, while it was not fixed, definite, and certain, nevertheless, it was a permissible purpose and the facts were that the taxpayer did purchase $380,000.00 worth of the distributor's stock that the taxpayer did expand and it was because of this expansion and purchase that the taxpayers continue to be successful but the critical point is that it's the Government's position that in adopting the A purpose test, you would then ask the taxpayer only two questions. 
    Number one, if the distribution was made to you would it be taxable? 
    Number two, were you aware that if a distribution was made to you it would be taxable? 
    And if both of those answers were yes, then it's my understanding that regardless of the fact that taxpayer's purpose is dominant purpose the whole purpose of the accumulation was for expansion to preserve and expand the business that nevertheless the penalty would apply.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="186.350" stopTime="192.390">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, the Government would not agree with that characterization, would it?

    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    I haven't heard them deny that characterization.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="195.497" stopTime="207.338">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Because it's not whether the effect of the distribution would be to subject the stockholder to tax but whether that was one of the motives and --

    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    That's not --

    -- withholding the distribution.
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="211.581" stopTime="249.809">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    I don't regard that that is what the Government is asking this Court to rule on. 
    I think they say very clearly that if the avoidance of tax is one of 100 purposes regardless of its significance then the tax applies and how do you determine what do you mean by avoidance of tax? 
    Well, avoidance of tax is knowledge that a distribution results in taxable income and the whole thrust of the Government's argument and our argument here is such a test really rights out the purpose test because this --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="249.809" stopTime="266.056">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I guess it gets pretty abstruse but and maybe those difference between and what we're struggling with is a shading between the words “purpose, effect and motive.”
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="266.056" stopTime="402.149">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    I think that is correct and it's basically our position that the Sixth Circuit correctly characterized the test in terms of the dominant and impelling motive. 
    It's -- I think one of the difficult things is the burden of proof that the taxpayer has and if you enunciate a test other than the dominant or impelling test whether it has any meaning because once the Court finds that an accumulation is beyond the objectively reasonable needs of the business we're face or the taxpayer is face with a determinative presumption. 
    He has to go forward and prove in very heavy burden that this was not the purpose. 
    He obviously cannot say, “Well, that was not my purpose. 
    I don't think that carries the burden.” 
    I think he's compelled to give specific and definite reasons as it relates to his motivation. 
    Now, as a practical matter, these cases are tried four or five years after the year in issue and he cannot fabricate. 
    I -- I think there is -- the Government is concerned about that these are subjective matters that there is no objective way to determine or test the testimony of the taxpayer. 
    But this is not true. 
    He's talking about a situation of his intentions of his plans and we're viewing these four or five years after and he -- when he says must be susceptible to objective verification or reason. 
    And it's out position that it's only through utilization of the dominant or impelling test that there is any meaning in the phrase avoidance of the purpose that any other test just puts an impossible burden on the taxpayer and I think this is why we believe the Government's position and I think it's very clear when I say, “One out of 100.” 
    That's enough to carry today. 
    That is their position.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But it's only their position against the background of a finding that the accumulation was and serves that frame of reference and by objective standards and unreasonable accumulation.

    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    Unreasonable and our point is that --

    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    No, I don't think that's true. 
    When you talk about the unreasonable means of the business, that phrase has been determined as requiring fixed, definite, and certain needs, something that is susceptible to a knowledge that this is going to require a liability. 
    Now, if the Court if we had a more liberal view of the unreasonable --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="490.672" stopTime="498.229">
    Justice Byron R. White

    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="499.809" stopTime="515.313">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Then what the taxpayer is claiming as justification for this accumulation has been turned to be unreasonable and he is giving an unreasonable reason for the accumulation.

    And it maybe that that is a matter of subjective and then he thought that he needed this much money for that purpose and you say that that's subjective attitude should be some room for that. 
    Is there room for you to prove that it in the case?
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="537.468" stopTime="553.469">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    I would think so because one of the things that concerns me or disturbs me is that in testing what is unreasonable. 
    That's not a very broad test. 
    It's rather limited and I think the whole thrust of our argument in terms of the unreasonable test --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="553.469" stopTime="555.633">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what if weren't though?
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="555.633" stopTime="599.119">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    I think if it were not I think you'd have fewer cases going on the purpose test. 
    I think what you really getting here is expansion problem. 
    The taxpayer that intends to expand desires to diversify but under the unreasonable test cannot satisfy it because he does not his plans have not matured to the state required by the statute. 
    And our position is in view of the fact that this is what the unreasonable test is to then adopt in -- purpose test precludes a taxpayer from expanding.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="599.119" stopTime="622.062">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But if the court, if a judge or jury found the accumulation of the unreasonable by whatever applicable standards there were you're suggestion is that nevertheless a taxpayer should be allowed not to be taxed on the unreasonable accumulation because he had a good faith view that this was -- that his business needed these accumulation?
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="622.062" stopTime="630.008">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    Correct. 
    I think what we're saying that whatever his motivation is he's not looking to avoid tax but he honestly believes that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="630.008" stopTime="724.349">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Braunstein, consideration that bothers me in this case following the quote by Mr. Justice White, is it's arguable that the standard adopted by the Court of Appeals in what you're contending here is contrary really to what the Congress expressly provided and that in a way it undermines the specific language of Section 533 (a). 
    And 533 (a) really makes the test of that intent to avoid stockholder tax a very minor consequence as I read it, it says that once you find that the earnings of the corporation are permitted or accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business that that “shall be determinative of the purpose to avoid the income tax with respect to shareholders unless the corporation by the preponderance of the evidence shall prove to the contrary.” 
    Now, those are very rugged standards but they're Congress' standards whether one makes a good, bad, or indifferent they are in the law.
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="724.349" stopTime="741.405">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    Well, I agree with you and I think they are very difficult standards and what we're saying is that in the Government's view to adopt an A purpose test really writes out any opportunity of the taxpayer to attempt to meet that standard.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="741.405" stopTime="765.644">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, even if you assume that if you go the other way and adopt a dominant purpose test as the Court of Appeals did below and as you're agreeing would seem to go to the opposite extreme and to undermine what seems to be the fairly obvious intention of the Congress?
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="765.644" stopTime="817.261">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    I view that really as a burden of proof aspect that Congress created making it most difficult for the taxpayer once a determination has been made that the accumulation exceeds the “reasonable needs” of the business that a very difficult burden is placed on the taxpayer. 
    And in terms, the taxpayer then has -- is given one last opportunity as I view it to show that his conduct was not motivated by what Congress -- the avoidance of tax that it was motivated by something else and that if we adopt the A purpose test, I --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="817.261" stopTime="830.957">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    There's something else being a reasonable needs of the business but as my brother White was pointing out that if you can show that this accumulation was needed for the reasonable needs of the business you never get to the question of --
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="830.957" stopTime="874.135">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    You never get to that but on the other hand, the reasonable needs of the business have been construed by the regulation and the courts and then the instruction to be fixed definite. 
    And there are many taxpayers if they do want to go on an expansion program at the end of any particular year. 
    It's maybe completely fortuitous that they have advanced to this stay. 
    And what we're saying is that if you accept the Government's interpretation in effect you're just preventing a taxpayer whose legitimate purpose is the expansion and diversification of his business from pursuing that point of view.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="874.135" stopTime="882.876">
    Justice Abe Fortas

    Well, I --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    (Voice Overlap) Let's down the matter of unraveling what the Congress really intended what the spiritual thrust of the legislation is?
speaker="richard_l_braunstein" startTime="897.472" stopTime="994.382">
    Mr. Richard L. Braunstein 
    Well, I think the spiritual thrust of the regulation in going back historically was to get at corporations that the primary purpose was the formation for matters not germane to the corporate function but to tax avoidance. 
    I think that really is the thrust. 
    And what we're saying here is that this interpretation is not inconsistent with that thrust. 
    What it does is permit the closely held corporation to compete with the public corporation. 
    And in no way do I view the test enunciated by the Sixth Circuit as inconsistent with his basic purpose. 
    I think the Second Circuit recognize the fact that this statute should not be construed in consistent with the antitrust laws that it recognize that the philosophy of Congress, I think rather than being hindered by the interpretation of the Sixth Circuit has actually helped. 
    Because I think it is consistent with permitting competition and permitting that closely held corporation to compete. 
    We are not arguing for a standard which permits tax avoidance. 
    We're arguing for a standard which permits the closely held corporation to compete with the public company to diversify and expand and to that extent, I submit it is completely consistent with the congressional purpose of the statute.
