    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on certiorari for the second time to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of North Carolina affirming an order that petitioner and her four children be evicted from a low-income public housing project in Durham, North Carolina. 
    The question for decision is whether tenants in federally financed projects, operated under the United States Housing Act of 1937 as amended, may be evicted from their homes and their federal benefits terminated without being told any reason or given any opportunity to be heard in their own defense before the decision to evict is made by the Housing Authorities. 
    Now, let me emphasize at the outset that, in our view, the fundamental underlying question here is whether poor people who depend on the government for the necessities of life, for shelter, whether poor people will get the same kind of procedural rights and protections that our citizen -- that our system has long given to more fortunate citizens and their contacts with government administrators.

    Well, let's take a comparable case if we can think of one. 
    Let's suppose that the Department of the Interior has a -- lent a lease with a concessionaire to occupy premises in a park area, and the lease says that it's terminable, that this is a month-to-month lease and it's terminable upon 30 days notice, and there's no provision for notice or a hearing or a statement of the reason why the lease isn't being renewed.

    Well, the thing that I -- the difference I perceive is the difference in the purpose of the program because the purpose of this program under the Housing Act is to provide housing for poor people.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I don't think that's important, Mr. Nabrit and this is a terrible important and new area of Constitutional Law to which you're addressing yourself now. 
    And, whether it is appropriate to analyze it in terms of giving the poor people rights that are given to their more fortunate fellow citizens or not is a problem of the utmost consequence, I think. 
    It's a matter of developing cons -- the developing application of constitutional principle. 
    And I, myself, believe that it's one that, and I'm sure you agree with me, that requires the most prayerful and careful analysis on the part of us and, perhaps, the game is not advanced when we merely refer it -- when we present a case like this in terms of equalizing the rights of the poor, vice versa the government, with the rights of the rich because you first have to establish, if I may respectfully suggest it to you, you first have to establish that there is a cognate or analogous right given to more fortunate citizens, vice versa their government.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Well, I agree that these issues about the rights of the poor are a challenge to us all, but there are none without difficulties. 
    Let's look at the position of the Housing Authority in this case. 
    They claim, after all that's transpired, after three years of this litigation, they still maintain that they don't even have to have a reason, they don't have to have any cause to evict a low-income family from its home. 
    They claim that they have no duty to tell the town anything or listen to anything that the tenant has to say. 
    Their position is, in some, is that these destitute people who pend on -- who depend on the government for shelter don't have any rights, that the auth -- procedural rights that authority is bound to respect. 
    Say I think it is relevant. 
    The point is not lost on poor people and that they do understand what's going on when the legal system treats them this way.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Nabrit, I'm going to leave you alone after this, but it's a problem of fundamental consequence in this and other cases, many other cases, and I suggest to you that perhaps two possible lines of approach. 
    One is, it's sort of a Gideon line of the discrimination between the poor and the rich with respect to essential governmental rights. 
    The other, and it may be, and this is for you to argue and not for me. 
    If -- and, it may be the one that's applicable to this case. 
    The other is that in this kind of governmental activity, that is to say the rental of residential property whether it's middle-income, high-income, or low-income, the government takes on certain responsibilities as a constitutional matter which a private landlord does not have. 
    I don't know whether that's right or wrong, but what I'm suggesting to you is the possibility that that may be the basic premise to which one must address for himself.
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="495.411" stopTime="856.183">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Mr. Justice Fortas, I think I agree with that. 
    I don't contend that there's a major equal protection component to the case. 
    I think it's a problem. 
    Of the principal problem in the case is what sort of procedures due process requires. 
    When the government is landlord, it deals with people. 
    I don't disagree with that at all. 
    Let's begin with a few words about this Federal Law, the Housing Act of 1937, so that we have a statutory frame of reference for the consti -- to discuss the constitutional questions. 
    The Congress has declared that the policy of using federal funds and credit to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and their acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of low-income. 
    Now, Housing in this particular program is provided only for families “who are in the lowest income group and cannot afford to pay enough to cause private enterprise to build an adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for their use. 
    Now, the subsidies in this program, although it's operated by Local Housing Authorities, the subsidies are almost entirely 100% federal. 
    The permanent financing of these projects is done by bonds sold by the local authorities. 
    And if the Federal Law subsidizes these bonds in several ways. 
    First, they make the interest n the bonds federally tax-exempt which has the effect of lowering the interest rate. 
    Then, the Government of the United States places its credit, the credit of the United States, to assure the payment of the bonds and under an annual contributions contract with the local authorities, the United States agrees to pay up to 100% on the debt service on the bonds. 
    The local authorities apply their net receipts to the payment of the debt service and any difference the United States makes up. 
    With some projects, the United States does pay 100% of the debt service. 
    In addition, the United States makes ca -- additional cash contributions for elderly families and on account on displaced families, families displaced by federal projects and, finally, the United States pays the administrative cost of the Housing Assistance Administration, a part of HAA itself. 
    Now, the State and Local Governments, rather than subsidizing the projects, in some case actually gain revenue from there by receiving payments in lieu of local real estate taxes from these housing authorities which, under the statute, may amount to up to 10% of the rental income of the projects. 
    There are now 2.6 million people in the United States living in these federally assisted projects. 
    Perhaps a quarter of a million of them have moved in these projects since this case was last argued here a year-and-a half ago. 
    The program is rapidly expanding. 
    About half of these people are Black, about a third of them are elderly, their medium-family income is little over $2,700, and the average rent they pay is about $50 and those figures are for 1967. 
    Of The petitioner was found eligible as she moved into her apartment at $29 a month in November of 1964. 
    Her lease gave -- her lease was a month-to-month tenancy. 
    It gave both the tenant and the Authority the right to terminate by giving 15 days notice before the end of any month, and she lived in the project without any incident for 8-9 months. 
    In August -- on August 10, to be precise, of 1965, Mrs. Thorpe was elected president of a tenant's organization that was being organized in the project. 
    And, the very next day, the authority sent her a notice that her lease was terminated at the end of that month. 
    Several times she asked for a hearing, she was told only that the authority was not required to give a reason for -- or a hearing. 
    And, when she did not move out, this present suit for summary eviction was brought in the State Courts which ordered her eviction. 
    The State Supreme Court ruled on the first appeal that the lease was terminated the ter -- because the term had expired that the auth -- that the reason the Authority terminated was immaterial and this Court granted review during the October term 1966. 
    After argument here in this Court, a year-and-a half ago, the case was remanded to the Court below to reconsider it in view of a supervening event in administrative direction directive circular issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which directed that tenants not be given notices to vacate without being told the reasons and an opportunity to reply or explain. 
    On remand, the Court below again affirmed stating that its prior judgme -- its prior opinion stood. 
    It stood by it and ruling that the circular was inapplicable because issued after the lease, the termination notice, and the Court orders. 
    So, Mrs. Thorpe remains in her apartment under stay orders issued throughout these appeals.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    9 (a) appendix. 
    Now, as I said at the beginning, it seems to us that it's a common place in Administrative Law that governmental agencies grant notice and hearings before taking actions which significantly disadvantage a citizen. 
    Particularly, this is true where the action is based on what amounts to adjudication that a citizen is guilty of misconduct, in effect. 
    Our tradition of due process rejects the idea of ex parte kind of missions. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter once put it that fairness can rarely be obtained by secret one-sided determinations of facts decisive of rights, and the Court has applied that view. 
    The Court has applied that principle in numerous cases. 
    As recently as a few terms ago, a case called Willner against the Committee on Character and Fitness, the principle was applied to a lawyer who was -- whose profess -- whose right to practice law was at stake. 
    It was applied as long ago -- it was applied to Meat Packers, as long as -- ago as the famous Morgan cases. 
    The same principle was true to the engineer that was denied a security clearance and, therefore, whose right to earn a living was at stake in Greene against McElroy. 
    So, I emphasize here that the issue in this case is primarily, I think, a question of procedural due process, to use Mr. Justice Brandeis' phrase, “due process in the primary sense of an opportunity to be heard and to defend.” 
    I think the case does not involve whether there's a right to public housing for all -- for all the poor. 
    Think it does not necessarily involve even what grounds might justify evictions but, rather, only what procedures due process of law requires if benefits are to be terminated.

    Well, to address myself, if I may, Mr. Justice Fortas, to the first part of your question as to whether or not they can terminate just because they were tired of having her here -- or having here there. 
    It seems to me that you have to focus on the statutory framework and the permissible kinds of things the authority can do under the statute. 
    A pri -- In deed, a private landlord could evict someone because he wants to make more profit or he wants the apartment for his brother-in-law or because he wants to tear a building down or anyone of the reasons you could think.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, what you're saying is that, from the fact of that, the purpose of the program is to provide housing for poor people. 
    There derives a procedural right, that procedural right being that before the lease is terminated or allowed to expire by its terms, there has to be a statement of charges or a statement of reasons and an opportunity for a hearing which assumes, too, that there's got to be a reason -- a good reason.

    Well, the statute does give us some guidelines, Section 1410 (g) which is in our brief at 14 -- page 3 (a) of the appendix, 1410 (g) (2), does layout the general considerations that the government once considered in this program. 
    Let me read it. 
    It says that it refers to admission policies, but I take it that the admission policies and the right to remain, that Congress would want the same policy, general principles, filed. 
    So, as the Public Housing Agency shall adopt and promulgate regulations, establishing admission policies which they'll give full consideration to its responsibility for the re-housing of displaced families to the applicant status as a serviceman or veteran or relationship to a serviceman or veteran or disabled serviceman or veteran to the applicants age or disability, housing conditions, urgency of housing need, and source of income, provided that in establishing such admission policies, public housing agencies shall accord families of low income such priority over single persons, as it determines to be necessary to avoid undue hardship. 
    So, for example, if a hearing developed that a housing agency was evicting a family in order to put single persons in or not giving preference to the veterans, they would be doing something that was quite opposed to this after cost.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Mr. Justice Marshall, your question suggests to me that it's relevant to analyze what the tenant has at stake in this, what the Authority has at stake in determining what procedures fairness requires. 
    Our position -- what we rely on is the Due Process Clause. 
    Now, it seems to me it's useful to look at the interest of a tenant who was in a low-rent federal housing project. 
    In the first place, it -- the general framework of it is pretty well-defined by the state and federal statutes. 
    We know merely from looking at the statutes that the housing project wouldn't be built in the first place without specific finding that there's a shortage of housing in the community.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    I agreed with that. 
    Agreed with that. 
    I said I assume that this case doesn't implicate the rights of non-governmental agencies, in terms of their leases. 
    This case depends on the fact that this is a govern -- that this is a government of the landlord. 
    That's -- I was about to address myself to what the tenant has at stake. 
    It seems to me, just looking at the statute alone that, obviously, if tenants who are eligible to get in these projects are evicted, they stand to lose the only chance they have to homes which they can afford which are decent, safe, and sanitary. 
    So that, what the tenant has at stake is of great value, whether you call it a right, a privilege, or what not.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Mr. Justice White, I think not, and for this reason. 
    It seems to me that the North Carolina law is very clear that the only question open to the Court to decide in the summary vision -- eviction proceeding under this statute is, number one, whether the person is a tenant and, number two, whether they're holding over after the term is over 
    That's been the law in North Carolina, under this statute as long as the statute has been there.

    And then it's entirely consistent.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1970.659" stopTime="2000.114">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but let's assume for the moment that, in the eviction hearing, the tenant attempts to urge that she was evicted because of -- she exercised some constitutional rights, and North Carolina said “Sorry, we won't listen to this reason, but it was established as a matter of Constitutional Law that North Carolina had to listen to this sort of a reason. 
    Now, what's wrong with that?

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III

    The last thing you mentioned is one of them. 
    That, in fact, in North Carolina, it's not open to you to do this. 
    Now, I don't deny, for a moment, it's possible to device a judicial proceeding that could give you a hearing on the relevant issues, but I suggest that that's not available now. 
    The second thing that hasn't been said and I should say, Mr. Justice White, is this, that --

    Is that it?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    When the term is ended because of some right of re-entry based on some act of the tenant. 
    Isn't there any room for the tenant to challenge? 
    Let's assume the landlord says “We terminate because you scratched up the walls of the apartment,” and the tenant says “I haven't either.”
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="2106.171" stopTime="2168.111">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    That proceeding would be brought under another subsection of the law. 
    If I could refer the Court to the statute, the North Carolina summary evictions statute, if I had myself, it's at page 21 (a) of petitioner's appendix. 
    And, it provides for an eviction under subsection 1, when a tenant in possession of real estate holds over after his term has expired. 
    That's what's involved here. 
    And, under subsection 2, when the tenant has breached the lease after alleged cause and they proceed under subsection 2, then they allege that the tenant didn't pay rent or the tenants scratched up the walls in breach of the lease, then they have to prove it. 
    But, if they allege that the term is over, that he's holding over after the lease expired under subsection 1, then that's all they have to prove. 
    And if the --

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume for the moment though that there was a full due -- that the tenant -- that could've -- bring to bear all the questions that you think he ought to be able to bring to bear in the administrative hearing. 
    Just suppose that North Carolina eviction proceeding permitted him to do that. 
    Would you say there would have to be a constitutional -- maybe the constitutional right to administrative hearing prior to that time?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="2249.518" stopTime="2315.713">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    My position, Mr. Justice White, is that this constitutional right to certain elements of fairness, at some stage of this procedure, anything from the beginning of the administrative procedure to the end of the judicial procedure. 
    I don't have any rigid notion of where you have to get your rights but, it seems to me, some place in that proceeding, the tenant ought to be -- where the government is the landlord, the tenant ought to be told why he's being terminated, why his benefits are being terminated, and have an opportunity to address himself to that. 
    In Additionally, it seems to me that, at least on the question of notice of the reasons and some minimal opportunity to address himself to, the tenant ought to have that at the administrative stage. 
    I say that, particularly where we have low-income tenants who are unlikely to be able to afford lawyers and afford to go to Court, and they certainly can't afford to go to Court to fight an eviction if they don't know why they're being evicted. 
    It seems to me, the Housing Authority also --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2315.713" stopTime="2328.304">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that really marks my point. 
    Do you think this HEW regulation could be read to be re-tried?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="2328.304" stopTime="2424.071">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Well, I -- yes, I think it can be read to apply to this pending case, and the reason I think that is that it's entirely conventional, it seems to me, to apply new procedural rules to cases where the judgment is not yet final. 
    I think, further, that's entirely artificial to view this case, as the authority does, as one where they're being deprived of some property because, as we said earlier, they're going to rent the same apartment to somebody else at the same rent. 
    So that by requiring them to go back and give the tenant the reason she's being evicted, it seems to me, doesn't deprive them of anything. 
    It just makes them be fair to the tenant. 
    I wanted to complete an answer to the prior question and say, also, it seems to me, important that the authority to be made to state a reason at the administrative level so that they will have a reason, and so that the reason they later present in Court is not a post factor justification for something that they decide earlier. 
    It seems to me that the person who makes the decision to terminate government benefits like this ought to be able to be required, if we are to -- if he's to operate under law, he ought to be required to say why he's out. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Daniel K. Edwards
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2424.071" stopTime="2425.684">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Edwards.
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="2425.684" stopTime="2546.799">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    Mr. Chief Justice and, if the Court please. 
    If -- as Mr. Justice Fortas has suggested, we're at the threshold here of developing some new constitutional concept about the relationship of the poor with the government. 
    I don't know whether I can supply much thought that's worthwhile, except this, that the philosophy that has been developed in the brief for the petitioner here, at least by quoting certain individuals such as Professor Jones and Professor Rich on the subject, on page 36 and 37 of the brief seems to have followed the line of thought that what we're doing is to give the poor the same rights and their contact with government that is possessed by other people, that is, we equate the thing. 
    And, that we haven't arrived yet in any case that I know of where they are given some different rights. 
    Now, when you supply them with a lawyer, because they're poor and can't afford one, you're not giving them additional rights in a sense. 
    All you're doing is equating them with a fellow who can afford a lawyer. 
    In this case, you have a lease that is a standard procedure between landlord and tenant. 
    Now, the question arises, do the Common Law procedures, these Common Law concepts, Common Law or the Statutory Laws that are applicable to everybody in a landlord and tenant relationship, do not they supply reasonable standards of fairness?

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I'm sure, Mr. Edwards, you understood my questioning of Mr. Nabrit. 
    My -- what I was trying to find out from him was whether the principle of putting the poor on an equivalent basis with the people who are better off in terms of legal rights, constitutional rights, whether that principle really got him anywhere in this case. 
    That was my question.

    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    And, I'm sure that it does not because they are placed on an equal basis here.

    That perhaps that is a matter that the Congress should consider as to whether or not they want to make the relationship different and or the state legislature.

    You can't do that, or you can't say that “You can't occupy these apartments if you decide to vote or, if you decide to make a speech somewhere, you can't occupy.”

    Within the limits of their annual contributions contracts, they do have that right and privilege. 
    HUD itself recognizes this.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2719.408" stopTime="2728.045">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, that's why I wanted to get this preliminary to this circular, because it want to know whether you say this circular is binding or not.
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="2728.045" stopTime="2729.805">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I say it's not.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2729.805" stopTime="2729.943">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    It's not, why?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="2729.943" stopTime="2903.986">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    And, the reasons for that are these. 
    The statute, the Housing -- United States Housing Act of 1937 did provide that HUD could issue certain general rules and regulations to implement the chapter -- the provisions of the chapter, but it also provided in there, just as clear as it could be, that it should deal with Housing Authority stet up -- set up under the state law, as this one was under the state statute, by entering into a contract with them, which is called an annual contributions contract. 
    It wasn't given the power by any statute to run the Housing Authority setup under the State Law by idict or by rule or by regulation, absent a contract with that agency, that hou -- local Housing Authority. 
    Had to have a contract, annual contributions contract, and that's in their general power to make rules and regulations was within the framework of the concept that their sole control over this local Housing Authority was by virtue of the contract for annual contributions that it entered into. 
    And, they had to put the provisions in that contract. 
    As I say HUD recognizes this. 
    The petitioner, in preparing this case, directed certain inquiries to her with reference to the s -- the February 7, 1967 circular, and received some answers from HUD in response to their inquiry. 
    And, you will find those in the petitioner's brief on page 48 (a) of appendix 5. 
    Back in the back part of the brief is the pertinent one that I would like to call the Court's attention to. 
    There, HUD says, HUD policy over the years has been to treat the local Housing Authorities as contracting parties under the annual contributions contract not covered by the term “public.” 
    Material issued from time to time for the guidance of local Housing Authorities in the implementation of the annual contributions contract. 
    Has, therefore, not been published in federal registry, but local authorities are given actual notice of these matters by supplying the material, manuals, bulletins, circulations, and similar publications directly to the local authorities. 
    And, the Housing Act didn't require that there'd be inserted in the annual contributions contract any controlling features about eviction or what sort of lease should given to the tenants, and the annual contributions contract itself contain no such provisions.

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3095.838" stopTime="3116.316">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    It says, you note in the same page, the PHA manuals, which are now HUD I guess, contain the requirements which supplement the provisions of the contracts between the local authority and the PHA. 
    That doesn't change your view, I take it?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="3116.316" stopTime="3131.054">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I tell you, no, sir, because I think that what they're talking about are those areas where there needs to be some rulemaking and there's, for example, with respect to keeping the records.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3131.054" stopTime="3146.122">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That didn't so -- I suggest if you look at page 32 (a) subparagraph 4, it seems to be just as broad as it could be with respect to the operation of the projects after initial occupancy.
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="3146.122" stopTime="3175.135">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    That's the PHA requirements. 
    But there, again, you have the -- this is the Housing manual has issued and the contract -- annual contributions contract under the statute is the connecting link between the two. 
    And, we say that this hasn't been shown to be anything in that contract which is the only -- really the only link between this Housing Authority setup under the state statute and HUD --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3175.135" stopTime="3198.856">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, to pursue my brother Marshall questions, if you assume, contrary to your present argument, if you assume that this circular is binding on the local Housing Authority, there's no question that it would require notice, etcetera, to Mrs. -- to a tenant upon termination of her tenancy.
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="3198.856" stopTime="3307.149">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I don't think it would, sir but necessarily as a matter of law and, for this reason, you analyze the circular itself. 
    The first paragraph makes an announcement of fact that there's been a lot of evictions around the country and that there's public dissatisfaction about it. 
    The second paragraph says we -- that is HUD, we believe that it's essential to advice with the tenant before the eviction action is taken. 
    Then, the third paragraph says that, in addition to advising with the tenant, from this date, the local authority shall keep certain records. 
    And now, in analyzing what they meant by the circular, it is significant, I think, that HUD does have the authority under the annual contributions contract and under the statute to require the local authority to keep records, and the only directive part, the mandatory part, of this circular related to the keeping of the records says, from time -- from this date forward, you shall keep certain records. 
    Now, the statute set forth on page 7 (a) of the petitioner's brief set out that the -- that HUD does have authority to require the local authority to keep records. 
    So, when they wrote this circular, they gave one paragraph of information about what was going on, a second paragraph about what they believe and then a third paragraph which directed them following -- pursuant to their authority to acquire records of these things.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3307.149" stopTime="3324.457">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So, you think we really have to decide the constitutional question here because the circular -- you think this circular is just a statement of the belief which may or may not be regarded by the local authorities praise-worthy, but certainly is not binding on it.
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="3324.457" stopTime="3326.123">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I think that's correct.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3326.123" stopTime="3429.838">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Edwards, let me ask you this question. 
    Assume -- putting the question of retroactivity aside for a moment and taking it as it was when this woman was first ejected from her premises, suppose this Housing Authority which is appointed by the mayor of the city was following the practices of many cities in the South of resisting integration of any kind, and it took the authori -- took the process of throwing out every Negro who came into the apartment house on 15-days of notice without any mention at all of why it was done, and absolutely defeated the purpose of this Act was to -- which is to give all poor people an opportunity to have decent housing in the community in which they live. 
    Would you say if the commissioners appointed by the mayor and the manager that they appointed took that kind of a position and ejected every Negro who was -- had to be admitted to the apartment house was regular and that the Negro could not -- no Negro could complain in the Courts because no reason was assigned for his ejection?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="3429.838" stopTime="3443.571">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    No, sir. 
    Certainly would not. 
    I would say that they would be violating the Constitution of the United States and probably the Constitution of North Carolina if they acted in such a fashion. 
    I take it --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3443.571" stopTime="3454.870">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, then, why shouldn't he be entitled to know if that was the reason for his ejection or if it wasn't?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="3454.870" stopTime="3459.289">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    In Court, I think he would be entitled to inquire into the matter, and that's where --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    In your eviction process?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="3461.166" stopTime="3488.605">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    In the eviction process. 
    That's why, at one point, I disagree with my friend on the effect of going into Court on -- in an eviction process and proceed. 
    I think constitutional issues are relevant there and can be raised in any Court in any stage of the proceeding if their constitutional issue, requirements of the constitution, the statute. 
    Eviction statue couldn't say “You cannot raise a constitutional issue before the Court.”
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3488.605" stopTime="3495.661">

    Exactly so, and so you have to consider in this course, it's no -- there's no question about it.

    That all he'd have to show would be that “my contract with this tenant is to the effect that on 15-days notice, I can terminate the tenancy and I don't have to give any reason at all for it.”
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="3555.838" stopTime="3587.199">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    No, sir. 
    We don't take that position. 
    We take the position that the constitutional issues would be relevant as they were ruled on here in this very case. 
    The Court below, when she raised the point “my First Amendment rights are being violated,” the Court didn't say “that is irrelevant. 
    You will not be heard on that." 
    The Court heard evidence on that very issue, not ruling it irrelevant but making a decision and making a finding of fact based on competent evidence that her First Amendment rights had not been violated.

    You say, then you're assuming that she has a constitutional right and my question to you is whether she has that constitutional right because this is a public agency or would she have that constitutional right even if it were a private agency?

    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    And, the only answer I can give is that some of these -- most of the cases in the past have said that the fact that it is a governmental agency is relevant to that issue, that the restrictions of the constitution were framed to restrain government because it had unusual powers.

    The only reason that this is a constitutional right is because this is government.

    And, the lawyer for the tenant says “What reason was there?”

    As long as you say that the standard is applicable in this little Housing Authority, which has no governmental powers other than that given to ordinary landlords so that the mandates and restrictions of the constitutions which apply to government generally and were designed to restrict government generally, wouldn't necessarily apply because they have to go into eviction proceedings to get their property back, they have to sign a lease, though I can hear the landlord.

    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I was -- my position was, sir, that some of at least he restrictions of the constitution between this -- between an individual and the government, they were designed to prevent government through its greater thought, its greater power, and so forth, from imposing on the individual. 
    Therefore, the constitutional prohibitions against government taken certain actions, vice versa, an individual which -- that wouldn't make that -- that reasoning would not give rise to any constitutional prohibitions as against this Housing Authority because it didn't have any power or authority greater than that, but when it comes to the theory, “well, you're administering funds, therefore, a morality founded on constitutional principles needs to be applied to you.” 
    Example, Mr. Edwards, if a private Housing Authority could say that “None of my tenants shall be permitted to speak in any way that I disliked,” there's nothing wrong with that, is there?

    Let me read to you from the findings of the Court that I get from the transcript. 
    That, by giving the defendant written notice of termination of her lease on the August 12, 1965, the plaintiff effectively terminated the tenancy of the lease of the defendants as of August 31, 1965. 
    Then, she appealed to the Superior Court, and this is the judgment of the Superior Court, the per curiam judgment. 
    It says “The defendant, having gone into position as tenant of the plaintiff and having held over without the right to do so after the termination of her tenancy, the plaintiff was entitled to bring summary ejectment proceedings against her to restore the plaintiff to the position of that which belongs to it. 
    Citing Murrill versus Palmer, 164 North Carolina 50 it is immaterial what may have been the reason for the lessor's unwillingness to continue the relationship with landlord and tenant after the expiration of the term as provided by the lease,” and that's the end of the judgment.

    I -- when we're here before, my contention was that this language in this per curiam decision, not only that it was immaterial, under the showing in the evidence that was presented there, what their reason might have been because there was no showing of any constitutional violation by the petitioner. 
    For that reason, it became immaterial but there was no holding even then that she could not have the opportunity to show that any constitutional right was violated. 
    Then, when it went back to the Supreme Court of Carolina on re-hearing, the Court went further into that particular point of the finding -- on the finding that her First Amendment rights had not been violated by the Trial Court and then said that since they were based on competent evidence, those findings by the trial judge which appear in finding number 10 should be sustained.

    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    Well, I don't think that when they say it's immaterial in that first per curiam decision, they are really staking out what the Court's view of the matter was.

    It'd be the Supreme Court of North Carolina per curiam decision in one summons says that, “Under the findings that have come to us.”

speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="4743.612" stopTime="4787.263">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    All it says is that it's immaterial, but I think that you have to construe what they're talking about in terms of the case that was then before, which was a case that had come before them with a finding of fact by the trial judge that First Amendment rights had not been violated and that there'd been no request by the petitioner for further exploration by the Trial Court into any reasons and there'd been no objection or exception taken to any action by the Trial Court, vice versa, any further exploration or what the reasons might have been. 
    And, in that context, I take it that, on appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, it really was immaterial what the reasons were.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4787.263" stopTime="4801.753">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    The exceptions are on page 25, I think, of the appendix, grouping of exceptions and assignments of error. 
    And, what I'm saying is that there were no exceptions taken to the scope of the Trial Court's inquiry and the reasons because there was no request made upon the Trial Court to broaden the scope of its inquiry. 
    Therefore, there would -- could be no exception taken to the Trial Court just confining itself to the evidence presented by the petitioner. 
    And, her contentions, she said they were in the trial. 
    There was no request to the judge and the trial of the action say “Make them come in and give us additional reasons.” 
    They didn't ask that, and the fact that he didn't do it on his own motion was not accepted, too, either there. 
    When it went from the Trial Court to the Supreme Court, they didn't take exceptions to the failure of the Trial Court on its own motion to make further inquiry and broaden the scope of its inquiry and the reasons for the eviction.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4971.510" stopTime="4973.563">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What would be the normal rule, wouldn't it?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="4973.563" stopTime="4991.302">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    It would be within the context of the generally applicable rules. 
    I think this Court has applied to other situations in which you have a procedural rule that has entered into the picture between the trial and the final determination you apply whatever.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4991.302" stopTime="5002.449">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you -- if the Court thought this circular was to be applied to pending cases, then what?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5002.449" stopTime="5004.924">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    We just lost the lawsuit, I gather.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5004.924" stopTime="5008.310">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But do you think it's binding?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5008.310" stopTime="5010.300">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I don't think it's binding. 
    I think it's --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5010.300" stopTime="5011.678">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do we have to determine that here?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5011.678" stopTime="5041.302">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I think you have here a contractual situation. 
    You have a state agency to be sure, but it's not a federal agency. 
    The local Housing Authority is created under a state statute, and HUD doesn't have a vestige of authority over it granted by any statute except by virtue of entering into an annual contributions contract with it and the sign on the dotted line, HUD and the local Authority.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5041.302" stopTime="5052.249">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I take it then, you must get down to this really because you seem to concede the general rule would be that if this is a binding rule of some kind, it really ought to apply to pending cases.
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5052.249" stopTime="5053.352">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I think so.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5053.352" stopTime="5064.831">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And so, your real last resort is whether it's really binding on it, on a local agency, whether this kind of circular really determines -- is supposed to determine your conduct.
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5064.831" stopTime="5065.573">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5065.573" stopTime="5074.165">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And you suggest that you can -- may depart from it now, although you're complying with it now, you can depart from it without violating any kind of Federal Law.
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5074.165" stopTime="5106.801">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I think so. 
    I think that because you'd have to be very careful about reviewing the content of the annual contributions contract, which we have done and can find nothing in it that gives HUD the prerogative under the terms of that contract to say what kind of lease we're going to have, whether it should be for six months, one month, one year, or anything like that and it doesn't give them any prerogative to say that you must have an administrative hearing in advance of --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5106.801" stopTime="5110.159">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Isn't that the real issue between you and Mr. Nabris?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5110.159" stopTime="5120.523">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    That's correct. 
    It's whether the constitution of this country requires that there'd be an administrative hearing or administrative giving of reasons before the eviction proceedings --

    Before you go to Court.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5122.719" stopTime="5151.876">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Mr. could I follow up one question? 
    Assuming that your view is deceptive on that problem, what -- I'm not quite sure that I understand your view as to what would be your position if, in an administrative -- in any summary eviction proceedings that I cannot be evicted because I have received no reasons for my eviction period, what would happen on that part?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5151.876" stopTime="5154.799">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I would say that would not be a sufficient defense on the --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5154.799" stopTime="5156.372">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Not a sufficient defense?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5156.372" stopTime="5159.812">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    That's right. 
    I cannot be evicted because I received no reason.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5159.812" stopTime="5171.828">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Right, and then, suppose that she said “I want to prove my answer to the questions of the majority that I was evicted because I was a Negro.”
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5171.828" stopTime="5177.146">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I think she would've been entitled to do so.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5177.146" stopTime="5195.534">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    But she has to make that assertion as a matter of speculation or suspicion, however we feel about her, knew well about her, she cannot explore as to what the reasons have been?
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5195.534" stopTime="5223.378">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    I think she could. 
    I think she could insist upon her right to examine the agen -- the executive director of the authority. 
    If he got up on the stand and ask “What reason did you have?” 
    He might say “I had no reason at all, I just wanted a vacant apartment there,” but we say, constitutionally, he would be entitled -- that would be a constitutionally acceptable answer and said “I had no reason at all, I just wanted a vacant apartment.”
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5223.378" stopTime="5233.019">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    And, as Justice White suggested, the language in here must have been that North Carolina was a little overbroad.
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="5233.019" stopTime="5254.319">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    That was the first -- the first opinion was overbroad and I concede that it was, and I don't think that the language accurately portrayed what the Court was thinking and what it was holding. 
    I know it didn't portray what it was actually holding on the basis of the record before it. 
    And then, when it went back on re-hearing, I think it clarified that point.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5254.319" stopTime="5259.957">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    So, she would get a chance. 
    She would have a right to get the reasons for the eviction?

    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    Yes.
