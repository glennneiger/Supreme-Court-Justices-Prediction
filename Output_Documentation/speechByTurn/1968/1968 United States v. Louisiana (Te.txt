    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court. 
    Let me make clear at the outset that despite the title of the case, this original action or this face of this original action involves only the State of Texas not Louisiana or as might be otherwise in the case. 
    It's perhaps fitting that the Court herein apology first for having to hear for the third time since the passage of the Submerged Lands Act another aspect of this title lands controversy between the United States and Texas. 
    One might have hoped that eight terms ago, when the Court decided that Texas unlike most of the gulf states was entitled to historic claim in the gulf that that historic claim was based on the Republic of Texas Boundary Act which defined the belt of Texas as nine miles from land and the Texas coast being relatively uncomplicated, that might have been the end of the matter. 
    Unfortunately, however, there was that non-resolved matters which came before the Court only at the last term. 
    The question then was where you start measuring this nine-mile belt, whether from the present coast or rather from the historic coast, that is the coast in 1845. 
    The Court there determined that it was measured, was to be measured. 
    This nine-mile historic belt to Texas had been adjudicated, that it was to be measured from the historic coast, the coast in 1845. 
    Therefore, one could not take into account artificial jetties that had been put outside of harbors at the Galveston and Sabine Pass. 
    When it came to translating the Court's opinion into a decree, we discovered that we've left another problem unresolved. 
    It was easy or it was done, it wasn't easy. 
    The parties did stipulate where the 1845 coast was and that has been stipulated in a written client stipulation which is before the Court. 
    Texas thought that the next step was simply to measure nine miles out from that which was done and that line has been stipulated. 
    However, the Submerged Lands Act contains a provision that no state not even a state in the Gulf of Mexico is entitled to submerge lands more than nine miles from its coast. 
    United States takes a position that nine miles from its coast of that purpose, for the purpose of its limitation means nine miles from the present coast not from the historic coast. 
    Now, it so happens that the Texas coast has eroded substantially over the last century. 
    One of the little drawings which have been distributed to the Court indicates the extent roughly of the erosion and the extent of the accretion. 
    The portion of shown in red indicates the erosion. 
    That's what concerns us today. 
    Because most of the coast has eroded rather than accreted, we do have a difference as to where this nine-mile belt ends up depending on where it begins. 
    Now, the real question is as I said, whether this limitation which Texas acknowledges and which is stated in plain words in the Submerged Lands Act that no state shall take more than nine miles from a coast means from the present coast. 
    If it means from the present coast, then we cannot measure from the old coast because that would push the line beyond nine miles from the present coast. 
    Now, the effectiveness is --

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Mr. Justice Black, this problem cannot arise with respect to any other state except Florida. 
    It arises with respect to those two states only because they have received grants which come to the very edge of the maximum, the maximum for any state being nine miles. 
    Otherwise, the problem would never arise. 
    While Florida was -- may be affected by the decision here and was duly notified of that fact, it shows not to participate in this face of the controversy. 
    Now, as I say, the effect of this translated into one small segment of the coast is depicted on the chart behind me, a copy of which in small form has also been distributed to the Court. 
    This is chart prepared by the State of Texas. 
    But it shows rather clearly what the difference is. 
    Last term, we were arguing about the effect of accretion, artificial accretion in that case but the same principle applies to natural accretion whether that pushed out the nine-mile belt. 
    The answer was it did not. 
    This time, we're arguing about whether the effect of erosion is to bring in the line because otherwise, this final line would be more than nine miles from the present shore. 
    Again, we say that this territory is not properly attributable to Texas under the Submerged Lands Act. 
    Now, you can see from just that statement that Texas appears to have at least two advantages in this case. 
    One is that we appear to be saying, heads we win, tails you lose. 
    Whether it's accretion or erosion, Texas gets the benefit of neither. 
    Secondly, our position results in a changeable, movable line as the modern coast shifts whereas Texas would have a fixed, permanent line nine miles from the stipulated 1845 coast which would not be affected by any future changes one way or the other.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Up to the line, will move seaward from where it is today if there is accretion where there presently erosion. 
    Other way, if this erosion should disappear, we would put the line here today. 
    Ten years from now, if this erosion is recaptured by the land, that would shift the nine-mile --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="552.337" stopTime="554.001">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You would move both ways?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="554.001" stopTime="650.423">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    We would move both ways in some areas. 
    Now, as I say, the superficial attraction of a permanent line which is already been stipulated which would certainly spare this Court of any necessity for future litigation if the Texas position where adopted. 
    We recognize the simplicity, the attraction of that position but let me say as to the first point, to the point that we seem to be same to Texas on a manner which way it shifts, you don't get the benefit of it. 
    That's not entirely true. 
    When there is a shift, when there is accretion of more than six miles, whether that be by natural accretion or by the building more likely, by the building of harbor work, then we would push the line out because in that instance, we would say to Texas, “Now, you're taking not under the historic claim, you're taking three miles which every state has a right to do from its modern coast.” 
    This example is illustrated on pages 20 and 21 of our memorandum. 
    That may be a small compensation for the other effect. 
    The reason it's a small compensation is simply because Texas is in the unusual position of having a nine-mile belt whereas every state but one has only a three-mile belt.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    The court in the California case did advert to the governmental power to prevent an exaggerated extension of the coast by any state for its own benefits which didn't serve a national or a navigational purpose. 
    I took it that discussion applies equally whether an extension of the inland waters are involved or an extension of the natural coastline.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="809.043" stopTime="823.449">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I think you can find anything affecting the California in view of the national coastline involved (Inaudible).
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="823.449" stopTime="922.796">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Mr. Justice Harlan, I'm not in a position to debate it. 
    I thought and I'm advised that California case did in fact deal for segments with shore as well with the line of inland waters. 
    I may be wrong with that. 
    It has certainly been assumed by all parties since that case including the argument of Louisiana case months ago that shifts in the shoreline when the shoreline is the coastline would affect the ultimate three-mile line and that I think is consistent with the international convention. 
    Of course, the Court having held in the California case that the one in the other are the same that is the international and the national line where the line is three miles from the coast. 
    This of course doesn't apply to Texas since here, we're dealing with a nine-mile line. 
    But let me say this bears on Your Honors' point that the appeal of the Texas position that we would here end up with a fixed permanent line that would not move would be an unusual result because as I understand it, in every other situation, we do in fact have a movable line, certainly we do where inland waters are involved and I thought it was clear that we deal with shoreline as the coastline.

    Well, Mr. Justice Black, as I understand, ordinary property law, normally if one owns the edge of a body of water, normally, that ownership carries with it a right to the accretions, therefore a shifting boundary as well as a loss by erosion if the water eats into the land. 
    So that the normal rule of property or boundaries on waters is that they do move as the water recedes or comes in.

speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="1002.103" stopTime="1178.135">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    I only say that it would be odd if it didn't, not that it's impossible. 
    Of course, one could have a fixed line in the gulf with respect to Texas, a movable line in the gulf with respect to Louisiana or Alabama and Mississippi. 
    It would simply be against the normal, that's all I'm saying. 
    There is a more dispositive answer to all this which is that the text of the Submerged Lands Act makes it crystal clear that this nine-mile limitation beyond which no state can take whatever its historic boundary was that this nine-mile limitation reads from “the coastline”. 
    That word is the same operative word that defines the three-mile grant. 
    That word is expressly defined in the Submerged Lands Act in Section 2 (c). 
    It's defined there for all purposes. 
    It doesn't say as used in this subsection. 
    Coastline means the same thing each time it's used in the Submerged Lands Act and it has been defined by this Court to mean a measurement that modern coast, the ambulating modern coast. 
    If I am right in that premise, then it follows that this nine-mile limitation must also be measured from the modern ambulatory coast. 
    The confusion here arises only because it so happens that Texas' historic claim is nine miles and the limitation is also nine miles and there's a temptation to make the two read on the same points. 
    It's the -- case would be far easier to view if there had been a 12-mile historic grant -- historic claim by Texas only nine miles of which was cognizable under the Submerged Lands Act. 
    In that case, I don't think it would ever occur to anyone to go plot the 1845 shoreline because it would be evident that you only took the first nine miles of it. 
    And even clearer case perhaps would be if the boundary historically in the case of Texas had for instance been set for the southern part on the 97th meridian without any reference to the coast whatever. 
    In that case, it would be a great waste of effort to go back and see where the coast was at 1845 since the historic boundary was not related to the coast but was set geographically arbitrarily. 
    In that instance, one would of course read the nine-mile limitation of the Submerged Lands Act read as reading from the modern coast readily available.

    I don't have the opinion handy. 
    Mr. Justice Harlan, I certainly be glad to furnish to the Court whatever reference as we can find. 
    My best memory is that at least the decree in the California case set out the definition of coastline in terms that at least imply a movable coastline when it is related to the natural shore that is where it is, the natural shore is in open contact with the sea. 
    I had taken it that that was the unanimous view of the meaning of a boundary, an international boundary under the international convention. 
    The Court having adopted for the purpose of inland waters, the international rules, I had supposed the same was true here with the three-mile limit or in this case, the nine-mile limit is defined by reference to the shore rather to the line of inland waters.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, assuming that the position has not been precluded or forbidden by Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in the California case. 
    Would it be rational third alternative argument to say that the three league limitation from the coastline means not the coastline as of 1845 and not the present and future coastline wherever it may be but the coastline as it was described by Congress that enacted the statute referring to it in the year 1953?

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Well, I only see two difficulties with it Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    The first is simply one of determining coastline as of that time wrote than is now.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    The more serious problem I would think was that once the Court has adopted the rule that the three-mile limit internationally and the three-mile belt assigned to the states is one and the same then of course we'd be running against a different rule followed by the state department for international purposes in viewing the convention as establishing an ambulatory line even where that line is referenced to the open coast.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of course for international purposes in coast, the environmental context is quite different along the gulf and the way it is in the matter of the pacific anyway because of the Continental Shelf Act and the variety of other things, isn't it?

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Well, I don't say they need be the same nor they need be the same. 
    Perhaps there's less reason for them to be the same in the gulf than on the California coast but there I would suppose, you couldn't have two rules. 
    One for the gulf of the fixed lines of 1953, but in California, one that ambulates, so --

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Well, I meant to say perhaps that you couldn't have a 1953 boundary all over the gulf even where it's three miles as Louisiana or Alabama and Mississippi and yet have a different rule. 
    I wouldn't suppose one could have a different rule applied in California simply because international considerations may be more important on the Pacific and on the Atlantic coast than they are in the Gulf of Mexico. 
    But I would think one might also and this is somewhat hypothetical run across problems of a narrowing of that belt to the point where Texas would almost lose some of its lands or Louisiana might, if you got a very shifting boundary. 
    If you fix it as of any given time, and there's a substantial accretion, you presumably have no longer any water belt around you. 
    This notion of the shifting belt is more consistent with as I think normal property rules.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Which is the boundaries as they existed and such state became a member of the Union and then another provision of the Act to be establish as a maximum as you pointed out but the definition under which they claimed is not contained the phrase coastline, isn't that right?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="1819.657" stopTime="1924.576">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    That is entirely correct and as I understand it, that was the basis of decision that Your Honor made it abundantly clear in the concurring opinion that was based on your concurrence. 
    Now, let me end on this that I do not think one can consistent with the text say that coastline for the purpose of this nine-mile limitations is something fixed as of 1953 but that for the purpose of the three-mile grant it may be a shifting one because both statements, that is the statement of the limitation and the statement of the three-mile grant, both reference to the single words coastline and those words are defined once and for all for all purposes in Section 2 (c) of the Act. 
    It cannot mean one thing one time and another thing in another time. 
    Therefore, if I'm right about the California case, here also, this nine-mile limitation must mean from the modern coast as it may be at any given time. 
    We have submitted decreased to the Court premised on our disagreement as to the theory. 
    However, we both agree with each other that if the Government's theory of the United States, this theory prevails its decrease beyond it and likewise if Texas is correct on the law its decrease, I should caution the Court that more sophisticated computations have required slight amendment of the figures in the decree which are not appropriate for statement orally and which will be supplied to the Court by concern by both parties within the next several days.

   Argument of Houghton Brownlee, Jr.
speaker="houghton_brownlee_jr" startTime="1958.869" stopTime="2116.186">
    Mr. Houghton Brownlee, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court. 
    As I remember, the last time we were here, our positions were almost exactly opposite and here we are simply because there is a difference in who gains an advantage as the simple truth no matter. 
    We were told quite plainly in the opinion that what Congress intended was to give us back what if we had in 1945 all that area that we've had in 1845. 
    Even one sentence in the majority opinion states that it's extremely clear, no new state boundaries being created by a state which qualifies and I'm talking about this historical claim. 
    Simply is being given the same area it had when it entered the union. 
    Now, there is only one possible way to do that and that's to use a fixed historic boundary. 
    Otherwise, erosion is going to take away something from Texas. 
    That's the only possible way to give that effect to the congressional intent is to measure from the fixed historic 1845 boundary as the majority opinion said. 
    I'm saying simply this sir that the only way that the Court can give effect to the congressional intent to give back to Texas the same area it had when it entered the union is to measure from fixed historical boundary three leagues out. 
    And that's the only possible way to include all of that area because we have lost somewhere between 17 and 35,000 acres through erosion. 
    Now, I can't tell you the exact amounts involved because we don't know. 
    We have one set of engineers that said 35. 
    They have another set of engineers that said 17 while it's somewhere in there. 
    In any event, it's important enough to tell his position on as far as the Government is concerned, they started out saying, “You're stuck with 1845 because they didn't want us to have the jetties.” 
    We were saying we want 1953 or present because we want the jetties. 
    Well now that they got the jetties cut away from us, they want to use the historic boundary only when it hurts us and use the modern boundary when it hurts us. 
    In other words, we don't win either way. 
    There's no way we can come out ahead in this proposition. 
    Sir.

    Yes sir, they certainly do. 
    I just don't think though that one should attribute an intention on the part of Congress to philosophy of these heads the Government wins and tails the state to lose. 
    I mean, that's just basically unfair. 
    Now, I think I can explain why this limitation was put into the Act. 
    This one in 2 (b) that he was referring to which incidentally does not contain the word present. 
    It was put in there because Texas and Louisiana prior to the enactment of the Submerged Lands Act had sought unilaterally by legislation of their own states to show their boundaries out to the edge of the continental shelf. 
    They wanted to make sure that Texas didn't get more than three leagues from its ancient historic boundary. 
    They want to make sure that no other state got more than three leagues from whatever historical boundary it could prove up. 
    Well, the one we proved up was this 1845 line which we've now more or less got located on the ground. 
    I think this is simply explanation as to why this limiting phrase was put in the definitions by the Congress.

    But you can't use it where it helps you. 
    We say that's basically an unfair argument. 
    We think it's the position which the Congress did not have in mind when it passed the Submerged Lands Act. 
    And we feel that the opinion has made this statement by the Court at least very clear. 
    We don't think it's at all ambiguous and we see no trouble at all in reconciling the limitation imposed to prevent those exaggerated claims with the other definitions of the statute. 
    Thank you.

    In one sense, Mr. Justice Black that is true. 
    That is the way it works out.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    But we're dealing with two quite separate provisions. 
    One is the provision which the Court held last time determines the extent of the historic claim it being a historic claim. 
    It was properly to be measured from the historic shore. 
    That is what the Court held. 
    And that of course is what we argued last time. 
    Now, we're dealing with something quite different. 
    We're dealing with a maximum limitation which is stated to be from a coastline. 
    That maximum limitation applies not only to those states which -- well, not only to Texas in terms. 
    It applies to any state which is able to show a historic, a valid historic claim. 
    Well --

    Well, Mr. Justice Black this three-league or nine-mile limitation only applies in the gulf but it applies to all the Gulf States and it simply says that you may take as much as you had when you came into the union but no more than nine miles from the coast. 
    And the coast is then defined for that purpose as well as for the purpose of the three-mile grant which every state gets and I can only say I thought it had been decided by the Court that that meant the modern coast not the historic coast, not the 1953 coast but the modern coast as it shifts time to time, the coast today.

    Do you agree with Mr. Brownlee that that proviso was a response to this 1943 Texas statute?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="2984.098" stopTime="3011.399">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    This proviso was added as I understand on the floor rather as a -- without much explanation. 
    It does appear however or one can I think fairly deduce that the nine-mile limitation was in response to the very exorbitant or at least very soft generous claims made by Texas and Louisiana and had also by Louisiana, now that I really don't know.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3011.399" stopTime="3019.522">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, if that is so, wouldn't that argue against your idea that the coastline means present coastline?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="3019.522" stopTime="3053.318">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    No, for instance in the case of Louisiana, the claim was not a state in number of leagues from the coast or at least the definition of the coast began so far out that this practical matter, there were 20 miles or so out into the gulf. 
    And there were boundaries set was straight lines, it had no relation to the coast so as applied to Louisiana, this nine-mile limitations couldn't be measured from any historic shoreline. 
    It would have to be measured from the modern shoreline.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    If in the case of Texas what the Congress wanted to be sure that limitation gave them no more than what they had back in 1845, I suggest that might mean that coastline meant the coastline of 1845 and not --
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="3072.859" stopTime="3099.818">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Had Texas been the only state against which this limitation was designed and since it happened that Texas had a nine-mile claim, one might have made the inference Your Honor suggest since however it is equally fair to read this limitation as Reed against Louisiana which showed a different sort of claim, I don't think the conclusion is warranted.
