speaker="gerrit_h_wormhoudt" startTime="15.182" stopTime="154.629">
    Mr. Gerrit H. Wormhoudt 
    At the close of argument yesterday, I was trying to establish that there has been an existence long before the enactment of the federal rules, a body of law derived from the Acts of Congress and interpreting decisions of this Court which are applicable to the jurisdictional requirements for Federal Courts, that body of law being independent of and indeed I think superior to the rules of practice that this Court may promulgate from time to time. 
    Because of that body of law I think we have Rule 82 of the present federal rule. 
    Rule 82 provided initially that none of the rules would be interpreted to extend or limit the jurisdiction of Federal Court when the 1966 amendments were adopted. 
    Rule 82 was restated making reference to admiralty but continuing the restrictive language I’ve just mentioned. 
    I submit that Rule 82 is there simply as a guide to construction and an admonition that in interpreting the rules they simply shall not affect the jurisdictional standards of the Lower Federal Courts. 
    I would now direct the Court’s attention to the nature of the particular claims involved in this action. 
    I think I mentioned yesterday that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals attempted to categorize the claims involved in this action as (b) (1), (b) (2) or (b) (3) claims. 
    I don’t think there can be any question however that if this is a proper class action, it must fall within the terms of rule -- of subdivision (b) (3) of amended Rule 23 which refers in substance to cases presenting common questions of law or fact where the predominating common question would take precedents over any separate questions arising out of the claims.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="154.629" stopTime="168.162">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, you do not question the proposition that this action is a class action under amended Rule 23 at least under (b) (3), you don’t quarrel about that?

    Yup.
speaker="gerrit_h_wormhoudt" startTime="174.986" stopTime="248.666">
    Mr. Gerrit H. Wormhoudt 
    I think in respondents brief, references made to the fact that prior to the amendment cases such as we have here today involving separate and distinct claims really amounted under the prior rule to a permissive joinder en masse so to speak under prior Rule 23. 
    That being the case, I do think then we must consider as Mr. Justice White was suggesting yesterday the logic of applying or abandoning the aggregation doctrine under (b) (3) cases to the other rules which deal likewise with permissive joinder and subdivision (b) (3) certainly presents an instance of permissive joinder provided by its own terms that any pardon may opt out upon recieve of notice that he has been included in a class which is in litigation before the court. 
    So, consequently we still have the permissive feature involved in at least Rule 23 (b) (3) cases.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I take it you would say that in an action by stockholders in cases where they have similar claims that three stockholders sued the same defendant and they all were named plaintiffs that each would have to have the necessary jurisdictional amount.
speaker="gerrit_h_wormhoudt" startTime="275.074" stopTime="311.201">
    Mr. Gerrit H. Wormhoudt 
    Well, if Your Honor please, at least under the laws of Kansas, merely all stockholder cases would have to be filed as derivative suits. 
    There may be special instances and departures from the derivative rule but normally that stockholder's actions present but a single action on behalf of the corporation. 
    Consequently, there would not be a joinder problem under the situation you put. 
    Perhaps there may be another state jurisdiction if so, I'm not familiar with the problem that would be present.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="311.201" stopTime="327.777">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Gerrit H. Wormhoudt 
    And it seems to me also on those lines that if aggregation has not been permitted under Rule 19 in an ordinary permissive joinder case where all the parties are before the Court they're identifiable and certainly res judicata would apply to any matters litigated where the parties were named that in a situation where all the parties may not actually be before the court, there is even less reason to aggregate their claims in order to satisfy jurisdictional amount then there would be in an ordinary permissive joinder situation.

    Mr. Gerrit H. Wormhoudt 
    I think in this traditional sense, I would have to disagree that this is not a true class action. 
    These claims are separate and distinct and traditionally at least under those circumstances any member of the class would have had perfect freedom prior to the enactment of this rule to litigate where he pleases, when he pleases by --

    No, we're not talking about prior to the enactment of this rule.

    Mr. Gerrit H. Wormhoudt 
    That's correct. 
    I think we simply have a policy consideration here which derives from Congress in a prior body of decisions of this Court which is namely to ristrict access to the Lower Federal Courts to ease their case load. 
    And for that reason, we have a rule of construction which says in so many words does not construe these rules to increase that case load. 
    And the Tenth Circuit Court conceded that prior to the amendment of these rules, this case simply could not have been filed. 
    The conclusion is that by virtue of the amendment now it can be. 
    And I submit that consequently jurisdiction has been large because it's now present where it wasn't before. 
    And as a result, we're going to have considerably more litigation in the federal courts of the most complicated kind. 
    And the kind of litigation that can certainly properly be handled in the Federal Court and I beg your pardon, in State Courts and I think both of these cases present good instances of that. 
    We have in this case a question of the legality of the municipal ordinance involving a franchise tax collected by a public utility which is subject to regulation by Kansas authorities. 
    There are just simply no policy reasons apparent apart from the so-called desirability or workability of the rules which override I submit the congressional policy of easing the work load on our Lower Federal Courts. 
    I think at least in my district, we can get a case disposed of in half the time in Federal Court, I beg your pardon again, in our State Courts.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Martin.
speaker="robert_martin" startTime="1013.327" stopTime="1183.498">
    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I think we have two platforms from which to look at the question before the Court. 
    The first one being the proper effect and interpretation of amended Rule 23 and the second one being whether there is any substance to the argument here that the effect of the amended rule is to extend the jurisdiction of Federal Courts unlawfully. 
    Now, most of the questions that if occurred or that had been asked from the bench in the preceding case and in this case really concerned the first question, the proper interpretation and application and practical effect of Rule 23 on class litigation. 
    So, I want to address myself to that aspect of what we have before us first. 
    I'm embarrassed to say that I have a somewhat different view of amended Rule 23 than seems to be the view by any of the three preceding counsel. 
    I see Rule 23 as it's now amended as an attempt to straighten out and do away with some terrible problems that confronted us in the practical application of former Rule 23 and very briefly what I am referring to is this. 
    Former Rule 23 did have its origin as one of the counsel stated in the old equity rules but when Rule 23 was promulgated, it appears from the history that Professor Moore undertook to categorize the circumstances under which you could have a class action and he came up with a three categories which were not resided in the rule by name but were described really in subdivisions (a) (1), (2) and (3) of true hybrid and spurious. 
    Now he thought and I think the bar thought and you can find in the literature statements by writers to the effect that this was a clear rule and plain English and everybody could understand it. 
    I think everyone thought that those categories are going to work well and they do work well when you're talking about property rights and they had some historical basis. 
    If you were bringing a -- if two people were joined together to -- as plaintiffs to try title to quarter section of land, what any problem to understand that they could aggregate their claims, they were all going to be bound by the judgment, you really had one piece of litigation. 
    And we have what we call in rem jurisdiction and all these things were familiar to lawyers and they understood them.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1183.498" stopTime="1186.174">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And if it wasn't aggregation (Inaudible)?
speaker="robert_martin" startTime="1186.174" stopTime="1440.348">
    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Yes, sir. 
    And it was really aggregation of plaintiffs and not aggregation of claims at all. 
    Now, Professor Moore attempted to apply that the class actions and I think the history demonstrates that it works well when you're dealing with property or a fund but class actions very quickly became broader than that. 
    There were all kinds of rights and all kinds of situations developed chiefly by modern commerce that demanded, cried out for adjudication by class action. 
    And it isn't a question of increasing case, load as a question of decreasing and when we try to extend these categories beyond property rights, we got into trouble and we got in to bad trouble. 
    Rule 23 left cases spread over our reports that simply couldn't be rationalized or harmonized in certain areas, one of them being the question of jurisdiction that we have before us both as to amount and as to diversity. 
    Now, there was no problem about aggregation when you talked about a claim to try title where you have more than one party but when you got down to what Professor Moore termed and the committee termed a spurious class action. 
    You have the literature which said this really isn't a class action at all. 
    This is a permissive joinder device. 
    Well then, you were face to face with this problem not only as to jurisdictional amount but as to whether or not intervenors had to show diversity. 
    Another area that we have which was -- which develops some terrible law was in the effect of a judgment. 
    As a matter of fact the burden of my argument will be that those two are bound up. 
    If you are going to bind a class with the judgment then you have the amount in controversy is the effect of that judgment on the class and that's the value you have to look at. 
    But in under old Rule 23, when we got down to the effect of the judgment, we developed the set of laws which said that in true class actions those really involved in property or something directly related to, all of the class was bound. 
    In Hybrid class actions, they were bound but to a lesser extent and under different circumstances and frankly there were so many different decisions that I haven't been able to figure out when they're bound and when they're not in a hybrid class action. 
    In a spurious class action, the law is clear that no one in the class is bound except those who intervene. 
    But -- and that seems reasonable, somewhat reasonable until you carried another step. 
    The practice developed of starting a spurious class action. 
    The other members of the class who were aware of this anomaly which sit on the outside and able to wait until the case was adjudicated or almost adjudicated until it became clear that the plaintiff was going to win then they'd come in and intervene, say we want the benefits of the decree. 
    But the problem was that it was a one way intervention. 
    They could stay out and not be bound if the -- if the defendant won and they could come in and be bound if the plaintiff won. 
    Further than that the courts quickly confronted themselves with this problem. 
    Here is what we call a class action. 
    The literature says, it really isn't a class action, it's a permissive joinder. 
    One of the plaintiffs, one of the members of the class stays out for a while. 
    As a matter of fact there was no requirement that he be given notice. 
    He might not know that he was being represented in Court or not represented depending on how the Court viewed it but in any event he stayed out. 
    He finally learned a bit or decided he would come in and he comes in and the defendant says well. 
    This is a spurious class action. 
    It isn't really a class action. 
    You're claim is barred by the statute of limitations whereas the plaintiff, the original member of the class, his claim is not. 
    Well now, there's many way to -- you can't reconcile these conflicting interests. 
    There were other problems that crop up in trying to pigeonhole the class action. 
    In effect what Professor Moore did to is and the advisory committee in the framing of the original rule was to lead us down the same path as the old common law pleaders. 
    We were trying --

    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Well, that's what one wonders. 
    I don't -- personally I don't agree with the -- from the standpoint of personal philosophy, I don't agree that it was only a permissive joinder device but that became the law or at least everybody thought it was the law. 
    I don't agree with that. 
    I think it was intended to be something more and what I'm saying is that at the present time under amended Rule 23, it is something more and it should be the -- as I see it, the effect of amending Rule 23 wasn't really amendment but it was a complete redrafting. 
    The effect of that has been to eliminate just exactly the problem that you mentioned. 
    We -- I don think now we have any such thing as a spurious class action. 
    I don't think we have any such thing as a hybrid class action. 
    I think that now for the first time and as it should be, all class actions are true class actions. 
    You --

    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Yes, sir. 
    But (b) (1), (b) (2), (b) (3) cannot be related to true hybrid or spurious either historically or in the context of the rule. 
    What really has happened under amended Rule 23 and the answer to counsel's argument that the amended rule is going to vastly increase the case burden of the Federal Courts is the rule itself. 
    Rule 23 has now amended or new Rule 23 as I will call it provides a very workable precise and careful description of what is and what is not a class action. 
    Now there is a little different treatment in terms of procedure given to a class action in which the cohesive force of the class is a common question of law or fact in an interest -- the common interest in relief. 
    As distinguished from that situation in which the cohesive force of the class is a joint interest in property or a fund. 
    But it's a procedural difference and nothing more. 
    It isn't the difference in substance and it ought not to be.

    Mr. Robert Martin 
    The answer to your question is that it would be very rare circumstance where that can conceivably be a class action because one of the requirements is that the number of the class has to be so large that it can't effectively be brought before the Court.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1766.815" stopTime="1779.218">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But in any event, the three of them could in your case you think where there are lots of gas users unidentifiable to raise in, they could bring a class action?
speaker="robert_martin" startTime="1779.218" stopTime="1780.306">
    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Well, yes, sir. 
    In my case where there are 18,000 --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1780.306" stopTime="1786.988">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Even though they could stay in the Federal Court themselves if they just name themselves as plaintiffs?
speaker="robert_martin" startTime="1786.988" stopTime="1948.263">
    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Yes, sir. 
    And the reason for that is that if three or five or get together or one comes in and says this is a class action and I want not only to adjudicate my rights but the rights of the classes hold then the changed procedure is this. 
    The Federal Court is then required to give notice to all of the identifiable members of the class and inform the members of the class that this action has been brought as a class action on their behalf who the plaintiffs are and that they will be bound by the judgment unless they come in and option themselves out that they have they right to come in and option themselves out but they also have the right to appear or not appear. 
    In other words you must give a practical notice then he is required under the new rule to proceed as quickly as possible to determine whether this properly is a class action and their various factors he must consider. 
    One of the things that he must determine is that the classes so numerous that class actions justify that the plaintiffs whether they will be one or three are in position fairly to represent -- present the interest of the class, then he must consider as additional factors under (b) (3) action that the -- the class action method is superior to any other available procedure for the adjudication of these claims. 
    He must also determine if the cases to be maintained as a class action that the interest of the -- what the interest is of the individuals that are controlling the litigation, he must take into account any other suits that are pending or any right on the part of any individuals to separately litigate their claims and any difficulties in management of this class action. 
    It gives him precise standards but broad discretionary powers. 
    Now and he must determine that at the beginning of the case before he takes another step. 
    Now, the burden of my argument really is that whether it's (b) (3) action as counsel says this one is and I agree. 
    We pleaded it is a (b) (3) action but we could have pleaded it as a -- under one of the other situations. 
    If the Court has made that determination, then it is a class action and if enough people come in and decide that they want to be optioned out, that of course should indicate to the court that it is properly a class action that there are reasons why individuals want to adjudicate their own claims if two or three out of 18,000 would come in and opt out as Professor Captain (ph) puts it, that would be alright.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But if the three -- if the three people we are talking about awhile ago have individual claims when they name themselves as plaintiffs. 
    I suppose they still have individual claims when they name themselves as plaintiffs but also purport to be bringing in class action and why isn't -- why aren't the -- and if their claims were individual claims, why aren't the claims of all of the unnamed members of the class also individual claims?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's right. 
    That's right, but when you do report to bring in the unnamed parties, do report to bring what you call a class action. 
    You say that because they are bound, therefore it's one claim and therefore there is in effect aggregation.

    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2082.380" stopTime="2090.829">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And I -- I'm just not sure that necessary follows from the fact from the consequence of binding that there is aggregation.
speaker="robert_martin" startTime="2090.829" stopTime="2160.608">
    Mr. Robert Martin 
    I'm not saying Mr. Justice White that that is the only -- that it necessarily follows from that. 
    I'm not saying that that's the only argument in favor of aggregation. 
    I am saying that that is one of the strong arguments and historically that has really been the effect here when the subject matter of the litigation is shown to have the value of more than $10,000.00, there is no reason why a Federal Court ought not to proceed. 
    It's a question of the procedure by which you reach this ultimate objective. 
    You see in the prior Rule 23, there was no way by which in a spurious class action for example, the Court could ever force that decree off on someone else. 
    It just could not be done therefore it was not correct to say that the amount in controversy was the amount that that is the total value of the rights of the class because the rights of the class were not to be effective, only the rights of the actual parties litigant. 
    Now --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2160.608" stopTime="2169.715">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, certainly Rule 23 in the long run has to be in effect be consistent with the statutory limit of $10,000.00.

    And yet the $10,000.00 limitation is then the amount has been changed but the requirement of that amount against the background of these older cases have been reenacted time and again.

    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Well, it has Mr. Justice White but this Court has answered that question in a companion matter which is the consideration of the amendment of Rule 19 in the Provident Bank &amp; Trust Company versus Patterson, that decision came down in January and I think that the situation that Mr. Justice Harlan described there and the argument that he rejected is really the argument of the petitioner here and the respondent prior case. 
    What they are really saying is that this old concept of aggregation in common property suits was alright but in other suits was wrong or not permissible that that establishes a common law which is inflexible, a substantive right and no matter how we change the rule, we can't get rid of this pigeonholes of true, hybrid, and spurious. 
    That -- that's not really so and it ought not to be so. 
    Those cases were somewhat similar to the cases that Mr. Justice Harlan said -- described as the 19th century joinder cases.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now one of the problems if we go back to the source and get underneath the class of the ages of the statute, one of the problems comes in subsection (b) and in subsection (b) as a reference to the denial of cause to the plaintiff where he is finally judged where the plaintiff who files a case originally, the plaintiff who files the case originally and the Federal Courts has finally judged to be entitled or recover less than the sum of $10,000.00. 
    Now, if that is to be taken as bearing upon the meaning of the term matter in controversy, then you got a real problem, haven't you?

    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Yes sir, if you would say Mr. Justice Fortas that subsection (b) really limits the general statement or the earlier proposition that the District Court have original jurisdiction when the amount in controversy is $10,000.00.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2415.922" stopTime="2430.889">
    Justice Abe Fortas

    Mr. Robert Martin 
    That's really right. 
    In subsection (b) that you've just read is the only thing in the rule or the statute that gives any hint that it is the claim of a plaintiff.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Under the rules and your argument is that since 23 (a) eliminates the distinction between true spurious and hybrid class actions and since in your submission, all class actions under 23 (a) are now to be considered as true class actions, therefore the line of cases permitting aggregation in the case of true class actions should control here.
speaker="robert_martin" startTime="2506.305" stopTime="2654.270">
    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Your Honor has made my submission on the second point, that is exactly -- that is exactly what I intend to say and I think that should be the rule, I believe that is the rule. 
    I want to fortify the proposition with the statement that originally, century ago, more than a century starting I think in 1843, we first begin to have these questions, this -- the circumstances where aggregation was allowed were really comparable in terms of commerce then and in terms of the lack of complexity of litigation then as compared to now. 
    They were allowing aggregation where it should be allowed, where the matter in controversy was $10,000.00 or at that time $500.00 or more. 
    All I'm saying is that procedures like suits of clothes ware out and no longer fit the necessities of commerce and human relations and that's what has happened with the old concept of true, hybrid, and spurious and that's what happened with Rule 23 originally, it wore up in 25 years. 
    And I think that the present rule that we have now, the amended rule is splendid, will solve the problem and directs itself to the problem. 
    There is no reason why to get back to one of Mr. Justice Marshall's question yesterday. 
    If the Court adopts the view urged by the petitioner here, we are going to have a situation where the only people who can represent the class are those who have $10,000.00 or more. 
    The other people, there might be another man who has $10,000.00 even, that's his claim, a stockholder and we are saying to him you can't come in, you can't start the action, you can't represent the class but to Mr. B who has $10,000.01, you can, the door of the courthouse is open to you. 
    Well, the arbitrary limit is fine in private litigation. 
    It must be made to limit litigation in Federal Courts but when in reality, when the man comes in to court, he presents and there is adjudicated not only his claim but a whole class of claims, it doesn't make any sense. 
    It isn't logical and it isn't -- it doesn't afford what the procedure that is necessary.

    Oh, I assume that it just won't -- this investigation, people opt out and all, if he finds it is less than 10,000, you prove the case out preliminarily?
speaker="robert_martin" startTime="2666.923" stopTime="2687.350">
    Mr. Robert Martin 
    Yes, sir. 
    I believe that's quite correct. 
    One of the things that he would find out when he makes the determinations which must be made before the action can be maintained, one of the things of course he would find out is whether we are dealing with a small class action, a piece of petty litigation where really the class only --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That's the point that worries me, if you go on to matter in controversy and the matter in controversy is $100,000.00 but only $10,000.00 worth comes in and the rest opt out, we get back to the point that actual amount of controversy, the actual amount is being claimed, not the amount that's in controversy, that's my trouble.

    Mr. Robert Martin 
    I believe the answer to your question Mr. Justice Marshall is that if you have that situation, a possible $100,000.00 class, the action started by someone who has a smaller claim of 10,000 and all of the members of the class or sufficient number of members of the class to bring the claims down below 10,000 opt out, then I think the Court has lost jurisdiction, the Court should dismiss the case and there for of many reasons, one of them being that --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And that's the trouble, what is the amount in controversy? 
    The amount that the corporation has or the amount that people claim?

    Mr. Robert Martin 
    The amount in controversy Mr. Justice Marshall is really what Mr. Justice Frankfurter said it was in 1942. 
    He said that in diversity actions and he wasn't talking about class actions but this is what I -- this is my argument. 
    He said that in diversity actions, the amount in controversy is measured not by the monetary result of determining the principle involved but by the pecuniary consequences to those involved in the litigation. 
    Now, to answer your question, the pecuniary consequences to those involved in the litigation in the class action ones it's determined that it is a class action consists of everybody whose bound by it, the defendant as --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    At least your claim is not worth than the average diversity claims which claims a $100,000.00 and then 2 years later settled it to 500.

    In my claim I think Your Honors are even better than that and it should be.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Martin, excuse me, we've been talking about the jurisdictional amount ingredient of federal diversity jurisdiction, how about the diversity ingredient, the diversity of citizenship ingredient of diversity jurisdiction. 
    What if some members of the class have the same citizens of the same status, the defendant and they don't opt out, does that defeat diversity jurisdiction?
speaker="robert_martin" startTime="2843.824" stopTime="2864.333">
    Mr. Robert Martin 
    No, sir. 
    In my view it does not affect diversity jurisdiction and of course this was one of the anomalies under old Rule 23, we were saying spurious class actions were not really class actions and yet we were allowing people to come in who couldn't show diversity and we were in hybrid actions, we were binding people who had no diversity, they were bound and they couldn't litigate it.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So--

    Mr. Robert Martin 
    It can bring the action and they couldn't really litigate it.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And what do you say the situation is now under new --
speaker="robert_martin" startTime="2868.299" stopTime="2880.846">
    Mr. Robert Martin 
    I say the situation now is that if the original plaintiffs show diversity of citizenship, then anyone who doesn't opt out can't benefit himself from the decree and is bound by it regardless of his citizenship.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2880.846" stopTime="2884.196">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And the existence of those people don't defeat diversity in your submission?
speaker="robert_martin" startTime="2884.196" stopTime="2887.408">
    Mr. Robert Martin 
    No, sir. 
    In my view it does not and it really didn't under old Rule 23.
