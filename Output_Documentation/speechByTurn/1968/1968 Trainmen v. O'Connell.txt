    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case does present the same legal issue that was presented in the previous case, although the language of the contrary is slightly different. 
    And, there -- in our opinion, there is no mootness problem here and, to that end, we did file the supplemental brief a few days ago, to which I believe Justice Fortas referred earlier.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="50.256" stopTime="54.899">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes, but the difficulty is that this is here on certiorari, isn’t it?
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="54.899" stopTime="56.098">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    That’s correct, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="56.098" stopTime="83.870">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And, the basic issue, it maybe a money claim pending but the question in my mind is whether it’s a matter that we would -- which we would have granted certiorari if the facts had been established, if the facts that seem to exist now existed at the time that we considered the petition for certiorari.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="83.870" stopTime="86.457">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Well, of course, the merger facts didn’t exist at that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="86.457" stopTime="95.122">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I know that, but I say that if they did, the question is whether we would have issued the -- issued the writ here.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="95.122" stopTime="102.139">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    You mean, because the amount of dues paid to the Brotherhood by the individual claimants and their class was a small amount of money?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="102.139" stopTime="124.086">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, not that, so much as that the underlying issue seems to be one in which -- which might not be appropriate. 
    I don’t know whether it is or not because we haven’t heard from the other side. 
    The other side filed nothing here, and I know this is your supplemental pleading here, but --
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="124.086" stopTime="124.422">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Well, the difference --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="124.422" stopTime="154.444">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I don't know. 
    I don't know that we would have -- I don't know that certiorari would have been granted. 
    I don't know that it wouldn't. 
    Well, I just don't know that certiorari would have been granted because, here, you have people arguing a very important issue on the basis not of a basic conflict of interest, but on the basis of a relatively small money judgment below.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="154.444" stopTime="162.805">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Well, there was a small money judgment involved in the Felter case against the Southern Pacific also because it involved only the check off dues of one particular man.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="162.805" stopTime="163.573">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I know, but --
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="163.573" stopTime="164.820">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    And, in this case --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="164.820" stopTime="175.937">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Of course the question about the kind of -- I know which we are to spend this -- spend our own time on these cases.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="175.937" stopTime="238.077">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    The difference in this case and in the previous case, of course, is that there was no restraining order issued in this case. 
    The effort to obtain the restraining order failed and, as a result, the plaintiff and his class were compelled to join the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and they were compelled to pay dues to the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. 
    And, when the appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, those plaintiffs argued to that Court that they wanted the case remanded to the Trial Court for the purpose of having their dues money that they had paid to the Brotherhood restored to them. 
    And that issue, of course, the issue of money damages, still makes this a live issue or a case of controversy for this Court because even if this Court does, pursuant to a mootness point, reverse and remand it and vacate the judgment, then these individual plaintiffs and the class that they represent will not be restored to the dues that they paid and would still have the claim for that money.

    I expect, as Justice Fortas suggested, this ins -- this case may not be moot. 
    But, if you're familiar with Monrosa and cases of that kind where there have been events, occurrences since the grant of certiorari which make it, in our judgment, a case not to be decided, we dismiss it as improperly granted.

    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    And I think, under the class action rules of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each member of that class would have to be notified that the Court intends to act on their claims and they would have the right to say, well, whether they waive them or not. 
    And, from the letters that we have received and the protests that were filed at the time they paid the dues, we have no reason to believe that these members are going to waive that in those claims. 
    They were not happy at all and -- by being compelled to join the Brotherhood.

    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Well, the individual plaintiffs are six in number and they purport to represent a class and, frankly, that actual damage issue was never tried. 
    So, it could be several hundred. 
    I would say an estim -- probably between 200 and 300 that were compelled to join the Brotherhood and were not pleased about it. 
    If the Court please, the Court below --

    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Well, we won the case in District Court and, so then, the men, of course, were compelled to join the Brotherhood. 
    Now, some of them remained members of the Switchmen also. 
    In other words, were members of two Unions, and then, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="389.023" stopTime="393.516">

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I see.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="405.954" stopTime="712.044">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    And then, of course, we filed a petition for cert here. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that Section 211 (c) of the Railway Labor Act must be read literary and that the legislative history supports the literal reading of that statute. 
    The Court also noted and stated that, in this judgment, the opinion of this Court in Rychlik versus Pennsylvania Railroad which construed the legislative history differently was dictum on that point. 
    And they also held that the Court of Appeals opinion in the Third Circuit in Rohrer versus the Black Lick Railroad was inapplicable because that railroad was owned by a Steel company and was organized on an industrial basis. 
    And, with those positions and with that reasoning of the Court below, of course, we disagree. 
    The legislative history of this law shows clearly that Congress intended the railway Unions to have a Union shop agreement just like the industrial Unions had. 
    The one problem that kept coming out and being debated was what they were going to do with the operating Unions as distinguished from the non-operating Unions because, in the operating crafts, there was this craft progression from fireman to engineer and back again to fireman, and between conductor and break man and back again to break man, and that argument was debated in Congress at some length, and different proposals where made at various stages of legislative history. 
    At one time, the proposal was made that perhaps the parties could just negotiate it out, and that wasn't satisfactory. 
    Another time, a proposal was made similar to what we did here that the man would have to be a member of the Union that held the bargaining march, and that proposal was not adopted in that form. 
    Another was a proposal to simply issue a general prohibition on requiring membership in more than one Union. 
    Now, in the final analysis, everyone agreed to one very important point, and that is that the only item they wanted to correct, the only difference that they wanted in this particular Bill was to correct the problem of compelling a man to become a member of more than one Union. 
    They felt that a man should not be forced to pay dues to one Union. 
    The Congress was willing to permit the Union the employer to compel and to pay dues to the Union -- to one Union, but they didn't want him to pay Union dues to two. 
    And, with that concept in mind and with that overall objective, the language was agreed to by the various Unions and, ultimately, adopted by Congress. 
    And, this Court exhaustedly analyzed the legislative history on that section in the Rychlik case and held that the -- that that legislative history must be read carefully in order to understand the exact language of the con -- of the statute, and that the statute itself could not be read literary on its face. 
    And, this Court held and it state -- and it adhered to those holdings in the Street case and in the Felter case that the statutory language must be read in the light of solving this problem and that problem, we agree with and we have incorporated into our collective bargaining agreement specific language which states that if the man has a right to work in another craft such as a conductor, and if the conductors have a contract with the railroad under which compulsory Union is a factor, he can become a member and remain a member of the Conductor's Union. 
    That, we say -- we assert to the Court, solves the problem of what Congress was trying to reach, and that is, the man cannot be compelled to become a member of two. 
    But, what does the Switchman's Union's have on the Milwaukee road? 
    It has no contracts. 
    It cannot negotiate a contract. 
    It had never did have a contract since the Railway Labor Act was passed, and it would be impossible for that Union to negotiate a contract with the employer that would compel the man to become a member of the Switchman's Union. 
    And, with that in mind, we have asserted that the legislative purposes served by compelling the man to become and remain a member of the Union that bargains for him and if the Union does not bargain for him, the -- if the Union is just a stranger to the property, which was Switchman's Union was in this railroad, that membership in that Union could not be used to satisfy the Union shop requirements.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="712.044" stopTime="723.463">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is there anything in the legislative history that shows that Congress was reaching for this problem?

    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    You mean, with specific --

    No, Your Honor, there's nothing specific on that.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I don't remember Rychlik and Rohrer which, as you're aware, brought it here.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="769.520" stopTime="779.123">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Well, Rychlik said in the -- several times, of course, that the language could not be read literary, that it had to be read in the light of solving a problem with compulsive --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="779.123" stopTime="784.095">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    We're dealing with the context of a Union still bargaining for him.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="784.095" stopTime="821.975">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Yes, that -- and, of course, there are a very few railroads in the United States in which the railroad is organized on a what we call a perfect basis where the engineer represents only the engineer and the fireman only the fireman and so on down the line. 
    And, it's true that the legislative history didn't consider that problem specifically, but it would be inconsistent with the overall provisions of the Union shop agreement and the Union shop statute to permit a man to satisfy the compulsory Union features of the statute by becoming a member of the Union that cannot and does not bargain for him.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="821.975" stopTime="835.038">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But it was certainly was a standard saying at the time these past -- these amendments were passed to -- for one of the railroad Unions to represent several crafts.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="835.038" stopTime="836.170">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Oh, yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="836.170" stopTime="842.328">

    And, I guess that background when Congress used this broad language.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="842.328" stopTime="870.687">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Yes, that's true. 
    They used very broad language. 
    Well, of course, how else are we going to solve a problem of a dual Union situation? 
    That was really the tough problem that they faced. 
    What language is there that they could adopt which would make the man join at least one Union, but not make him join two? 
    And, this was the subject of considerable debate in Congress but the overall picture was, I think, clearly in the legislative history, shows that that was on the only problem --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="870.687" stopTime="877.837">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Your position is they didn't need any language. 
    All they needed to do is to live up to the Union shop agreement.

    Well, except that --

speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="882.206" stopTime="894.811">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Well, no, because you may have a situation like it is true on the Milwaukee Road where they trainmen and the conductors each have a contract, and the trainmen do work as conductors from time to time. 
    They are assigned to that job.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="894.811" stopTime="896.473">

    I understand that, yes.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="896.473" stopTime="914.567">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    And, of course, the purpose of this language of the statute was to permit the man, eventhough he was employed as a trainman perhaps the majority of the time, to be a member of the Conductor's Union, if he chose to do so, as long as he had the right to work under that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="914.567" stopTime="918.517">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, suppose Congress could've put it like your brief.
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="918.517" stopTime="947.270">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    That's true, Your Honor, and I think though that the Rychlik opinion pointed the way clearly in that direction and the decision of the Court of Appeals in Rohrer versus Black Lick made it very plain that that is exactly the way it's certain to work and it only makes labor relations sense to work to have the man belong to the Union that must do his bargaining, that is obligated under the duties of fair representation and all the rest to defend him.

    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Well, I -- there is no place in this record or anywhere else that I can find that's going to -- for someone to say, “Well, I was there at the time that language was drafted and we intended a man to be able to be a member of any one of the five Unions.”
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="998.202" stopTime="1004.033">

    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    The language is different, Your Honor. 
    That's true, but the problem that the language was intended to solve was the same. 
    Now, there was alternate proposals made as to how they should meet this problem, and I don't think it was fair to say that the Court of Appeals said that the trainmen proposal was rejected. 
    It was -- it's to strong to say that because there was a group of men, contesting men, trying to solve one problem, and no one, as I think that Justice Harlan pointed out, no one had this problem specifically in mind. 
    They had the problem of trying to avoid the situation where a man would be forced, could be compelled to join two Unions, and that problem is not present unless both Unions have a contract because, unless the alternate Union has a contract, the man cannot be compelled. 
    There's no -- the alternate Union is a stranger to the situation.

    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Yes, I think that Your Honors had that on certiorari. 
    Was denied yesterday in the McElroy case. 
    That was a case, as I understand it, where the Engineer's Union holds a collective bargaining agreement with the railroad, and the Firemen's Union which does not hold the contract did seek to and did in fact represent a particular man under the engineer's contract.

    Is that case -- these cases aren't related?
speaker="david_l_uelmen" startTime="1113.512" stopTime="1169.939">
    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Well, I think that the labor relations principle is fairly similar, although not identical because although I can't argue with what you did yesterday, I do say that it doesn't, again, make labor relation sense to say to a Union, like the engineers who has a contract with the carrier, “We're going to let some other Union interpret that contract, enforce that contract, settle grievances under that contract, and not even have the engineers present or on the scene when that is done.” 
    And, what this case is related in the sense that what we're saying to a man is that “You have a Union that represents you and you can make him represent you. 
    You can force him to represent you. 
    You can take him to Court to be sure that he doesn't represent you unfairly, but we're going to let him pay his dues to somebody else,” and that's the evil that we're getting at in this argument. 
    Thank you, Your Honors.

    At the time and prior to the effectiveness of this agreement on the Milwaukee -- the Milwaukee Railroad Issued a bulletin informing all its employees that there would be no enforcement of this agreement pending the outcome of this litigation. 
    No employee on the Milwaukee Railroad has been discharged, no employee, to the best of our knowledge, has ever been cited for non-compliance with the Union shop provision.

    To answer your question, Justice Black, if the case is remanded and vacated, similar to the preceding case, and if that is the end of it, of course, nobody will have any problems. 
    But, it does seem to me that because the plaintiff pleads a representative suit here, a class action, it does seem to me that when it goes back to the District Court, that class under the federal rules is going to have to be circularized in some fashion to find out if they want to have their dues refunded because they certainly claimed that in the case so far. 
    And, if the individuals do claim that they want their dues refunded, as far as I know, the United Transportation Workers Union is not going to just write them out check, and we're going to back in the --

    No, the dues were definitely collected and we printed in our appendix to the -- just one letter that we received from a man who made it very plain that he was unhappy about joining and there was, just literally, dozens and dozens of protests made when the man came in and paid his dues, “I'm paying under protest,” that some of the checks appeared, under paid, under protest.

    But when -- when these Unions merged, were there any considerations given to you in one of these cases? 
    Couldn't they have all been worked out then? 
    Why do you leave it until its last moment and then drop it in our way? 
    Why?

    And then, we wouldn't have any troubles. 
    So now, instead of doing that on your own, you're asking us to find someway to get the case back to the other Court so this can be litigated all over again, is that your position?

    Mr. David L. Uelmen 
    Correct.

    Mr. Lee Leibik 
    They were neither compelled to join nor to drop their membership on the basis of the bulletin issued by the Milwaukee Railroad while this litigation was pending in the Courts, and we know of no employee who was cited for non-compliance with the Union shop agreement.
