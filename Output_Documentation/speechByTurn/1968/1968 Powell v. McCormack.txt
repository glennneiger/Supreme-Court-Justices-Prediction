Powell v. McCormack
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="0.000" stopTime="748.633">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    Were wholly unsupported by the facts themselves. 
    They’ve talked of willful contemptuous a conduct in the part of the petitioner towards the Courts of the State New York, and on April 11th of this year, the appellate division of this Court’s to State of New York, revoked, resented, and vacated the judgment of criminal contempt against the petitioner. 
    They talked of alleged improper use of committee funds and yet, Mr. Hayes, himself the chairman of the committee which had previously investigate said on the Floor of the House, in supporting the admission of the petitioner without any qualifications this time, he pointed out that when these supposed facts were submitted to a tribunal which has the power to investigate a grand jury, the grand jury refused to return any bill of indictment whatsoever. 
    This illustrates the profundity of the founder’s insistence that this rock of protection be written. 
    Now, the respondents have a great difficulty with this constitutional of analysis. 
    They have difficulty with the writings and thinking of Professor Warren, who after lifetime scholarly expertise came to the conclusions which we have here advanced. 
    Did they suggest that Professor Warren through his lifetime of experience did not have the same time to examine the sources of history which turns this to the respondents that had. 
    We don't have to pause long on this. 
    This Court has time and time again relied only in Bond against Floyd on the expertise of Professor Warren. 
    Think of difficulty with Madison and Hamilton and they suggest that the Federalist Papers are after all only special pleading. 
    Well, we do not have to pause long with that contention. 
    This Court has characterized the Federalist Papers time and time again as the most authoritative evidence of the intention of the founders. 
    They have difficulty with the constitutional opinion of their own Select Committee. 
    We point out in our brief that there own Select Committee said, the House had no constitutional power to exclude Mr. Powell. 
    They have difficulty with the opinion of the most dominant constitutional authority in the House, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
    They have difficulty with this Court's decision in Bond against Floyd which proceeds on the assumption that the statements of Madison and Hamilton meant what they said. 
    So, they suggested this Court that it's a position and thinking in Bond against Floyd is mere dictum. 
    Having these difficulties, the respondents reached back into history for precedent to explain that Madison and Hamilton did not mean what they said. 
    That the founders in fact intended to allow some sort of inherent power in the legislature to exclude otherwise duly qualified representatives of the people. 
    Upon the legislatures own notion of unfixed but what is extraordinary is that there entire constitutional edifice rests upon a precedent that they grasped from history, what is the precedent? 
    The Wilkes case, the exclusion of John Wilkes by the British Parliament and Blackstone's rationale in justification for the parliament reaction. 
    They say that since American lawyers were schooled in Blackstone as we all know. 
    The founders must have adopted his justification for the action of the British parliament in excluding Wilkes. 
    But I suggest to the Court this is fantastic that it turns history upon its head that the Wilkes case was the very lesson, Madison said in Philadelphia was what we must prevent in the New Republic in this Republic. 
    And Blackstone's justification for the action of the British Parliament upon which their entire constitutional case rests. 
    They do not inform the Court, was first of all not included in this first commentaries he was very embarrass on the Floor of parliament when he appeared as a special plea therefore the majesty's government to justify the Wilkes exclusion when his own commentaries were read against him. 
    So, he revise his opinion to justify the Wilkes exclusion and he was then attacked on both sides of the Atlantic by the leading spokesman for the colonial courts as evidencing the precise theory of legislative tyranny which the colonist were rising against. 
    Then, we have set forth with the court's convenience in our reply brief. 
    The famous “Junius” papers which repudiate that Blackstone position but most important of all, the Blackstone position was repudiated by the parliament itself when it expunge the Wilkes exclusion resolution, five years before the Philadelphia convention when it expunge it as what, as subversive of the rights of the electorate of the British Isles. 
    And finally, the Blackstone opinion is not even considered English law today. 
    As Professor Holdsworth in his most dominant history of the British English law sets out. 
    So, I suggest the respondent's entire constitutional argument is based upon theories and actions of the British parliament of George III which were at the very core of American opposition, the British league -- legislative tyranny at this has at least proven to me. 
    The wisdom of Mr. Justice Holmes comments that at page of history worth the volume of logic. 
    But I suggest to the Court that this understanding that the founders insisted that the legislature was to have no power to refuse the seat and otherwise duly qualified representative of the people is the key to the question of justiciability and is the key to the question of the role of this Court in this case. 
    In this case as in Baker-Carr, non-justiciability had become little more than a play in words. 
    For Baker-Carr teaches that the test of non-justiciability in the political question doctrine is deciding whether a manner has been in anyway committed by the Constitution to another branch of government or whether the action of that branch succeeds, whatever authority has been committed, or Justice Harlan pointed out his opinion in Baker-Carr that it's quite necessary to cut through the thick of discussion about justiciability and get to the point as to whether complaint discloses the violation of our federal constitutional right. 
    This inquiry the Court has thought us all in Baker-Carr, requires a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation and it is the responsibility of this Court as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution to make it. 
    This is the key to this case. 
    The question as to who may be the freely chosen representatives of the people has not been confronted by the Constitution to the exclusive control of the legislature quite to the contrary. 
    It has been confided by the Constitution to the ultimate branch of government, the sovereign people. 
    In the written document they established as their fundamental law. 
    This is because the fundamental process itself of representative government requires that the free choice of the people's representatives remain with the people, subject only to the qualifications they themselves lay down in their Constitution. 
    So, under the teachings of the Court in Baker-Carr, this is a case in which judicial power must be exercised with the action of the legislatures exceeded the authority committed to it. 
    It is suggested that relief here would violate separation of powers. 
    The contrary is true. 
    Relief here is required to preserve the powers reserved to the sovereign people by the Constitution. 
    This is the most historic role of this Court and the words of the Chief Justice in Marbury are decisive here. 
    And his question is the question, we must all answer to what purpose or powers limited and to what purposes is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained. 
    And let me speak frankly at this point, what is that the heart of the reluctance of the Lower Courts to grant relief here? 
    It is the fear of a confrontation with the House, but this fear in itself unreal since in the words of this Court, it is an inadmissible suggestion that the House would not accept this Court's role as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. 
    This fear would paralyze the Court in its most important function to preserve a rule of law, the foundation stone of which is a written Constitution. 
    A fear to act here because respondents have power would in the Chief Justice's words in Marbury subvert the very foundations of all written constitutions. 
    At another priceless point in the history of this Court, this Court said in Cooper against Aaron that Marbury declared the basic principle that the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution and that this principle has been respected by this Court and by the country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system. 
    The reaffirmation of that this is a government of laws and not men that represented of government means that ultimate power remains with the people is particularly necessary when the crisis arises in a context in which black citizens are denied the right to elect their own black representative who had reason to great heights of legislative leadership. 
    It is difficult indeed to demand law and order of American citizens if the legislative branch itself denies the first assumptions of an ordered society. 
    The right of people to govern themselves, thus, to grant relief here would not only be to reaffirm the fundamentals of a representative government but it would reaffirm the fact, that the principles of populous sovereignty are equally applicable to citizen's black and white. 
    Such a decision in Justice Clark's words concurring in Baker-Carr would be in the greatest tradition of this Court. 
    Professor Reid will continue the argument.

speaker="herbert_o_reid" startTime="750.228" stopTime="932.118">
    Mr. Herbert O. Reid 
    May it please the Court. 
    We've attempted to argue in our brief in orally. 
    First the Congress did not have the power to exclude Congressman Adam C. Powell and what it did and how he did it raise further constitutional objections. 
    In the outset, the two judges in the Court of Appeals tried to treat this matter of expulsion -- treat this matter of exclusion as a matter of expulsion. 
    And have it clearly that should be laid to rest in the beginning. 
    When Congress was organized -- when the House organized on January 3, 1969, the very same resolution which had been proposed in March 1, 1967, the subject matter of our discussion here, the same resolution was proposed. 
    The speaker was called upon to read to rule on whether or not a motion to exclude with germane to expel, with germane to his seating our motion to exclude in which the Speaker wrote with January 3rd that such a motion was not germane that on the seating of the congressman. 
    The only question opens to the House with the three qualifications. 
    Also, the speaker wrote on March the 1st that since this was a question of seating that the necessary vote was a majority vote and not the two-thirds which would have been required if it had been a matter of expulsion. 
    The justice's below suggests that this is an immaterial distinction since the vote was large enough to satisfy the two-thirds requirement. 
    What we argue here is that of course, the motives of the members of the House in voting cannot be inquired into determine how they would have voted where the issue expulsion. 
    But more fundamentally, this was at the bottom and grounded on the Precedents of the House as demonstrated in the speaker under the later wrote in this January 3, 1969. 
    These precedents dictated that the speakers earlier ruling that the vote was on exclusion because the House could not expel for conduct in a previous session and it was no question as the conduct alleged here in had taken place in Congres's previous to 90th of Congress. 
    The --

    What's the basis of that statement Professor Reid that the House could not expel for conduct in previous session?
speaker="herbert_o_reid" startTime="940.247" stopTime="976.666">
    Mr. Herbert O. Reid 
    The Precedents of the House sir, the speaker outlined the Precedents of the House when he wrote on March -- on January 3, 1969 in which we've included the copy of the record of January 3rd. 
    In which he gives -- he said that he anticipated. 
    Pardon me. 
    That he had anticipated that this question would be raised and therefore he had had his brief and it is very long in detailed ruling by the speaker that particular time citing the House Precedents.

    Sir?

    Mr. Herbert O. Reid 
    Well, no because I don't know of any matter that is a reason that would have given the Court the opportunity, sir, to have decide at this. 
    There is however, a great distinction involved in judicial standard sir. 
    If the -- on the question of judging an election and seating. 
    Of course, the House exercises judicial power there but this Court has been very clear in a number of cases and saying that, when the House is exercise -- the House are in, they're exercising their powers or in expulsion. 
    That this is a judicial power of the highest order requiring the greatest amount of due process protections in the adversary sense. 
    So, for an additional judicial reason, sir, we believe that this role that this exclusion -- the expulsion could not be -- the exclusion could not be treated as expulsion.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    As a different appropriation on the one that Justice Fortas argues --
speaker="herbert_o_reid" startTime="1051.458" stopTime="1458.611">
    Mr. Herbert O. Reid 
    Yes, of course as I said the -- in terms of a -- which incidentally we contend here that does power -- the Congress did not -- the House did not have the power and beyond that the money in which out of the Congress in power was excluded violates other provisions of the Constitution to wit the Fifth Amendment due process and the prohibition against Bill of Attainment. 
    Certainly, the House has power to deal with a member and the member elect and the way in which it may not deal with a general member of the societies so far as the bill of attainder is concerned. 
    Its judicial power there to seat and to remove one who has been seated, however, where one was never seated and punishment was legislative as it was here after a legislative finding and at no time with any resemblance of due process hearing held. 
    We contend then that such the manner in which this was accomplished in the House violates first the due process while this substantively and procedural requirements and in addition that it amounts to a bill of attainment. 
    At the beginning of this matter in the 90th of Congress, when Congressman Powell was asked to step aside, the Hayes Committee had concluded its report. 
    The Hayes Committee, Committee on Administration had been directed by a resolution which is in the Hayes report at pages -- at page 4 had been directed by the resolution to investigate the various committees of the House and the various numbers of a House into regard. 
    There was nothing in this resolution was specify, any particular committee, any particular committee chairman or any particular member of the House. 
    Nevertheless, the committee proceeded to investigate only one. 
    Congressman Powell was invited to attend the Hayes Committee, in which he declined at page 84 that levy in the same report as included at which he was not an unconditional declination by in which he suggest that the Committee that a charge to investigate other committees and other people in Congress. 
    And as soon as the Committee had done this, he would be glad to appear now, this position who has asserted by the very reason that he was entitled to know whether or not this was preferential treatment as to him, in order to lay an equal predicate if necessary in the House or in the Courts if the matter had been raised. 
    Now, he was denied this opportunity and then when the Select Committee was formed and directed to investigate and to report back on the seating of the Congressman, the Select Committee declined to have an adversary hearing and that one thing that's clear in this record. 
    It is the Chairman Celler's position and the position of the Committee that this was not an adversary hearing. 
    As a result, he was not afforded the rights of an adversary hearing and therefore, the findings are mere legislative findings. 
    And I think the affect of such findings are clearly illustrated by the January 3rd proceeding in the House in 1969. 
    Where even though these facts are not refuted anywhere because we didn't have adversary hearing. 
    They have been completely repudiated. 
    Mr. Hayes who was chairman of the Subcommittee on Administration, pointed not only that they had -- they didn't found insufficient by grand jury but he said, “They are insufficient for us to act on, the way we find facts in the House,” he said, “in no basis upon which to predicate this kind of action.” 
    Gentleman, Mr. Hayes made that statement himself in the record on January 3rd. 
    So, the first predicate of the House's action, the Hayes report. 
    The second predicate, the proceedings in the New York Court have both been the support of these have been withdrawn from the House's position. 
    In addition, the House reported to furnish Congressman Powell for his contumacious conduct toward the select Committee and that contumacious conduct where they refuse over to participate in a legislative hearing to determine whether or not he should be seated. 
    For -- so, for exercising his constitutional right as the Court pointed out this morning in the decision in the resident requirement cases, he was being punished then for asserting a constitutional right and that's impermissible whether the assertion is good or bad. 
    Beyond this he was denied all of the procedure work guaranties and for a very good reason, I think. 
    For the very inception of this matter, Mr. Powell would notify that the Select Committee would investigate, “Into his official misconduct since 1961.” 
    Of course, that's a frightening suggestion to most people but this -- it was open ended and to the day in which he had assumed the chairmanship of this committee. 
    At the time he assumed this chairmanship of this committee, there was great question raised in the House and addressed to the speaker as to whether or not Mr. Powell would be elected by the House as Chairman of this committee, since he was then the senior person or would he be avoided because of his race and of course, he was re-elected. 
    And what relevance other than this that the notice of his official misconduct to date of his taken on the chairmanship has -- I do not know.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose that the House determine in whatever way that a member had misappropriated House funds in a substantial amount. 
    And suppose that this determination occur and the misappropriation had occurred during the same session, do you challenge that the House could expel him?
speaker="herbert_o_reid" startTime="1489.884" stopTime="1551.319">
    Mr. Herbert O. Reid 
    There are two problems, Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    First, procedural due process, I have no and I have no problem that the House would have to afford here an adversary hearing, affording all the requisites of due process. 
    Procedural due process, as to the matter of the substantive due process implicit in your question, I have some difficulty as members of the House have and the members of the Senate from time to time across on in each one that they should write some rules and regulations before the fact so as to avoid the same kind of situation. 
    Congressman Fusco introduced the resolution in the House several days after this occurred, to call him for a select Committee to set up standards. 
    I would not go so far to say sir that before these standards arouse were set up that the House would be important to act. 
    I think the House might be able to proceed on account of a common law reference --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1551.319" stopTime="1551.835">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well I want to be sure --
speaker="herbert_o_reid" startTime="1551.835" stopTime="1553.961">

    Which have been suggested by some of the rights, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1553.961" stopTime="1575.829">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I want to be sure I understand your position. 
    You wouldn't say them that the House could constitutionally expel the member after a due process hearing for the misappropriation of House funds and I assume that it was everything happen during the single session.
speaker="herbert_o_reid" startTime="1575.829" stopTime="1611.132">
    Mr. Herbert O. Reid 
    Well, misappropriation of funds, yes sir. 
    However, in terms of such a proceeding, and to defense to that the conduct other members of the House would be highly relevant. 
    And this is one of the reasons I'm sure that the House did not want to afford him a due process hearing. 
    Because they didn't want any comparative study made and this is indicated also about -- January 3rd record of 1969 when Chairman Celler said as to nepotism, judge not lest, you be judged.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1611.132" stopTime="1617.952">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You mean can expel one person for misappropriation of House funds unless you expel everybody?
speaker="herbert_o_reid" startTime="1617.952" stopTime="1934.233">
    Mr. Herbert O. Reid 
    No, sir. 
    I'm not saying that Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    What I am saying that the relevant to the expulsion of the one is the conduct of others and whether or not under the equal cases. 
    Whether or not he then has an equal protection argument because of being singled out and this was highly relevant in the particular case as well as the conduct of other members. 
    And I think that there is no other justification for the House's failure to accord him a due process hearing. 
    They're requiring the attendance of witnesses and the like other than they wanted to avoid this comparative study, to which I think he was entitled to. 
    Beyond the constitutional infirmities of due process and (Inaudible) which clearly are going back to the main part of our argument would indicate that this Court had jurisdiction and that the issues were just justiciable. 
    I want to say a word about mootness and remedy. 
    The House has suggested that the seating of Congressman Powell on January 3, 1969 had mooted this controversy to which we take issue in our memorandum in our position in which we contained narrow to argue that the manner had not been come moot. 
    One, because this is continuous conduct, the kind of continuous conduct that we had complained about in the original suit. 
    And on January the 3rd 1969 when the motion which finally passed -- the motion which finally passed seating him carried the findings from the 90th Congress with no question whether the same punishment, the same conduct, the same activity was the basis of the discriminatory action which took place on January 3, 1969. 
    In addition, we take the further position that the House could not moot this case by further unconstitutional conduct. 
    Therefore, in order for this Court to determine that this case had been mooted by the January 3rd action of the House. 
    This Court would have to find that the January 3rd resolution which seated him on condition of paying of fine and other limitations whether that action of the House was correct. 
    In addition to the continuing conduct, obviously as the Court suggested in Bond case. 
    We have a question of the backpay from the two years in which he was not allowed to seat. 
    An amount I think estimated by the chairman of -- Mr. Chairman Celler, as $55,000.00 but in addition, this resolution which a levy to fine upon him. 
    Thereby adding the resolution of January 3rd seated him were clearly and then the -- against the pleadings of the leadership of the House, Mr. Albert, Mr. Celler, mention just a few Your Honor, all suggested that the House would not punish him prior to seating him because to do so was to add to the qualifications. 
    Mr. Kinoy has pointed out. 
    And now the House is now in position of the respondent is that this further illegal conduct moots this controversy to which we take exception and press before you that this matter is not moot, ready for the decision and should be decided in order to cover to the matter of backpay as well as the other punishment position provisions of the resolution. 
    Now, as to remedy because the big stone in Bond in this case all along has been the remedy aspect, and whether the Court could enforce its mandate. 
    I think the difficult in our position since you agree to took the outset, a mandamus was proper and that we were entitled to mandamus from Marbury, to the case of Marbury down. 
    I think the fact that the Congressman had been seated however, removes his difficulty considerably. 
    The -- therefore, I think the remedy problem becomes much, much easier to handle and to direct here in terms of declaring the Resolution 278 and of March 1, 1967, and the resolution of January 3, 1969 unconstitutional. 
    I think that in the light of the --

    The House would not obey the declaration of law by this Court as it has from Marbury through Cooper and (Inaudible) and that there is no inhibition to the kind of remedy we seek here coming out of the Constitution itself with no basis for believing that the historical role of this Court in the area of judicial review has been that it had judgment that it -- that in separation of powers what had been separated and given to the judiciary was the matter of deciding cases.

   Argument of Bruce Bromley
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2159.917" stopTime="2162.292">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Judge Bromley.
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="2162.292" stopTime="2372.305">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Yes, please. 
    They – there are at least four undisputed matters before us to which my two friends have made scant attention. 
    First as this Court is fully aware, this is an action against the members of the House questioning their action in there official capacity as petitioners emphatic announce below. 
    Here, we are suing the legislative branch. 
    This action then is not an action against private parties or against the United States with its consent to secure the declaration of unconstitutionality of a statute passed by the Congress. 
    It is directed solely to the members in their capacity as members of the House and three of their agents who acted within the House pursuant to the command of the House. 
    It is our view that this Court does not have the power to entertain this action against the members any more than it would have the power to order the members to pass or repeal a statute. 
    Second, there is no dispute now as to the correctness of the findings made by the Select Committee of the 90th Congress. 
    To the effect that Mr. Powell misappropriated large sums of government funds that he was in civil and criminal contempt at the time of the action of the New York Courts. 
    That he maintained unlawfully an improper person on his congressional payroll and that he refused to cooperate in a perfectly proper investigation of his conduct, conducted by two committees, one of the 89th Congress and one of the 90th. 
    Now, the serious charges against Mr. Powell were not denied by him at any time. 
    They were not denied by him before the committees which investigated him. 
    They were not denied by him at the time the House convened. 
    Now, considered the matter and reach its decision. 
    They were not denied by him in the compliant which was filed two years ago. 
    They were not denied by him in the lower courts below -- in the courts below and they are not denied here.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2372.305" stopTime="2384.550">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Judge Bromley, is it a fact that the Speaker of the House had already ruled that those questions were not relevant to the investigation of the committee?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="2384.550" stopTime="2387.071">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    No, Your Honor. 
    It is not.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2387.071" stopTime="2410.371">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I thought that counsel said that prior of this it was a ruling by the Speaker of the House that the inquiry into his conduct while he was in the Congress on this particular investigation was not relevant?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="2410.371" stopTime="2411.573">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    No, that's not right sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2411.573" stopTime="2413.207">

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, don't let me interrupt your argument anymore then.
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="2427.725" stopTime="2538.148">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Now third, the complaint in this case does not allege that Mr. Powell was excluded because of his race and the record before the House when it came to reach its decision of expulsion. 
    It does not even suggest that such an allegation would be supported. 
    Accordingly, I say it has no proper place in this case. 
    Fourthly, the action of the House of the 91st Congress, the present Congress in fining Mr. Powell $25,000.00 and depriving him of his seniority, likewise, is not before this Court. 
    The action of the 91st House is not challenged in the compliant. 
    The parties to any such claim that is the members of the present Congress and their agents are not parties to this action in their capacity as members of this Congress. 
    The moreover, this Court I submit it does not have original jurisdiction to hear any such claim. 
    And so, the precise question as we see it is whether any Court in a suit against the members of the House of the 90th Congress can review a decision of those members acting pursuant to their constitutional powers to judge the qualifications of their own members to exclude the member elect solely for reasons of personal misconduct and that's all Mr. Powell was excluded for here.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2538.148" stopTime="2548.690">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose he had been excluded because of his race, a former resolution. 
    Would say that he would have any judicial remedy?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="2548.690" stopTime="2555.249">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    I should say sir in answer to that question of action of the House would be clearly unconstitutional.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2555.249" stopTime="2557.448">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="2557.448" stopTime="2635.739">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    But as I read the speech or debate clause he would not sir. 
    So, our position is that what the House did in this matter was for the House on the House alone to decide and its action should not and is not subject to judicial review. 
    Before discussing however the reasons for that answer, I wish to emphasize again as we do in our suggestion of mootness and in our brief that in my judgment that this action is clearly moot. 
    The House of the 90th Congress against which relief is sought as terminate. 
    Mr. Powell can no longer be seated in that House. 
    There is now a new House. 
    He now seats in that House and I believe for that reason in that simple reason, the case is moot. 
    But it is my purpose to devote the remainder of my time to the substantive issue.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2635.739" stopTime="2641.550">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How about his back salary that he would have been paid, had he been seated, Mr. Bromley?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="2641.550" stopTime="2701.771">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Back salary is so incidental to the main prayer for relief that I do not feel it could justify the jurisdiction of the Court. 
    It is completely de minimis. 
    He was paid up to March 1, 1967, the date on which he was expelled. 
    He was re-elected very promptly and he could have prevented himself to the House in April of the same year. 
    And as the speaker said, twice the matter would be considered again in light of the very important new factor that he had been re-elected as it was last January but Mr. Powell chose to stay away. 
    He never presented himself. 
    He never came near the House. 
    So, I say he clearly has no claim for any salary except maybe a month's salary.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2701.771" stopTime="2710.551">
    Justice Abe Fortas

    The resolution say he should paid?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="2923.674" stopTime="2931.467">

    That's right. 
    The resolution said he should be paid while the hearings were going on and up to his date of -- up to the date of decision.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2931.467" stopTime="2939.455">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I see.
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="2939.455" stopTime="3179.492">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Of course, my point about the salary is after he was paid the March 1st, he could have come back and the result might have been entirely different as it was last January. 
    The reason he didn't get his salary after April 1967 until January 1969 was because he never presented himself. 
    He never asked the House to reconsider in the light of the important fact that he had been overwhelmingly re-elected in Harlem. 
    Now, I submit that there are at least five separate reasons why his demands for relief cannot be granted and I'd like to summarize them briefly before I start to discuss it. 
    In the first place, although, we haven't heard any mention of it. 
    Article I Section 5, the Speech or Debate Clause affirmatively barged any Court from questioning members of the House or their agents with respect to actions taken by them within the House such as the exercise of their constitutional power to judge the qualifications of one of their members. 
    Second, I don't think Federal Courts have any subject matter jurisdiction here because Article I Section 5 assigns the sole adjudicatory power to the House by declaring that the House is the judge of the qualifications of its members. 
    That delegation of judicial power under Article I, like the power of the trial impeachment if you please is an explicit exception to the general grant of judicial power to the courts under Article III. 
    Since the legislative is co-equal with the judicial branch, the judgments which the House makes in this situation in the field allocated to it, i.e. the qualification of its members are exclusive and supreme. 
    Thirdly, the Court should not proceed in this case because it involves a nonjusticiable political question. 
    Fourthly, if the courts could review the propriety what the House did. 
    It is clear that the House acted within its constitutional powers when it excluded Mr. Powell. 
    But the constitutional power of each House, the judge qualifications is not limited as had has been stated so many times here to the three standing disqualifications of age, citizenship, and inhabitancy. 
    It extends as well to matters of personal misconduct on the fitting a member of the House and even three -- if these three standing disqualifications were exclusive, the House's action in any event would be justified under its expulsion power. 
    Since the two-thirds vote required for expulsion was obtained. 
    And fifthly, assuming that the lower Federal Courts did have the power to rule on the merits of the case, under the circumstances presented here, those courts did not abuse their discretion in declining to grant the extraordinary and discretionary relief prayed for. 
    Now, I submit that anyone of these five reasons is sufficient to require dismissal of the action.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3179.492" stopTime="3210.876">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Could I ask you a question about your non-justiciability argument. 
    Put in extreme case, have you claimed that if the Congress expelled Mr. Powell saying, well, we will lay aside the majority vote required for expulsion before exclusion and he had two-thirds vote for expulsion were just take a general census in expulsion. 
    Did you say that is nonjusticiable?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="3210.876" stopTime="3215.515">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    I think so, of course it was improper and unconstitutional.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3215.515" stopTime="3218.442">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    But that there no, no, relief?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="3218.442" stopTime="3228.164">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    No relief because the power to judge which includes the power to judge erroneously has been confided to the House.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3228.164" stopTime="3248.385">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But would you contest, I beg your pardon. 
    Would you then contest the judicial power to review and whatever procedure it might be in action by the House holding a nonmember in contempt?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="3248.385" stopTime="3252.444">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    No. 
    I wouldn't contest that.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3252.444" stopTime="3262.424">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So, there are some instances where action by the house maybe subjective to judicial review?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="3262.424" stopTime="3273.326">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    It's correct. 
    Yes, but outside the House but not for action in pursuant to its adjudicatory constitutional power to act within the House.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3273.326" stopTime="3280.245">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I don't understand. 
    Both actions take place within the House.
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="3280.245" stopTime="3292.308">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    But if Kilbourn against Thompson certainly that action didn't take place within the House. 
    The witness would seize outside the House.
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="3292.308" stopTime="3332.105">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    True that there were some authorization within the House that they act which the courts had jurisdiction of was the seizure outside the House and I think that distinction, however, artificial it may seem is one which is dictated by the allocation through the power to judge the qualifications of its members, power to make its own rules of its proceedings, and the bar which is set up against attack in the Speech or Debate Clause.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3332.105" stopTime="3376.636">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well Judge Bromley, would your argument carry you to the extent of saying that if one party was in complete control of the House, say it had three -- two-thirds or three-fourths of all the members that the House and that it could on a proceeding of this kind refuse to seat all the elected members of the other party on a ground that their views were dangerous to the country or on any views so -- on any -- for any reasons that it want to, would you say that they could do that without any remedy whatsoever?

    What would the remedy be?

    Yes.

    Well, I think it is because of your remark about other perversions in Bond against Floyd there -- I must admit there are some perversions which this Court must be ingenious enough to find a way around the Speech or Debate Clause or else will be confronted with revolution or worse. 
    So, I don't say that the other perversions which this maybe and lastly, this maybe an attempt by a Congress to add another standing disqualification which it has no power to do and which I don't think could be attacked if it tried to do it to cause of the Speech or Debate Clause.

speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="3545.719" stopTime="3657.736">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I recognize that it has a strange sound coming from any lawyer to tell this Court that something unconstitutional may have occurred and yet you have no power to intervene. 
    But I've -- I make that contention in this posture and I rest it squarely on the Speech or Debate Clause as interpreted by at least three cases decided here under that clause. 
    But that clause providing that for any speech or debate in the House, its members shall not be questioned at any place underscores and enforces the separation of power doctrine embedded in our Constitution. 
    It has the broad purpose, I submit of protecting the integrity and independence of the Federal Legislative branch from any interference whatsoever by the Executive or Judicial branches even to the extent of imposing upon the members the inconvenience and expense of defending themselves. 
    No longer is there -- does anyone question the fact that speech or debate is not limited to words spoken in debate in the House but includes everything done in the House in connection with its business such as the act of holding the passage of a resolution directing the activities of its agents and --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3657.736" stopTime="3664.539">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Powell led to its logic conclusion why doesn't that vitiate the whole part of the initial review?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="3664.539" stopTime="3858.070">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Because it's confined only, Your Honor, to the action which the members take in connection with the regulation of their own proceedings within the House. 
    And mind you, that's why I emphasized at the outset in the suit against the members. 
    It doesn't officiate a broad area at all sir, it only vitiates a very narrow area. 
    Now the three cases that I mention, this immunity from attacked put up with the Speech or Debate Clause covers, well, let's take Kilbourn against Thompson first. 
    That involves the passage of a resolution directing the illegal and unconstitutional incarceration imprisonment of a private individual sued against the members barred by speech or debate even though their action was clearly unconstitutional. 
    The alleged unlawful and unconstitutional activity of seizing private property in the context of an effort to suppress free speech, last terms Dombrowski against Eastland. 
    And finally, activity which results in the clear violation of a criminal statute, United States against Johnson, the only possible limitation as I said before on the Speech or Debate Clause is what this Court said in Kilbourn. 
    And what it described as possible other perversions and the example that I gave of the heading the precedent was given by this Court in the opinion in Kilbourn as an example of an utter perversion, I didn't make it up. 
    Now, what other cases would be included in this doctrine of other perversion? 
    Well, that's a very difficult question but I am willing to say I think but what its worth that probably if all blacks were excluded in any fashion either seriatim or by the passage of a rule that would be an utter perversion possibly. 
    I'm sure if all republicans were excluded it would clearly be an utter perversion. 
    But I say probably not if only one will act were excluded such as here assuming contrary to the fact that Mr. Powell was excluded because of his race. 
    He'd probably not give if --

    I don't know. 
    Maybe we could get some help if we took the analogy of impeachment. 
    Suppose the president were impeached on unconstitutional grounds of race, religion, or speech and removed from office by the Senate. 
    I say this Court could do nothing about it in a suit against members of the Senate because of the Speech or Debate Clause. 
    And the fact --

    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    I was about to say and because I think as well the fact that the constitutional lodges the ultimate power to try impeachments in the Senate under Article I just as the Constitution allocates the power to judge the qualifications in the House or perhaps --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3971.213" stopTime="3975.640">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But the Constitution does state what the qualifications are, doesn't it?

    No person shall be a representative who has not obtained the age of 25 and is a resident citizen of state court he comes. 
    I think that's -- that's a standing disqualification and doesn't that all evidence an intent on the part of the framers to overrule the longstanding power of legislative bodies for over two centuries to discipline their own members for personal misconduct. 
    Well, that goes back to the 16th century.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What you're really saying Judge Bromley, if I correctly understand you is that the Constitution has these grounds of disqualification. 
    The Constitution provides that the House shall be the judge of the qualifications of its member that the House may take whatever standard it wants to for necessary qua -- as a necessary qualification of member -- of the member provided that it is not so extremely outrageous, is that about it?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="4063.808" stopTime="4065.277">

    That's your position?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="4067.993" stopTime="4082.972">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    So, long as we qualify it by understanding that my contention about that power to exclude is probably limited to cases of misconduct unbefitting the trust and confidence that ought to be placed in the member.

    Now, that I must repeat even though I know it may bore you. 
    These questions have nothing to do with our case. 
    There was nothing unconstitutional about Mr. Powell's exclusion once you agree that the power to judge the qualifications for misconduct is lodge in the House as I think is perfectly clear by the practice of all the legislatures and our Congress right down to the present time.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4251.071" stopTime="4252.997">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I want to ask you one more question.
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="4252.997" stopTime="4253.117">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4253.117" stopTime="4303.899">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Would you in that respect, would you make any distinction between the grounds for exclusion which relate to his activities as a member of the House that is to say the allege misappropriation of funds, the allege contumacious conduct, the alleged improper payroll practice, would you make a distinction between those on the one hand and on the other hand alleged improper conduct that had no bearing upon the business of the House but related the allegedly to Mr. Powell's character and his obedience to law, namely the contumacious conduct towards a court?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="4303.899" stopTime="4706.777">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    I would make no such distinction sir and there are many, many cases of the legislative practice of excluding felons, perjurers, and we even have some presidents for persons who had been contemptuous of the Court's outside the House. 
    I think that a well-defined legislative common law that came along with this Speech or Debate Clause into the Constitution. 
    Well, I was talking about impeachment and I said that I thought that was an analogy because the Speech or Debate Clause applied to impeachment, even though it was on at utterly unconstitutional grounds. 
    Now, coming to this contention of the petitioners for a moment, as I understand them they say, well, speech or debate may bar the imposition of criminal or civil penalties after the event. 
    But it doesn't forbid the course the kind of relief inherent in an injunction or a writ or declaratory judgment. 
    However, it seems to us that in order to effectuate the immunity afforded by the Speech or Debate Clause, it must apply to injunction, mandamus, or declaratory judgment, of course, it is far simpler to intimidate critical legislators by direct order of a court with its attention -- attended sanctions than it is by the indirect threat of subsequent criminal or civil proceedings. 
    And as I've indicated, I don't believe petitioners have overcome their difficulty by now limiting their prayer to a declaratory judgment because the declaratory judgment is itself I submit in the most direct and positive sense, a questioning of speech or debate taken in the House. 
    Furthermore in this situation, I think there should be a doctrine and probably is that declaratory relief should not lie where the suit for injunction is barred at least by the separation of power's doctrine as it is here for unless declaratory judgment is to feel wholly gratuitous and advisory, and useless act. 
    It must rely for its efficacy upon the willingness of the members to acquiesce in the Court's interpretation of it's -- of the House's powers. 
    Thus, insofar as a declaratory judgment would be given force and effect by the member voluntary acquiescence, it would be, I submit as effective and impingement and interference with legislative proceedings as a flat injunction would be. 
    I want to say a word about nonmember agents because in the Dombrowski against Eastland, the court said that the immunity extends to the Sergeant at Arms in this case to the Clerk and the Doorkeeper who are three individual defendants in this matter. 
    And this Court said the immunity extends although it is less absolute. 
    But it seems to me, of course there the agent of the Senate Mr. Sowerwine was held not protected by the Clause because he is alleged to have conspired down in Louisiana with some people to make an illegal seizure of some papers which Senator Eastland wanted. 
    Here, the only thing that these three gentlemen did was to obey the command of the House within the House and it seems to me the immunity therefore clearly applies to them. 
    I want to say a word about power to judge qualifications and the power to expel. 
    Let's assume for a moment contrary to my basic position that this Court may properly review the action of the House in this case. 
    I nevertheless say that the action of the House in doing what it did to Mr. Powell was clearly within its constitutional powers for it clearly was within the constitutional grant in my view of the power to judge his qualifications to seat and I had no use my repeating that I do not believe this constitutional disqualifications under more than three of them are exclusive in all that the framers had before them illustration of state constitutions which made this matter clear. 
    I said that the legislature in various states like New Hampshire and Massachusetts had the power to judge the qualifications contained in this Constitution and one of the men who work on the draft of the Constitution came from Massachusetts or New Hampshire that he was fully familiar with his own Constitution. 
    And yet, the framers chose to adopt language not so specifically limited and the reason they did it I think it's because they new fully well and realize and all that to retain the power to purged themselves of dishonest, disgraceful people because of the obligation they owed to the whole nation to have a legislative body made up at least of decent, honorable citizens.

    At great length showing how widespread the power with -- was and how widely it was exercise what the grounds were.

    It was not committed while he was in the House or at the seat of Government or not even during a session and it negated all of the requirements that the conduct be limited to his conduct while he was in the House. 
    This opinion In re Chapman approve the case of William Blunt, not long ago in 1797 in which the House found that his conduct, although, not taking place during the time of his service was nevertheless a proper ground for expelling or excluding.

    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Well, the House is never -- the House itself formally never thought this is acting on an expulsion matter.

    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Yes, but isn't that the distinction since there was a two-thirds vote. 
    Absolutely immaterial, what would this Court be --

    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    But I just want to say this -- this work should the Court order the House not an existence to go back and seat him and then expel him?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5334.334" stopTime="5352.991">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume the House that the -- that in the precedents of the House it was pretty clear that the House had always sought it, it could never expel for conduct occurring prior to the organizing of the House? 
    I suppose that would be at some --
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="5352.991" stopTime="5353.351">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Yes, but --

    He had $50,000.00 which he taken. 
    He had it through -- he took it prior to the 90th Congress but he had it in his possession at the time the 90th acted, he saw no reason for offering to give it back --

    Well, I opted a little or defined the specific finding -- specific findings of the report, say that he willfully and unlawfully appropriated to his own use. 
    There are two findings, 25,000 add, 50,000 add, 16,000 add and you add them up and they come to over $44,000.00.

    We the citizens of this country didn't get it back.

    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Well, I should think in this posture that we ought to come here with some statement from him if he didn't do it saying, we'll, I didn't do it. 
    But if -- they're very careful not to say that and they have never said it. 
    Why he took -- he took checks made out to his wife and there was a forged signature on her checks. 
    And he deposited them and in his own account. 
    That's where he got the $44,000.00 from and they were separated. 
    He and his wife were separated. 
    She lived in Puerto Rico. 
    She testified under oath. 
    She hadn't done any work for his congressional staff since 1965 which started the period that the $44,000.00. 
    She was paid at his instigation over $20,000.00 a year. 
    Never did a thing and each month, the check with the forged endorsement in her name ended up in his bank account. 
    And not only that, he authorized according to the testimony of his Assistant Stone, the illegal and deceitful use of credit cards issued to employees of his committee for friends and family to travel in Europe, to Florida, to the Bahamas --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5655.092" stopTime="5656.624">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Isn't that a crime?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="5656.624" stopTime="5662.229">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Yes, it's a crime and he should have been indicted. 
    I don't know why he wasn't.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5662.229" stopTime="5663.430">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, that's what I was thinking --
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="5663.430" stopTime="5663.694">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Yes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5663.694" stopTime="5665.484">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And it probably be a better place to try him.
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="5665.484" stopTime="5839.212">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Yes. 
    Well, I don't know if there's been any better place to tried at Mr. Justice Black, since he plainly admitted it, there was no doubt about it. 
    He'd been indicted he'd probably would have to plead guilty. 
    I don't understand why he wasn't. 
    The jury, the grand jury by the way to whom my friend referred, never voted no true bill. 
    It never did anything and the Department of Justice all fit to terminate its existence before it took any action. 
    But the matter of whether he similarly liable it's still pending somewhere in the department. 
    So finally, I say again that for anyone that he seeks legal reasons, I think this matter deserves affirmance and I believe it to be no answer to any of those arguments to say that the House might unreasonably or erroneously exercise its adjudicatory powers. 
    For members of the House like judges take an oath to support the Constitution 
    We can't assume that they will violate the oath. 
    Of course, there's always the risk of error, even constitutional error on the part of each branch of Government in the areas in which it is granted supreme constitutional competence. 
    But this is not a weakness of our system of Government. 
    I think it's a strength because some individual or some group always has to make the final decision and our finding fathers put this narrow area of adjudication 
    Not in the hands of an Article III Court but in the hands of an Article I Legislative body 
    There's a remedy for a situation like this, of course, but it's a political remedy. 
    So quickly exercise by the voters in this case. 
    And if he, Mr. Powell had presented himself a month or two after he was excluded since he was overwhelmingly re-elected. 
    In the light of the speaker's ruling that the House would reconsider the matter in the light of that important development. 
    He probably would have been seated. 
    He chose to wait. 
    I don't know why.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5839.212" stopTime="5852.753">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why would he been seated, if he so reasonably been prevented from taking his office because of these what you call crimes?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="5852.753" stopTime="5894.202">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    Because the voters so overwhelmingly express their preference to him of this. 
    His opponents practically got no votes. 
    Despite -- despite all the publicity attended upon is there elections and of course the House would consider that that was a very important matter when they did consider it last January. 
    They voted to seat him, surely. 
    They thought, look, we can't let this man go scot-free. 
    We will punish him and they did strip him of his seniority and fining $25,000.00 which he got to pay $1,100.00 a month out of his salary.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5894.202" stopTime="5905.836">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, there's a quite a difference between those two than that. 
    Quite a difference between taking away his seniority which I presume nobody would decline to say to the Congress they know what to do --
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="5905.836" stopTime="5906.238">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    That's right.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5906.238" stopTime="5911.615">

    And fining for crimes.
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="5911.615" stopTime="5923.669">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    I don't see the difference, sir, fining him from misappropriating money making him pay it back in part. 
    I think it was a very mild sanction myself.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="5923.669" stopTime="5929.983">

    That's what it says.
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="5940.730" stopTime="5943.882">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    I assume that mean I can have him imprison.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="5943.882" stopTime="5950.507">

    And in that event would he been entitled to -- it is your position that he would not be entitled any judicial review?
speaker="bruce_bromley" startTime="5950.507" stopTime="5983.020">
    Mr. Bruce Bromley 
    That is my position. 
    Yes, sir. 
    As Professor Zechariah Chafee said long ago, it is no answer to say that if the House should exclude the man on some whimsical ground, no appeal would lie from its action, neither is there any appeal from the Supreme Court. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Arthur Kinoy
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5983.020" stopTime="6004.951">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Kinoy.
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6004.951" stopTime="6167.729">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    May it please the Court. 
    There have been some rather unusual statements made in Court this morning which we would like to respond to very briefly. 
    In the first place, in response to the Chief Justice's question as to the speaker's ruling. 
    I called the Court's attention to the fact that in the congressional record for January 3rd H14, the speaker's ruling is set forth in full the speaker ruled that the question as to the punishment of Mr. Powell for act's committed in the 88th or 89th Congress is not germane to the proposition that he now be sworn in. 
    The speaker based this ruling, Mr. Justice White upon the Precedents of the House and contrary to what Judge Bromley had said, the Precedents of the House are full and clear on this question and they start with the case which is most famous in American history. 
    The case of Matthew Lyon in the Fifth Congress which Congressman Lyon was convicted under the Alien and Sedition Act and a motion was made to expel him before the House. 
    The House then composed of gentlemen who had participated in the framing of the Constitution. 
    For we debated the issue and came to the conclusion that the House had no constitutional power whatsoever to expel, and mind you, this is under the Expulsion Clause not Exclusion Clause 
    No constitutional power to expel a member for alleged acts occurring prior to his election and in full the Annals of Congress point out that the fundamental reason was the very same reason which Madison and Hamilton advanced. 
    And that is that the ultimate tribunal and to the fitness of a member is not the Congress of the United States but the tribunal it's fitness of a member is his constituency is the people of the United States, the people he represents. 
    The President of the Matthew Lyon case has been followed fully and completely, never deviated once in the five cases on expulsion in the history of the House and for the convenience of the Court, we have set them out info in our reply brief pages 18 through 23. 
    And just as so that there would be no question about that whatsoever, the official historian of the House, Mr. Galloway says in this history of the House of Representative, he concluded that I quote, “In general the House has been dubious of its power to punish members for offenses committed before their election.” 
    Now, it turn --

    Yes.

    Well It is quoted in many of your briefs.

    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    That ruling is referred to in our brief, in our reply brief. 
    It is not set forth in full. 
    It is in the official document set forth info.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6198.432" stopTime="6199.830">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6199.830" stopTime="6201.454">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What is the citation?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6201.454" stopTime="6215.439">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    The citation is January 3rd Congressional Record 1969, H14. 
    Now, I would like to address myself to the next question --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6215.439" stopTime="6217.829">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    19 what?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6217.829" stopTime="6275.926">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    1969. 
    I would like to address myself now to the -- that question advance that this Court has no power under the Speech or Debate Clause. 
    Now, I find that argument rather surprising in light of the decisions of this Court itself. 
    This Court has held from the beginning that the Speech or Debate Clause and these are called discussing fully with the Court in the Eastland case last term has held that the clause was designed to protect legislators and legitimate legislative business from criminal or civil sanctions. 
    There are no criminal or civil sanctions involved in this case. 
    But more fundamentally, in Kilbourn against Thompson which is the founding head of all teaching of this Court on the Speech or Debate Clause.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6275.926" stopTime="6276.412">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Kinoy.
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6276.412" stopTime="6276.952">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6276.952" stopTime="6284.211">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let me get something straight here, did the Speaker of the House in 1967, was that when the exclusion took place?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6284.211" stopTime="6297.734">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    Yes. 
    He made a ruling there too Mr. Justice White and I make that very clear. 
    The ruling in March of 1967 was that the matter before the House was an exclusion and not an expulsion.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6297.734" stopTime="6304.642">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now I understand that. 
    But did he at that time say refer to anything at all about expulsion? 
    Except to say it was --
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6304.642" stopTime="6307.147">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    Except two-thirds vote. 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6307.147" stopTime="6311.259">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    They didn't so it was only in 1969 that he referred to the precedents then --
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6311.259" stopTime="6401.328">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    Correct, Mr. Justice White. 
    That's absolutely correct. 
    Now in Kilbourn itself, the Court held that the resolution of the House of Representatives then before the Court was unconstitutional and void, and held it directly and the relief that flowed from that was the relief which was directed toward this Sergeant at Arms of the House. 
    So, that in the very case which the respondents rely on which supposedly deprives this Court of its historic power of judicial review over actions of the legislature when those actions transcend constitutional boundaries in that very case. 
    This Court did precisely what we are asking the Court to do here and that is declare a resolution of the House of Representatives unconstitutional. 
    Now, this was no minor question. 
    This reflected the understanding of the court that the Speech or Debate Clause does not repeal Marbury-Madison. 
    The Speech or Debate Clause was known to the Chief Justice when that decision was handed down. 
    The Speech or Debate Clause simply has nothing to do with this case whatsoever, nothing whatsoever.

    Is that the one -- is that the one that stated that and considering this was condition of the Constitution, how that could be exercise to do something to a man was the least possible power adequate to the (Inaudible)?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6427.267" stopTime="6603.546">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    That's right Your Honor. 
    That's precisely the case that stated that. 
    I respectfully would bring this to the attention of the Court. 
    The analysis of the Constitution which the respondents have presented here today is -- has one fundamental flaw in it. 
    The fundamental flaw is that it is simply not the analysis of Hamilton and Madison. 
    It is simply not the analysis of the founding fathers and what I find extraordinary in that height is that the proposition is urged before this Court that the legislative power which the British Parliament asserted in the Wilkes case. 
    One of the most central and decisive causes of our revolution that this power is the power which is the respondents seek to sustain their action upon. 
    I never would have expected that the Wilkes case would once again be argued in an American Court. 
    Now I have to say one thing, I think it is outrageous that before this Court assertions are made that the petitioner was guilty of certain acts that the petitioner never denied his guilt of certain acts. 
    The record has it an ounce of evidence of that and then, I want to make is very clear. 
    We did not boycott those hearings. 
    Mr. Bromley was not there. 
    We were there and the petitioner was there, and we asserted our constitutional position which we had every right to assert before that House. 
    More than that, I think it is not proper that the respondents make the statements they do about petitioner when the chairman of this committee itself, Mr. Hayes. 
    On January 3rd of this year said, that the findings of his committee were not judicially ascertained and that he was satisfied that no inference could be drawn from those because a federal grand jury had not seen fit to indict the petitioner. 
    I think it's improper to make the statements about petitioner which were made.

    You said that he made his position clear before the committee?

    Yes, Justice Black.

    What did he say?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6610.955" stopTime="6649.146">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    We said before the committee that the Congress had the power on the question of seating a member to inquire into the constitutional qualifications as set forth in the Constitution, we would give evidence as to those qualifications we did. 
    We testified, the petitioner testified and we put in documentary evidence as to the existence of the three constitutional qualifications for membership. 
    We said that House had no power under the Constitution to go beyond that question and that was the position we took before the Select Committee.

    If they --

    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    All questions on the constitutional qualifications. 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6655.776" stopTime="6671.095">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    If the petitioner had been seated, there's no doubt is there that the House would have had power to punish him if it had so concluded so to do under the specific provision in the Constitution.
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6671.095" stopTime="6679.358">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    Justice Fortas, subject only to the constitutional mandate that they could not punish him for alleged acts occurring prior to his elect --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6679.358" stopTime="6681.237">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I understand that but the --
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6681.237" stopTime="6681.988">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    Otherwise --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6681.988" stopTime="6684.994">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In theory that constitutional power is clear?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6684.994" stopTime="6685.922">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6685.922" stopTime="6715.105">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And so that if the -- a proceeding to punish him had been brought in the same session of Congress in which allegedly acts, these acts were committed. 
    I'm talking about the acts relating to congressional funds. 
    There would have been no question as to the power of the House to punish subject to judicial review or not subject to judicial review as it might turn out, is that right?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6715.105" stopTime="6722.486">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    That's correct, subject to an adversary proceeding and the rights of the adversary proceeding, and subject to the limitations as I said before of the Constitution.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6722.486" stopTime="6737.518">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And also there had been no question as to power of the House and in appropriate case and by whatever procedure may be appropriate to expel a member, is there?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6737.518" stopTime="6738.808">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    That's absolutely right.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6738.808" stopTime="6758.054">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So that to considerable extent in a way, your submission to us depends in the first instance upon the distinction between the exclusion and the expulsion procedures or the exclusion and the punishment procedures.
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6758.054" stopTime="6787.158">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    Well, I would put it this way Your Honor. 
    Fundamentally, the constitutional argument, the constitutional position is the same. 
    If the expulsion power were used in affect to do what the House cannot do under the exclusion power that is to add a qualification to membership that would equally fall as unconstitutional.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6787.158" stopTime="6796.731">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Oh! 
    You're -- what you're saying is that the House can expel only because of the lack of these three specific called cases?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6796.731" stopTime="6814.459">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    No. 
    What I'm saying, the House can expel under the Punishment Clause for misbehavior which it's found within that session of the Congress subject of course to other limitations in the Constitution.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6814.459" stopTime="6846.933">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, why do you -- I've read your brief on the point that -- perhaps you'd tell -- tell me briefly, quickly now why you say that you have to take this problem session by session of the Congress or Congress by Congress? 
    That is to say that Congress -- you're position isn't Congress could not punish or expel for “x”, let's say disorderly behavior occurring in the preceding Congress by the same member?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6846.933" stopTime="6847.912">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6847.912" stopTime="6849.180">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And why is that?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6849.180" stopTime="6935.834">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    Well, the explanation for that I think was best put forward. 
    First one, it was never discussed in the House in the Matthew Lyons case. 
    An explanation was that this went to the fundamental principles of Representative Government because the founders were determined that under no guides whatsoever. 
    The House was the half power of overruling the choice of the people as to who would to be the representative. 
    Now as to unfitness or prior misbehavior, the House specifically discussed this in the Lyons case and said -- because there, they said it was the grossest misbehavior. 
    He was charge with among other things speeding at all the members of the House of Representatives, Matthew Lyons was. 
    And the House there said that it is a fundamental principle of American Representative Government that the Court of resort of last resort as to the fitness of a member is his constituency. 
    When an act is occurred prior to the election, the people have passed on it by electing him and the House may not overrule. 
    To allow the House to overrule it would be to open up the dangerous road which Madison talked of, of subverting the fundamental principles of the Constitution.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6935.834" stopTime="6944.066">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the fact is that in this case you would say that it -- that the Representative Powell could not have been expelled for the conduct that's involved in this case.
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6944.066" stopTime="6945.143">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    I would say that. 
    Yes, Your Honor --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6945.143" stopTime="6947.243">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because -- because of the time of its occurrence?
speaker="arthur_kinoy" startTime="6947.243" stopTime="7023.725">
    Mr. Arthur Kinoy 
    That's right. 
    I think the constitutional provisions are very clear and the Precedents of the House are very clear on that. 
    Finally, I would like to just point out to the Court that in essence, the respondents' position is a challenge to the role of this Court as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, that the short answer to the respondents' entire argument can be put no better than Chief Justice Marshall put it in Marbury against Madison. 
    That it is for the judiciary to say what is the law and that is the meaning of a written Constitution. 
    And to argue a doctrine which says that the legislature can transcend the boundaries placed in the Constitution is to subvert the very meaning of a written Constitution. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
