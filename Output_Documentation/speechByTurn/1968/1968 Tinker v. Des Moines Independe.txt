    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is similar in some respects to the decision and the case of result and decision in Epperson versus Arkansas which the Court decided just this morning. 
    The case is here on certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
    One major distinction between Epperson and this case is that this case involves the right of public school students other than public school faculty members to exercise expressions of their opinions in a non-disruptive way in the school. 
    Case began in the United States --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, this is not a religious establishment case here?
speaker="dan_l_johnston" startTime="59.126" stopTime="397.848">
    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    No, it's not Your Honor. 
    It's a First Amendment free speech case in the sense of expression of views rather than a worship or establishment cases. 
    The case began as a petition for injunction and nominal damages under 42 United States Code 1983 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. 
    That court dismissed the petition and on appeal to the Circuit -- the decision was split 4 to 4. 
    Conduct of the students essentially was this, that Christmas time in 1965 they decided that they would wear small black armbands to express certain views which they had in regard to the war in Vietnam. 
    Specifically, the views were that they mourn the dead of both sides, both civilian and military in that war and they supported the proposal that have made by United States Senator Robert Kennedy that the truce which had been proposed for that war over the Christmas period be made an open ended or an indefinite truce. 
    This was the purpose that the students gave for wearing the armbands during this period. 
    During the period of time of course, there were school days and they wore the armbands to school. 
    Prior to the time when any of these petitioners wore the armbands to school, it came to the attention of the school authorities that perhaps there would be some students who would express views related to the war in Vietnam in this manner during school time. 
    The principles of the secondary schools, the high schools and perhaps the junior high schools in the City of Des Moines, a public school system met prior to the time in any of the armbands have been worn and enacted policy which was not written but which was agreed upon among themselves that no student could wear an armband in the Des Moines public school system for this purpose that if a student came to school wearing the armband he would be asked to remove it. 
    Failing that, the student's parents would be contacted and their assistance would be solicited in getting the students to remove the armbands. 
    Failing that, the students would be set home would be in effect suspended from school until such time as they were willing to return to school without the armbands. 
    The three students who are petitioner in this case, Christopher Eckhardt who was 16 and in the 10th grade of Roosevelt High School in Des Moines at the time, John Tinker who was 15 and in the 11th grade at another high school, Mary Beth Tinker who was 13 and in the 8th grade determined that in spite of the policy that have been announced to the schools that they would wear the armbands as a matter of conscience to express the views that they have. 
    Christopher Eckhardt and Mary Beth Tinker wore theirs on the first day. 
    Mr. Eckhardt went to school have the armband on but knowing of the policy against the wearing of the armbands because as I say it's been announced. 
    He went quite immediately to the office of the principal and said, “I'm wearing the armband, I know that it is a violation of the school policy.” 
    The principal carried out the dictates of the policy which were to tell the student to remove it. 
    The student said, he could not in good conscience remove the armband but he thought he had a right to wear. 
    The student's mother was called and she supported her son in the activity and then young Mr. Eckhardt was suspended from school. 
    He was out of school approximately six days or five days prior to the Christmas vacation and then one day after the Christmas vacation. 
    Mary Beth Tinker also wore her armband on that first day. 
    However, she wore it throughout the entire morning without any incident related to it and any way disrupted the school or distracted. 
    She wore it at lunch and she wore it where there was by the way some conversation between herself and other students in the lunch room about why she was wearing the armband and whether or not she should be wearing it. 
    And then wore it into the first class in the afternoon and it was in the first class in the afternoon that she was called to the office and the procedure was followed for contacting her parents apparently asking her to remove it and she did remove the armband and then returned to class. 
    However, in spite of the fact that she had removed the armband and returned and was returned to class, she was later called out of class and suspended nevertheless. 
    John Tinker determined that it was his belief that the armband should not be worn in open violation of the policy that the schools had adopted until some attempts have been made to try to reach an accommodation with the school board. 
    So, on the first day, John Tinker did not wear the armbands to school rather in the evening of the day when Mr. Eckhardt and John's sister Mary Beth were suspended from school, he with some other students who had worn the armbands attempted to contact the superintendent of the -- not superintendent, excuse me, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the school at the morning of public schools and they requested that he calls special meeting of the board of directors, the school board as we call it for the purpose of tying to reach an accommodation between the students, the desire of the students and the policy enacted by the principals of the school. 
    They were refused this special meeting of the school board and then on the next day, Friday, John Tinker wore his armband to school, wore throughout the morning hours without any untoward incident, without any substantial or material disruption to the school. 
    He wore at lunch where there was again some discussion about it in a period it's generally free and open for discussion among students. 
    And then wore into the first class in the afternoon where he was suspended.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Physically, it wouldn't make a noise, it wouldn't cause a commotion but don't you think it would cause some people to direct their attention of the armband in Vietnam War and think about that rather than what they were thinking about -- supposed be thinking about in the classroom?
speaker="dan_l_johnston" startTime="540.753" stopTime="550.627">
    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    I think perhaps Your Honor, it might for a few moments have done that and I think it perhaps might have distracted some students just as many other things do in the classroom which are allowed from time to time. 
    I think it might --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="550.627" stopTime="555.784">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But which this school is permitted to forbid?
speaker="dan_l_johnston" startTime="555.784" stopTime="572.820">
    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    But which the school also allows to continue. 
    I don't think there's any suggestion that the school attempts to regulate all sorts of things that might be distractive especially in a sense of these -- of this type of activity which probably contribute something to the total atmosphere in the school for them to stress.

    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    The situation I think and the problem we have is this specific regulation directed only toward one specific kind of conduct. 
    Now, there is in the record, document called at which was defendant's exhibit 3 in the trial which is a broad statement of policy by the school are related to things that disrupt, related to disrupting conduct. 
    The difficulty we have with this particular policy as it was enacted is that there was no indication, no testimony by teachers, by administrators or any one else of any reason to believe that it would be disruptive. 
    And when the students in fact did wear the armbands, the record quite clearly shows that it was not in fact disruptive. 
    That the -- and I believe it's interesting --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think that a narrow, a narrower regulation it says that you may not wear armbands or buttons or placards in the classroom would be sustainable under First Amendment?

speaker="dan_l_johnston" startTime="716.735" stopTime="723.921">
    Mr. Dan L. Johnston

    They did wear it in class.

    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    The suggestion, I believe we're making Your Honor is that there should not be any special rule for freedom of expression cases for schools. 
    Now, that would mean that the general Terminiello the type of response that the state first has an obligation to try to move directly against the -- those causing the disruption rather than to take away the First Amendment right to free expression would apply also. 
    But again, we don't reach that in this case because there are just simply is not that kind of evidence in the record.

    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    Or as the Fifth Circuit in two cases, Burnside versus Byars seems to indicate and Blackhall versus Isoqueena, Byars case cited in our brief, a material and substantial disruption to the schools would justify perhaps the subordination of freedom of expression.

    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    Well, the facts of the Terminiello case are not necessary applicable to the classroom with the kind of test and the thing, Your Honor, that we've been trying to do with in this case since the trial was is the concept that wholly special rules -- wholly special doctrines for some reason should be applied to the First Amendment law in schools.

    Well, is there any evidence of that in this record?
speaker="dan_l_johnston" startTime="961.846" stopTime="1017.296">
    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    Your Honor, there's none. 
    As I say there was a discussion from time to time at the cafeteria at lunch. 
    There was some discussion in the halls, there is and I'm frank to say when John Tinker wore the armband in the first hour they were engaged in the class which was a free discussion type of class. 
    The instructor of the class was outside the room and he was asked during that period about the armband and he did explain to the students why he wore it. 
    We are urging upon the Court the concept that especially in the public schools which is this Court recognized this morning in Arkansas case as it is recognized many times before that it's important that the idea of freedom of dissent and inquiry and expression be maintained in the schools and that there are certainly is nothing in this record which indicates that the sufficient amount -- sufficient quantum of evidence to overcome that presumption.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1017.296" stopTime="1051.065">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    As I understand I want to be very clear about this, in response to my Brother White's question. 
    If the record showed that the wearing of the armbands significantly or substantially a material whatever is the right word interfered with the business of the classroom that is communication between teachers and students, then you would say that disciplinary action would be justified?
speaker="dan_l_johnston" startTime="1051.065" stopTime="1122.932">
    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    I think we can take that position. 
    I would like to make a distinction, if I may, between the -- an expression of an opinion which might itself disrupt the class and the expression of an opinion which might cause someone else to disrupt the class. 
    And I believe those are perhaps two separate cases. 
    I also like to make a distinction between the expression of an opinion which is coupled with something else, like marching in the hallway or standing up in the class and making a speech about the war in Vietnam during mathematics class. 
    That kind of thing, I think the Court can prohibit, but we are in a situation here where the record just simply doesn't support that kind of a situation. 
    Rather it supports the idea that before anyone wore armband really on the basis of pure conjecture that the policy was adopted frankly for the purpose and the administrators and the teachers say this over and over again, it was the principle of the demonstration, the idea of expressing political beliefs that they were opposed to in this context. 
    And that the students were suspended for violating that policy and not suspended for causing any disruption in the classroom.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1122.932" stopTime="1143.391">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose the state passed a law applying a ban on black armbands for protest purposes, across the board, so that it would be applied in the private schools as well, would that be constitutional?
speaker="dan_l_johnston" startTime="1143.391" stopTime="1191.200">
    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    I think that would probably Your Honor interfere with some earlier decisions of this Court probably in regard to the right of individuals of citizens to establish private schools and so long as they meet the accreditation standards to educate their children as they see fit. 
    I believe that's probably a different kind of situation from what we have here. 
    The situation here, as I view it, is based not so much upon the conduct of the students, whether or not it was permissible but the conduct of the state whether or not the conduct of the state was permissible. 
    Whether or not where we have a situation of pure expression and nothing else which was no evidence of any material or substantial disruption of any public interest, whether or not in that situation the state can move to subordinate and to punish freedom of expression.

   Argument of Allan A. Herrick

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Herrick.
speaker="allan_a_herrick" startTime="1630.650" stopTime="1821.708">
    Mr. Allan A. Herrick 
    Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices. 
    The respondents believe that there are two basic issues involved here. 
    The first, the school administrators are school boards have to wait from until violence, disorder and disruption break out and scholarly discipline of the school is disrupted or may they acted when in good faith in their reasonable discretion and judgment, disorder and disruption of scholarly atmosphere of the schoolroom will result unless they act firmly and properly. 
    The second issue it seems to me is that this Court must determine how far it wants to go under the constitutional amendments for free speech in reviewing every decision of every school district made in good faith in its reasonable discretion and judgment as necessary to maintain order and scholarly discipline atmosphere within the classroom. 
    The third issue, might be added, are disturbances or threatened disturbances in the schools to be measured by identical standards with disturbances or threaten disturbances on the streets. 
    Now, it's the position of the respondents that the decision of the school administration and of the school board made in good faith under the circumstances existing when that decision was made was the reasonable exercise of discretion on the part of school authorities and did not deprive petitioners of their constitutional right of free speech. 
    Now, this Court has held that freedom of speech including of course the right of demonstration is not an absolute right to be exercised regardless of time or place. 
    I'm sure it isn't necessary to quote to this Court its own decisions but a case of Adderley versus the State of Florida seems particularly pertinent, where the students went from the university to the jail grounds to protest the arrest of students who had been arrested the day before and their claim was --

    Mr. Allan A. Herrick 
    Well, if the Court please, I think the question there is and gets back to the first issue that I undertook in the states. 
    Does the school if we have an aroused community have to wait until disruption occurs or may it act to prevent it?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1974.329" stopTime="1979.126">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, the school system was aroused? 
    Where is that in the record?
speaker="allan_a_herrick" startTime="1979.126" stopTime="2193.452">
    Mr. Allan A. Herrick 
    I think I can point that out, if the Court please. 
    In the background of this case, in November of 1965, the petitioner, Christopher Eckhardt with his mother who was president of the Des Moines Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, had come to Washington D.C. to participate with the students for Democratic Society, Dr. Spock and others in the march, which I'm sure this Court is familiar with from the White House to the Washington Monument. 
    Now, that was in November I think about Thanksgiving holiday. 
    On Saturday, December 11, 1965 following this march, a group which included students related to the students for a Democratic Society and some adults met at the Eckhardt home and one of the proposals that developed this meeting was the wearing of these black armbands. 
    None of these petitioners were present. 
    Now, as the trial court said and this is on page 73 of the appendix, the last paragraph, that Vietnam War and the involvement of the United States therein has been a subject of a major controversy for some time. 
    When the armband regulation involved herein was promulgated, debate over the Vietnam War had become vehement in many localities. 
    A protest march against the war had recently been held in Washington D.C. 
    A wave of draft card burning incidents protesting the war had swept the country. 
    At that time, two highly publicized draft card burning cases were pending in this Court both individual supporting the war and those opposing it were quite vocal in expressing their views. 
    This was demonstrated during the school board's hearing on the armband regulation. 
    And that appears also in the record, I think some 200 had gathered who were many of them are outsiders at the time of the school board hearing. 
    This hearing the school board voted in support of the rule prohibiting the wearing of the black -- wearing of armbands in school premises. 
    It is against this background. 
    The Court must review the reasonableness of the regulation. 
    Now, this is the background that faced the superintendent of schools. 
    This thing had become a matter through the press and through the community and the superintendent directed Doctor Peterson who was the director of secondary education, to call a meeting of the principals on December 14, 1965. 
    And with this background and at this meeting, their principals in the good faith, using their discretion in best judgment decided that to maintain discipline and avoid disruption, the wearing of the armbands in the schoolroom should not be permitted.

    Mr. Allan A. Herrick 
    I think, Your Honor, that the correct answer of that is free discussion in the classroom is always permitted, always has been if they want to come in and discuss these matters. 
    But the question of imposing on a captive audience moving in with an armband when it's known through the press, through the community, through the things that have happened here that the community is inflamed might disrupt the orderly conduct of schools.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Seventy-two.
speaker="allan_a_herrick" startTime="2385.932" stopTime="2503.963">
    Mr. Allan A. Herrick 
    Yes. 
    The question which must now be determined is whether the action of the officials of the defendant school district forbidding the wearing of armbands on school facilities deprive the plaintiffs of constitutional rights secured by the Freedom of Speech Clause of the First Amendment. 
    And an individual's right of free speech is protected against infringement by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Gitlow versus New York, 268 U.S. 652. 
    The wearing of an armband for the purpose of expressing certain views is a symbolic act and falls within the protection of the First Amendment Free Speech Clause, West Virginia State Board of Education versus Barnette. 
    However, the protections of that clause are not absolute. 
    The abridgment of speech by state regulation must also -- always be considered in terms of the object, the regulation is attempting to accomplish and the abridgment of speech that actually occurs. 
    In each case, the courts must ask whether the gravity of the evil discounted by its improbability justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid danger. 
    Officials of the defendant's school district have the responsibility for maintaining a scholarly, disciplined atmosphere within the classroom. 
    These officials not only have a right, they have an obligation to prevent anything which might be disruptive for such an atmosphere. 
    Unless the actions of school boards -- officials in this connection are unreasonable, the Court should not interfere. 
    Now does that answer what Your Honor had in mind?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2503.963" stopTime="2505.204">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, that's what I had in mind.
speaker="allan_a_herrick" startTime="2505.204" stopTime="2742.121">
    Mr. Allan A. Herrick 
    Now, in this case, counsel has already referred to the fact. 
    Christopher Eckhardt went to Roosevelt high school wearing the black armband. 
    He is the one as I have stated with his mother have been down here on the march. 
    They came back and they had the meeting at which he didn't attend. 
    Adults held the meeting. 
    When Christopher came to school he was asked by a student if he knew there was a rule against wearing the armband that he said he did and he went directly to the principal's office in defiance of the rule because, as he said, he thought they might suspend him. 
    Now, Mr. Blackmun who was the vice principal asked Christopher to remove the armband and he refused. 
    Now, after considerable discussion, Mr. Blackmun finally called Christopher's mother and told her that he would have to suspend Christopher for wearing the armband and of refusing to abide by the school's regulation. 
    And Mrs. Eckhardt's reply was that Christopher had a constitutional right to wear the armband. 
    Now, the other two petitioners, John F. Tinker and Mary Beth Tinker bring this action by their father Reverend Leonard Tinker who is Secretary for Peace and Education of the American Friend's Service Committee. 
    And I think it of some significance here. 
    I don't in any sense feel that it is controlling the constitutional right exists you've got, period. 
    But Paul Tinker who was eight years old went to school with a black armband, Hope Tinker who was 11 years old went to school with a black armband, and the petitioner Mary Beth Tinker who was 13 went to school with a black armband. 
    John Tinker is 15, he went to school of a black armband. 
    Now Reverend Tinker testified that he had to support them in what he considered the exercise of their conscience and their own constitutional rights. 
    Now, respondents do not question that the Students for a Democratic Society or that Reverend Tinker as the Secretary for Peach and Education of the Friend's Society or Mrs. Eckhardt as the local President of the International League for Peace and Freedom are entitled to express their views under their constitutional right of free speech. 
    But the point is not at every time, not at every place and particularly not under the circumstances that existed in this case, not in the schoolroom at a time when it might result in disruption and might even result in violence. 
    Now, in substance if we understand the petitioner's position in this case it is that the school officials are powerless to act until the disruption occurs. 
    Respondents believe that should not be the rule. 
    Sometimes per an ounce of prevention is a lot better than a pound of cure and I think subsequent history of such activities about the judgment of the school officials in their discretion.

    What page?
speaker="allan_a_herrick" startTime="2876.366" stopTime="2904.562">
    Mr. Allan A. Herrick 
    That would be on page 18 of the appendix. 
    It really starts possibly on the first page. 
    He went to the first two classes. 
    He didn't think the instructor saw it and he said, he sat in the back of a class, I believe, in the second class which was 10:30 before noon and he didn't think any body saw it. 
    And he said, that's in the bottom of page of --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2904.562" stopTime="2906.413">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Didn't think that he saw it?
speaker="allan_a_herrick" startTime="2906.413" stopTime="3020.430">
    Mr. Allan A. Herrick 
    Saw the black armband, that's correct, because he sat in the back of a class. 
    Then he went to gym class and he said that on the way to gym class, there wasn't any discussion. 
    There was hardly no one around. 
    That's the way it's stated here. 
    “After gym class, some of the students were making fun of me for wearing it. 
    Others who were my friends made remarks in the locker room that were not very friendly. 
    After others who are my friends said, they didn't want me to get in trouble.” 
    Two or three boys made remarks in the locker room, I beg your pardon, it was that part I'm repeating. 
    “This lasted perhaps three or four meetings. 
    They did not threaten me with any physical harm after gym class, I had half an hour for lunch. 
    I ate lunch in the student's center with several other students with who I meet frequently. 
    These people warned me in a friendly manner to take the armband off. 
    There was one student whom I had a feud in the 7th grade who was making smart remarks for about 10 minutes. 
    There were four or five people with him standing milling around. 
    There were quite a few other students standing and milling around the lunchroom. 
    To my knowledge, there were no threats to hit me or anything like that. 
    At no time was I in fear that they might attack me or hit in the student center because there were too many people there.” 
    Now, it was right after lunch, the exposure we frankly concede here on the matter of disruption was very brief because here Christopher Eckhardt went to the principal's office and this to have about given you what happened to John Tinker. 
    But he said he want --

    Mr. Allan A. Herrick 
    No, not at all, Your Honor. 
    I think the rule that maybe I can express, I think there's an Arkansas case that I have referred to that expresses what we feel should be the rule and this is in the respondent's brief on page 28. 
    And this again was a case where the plaintiff was suspended from school for violating a school rule forbidding the use of paint -- face paint and cosmetics. 
    And she brought the mandamus to require her admission to school notwithstanding her refusal to obey the rule.

    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    Thank you Your Honor. 
    I would just like to point out, may it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice, one of the things which I believe it's been mentioned but needs to be mentioned more firmly and that was that there was in the school no general prohibition against political emblems of this nature.

speaker="dan_l_johnston" startTime="3849.382" stopTime="3895.880">
    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    It gives them the power to do, yes Your Honor. 
    But I, the point I'm -- I'd like to impress upon the Court this time is on pages 44 and 50 and 51 of the record. 
    It's very amply stated by respondents that other kinds of political insignia including the iron cross were worn in the schools that they were not covered by this policy, that there was no policy covering them, that it was simply this one policy against the wearing of the armbands in this context. 
    Now, counsel indicates that there was some sort of explosive situation which made this as a special circumstance. 
    I can't of course recite to the record to prove a negative. 
    I can just simply say that I don't believe that the record supports that kind of a situation.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3895.880" stopTime="3905.553">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    Yes, Your Honor it is but our point is that the rule is not valid.

    That's right.

    -- and because it's based solely upon a Fourteenth Amendment alone type stand of reasonableness. 
    And this Court --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3917.732" stopTime="3937.155">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But I must say I agree to some of the implication of my Brother Fortas about that reasonableness rule. 
    I don't think that case has been cited approvingly in many, many years. 
    And I think the Court was very careful to say this morning that it wasn't citing that case to allow.
speaker="dan_l_johnston" startTime="3937.155" stopTime="3993.388">
    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    Well, for instance in the case of -- in the Barnette case which we've cited in the brief which was the case of the compulsory flag salute. 
    This Court specifically said that mere Fourteenth Amendment test of reasonableness are not sufficient in the schools when the students are engaged in something or where the conduct involves something that's privilege under the First Amendment. 
    That's the suggestion we have here. 
    Now, the reasons for the school board establishing the regulation are set out in page 70 of the record at quite some length by a document promulgated by the school board itself. 
    Counsel referred to them, those reasons which were by the way passed or at least reduced the paper after the suspensions in a week after the suspensions. 
    Simply to my reading of the decisions of this Court do not provide sufficient grounds for the subordination of freedom of expression. 
    Now, --

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. Dan L. Johnston 
    In addition to the other argument that I want to make and that is -- and I believe the stronger argument is not the equal protection argument, not the censorship by discrimination argument Mr. Justice Black has called it. 
    But as a matter of fact the stronger argument is that the interest of the state sought to protect whatever that may have been it's set out on page 70 of the record simply was not sufficient where as it might have been sufficient to justify the suppression of something it was privileged under the First Amendment.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4055.722" stopTime="4072.401">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, now you have the real interest that the state is trying to protect is the right of the state authorities and the teachers to ran the schools and establish the rules for teaching rather than the pupils.
