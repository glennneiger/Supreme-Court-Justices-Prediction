Federal Marine Terminals, Inc. v. Burnside Shipping Company

    Mr. John W. Hough 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    One Gordon McNeill, stevedore employee of the petitioner, Federal Marine Terminals Inc. fell into the number 3 deep tank of the vessel Otterburn owned by the respondent on June 2, 1965 and was killed. 
    Thereafter, his widow filed a wrongful death action against the vessel owners. 
    In a separate action the vessel owners, Burnside Shipping Company, the respondent filed an action under the Ryan Stevedoring doctrine seeking indemnification of -- the amounts which they had to pay to the widow. 
    In a counterclaim of this petitioner, petitioner sought to bring a direct action against the vessel, the petitioner being a stevedoring contractor and thought to recover all the damages that it was exposed to under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act which had a potential total liability of $70,000.00. 
    That counterclaim was dismissed upon the motion of the respondent in the District Court. 
    The -- this vessel was affirmed in the Seventh Circuit. 
    We are here on the limited question and we submit to this Court that the question is, is there a contract, stevedoring contract implied in fact running directly between the vessel owner and the stevedoring contractor? 
    And we submit the corollary question fairly encompassed within that issue is, does the Longshoremen's and the Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, acts as a shield to the vessel owner to isolate the vessel owner from any liability directly against the stevedoring contractor?

    The charterer is not in control of the vessel. 
    It's controlled in the control -- since this insofar as before this Court, it was an unwritten contract. 
    And the time charterer only controls where the vessel is going, not the crew or the operation of the vessel by its crew, the crew being under the control of the vessel owner.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="369.853" stopTime="391.282">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume -- if because of some negligence of the one in control of the ship, certain equipment of the stevedore which is brought on the ship is damaged along with an employee of the stevedore, certainly the stevedore might in tort be able to recover for damages for the equipment, wouldn't it?
speaker="john_w_hough" startTime="391.282" stopTime="835.500">
    Mr. John W. Hough 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But that is not the instant case before this Court. 
    We suggest and urge to this Court that the Ryan Stevedoring Company case in 1956 established that there was a stevedoring contract even though unwritten which was implied in fact. 
    Under the stevedoring contract, certain duties were owed by the stevedoring contractor directly to the vessel owner. 
    If a violation of those duties by the stevedoring contractor and the very essence of that duty having been defined in that case as being the proper performance of the stevedoring contract either offloading or unloading the cargo, if there be a violation of those duties, the vessel owner could recover complete indemnification from the stevedoring contractor for any amount that the vessel owner became obligated to pay to the -- to an employee of the stevedoring contractor who was injured aboard the vessel. 
    That case focused on side of that relationship.The duties owed by stevedoring contractor to the vessel owner. 
    It also stated that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act did not preclude the vessel owner from being sued by the employee of the stevedoring contractor under a tort theory. 
    And the stevedoring of the vessel owner turning around if there was a judgment against him by the stevedore and recovering the full amount of that judgment directly from the stevedoring contractor based on a breach of contract theory, the -- this Court announced in that decision that the tort theory was not to be confused with the contract theory that the action by the vessel owner against the stevedoring contractor was directly based on contract and not any tort theory. 
    We read in the Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company case in 1958, the warning announced by this Court that the vessel owner can be precluded from recovering directly from the stevedore contractor if there might be conduct on its part to preclude such recovery. 
    This Court did not go further to define what that might be. 
    In 1959, in Hugev versus Dampskisaktieselskabet International, the District Court which was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit and certiorari was denied by this Court. 
    The District Court announced what the duties of the vessel owner were under the stevedoring contract even though it be unwritten stating that these were implied in fact. 
    In essence these duties were to provide a reasonable, reasonably safe place to work and to give warning of any latent danger. 
    These duties we have quoted in length in our brief and I briefly summarize them but in essence those are the duties. 
    In the Hugev case, because the stevedoring contractor knew of a violation of these duties by the vessel owner and thereafter assumed the risk, recovery was denied. 
    But these duties were thoroughly announced in that case. 
    We -- in the Hugev case, there was a statement that the stevedoring contractor does not board the vessel at its own peril. 
    The owner does not turn over to the stevedoring contractor a vessel. 
    In any condition, we submit to this Court that there must be a reasonable time where the stevedoring contractor to inspect that vessel and to discover and correct any false in that vessel that might exist. 
    If this ship owner can turnover to the stevedoring contractor a vessel in any condition, be there exports or otherwise which are misplaced for a week, then we suggest this would encourage willful and wanton misconduct because under the Ryan doctrine, the stevedoring contractor has almost an absolute liability for indemnification to the vessel owner.

    Against the shipowner?
speaker="john_w_hough" startTime="1247.424" stopTime="1555.518">
    Mr. John W. Hough 
    Against the shipowner and the stevedoring contractor had sought indemnification. 
    And was prohibited from it due to the fact that they had assumed the risk but in the Hugev case and we have set forth in out opening brief the duties that the vessel owner owes directly to the stevedoring contractor. 
    The -- in the Hugev case, the court decided there was a contractor relationship directly between the vessel owner and the stevedoring contractor even though unwritten. 
    This Court has said that in the Ryan case to. 
    But this Court has never asked upon the question of the duties flowing from the vessel owner to the stevedoring contractor. 
    Was never announced though, that's only been announced below and certiorari has been denied here -- in that case. 
    Now, it was held by the Seventh Circuit that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act isolated the vessel owner from all liability directly to the stevedoring contractor. 
    That case, the decision rendered by the Seventh Circuit went further to state that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is the source of all remedies existent to the stevedoring contractor against the vessel owner. 
    We submit to this Court that that is far beyond the intendments of the Act. 
    Section 904 (a) imposes on the stevedoring contractor a liability without fault. 
    Taking away from the employee his common law liability and giving him a quid pro quo. 
    Section 904 (b) provides that the liability of the stevedoring employee -- employer is the exclusive liability to a certain class, namely the stevedore and all persons claiming under and through him. 
    However, Section 933 (i) of the Act warns that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act only applies to this class of people. 
    It does not go further. 
    The basic provision and reason for the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was to replace the common law liability which was only possible with an absolute liability which was completely without fault but a liability in a lesser -- a liability by the stevedoring contractor to his employees in a -- result from a lesser liability. 
    The Act we submit has no bearing whatsoever on the relationship between the stevedoring contractor and the vessel owner. 
    True, there is a right to subrogation by the stevedoring contractor to the claims of his employees against third-party tort. 
    These are under Section 933 (b) prior to the Ryan case, it was mandatory. 
    Perhaps the dissenting opinion in the Ryan case caused Congress to change its mind and amend it so that now only if the person on -- who is entitled to compensation under the Act commences an action against a third-party within that six months after an award of compensation is the action assigned.

    Mr. Paul McCambridge 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would first direct my answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's inquiry about whether the vessel was in time charter or whether the owner was had entered into some contractual relationship with the stevedore. 
    The answer is in the record. 
    There was an allegation in the liability that the -- it's on -- it's on page 5 of the appendix and it's paragraph 7 of the liable in which we alleged that the work of the respondent was being performed pursuant to agreement between the respondent and the time charter the vessel, Federal Commerce and Navigation Company Limited, a corporation affiliated with the respondent. 
    And then on page 9 of appendix that allegation in the liable is admitted so I don't -- there's too much question that the vessel was under time charter and certainly that leads us right into -- immediately one of the principal contentions that we make to this Court. 
    And that which that there is no affirmative contract between the stevedore and the petitioner or -- I'm sorry, the stevedore and the shipowner and that therefore there -- absent a contractual relationship certainly there cannot be any implied duties running from the shipowner to the stevedore.

    Mr. Paul McCambridge 
    No sir. 
    Doesn't matter to me. 
    The judgment were deferred. 
    We maintain that in this field of indemnity in Longshoreman personal injury cases, indemnity as between a shipowner and a stevedore can be predicated only upon a contract theory of warranty. 
    Now the stevedores counterclaim in -- for indemnity is premised entirely upon what we considered to be tortuous conduct of the shipowner which we say is not -- they are duties that arise by virtue of any contractual relationships. 
    These are duties which exist irrespective of any contractual relationship between the shipowner and a stevedore. 
    The petitioner's counterclaim essentially has been changed. 
    The -- Mr. Hough has mentioned to the court now that he is -- looking only for a reasonably safe place for his stevedore employees to work. 
    However the counterclaim itself specifically says it is based upon a purported duty owed by the shipowner to the stevedore to furnish a safe place to work. 
    Now, this duty to furnish a safe place to work is clearly a duty owed to the individual longshoreman working onboard the boat -- onboard the ship. 
    It's the -- if the species of liability that was enunciated without thought. 
    It was enunciated by this Court in Sieracki.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Wouldn't there?
speaker="paul_mccambridge" startTime="2080.384" stopTime="2488.559">
    Mr. Paul McCambridge 
    Because this is a duty generally owed to everyone. 
    This duty to exercise ordinary care which is spoken of by the petitioner and the duty to warn of a hidden defect, these are tort obligations and this Court in Ryan admonished that in ascertaining a shipowner's liabilities and his responsibilities that resort may not be had to principals of quasi contract or to principles of tort liability. 
    Mr. Justice White, you addressed yourself to the question what duties are owed to and when it comes aboard a ship. 
    And I think it was -- but that question was put to rest in the Kermarec that the shipowner owes the duties to use ordinary care and to warn of hidden defects. 
    He owes these to all persons who are lawfully aboard his vessel. 
    Therefore, it is clear I believe, it's obvious that is are not duties arising by virtue of contract but that they are independently owed duties and they're tort duties. 
    Now the shipowner of the -- pardon me, the stevedore has brought his counterclaim alleging that he has a independent cause of action against this -- against the shipowner under contract and separate from the action which is given him under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. 
    He says that Section 33 of that Act provides a statutory method by which an employer may be reimbursed for the compensation expenditures that must pay for -- to its injured employees but he says because the Act is not specifically barring independent cause of action therefore it should not preclude this action. 
    We feel that that argument is false or at least the fallacy can be demonstrated by the fact that prior to the enactment of compensation statutes generally in this statute in particular, an employer no -- had no non-negligent liability for injuries to its employees. 
    Therefore we feel that proper construction of the statute says that if the liability standards from the statutes certainly, then the corresponding right to be reimbursed must also be predicated upon that statute. 
    The -- and I feel that the petitioner's principal complaint here is that he doesn't have a complete remedy under the Longshoreman's Act by reason of the fact that if he takes under that Act is the assignee or the subrogee of the employee's claim then he will be limited to the $30,000.00 maximum recovery which was permitted under Illinois law in effect to the time of this accident. 
    However, it is maintained that the employers are as carriers, insurance carriers potential liability is $70,000.00 therefore he is going to be at least $40,000.00 out of pocket rate -- right away if he cannot find a way to get around the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. 
    I believe that this question, this possibility or likelihood that there would be cases in which the injured employee in bringing his cause of action against a negligent third party, there were cases in which he would recover less from the negligent third party than he might against -- as a right -- result of his entitlement to compensation benefits. 
    The Congress covered this in subsection (f) of Section 33. 
    It isn't in the appendix but it is in the petitioner's brief on page 3 of petitioner's brief. 
    In contemplating what would occur when there was a deficiency in the employees recovery, the Congress did not say or did not enact that the employer or his compensation carrier might have a separate cause of action or additional cause of action against the negligent third party to recover the deposit that it might have from its right to be reimbursed from -- or to recover from the employees recovery but instead in protecting the employee it said that the employer shall pay to the employee any deficiency between whatever it recovers from the negligent third party and what it was entitled to under the compensation act. 
    The Act, I think it's designed to protect employees rather than employers to some extent anyway. 
    We feel that the Congress in enacting this statute specified -- set forth a particular manner in which reimbursement could be achieved by the employer and we feel that the mode of reimbursement under the statute is very, very plain. 
    The compensation statutes have been consistently interpreted to cover the entire area of industrial injuries and basically where Congress has provided a means of recovery, I don't think it's necessary to go outside the Act. 
    I think the recovery must be found within the four corners of the Act. 
    We certainly we feel that Congress did not intend that there should be two recoveries for a single tort. 
    The second aspect of this question is before the Court is how can the -- or what rules do govern this area of indemnity? 
    I think it's clear from the decisions of this Court beginning with Ryan going under Weyerhaeuser, Crumady that indemnity in these cases must be predicated entirely upon contractual warranty.

    Mr. Paul McCambridge 
    The courts in following this Court's several decisions in this area of the law have examined the shipowner's conduct in the context of whether it -- its conduct has actively hindered or whether it has prevented the stevedore from safely performing its services to the vessel. 
    If the shipowner's conduct has been of that nature, then the courts merely say you have no right to indemnity for the amounts that you have paid to the injured employee. 
    You cannot recover this from his employer. 
    But the courts have not gone further.

    I was wondering why if this Court can find an implied contract in favor of the ship -- in favor of the ship against the stevedoring company for it's -- not doing anything they can didn't it? 
    That -- may cause us damage, why can't the Court find the same implied contract on the other side?

    Mr. Paul McCambridge 
    I -- that is one answer Mr. Justice White. 
    I don't think it necessarily would prevent it if it were expressly agreed upon but the duties that -- which the stevedore urges that we owed to them as a matter of contract are tort duties, the duty to use ordinary care, the duty to warn of hidden defects. 
    These are tort duties.

    They are duties, we would -- I would acknowledge that these are duties we owed them to everyone who is aboard the ship but they do not arise necessarily by virtue of the stevedoring contract whereas this Court has expressed --

    Well that -- that's only a matter of semantics.

    Mr. Paul McCambridge 
    Well, two District Court decisions in California which interpreted the Hugev which is relied upon by my opponent said it isn't just a matter of semantics. 
    It really is the true perspective of the reasoning is that these duties existed independent of contract and that they do not arise by virtue of the contract. 
    And in this area --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What if they do, you would admit liability, wouldn't you?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, you may answer the question.
speaker="paul_mccambridge" startTime="3764.433" stopTime="3885.768">
    Mr. Paul McCambridge 
    If the shipowner does in fact impliedly warrant that it will observe a tort obligation to use ordinary care or to warn of hidden defects or if it owes the duty to furnish a safe place to work not only to the individual longshoreman which Sieracki says it owes. 
    But it also owes that same to the stevedore employer to furnish its employee's a safe place to work. 
    The whole balance in this area of indemnification between shipowners and stevedores will be thrown out of balance because in every case, the fact that a shipowner has failed to furnish a safe place to work and that is this liability would have to fall. 
    It's the absolute non-delegable liability duty that it has in every case that would prevent its recovery of indemnity against a stevedore because it would be a breach contract. 
    It would be a breach of warranty that it would furnish a safe place to work. 
    Now, the cases have never held -- in fact the cases are in accord that the shipowner does not furnish -- does not warrant to a stevedore that it will furnish a seaworthy vessel. 
    A seaworthy vessel, the duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel and the duty to provide a safe place for a longshoreman to work is identical, it's the identical obligation really. 
    And it -- and the injured longshoreman recover in these cases because the shipowner has breached this duty to furnish a safe place to work. 
    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3885.768" stopTime="3916.032">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose -- may I ask you just this one question. 
    Suppose they had made a contract with the stevedoring company and says, "You are to bring your man over this gangway, this water freight right here." 
    He brings him over. 
    It is discovered that was the knowledge of the owner of the ship that the thing has been so defective, that is absolutely bound to break, let him go in the sea. 
    And it broke and went into the sea and was drowned. 
    What about that?
speaker="paul_mccambridge" startTime="3916.032" stopTime="3969.752">
    Mr. Paul McCambridge 
    In that case, I would say that the injured or decedent -- the deceased could recover from the shipowner and the shipowner would be prevented from recovery of indemnity from the stevedore because obviously the ship's gangway is something that is furnished by the shipowner. 
    Therefore in the first instance, the longshoremen recover. 
    The second aspect of that question would be that in the first time up a gangway, the stevedore does not necessarily have a duty to inspect. 
    This is something that is -- this was in the -- that is within the realm of the shipowner's responsibility. 
    Therefore in this case, the furnishing of the defect of the gangway would prevent the stevedore --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3969.752" stopTime="3987.259">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Then I suppose that stood in the way of the stevedore any protection because of the decision by this Court that had held that he must be -- indemnify the shipowner even though it's the shipowner's negligence.

    Mr. Hough, you have a few moments if you wish to use them.
speaker="john_w_hough" startTime="4016.609" stopTime="4134.834">
    Mr. John W. Hough 
    I would like to point out to the Court that respondent recognize that changing the law here would perhaps have a decided impact on the industry and that Ryan changed the law existent up to that time and had as have been enacted under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act long before the advent of Ryan. 
    I would like to point out to the Court that the position of the law now is in the Ninth Circuit, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, the Hugev case makes the very definite statement that the law prompt the holding that the ex -- the absent a span, they expressed a provision to the contrary. 
    The shipowner owes to the stevedoring contractor under the stevedoring contract the implied in fact obligations. 
    The Ninth Circuit holds there is an implied in fact contract. 
    The Seventh Circuit holds there is none. 
    We ask this Court to clarify the law and we urge that there is this implied in fact contract under which duties flow both ways. 
    And secondly, that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was not designed to and does not isolate the shipowner from liability to the stevedoring contract for a breach of that contract. 
    That Act has no bearing on that relationship, we suggest to this Court. 
    Thank you.
