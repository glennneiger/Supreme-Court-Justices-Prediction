Lear, Inc. v. Adkins

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 56, Lear Incorporated, petitioner versus John S. Adkins. 
    Mr. Cohen, you begin your argument.
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="14.056" stopTime="124.447">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    First, it is important to show in this case that Lear never properly raised or preserved the question of whether licensee estoppel violates either the patent laws or the antitrust laws. 
    Although Mr. Wallace for the Government referred the Court to pages 25 to 28 of one of Lear's reply briefs where Lear had quoted the constitutional standard for invention and the sections of the patent laws dealing with validity. 
    He did not read far enough from that portion of the brief. 
    In that section after quoting those provisions what Lear was arguing was only that the federal laws including the constitutional standard had to be applied in determining the question of validity. 
    That portion did not in any way assert that the doctrine of licensee estoppel was invalid and that it violated either the patent laws or the antitrust laws. 
    In fact, at page 75 of that same brief, Lear had a separate section dealing with the doctrine of licensee estoppel in which Lear conceded that the doctrine was applicable in this case unless it fell within one of two exceptions. 
    One being termination and the other being repudiation. 
    I have Xerox copies of the brief that Mr. Wallace referred to pages 18 to 26 and I have handed them to the Clerk this morning for this Court to consider if it's so desires. 
    Now, I offer now a copy to the Government.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    What page is that?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="125.687" stopTime="303.397">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    It's 18 through 28. 
    In fact, the Government concedes in its amicus brief that the issue of whether or not the doctrine of licensee estoppel violates either the patent laws or the antitrust laws was not timely raised or preserved in this case. 
    At page 8, the Government says as follows, “This Court need not be deterred from reaching this issue, licensee estoppel by the fact that petitioner's contentions in the state courts were directed primarily to attempting to carve out an exception to the doctrine rather than to its overturn.” 
    Because of this Court's decision upholding the doctrine at Automatic Radio Co. versus Hazeltine it would have been futile for the petitioner to argue broadly to the state courts that federal law bars the states from applying the doctrine of patent licensee estoppel. 
    Moreover, Lear has conceded in the state court system that the rule of licensee estoppel was applicable unless Lear fell within one of two state exceptions. 
    The best statement of this concession appears at page 109 of Lear's answering brief in the California District Court which is quoted at page 120 of the appendix before this Court and which states as follows, “it is a recognized principle of law that when a license agreement provides a grant of a right to either manufacture, use or sell a product incorporating a patented invention, the licensee is estopped to contest the validity of the license patent only so long as the licensee is operating under the license.” 
    This is not only the modern rule as plaintiff likes to call it but as also the old rule as well. 
    This rule was set out in the 1939 case of the Armstrong Co. versus the Shell Company of California which was a California Court opinion. 
    Lear then goes on to say this estoppel as only so long as the licensee operates under the license agreement. 
    This estoppel arises not because of the expressed terms in the agreement but because the licensee is using and enjoying the benefit and protection of the right covered by the agreement and should not be permitted to reap the benefits of the agreement and at the same time contest the validity of the patents to show failure of consideration for the agreement.

speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="348.131" stopTime="413.651">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    The passage in the brief that was read to you yesterday was dealing primarily in fact exclusively with the constitutional standard and the patent laws insofar as they concern the standard for invention. 
    There was nothing said there about licensee estoppel and particularly nothing said about whether it violates either the antitrust laws or the patent laws. 
    That section was dealing solely with the validity question and what the standard was for determining the validity of a patent. 
    I think this is clear from page 28 where after quoting the constitutional provision and the patent standard set forth in Sections 101, 102, 103 and subsequent sections. 
    They conclude that this test must be applied in determining validity but there's no statement there concerning licensee estoppel or whether those standards have to be applied in determining whether the doctrine of licensee estoppel violates either the patent laws or the antitrust laws.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Well, I'm saying they did not raise with any specificity was the question of whether the doctrine of licensee estoppel per se violates either policy of the antitrust laws of the policy of the patent laws. 
    This question was never raised in the trial court --

    Not on this issue because this issue was never raised.

    If it was decided assuming it is essential to the decision and it is essential to the decision only in a very narrow respect but I would assume that if it hadn't been properly raised that would not be properly before this Court.

    Even if the Court decided it?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="480.228" stopTime="514.663">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    I would assume that the Court had decided it as a question of state law because it was not raised as a federal question and in trying to carve out exceptions to the doctrine in that Lear had claimed that either terminated or repudiated the agreement Lear stated that these were state exceptions to the doctrine. 
    So that I would gather that it was more or less assumed all the way along the line that what was being applied was a state doctrine since it was never questioned under the federal laws in any way.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    It has been a controversy before this Court, yes but it arose in this case in the context that Lear conceded the applicability of the rule and then contended only that they fell within two so-called state exceptions that they had either terminated the agreement --

    They conceded that the doctrine of licensee estoppel was applicable without saying any place in the state system whether it was state or federal but by the fact that they tried to use so-called state exceptions to come without the rule. 
    They probably also conceded that it was a state doctrine although I admit that it was never specified which one it was.

    Well, that wouldn't certainly preclude us, would it? 
    Assuming that they have not press the point below would that wouldn't preclude us from deciding the issue, would it? 
    This is not an issue that this is about us claiming the issue of law, law appearing something is any such thing as one could readily imagine.
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="668.920" stopTime="710.325">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Well, I would assume that under the procedural rules that have been laid down by this Court that unless the issue is timely raise as a federal question, it is too late to raise it in this Court. 
    Now, it went through the entire California system without any question to the applicability of the doctrine. 
    There was no federal question presented, rather there was only an attempt to carve out state exceptions to this rule on the theory that Lear had either terminated the agreement by sending notice of termination or had repudiated the agreement. 
    And on both those issues, Lear took the position that that was state law and since they were applying it to the doctrine of licensee estoppel I would assume that they also --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="710.325" stopTime="730.863">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I don't want to take more of your time but certainly there were plenty of federal questions raised below and your point, I take it is that assuming that this particular argument was not made below. 
    Is it too late to make this particular argument here?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="730.863" stopTime="766.833">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Well, I think it is because the only federal questions that were raised below were in connection with the application of the federal standards for patentability which never really became an issue in the California Supreme Court because it applied the doctrine licensee estoppel. 
    So, unless, the Court can reach the issue of licensee estoppel, it can't go any further than that. 
    And if that's decided solely on a state ground as a matter of state contract law then the federal patent issues which were raised never arise in this case.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="766.833" stopTime="781.564">

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes.
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="789.670" stopTime="813.197">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    The other issue was primarily the construction of the contract and Lear's attempts to avoid the contract by saying that it either terminated or repudiated. 
    And thereby get itself into the federal court system in a pure suit for infringement and the California Supreme Court devoted a good part of its time to determining whether or not they had terminated the contract.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="813.197" stopTime="828.163">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Do you agree or disagree that this contract has to be construed and applied solely from the point of view of the patent -- of a patent contract -- patent license contract?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="828.163" stopTime="961.852">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    No, I don't think it does because I don't think it is in the pure and technical sense, a patent contract. 
    It relates to patent events to a certain extent but it is more concerned with a bargain for the disclosure of an invention in return for the payment of a royalty for the disclosure of that invention. 
    That is the real basis of that bargain which I will get to as I get further in to my argument. 
    Now, just as the issue relating to the question of licensee estoppel is not properly before this Court, in my opinion, similarly the issue of patent validity is not before this Court for several reasons. 
    First, if the issue of licensee estoppel is not before this Court, it cannot reach this dependent question. 
    Second, the issue of validity was not one of the five questions presented in Lear's petition for certiorari. 
    It is also third, not a necessarily included question under Rule 23 (1) (c). 
    Fourth, the California Supreme Court did not consider the issue of validity and under settled procedural rules of this Court will not normally pass on questions in the first instance without the lower courts having first undertaking to decide those issues. 
    In fact, the Government urges at page 26 of its amicus brief that if the issue of validity must to be reached that the case should be remanded to the California Supreme Court for consideration of this issue. 
    Consequently, in my view because the doctrine of licensee estoppel was never properly raised as a federal issue and the doctrine of the validity of a patent is consequently not before the Court. 
    The result should be that this petition be dismissed as improvidently granted.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Well, I think what it was doing was saying was one interpreting the contract and then saying as a shorthand method that what they're really saying is licensee estoppel really means that Lear has estopped to question the bargain that it freely entered into in that in making the bargain, it did not make conclusive validity of the patent one of the considerations for the bargain. 
    And therefore, since failure of -- since invalidity of the patent, would not cause a failure consideration. 
    It should not be a defense. 
    In other words, the party has never bargain with respect to the validity of the patent. 
    And therefore, it should not be a defense if it's invalid because it could not affect the bargain of the parties.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Whether they may go too far because of an overriding federal policy but we're confined to the narrow situation and there's no misuse of the patent. 
    I think it remains just a state question until there is some transgression of the antitrust laws.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What was that?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="1172.317" stopTime="1247.401">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Well, perhaps that patent laws but I don't really see how patent laws come in to play here especially in the context of this case because the bargain was really not for “patents or patent rights” the essence of the bargain as I will get to it in a minute was that Lear received a disclosure from Adkins of an idea, discovery and invention for which they agreed to pay him as long as they continue to use it subject to three conditions subsequent. 
    Now, those conditions subsequent were, one, if no patent issue. 
    Two, if a patent issue with claims which did not cover the inventions they were using in the 2156 California gyro and the Michigan steel gyros. 
    And three, if the patent was held invalid in third party action. 
    So, although they tie this escape hatches to what might happen under the patent laws they were really just a way of reducing Lear's liability under the agreement to continue to pay until the expiration of the patent. 
    And since none of these conditions has occurred, there of course belong to the party.

    I think you first have to read paragraph 2 (a) with paragraph 1 (b) in order to determine what Lear was in effect licensee --

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    No, I'm not saying that at all. 
    I'm saying that when you read paragraph 2 (a) with paragraph 1 (b) what Lear licensed was the invention disclosed or intended to be disclosed and by use of the words if patentable they were bargaining for what the patent office might do or what some third party might do to the patent and third party adjudication. 
    But they were not bargaining that they themselves could contest the validity of a patent and thereby avoid the bargain. 
    In other words, they were saying in effect that if the patent does an issue or if the claims don't cover what we're making or third party holds it invalid and therefore it can use it free that we should also be able to use it free. 
    And under those conditions only we can terminate but the validity between us is decided by what the patent office will do in the first instance in issuing or not issuing a patent.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen

    -- to that standard for -- but only for one purpose not to control the rights vis-a-vis Adkins and Lear but to likely or out of the contract in the event that a patent didn't issue and somebody else could therefore use it. 
    In other words, their bargain was, we will pay you for this invention which we have an inclusive right to use subject to conditions subsequent which are if no patent issues or if the claims are not substantial and don't cover the inventions we're making -- the devices we're making or if it's held invalid in third party adjudication. 
    But only subject to those three conditions can we get out. 
    Other than that, our bargain is founded upon your disclosure Mr. Adkins of the invention and our use of the invention for which we agreed to pay the royalty. 
    So that the patent laws are really not involved in this bargain except to the extent that Lear's escape hatches --

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    I think I have outlined the cases in my brief the one that comes to mind in particular is this Court's opinion in the case of Brulotte versus Thys where the Court was considering the use of a patent to exact a royalty after the expiration of the patent by tying it to the license of the patent and where the Court when faced with the question of what would happen if the parties have made a contract for a machine which was not patented whether or not this would involved federal law. 
    And the Court there said, “The sale or a lease of unpatented machines on long-term payments based on a deferred purchase price or on use would present wholly different considerations.” 
    Those arrangements seldom rise to the level of a federal question. 
    So I assume that what the Court is saying where the parties are contracting with respect to something which is an unpatented invention.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Yes but as I'm trying to say when they used the word “patented or patentable” on paragraph 2 (a), 2 (a) expressly refers to 1 (b) for further definitions of the term used and it defines claims as including the invention disclosed or intended to be disclosed in specification of the application and that Lear is taking a license of the invention which Adkins disclosed or intended to disclose not with the claims under the patent. 
    So that he merely used the specifications to define the invention rather than to take a license of claims under an application.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Yes, I don't deny related to the federal patent but the question is the way it related to that federal patent. 
    As the California Supreme Court held, Lear was not concerned prior to the issuance of the patent with particular claims in the application, what they were licensing was the invention either disclosed or intended to be disclosed in the specifications without regard to the claims for which they agreed to pay until final patent office action. 
    And that further when final patent office action occurred if a patent issue they would have to continue to pay regardless or whether that patent was valid or not valid because that was no part of the bargain between the parties but however if the patent did not issue then they would have the right to seize paying further royalties because in that situation then a third party would be free to use the invention also.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1856.412" stopTime="1876.327">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you mean that this contract could've been included the promise by Lear to use in connection with this disclose the device, some other device that the seller wanted Lear to use?

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Well, in that situation, I would assume that since Adkins had no control over what Lear used it for that it would no rise to the level of a federal question.

    Well, because then if you tie something in whether the contract involves a patent or not I would assume you get involved with the antitrust laws.

    I think that's what they're after and I think that's what the Hazeltine opinion makes clear that assuming that a patent right is involved, as long as that patent right is not misused either by price fixing or tie-ins or conspiracies to restrain trade. 
    Then, the doctrine of licensee estoppel can be applied and in fact should be applied.

    Well, that maybe where this Court is trying to go to say that you must engraft upon every agreement which deals with something which is capable of being patented a provision that the parties cannot make a bargain unless they condition it first on obtaining a patent and second condition that upon the patent being valid. 
    Now, that maybe where the Court wants to go but I would submit that that's a very harsh result to take away from the parties the free right to make any contract they wish with the respect to an idea or a discovery even if it doesn't arise to the dignity of something that is patentable under the federal patent laws.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    The fall back on the patent for one reason and that is to show that Lear did not come within the conditions subsequent it said if a patent did not issue, they didn't have to pay for the royalties. 
    That's the only extent to which we rely on the patent in this case other than the fact that the claims cover the 2156 California --

    -- in this case I think that even if you overturn the doctrine of licensee estoppel and held the patent to be invalid that that would not end Adkins' rights under this contract because it is interpreted by the California Supreme Court the parties themselves were not concerned with the validity or invalidity of the patent and therefore since they did not make this a part of their bargain.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2446.412" stopTime="2452.469">

    Why do you say that, exactly that?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="2452.469" stopTime="2460.744">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    It appears at page 182 of appendix 1 in footnote 17.

    Appendix 1 -- 182?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="2471.443" stopTime="2547.040">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    And reading from footnote 17, California Supreme Court states, “Lear states that the license extended only to validly patented claims, however, the provisions of the agreement setting forth the scope of the license do not so state.” 
    The validity of the patent was adverted to in the agreement only in connection with the right to terminate if the patent “was subsequently held invalid.” 
    And the Court goes on to say that page 209 of that appendix the cause is based on rights emanating from a written agreement and the patent itself is referred to only for the purpose of determining whether Lear used the invention therein set forth. 
    I think that makes a pretty clear that what the California Court was saying that even if the patent was invalid it would not cut off Lear's right or Lear's obligation to pay royalties in this case because they weren't bargaining between themselves Adkins and Lear for a conclusively valid patent.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Cohen, in what respect what can you point to in this contract that distinguishes it really from the ordinary sort of contract in some of the circumstances where a party has an item for which he has filed the patent application and he makes contract with somebody else for the use of that item. 
    Now, it seems to me that your case and perhaps the decision of the California Court depend upon your argument rather than the decision of California Court depend upon establishing that a fundamental proposition which goes to the intention of the parties which is that somehow someway this is not to be looked at as an ordinary agreement with respect to an article before which patent application has been filed and which is subject to the federal patent law but somehow someway this contract is to be read in terms of the intention of the parties and then as an agreement for the use of any an invention without reference to patentability. 
    Certainly, the contract, when you look at the contract it looks like an ordinary patent -- ordinary agreement under the patent laws.
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="2651.851" stopTime="2657.033">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    I don't think there's any question about that it's only couch in terms of the normal formal patent license agreement.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2657.033" stopTime="2657.379">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes.
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="2657.379" stopTime="2786.125">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    But I think you can distinguish it in this way, taking the typical situation first a holder of either an application for a patent or a patent would go to a manufacturer and say, the manufacturer was either using or intending to use what he thinks is covered by the application of the patent. 
    Let's say you either pay me a royalty or I will sue you for infringement of this patent. 
    And in that situation which is the typical situation the force behind the bargain is the threat of the supposed patent right and that is probably the main force in causing the bargain to be made assuming or leaving to the one aside the desirability the parties to settle but still the main force is the same. 
    It's the existence or the expected existence are the patent right under the federal law. 
    This case did not arise that way. 
    It arose rather with an agreement dated December 29, 1951 between Adkins and Lear which is one page in length as copied verbatim at page 11 of the appendix in which Adkins agreed to disclose the Lear “all ideas inventions and discoveries which he might conceive of which Lear agreed expressly would be Adkins property and Adkins then agreed to license it to Lear for a mutually satisfactory royalty.” 
    This agreement made no mention of patents, patent rights or patentability to the contrary. 
    The existence of a patent or patent right under this agreement was totally irrelevant then pursuant to that agreement Adkins went to work for Lear and did invent something which they wanted and when it look to Lear like it was going to be commercially successful they said to themselves, well, we have to do something about this first agreement because under state law he will collect that reasonable royalty. 
    So the result was that they begin negotiation with them that went over a three-year period and resulted in this license agreement.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Right, now actually what happened there was at the time Adkins joined Lear he did have one issue of patent and he started negotiations with the lawyer with Lear with respect to that issue of patent which had nothing to do with this case. 
    Thereafter, Adkins and Lear started discussing this license agreement which Adkins alone negotiated with Lear and in the course of so doing they merged that other agreement with this one. 
    So that there were several parts of the same agreement, so he was initially represented on another face of it nothing to do with this particular invention. 
    I think it's also --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alternatively then I think I have some illumination that really what you're urging upon us is that we construe the patent license agreement which is the agreement upon which this litigation has been conducted as if that incorporated the spirit and substance and motivation of the -- and they show one page agreement between Adkins and Lear. 
    That's about what it comes down to.

    Well, that's what I haven't got is and perhaps it's in the brief and I don't want to divert your argument and I don't recall it in your brief.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Basically, an analysis of all the considerations that Lear was bargaining for and that Adkins was giving up with reference to the first agreement. 
    Not of which considerations had anything to do with either the power of force behind the patent or patent application or a patent or a patent right except to the extent that conditions subsequent where title Lear's obligation to pay royalties. 
    That's the only extent that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2965.055" stopTime="3014.713">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, that would cut pretty far one because practically every patent license agreement involves the same kind of -- involves a licensee of know-how and I suppose there are great many that involved facts somewhat like this in terms of the background of the patent license agreement itself which you really -- it's possible that the argument is that an invitation to this Court to supersede some aspect that at least the federal patent law where the parties had a relationship of employer or employee during the period of invention.

    I would suggest that this is not the typical case and probably would never come up again for one practical reason that most if not all corporations when they employ an inventor make him sign an agreement in advance of his coming to work that whatever he invents will belong to the company. 
    This is the atypical situation because they signed an agreement exactly to the contrary.

    Well, perhaps it's not but it's also the key to understanding the consideration which flowed from Adkins to Lear and vise versa under the 55 agreement which concededly was couched in terms of a formal patent license agreement. 
    And if I may just dwell on that for another moment, I'd like to analyze if I could exactly what the considerations are that Lear received under this 1955 agreement. 
    First, --

    That's the last one, isn't it?

    Sorry?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3077.781" stopTime="3078.582">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The 55 (Voice Overlap)?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="3078.582" stopTime="3426.569">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    The 55, yes sir. 
    First, Lear received the exclusive uncontested and immediate right to use the secret idea discovering invention which Adkins had disclosed until final patent office action. 
    Note, that I say exclusive and not nonexclusive because the license agreement was in fact expressly exclusive contrary to what the Solicitor General states in his brief, it started out as an exclusive license not a nonexclusive license. 
    Second, Lear received the cancellation of the letter agreement that December 29, 1951 under which his liability to Adkins was far broader than under the agreement that replaced it. 
    Under that agreement pursuant to California law, particularly a case known as Desny versus Wilder which is California Supreme Court case cited in my brief. 
    Based on that agreement, the Court would find that there was an implied contract between the parties for Lear to take the mutually satisfactory royalty which it would have determined was a reasonable royalty and under that agreement, Lear would be bound to pay as long as Lear use the device without any escape hatches or condition subsequent termination clauses whatsoever. 
    And that brings to the third point. 
    Third thing that Lear got under this agreement was the right to seize payment of “for the royalties” if no patent issued or if it issue which claims which did not cover the gyros in issue or some third party held it invalid. 
    And fourth and equally important, there were two additional agreements signed concurrently with this license agreement which are attached to Lear's answer and are on appendix A at pages 40 to 45 wherein Lear in addition to receiving the right to use the invention disclosed in the patent application also received a release from Adkins of all other and different ideas, discoveries and invention which he may have created for the year past, present and future as long as he work for the year. 
    So that this was the consideration that Lear was concerned for and was bargaining for as the California Supreme Court recognized it was not bargaining in addition for a conclusively valid patent under which it could say that the patent was invalid and therefore we don't have to pay. 
    Its sole rights were under the very carefully drawn condition subsequent. 
    I think it's also important in this case to understand that when Adkins went to work for Lear in January of 1952 after signing this first letter agreement, he went to work for what the president of Lear Incorporated described his “coffee and cake money” which was $650.00 a month. 
    Thus, Adkins real reward under this initial bargain was to be dependent upon his successors and inventor and after spending approximately six months experimenting with a bearing on as a self-aligning type bearing he concluded that that approach to the problem would not work after which he conceived of the invention which is the subject matter of this case and fully disclosed it to Lear both to its executive personnel, to its technical personnel in Grand Rapids both in writing and orally. 
    Now, after Adkins made this disclosure, Lear at its Michigan plant in Grand Rapids began experimenting also with a self-aligning principle which Adkins had rejected and experimented with this principle for roughly 13 months at which time they were intending to put the self-aligning principle into what we're now calling the Michigan Steel gyros. 
    In fact, they had set up on production ready to go with the self-aligning principle in it. 
    And after a limited production run, it was determined that it would not work in production quantity. 
    As a result of which, the technical personnel at Michigan held what Mr. Shepple who was the head of that section referred to as a midnight meeting and decided to use Adkins' invention in the steel gyros as the only solution to the problem at a critical time period when they had to get it to production with it. 
    The result was that between 1955 and 1963, Lear amassed sales in excess of $67 million effectively eliminating all competition in this market. 
    Now, all that we're asking here is that the Court recognizes that the California Supreme Court did that the primary consideration for the bargain had nothing to do with the validity of the patent. 
    It was solely the right to use this valuable invention and the other additional considerations which I have outlined subject to Lear's rights to terminate on these conditions subsequent which we're very carefully drawn to provide that they would not be as broad as Lear as now urging and the California Supreme Court in fact found they were not as broad.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3426.569" stopTime="3436.283">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You're telling us that this was more analogous to simple compensation for his services to the company, is that right?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="3436.283" stopTime="3449.629">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    That's correct. 
    When you view it in entire context with the first agreement in the history of what Adkins was doing and what Lear needed then I think it puts it in the context that this is his true reward for disclosing this invention --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3449.629" stopTime="3452.044">

    This is his compensation for it --

speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="3457.431" stopTime="3477.980">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Enormous value, exactly. 
    And in drafting the 55 agreement as the Supreme Court found, they were aware of these considerations. 
    And the Supreme Court in fact outlined all these various considerations which they got in reaching its conclusion that they were not bargaining for the right to say that the patent was invalid and therefore we don't have to pay.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3477.980" stopTime="3484.866">

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    As I said before, the Supreme Court stated that he was although the actual fact and I put the citations in the appendix was that he was not where as Lear was represented not only by House counsel but also by outside patent counsel and in fact conducted negotiations with them for three years and did not get serious in concluding this agreement until after sales began to mount up when they figured they better hurry up and get it done before he went back under the first agreement under which their liability was far more broader.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3522.429" stopTime="3525.464">

    Does that have any relevance to the issue?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="3525.464" stopTime="3582.639">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    I think it has a relevance to the issue because if you take the state contractual construction ground then the validity or invalidity of the patent is not a defense in this case because the parties were not bargaining for a valid patent. 
    They were bargaining for the disclosure and this was Adkins' compensation for making that disclosure to him. 
    You must take this case in the context of the history of the case. 
    This is what makes it unique from virtually every other patent situation. 
    In the normal situation, it's the pressure of the existence of an application or a patent which forces the bargain. 
    Here, the pressure was not the patent rights or the patent laws. 
    Here, the pressure was the first agreement and all the consideration that Lear had received under the first agreement and additionally the consideration act and gave up under the second agreement which I have outlined.

    There is no material difference whatsoever in these gyros. 
    In both gyros, the assembly procedures as follows: bearing cups are placed on the ends of the mandrel. 
    The cups are held on the mandrel not by screws as Mr. Hale may have implied but rather are held on the mandrel by the tight fit of the bearing cup with respect to the mandrel. 
    Then, the bearing cups are coated with cement and the two gimbal halves are placed over the mandrel holding the bearing cups. 
    Each gimbal half has a center hole and when it is closed down on this mandrel the bearing cups position themselves in the hole where when the cement dries the bearing cups are then left in the relationship which they were in on the mandrel. 
    Once, the cement dries it's taken apart, the mandrel is removed and the screws which hold the gimbal to the mandrel are also removed and formed no part of the invention. 
    So, that the result in structure is a structure consisting of a pair of three elements which achieves coaxial and parallel alignment without relationship to the parallelism of the end bells or the coaxial alignment of the receiving holes. 
    That, I suppose is an over simplification but that's the essence of this invention and that was used in both the 2156 California gyro and also in the Michigan steel gyros in the same way. 
    In fact, as Mr. Shepple who I have referred to before stated and he was the head of the steel gyro development program the assembly finished structure. 
    The result are the same in both gyros and the principle is the same in both gyros. 
    Thus, the remaining question is whether claim 9 which was on a chart presented by Mr. Hale yesterday. 
    Question is whether that claim covers these gyros. 
    Lear concedes that it covers the 2156 gyros and because there are no material differences between the 2156 California gyro and the Michigan steel gyros it also covers the Michigan steel gyros. 
    This is what the jury found and this is also what the California Supreme Court held stating in fact that the evidence was uncontradicted that claim 9 covers the Michigan steel gyros.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    No, the instructions are not challenged as far as I'm aware at least on the issue of infringement that they're challenged. 
    They were challenged in some other respect on various other matters but not on infringement. 
    And as the California Supreme Court found the evidence was uncontradicted and compel the conclusion that the claim 9 covered the Michigan steel gyros. 
    And I've set forth most of that testimony in the appendix, five witnesses, Mr. Lee, Shepple, Adkins, Carpenter and I believe Charleston. 
    If I may, I will get back for just a moment to the -- this Court's opinion in the Automatic Radio versus Hazeltine case as I read that opinion and assuming we're concerned with the doctrine of licensee estoppel in this case, this Court has held that where there is no misuse of the patent such as the Court found in sole in Katzinger as price fixing and as the Court found in Mercoid as a tie-in then the doctrine of licensee estoppel maybe applied in and in fact should be applied and that's what was done in that case. 
    Taking it back to the foundation, I would like to read one quote from this Court's opinion in United States versus Harvey Steel and I think it's particularly applicable to the bargain of these parties. 
    There, this Court said, “The United States was dealing with a matter upon which it had all the knowledge that anyone had that it was contracting for the use of a process which however much it may now be impugned the United States would not have used when it did but for the communications of the claimant and that it was contracting for the process which it actually used a process which has revolutionized the naval armor of the world.” 
    This language can be read directly on our case as to what they were in fact contracting for.

    And the Court found that there was both a patent and a process and that principally what the Government was wanting to use was the process or the know-how or the disclosure of how to do it.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's derived from the -- I suppose primarily from the expressed provision in the contract as you argue it from the expressed provision in the contract that if upon suit of a third party that patent is found to be invalid then certain consequences follow, and I suppose you derive make it to the implication from that the parties have agreed that the licensee may not challenge the validity of the patent.
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="4363.950" stopTime="4387.794">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    I think that's what they were saying, yes that they have narrowly limited their rights to terminate this agreement and that particular conditions subsequent was designed to apply only when some third party adjudicated the patent to be invalid in which case that third party could use it free then Lear could too but that was it's only escape hatch so to speak.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    It is fairly customer specified isn't in as I recall in patent license agreements cover not to by the licensee not to attack the validity of the patent?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="4401.818" stopTime="4419.296">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    I really can't answer that Your Honor I just don't know how frequently they're doing, how frequently they don't. 
    I would assume if the licensee was concerned about it, he would expressly reserve the right to contest the validity and make an express part of the bargain.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4419.296" stopTime="4447.347">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, if there -- if they want a provision in the agreement with respect to termination if the patent is held invalid? 
    There weren't any provision like that at all. 
    You could argue I suppose that it's totally irrelevant where the patent is valid or invalid and that even if the patent was declared invalid this -- the obligation of the license goes on.
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="4447.347" stopTime="4448.765">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    I would think the answer to that is probably --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4448.765" stopTime="4455.056">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If you contracted for the use of the process why you contract for the use of it, was it patent or not?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="4455.056" stopTime="4456.488">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4456.488" stopTime="4469.944">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But now, you do have a provision in the contract that says termination if it's held invalid?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="4469.944" stopTime="4487.797">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Yes, but that provision as the California Supreme Court construed it was drawn to permit Lear which had an exclusive license to terminate in the event that some third party adjudicated it to be invalid and therefore acquired the right to use it free.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4487.797" stopTime="4497.952">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So, the license agreement seems to me does have some critical part of it but depended upon the existence of the patent?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="4497.952" stopTime="4723.072">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    But to the sole extent that Lear's rights to terminate and avoid its bargain are tied to the -- what the patent office would do what some third party might do, did not give Lear the right to do it. 
    In other words, it is tied in a limited way to what might happen under the patent laws but only in a very limited way. 
    It doesn't form a part of the consideration. 
    It forms only the conditions subsequent under which Lear can get out of the bargain. 
    Now, assuming the sake of argument only that the doctrine of licensee estoppel has to be overturned then the question becomes what happens to this case thereafter. 
    Now, although Lear urges that this Court then delve into the issues of validity of the patent and itself determine the issue, the Government concedes that in that situation the case should be remanded to the California Supreme Court which has not yet considered the issue of validity. 
    It is the policy of this Court that lower courts first be given the opportunity to pass on questions before this Court reviews them. 
    Otherwise, in this case, the result would be since there are no new or noble patent issues involved but this Court would be sitting and performing a function performed by the Court of Claims for instance that, the right of ordinary review rather than reviewing questions of law. 
    Moreover, even if the patent was held invalid that would not in the case, that would still be additional things that have to be considered such as the proper cut-off date for the payment of royalties if the patent is held invalid. 
    And on this issue, the Government also concedes in its amicus brief that the resolution of this issue where the license is exclusive would depend upon state considerations of fairness between the parties. 
    Similarly, we would have in this case the right to pursue the second cause of action. 
    The second cause of action was an alternative cause of action which existed for the idea, discovery and invention as and unpatented and unpatentable invention. 
    And we took the position under that second cause of action that if the license agreement for some reason failed either because of a failure or consideration or because of some illegality or for some other reason that Adkins was under one of these theories pleaded there entitled to recover the reasonable value of what he in fact convey to Lear when he disclosed the idea. 
    Now, although it's been contended that Mr. Adkins waived the second cause of action in its entirety he did not in fact do so of the trial court had held that Mr. Adkins have waived the entire cause of action but on the writ of mandate proceeding, the District Court of Appeal reversed and compelled the trial court judge to enter an amendment to the judgment stating that the second cause of action had not been waived for what Adkins had disclosed to Lear insofar as related to the subject matter of the patent application. 
    I believe that concludes my presentation.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This morning we spent a lot of time on something that we had no trial on. 
    The trial court limited us to the express terms of this license agreement. 
    We -- pardon me. 
    We endeavor to present evidence leading up to the consummation of this agreement, a background material, the trial court excluded, expressly excluded all of that. 
    The trial court said, you're here on an agreement or you're here on something else, why are you here on? 
    It required Adkins to elect. 
    Adkins wanted to go in under the idea, discovery, invention and common law. 
    The trial court says, you can't ride both those horses. 
    You have to pick the agreement or the common law, which are you on? 
    And Adkins picked the agreement.

    I think it was Your Honor. 
    The two causes of action are antagonistic to one another, they are I might say mutually exclusive as I indicated yesterday the common law relies upon secrecy, nondisclosure. 
    Patent law relies upon disclosure. 
    There was an agreement, Adkins pleaded the agreement and that's what we're here on. 
    Now, for example this --

    Mr. C. Russell Hale 
    No, I thought I'm in complete agreement with the Court's decision and that has not been overturned Your Honor. 
    That was the way the thing went up all the way. 
    Now, this is enabled the presentation of numerous incorrect statements as to the facts because they're just not in the record. 
    Now a lot of the facts, of this Court heard this morning, are not in the record because the trial court won't let us put them in the record. 
    For example, today, you heard that Adkins alone negotiated with Lear and this is set forth in Adkins' brief at page 15, he gives a couple of reporters transcripts citations and I ask this Court to read those two citations and see if Adkins was represented by counsel or not. 
    They don't say. 
    Now, at the trial, we tried to present evidence concerning this as I pointed out and it was excluded. 
    Exhibit U is down in the record, in the archives. 
    We made an offer of proof of exhibit U at our -- at the reporter's transcript 1018. 
    Exhibit U says, I have read over the license agreement and I found it to be generally in good shape. 
    However, prior to submitting it to my lawyer for his comments and interpretation of certain legal phraseology I would like to go into certain details.

    Now, Adkins is saying, prior to submitting it to my lawyer for his comments. 
    Now, this is dated November 26, 1954. 
    There are several other pieces of -- this is not an evidence Your Honor, this was for identification only but it is down here in this -- in the archives and I just want to point out that this one of the things that we've been going into today that that we never had trial on.

    It was never admitted.

    Was that reprinted by stipulation to you counsel?

    Mr. C. Russell Hale 
    Mr. Adkins designated for inclusion in the record if you will notice we say exhibit 7 for identification only. 
    This document was never admitted and the reason it was never admitted is the trial court said, we're going to trial on the agreement of exhibit 8 and nothing else is material, nothing else is permitted.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    When you've been saying it's not in the record, do you mean it's not in the record that submitted to us for how consideration or if that's what you mean, how could you say it is here on the bottom, that U exhibit that you're talking about? 
    How did you, you said exhibit U is share in some things.

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Well, it was often you say but was not admitted in evidence?

    Mr. C. Russell Hale 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    That's what you mean when you say it's not in the record?

    Mr. C. Russell Hale 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    We were never permitted to develop a record of any kind going -- leading of the thing -- leading up to the consummation of this agreement.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I don't believe that one page -- my question may not have been clear. 
    I don't believe that one page document to which you referred is the one page document to which Mr. Cohen referred --

    Mr. C. Russell Hale 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I thought he referred to a one page agreement between Lear and Adkins with respect to inventions --

    The same document?

    Mr. C. Russell Hale 
    Would you so agree Mr. Cohen that we're referring – he's referring to the pleadings and I'm referring to the exhibits. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Peter R. Cohen

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I see, thank you.
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="5331.949" stopTime="5340.040">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Because I'm referring to exhibit A attached to the complaint which is the same document and which was admitted in the answer. 
    Well, it's incorrect to that extent.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5340.040" stopTime="5342.562">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was submitted in the record?

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Oh! 
    Yes, it's in the record because it attached the complaint and the answer admits that the party signed this agreement.

    Yes.

    No, it was admitted --

    It was admitted for identification only.

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Yes. 
    You can consider it because it was --

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    Well, in California you do not have to offer something into evidence which is admitted once it is admitted in the answer --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5376.549" stopTime="5384.565">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But it might be admissible and relevant that it might not, did the Court hold that was admitted as a relevant piece of evidence?
speaker="peter_r_cohen" startTime="5384.565" stopTime="5395.970">
    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    No, it did not because I was trying to get to another subject with it but in the answer it was admitted that Lear had signed this agreement and the California Supreme Court in fact considered it in its opinion.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5395.970" stopTime="5410.969">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's on page 11 of appendix, volume 1 and it is exhibit 1 to the complaint that was filed and as I understand it the answer did not deny that part of the allegations of the complaint?

    Mr. Peter R. Cohen 
    That's correct.

    Mr. C. Russell Hale 
    No, that's beyond question Your Honor but the trial court excluded it because license agreement, paragraph 13 of the license agreement says, this agreement supersedes and cancels the agreement which has been brought.
