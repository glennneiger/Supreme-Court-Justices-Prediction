    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case presents the question as to whether or not this Court's decision in Harper versus Virginia State Board of Elections applies to a local revenue bond election limited to property taxpayers who have no special interest in the election which would warrant their limitation. 
    The facts of this case may be briefly stated as follows. 
    This suit was brought by Joseph Q. Cipriano as a class action. 
    Mr. Cipriano is a resident of and a duly registered and qualified voter in the City of Houma, Louisiana. 
    The plaintiff does not own any real property in the City of Houma nor does he pay any property taxes on any such property. 
    On October 24, 1967, an election was held pursuant to the statute challenged in this suit to authorize the issuance of utility revenue bonds. 
    Under the applicable statute, the election was specifically limited to resident, property taxpayers, appellant and all similarly situation -- situated persons who are prohibitive from voting in this election by the effect of the statute. 
    The purpose of the election was to obtain authorization from the electorate to issue $10 million worth of utility revenue bonds with which to expand the utility system of the City of Houma. 
    The election received a favorable vote by the property taxpayers. 
    Of the 11,606 registered voters in the City of Houma, 4,680 are property taxpayers. 
    Of that latter number, 2,724 actually voted in this election, 1,828 voted in favor of this proposition, 896 against it. 
    The appellant brought this suit within the 60-day period allowed and provided for by Louisiana statute and contesting -- contested the constitutionality of the voter classification or qualification. 
    The trial court and the divided opinion with the dissent by Justice Wisdom rejected appellant's contention and from that decision of a three-judge court, the appellant appeals to this Court.

    Under the law of simple majority of the property owners is sufficient, is it?

    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    Under the law, it is required Your Honor that there be a majority in both number and amount as we shall point out.

    In number of the taxpayers, voting and a majority of the assessed property owned by those taxpayers who are actually voting them.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="198.136" stopTime="198.980">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That wasn't clear.
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="198.980" stopTime="455.980">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    Yes sir. 
    All revenue -- it's important to note that all revenue derived from the operation of the utility system over and above that first revenue dedicated to repaying the bond goes into the general fund of the City of Houma and is used for general city services. 
    Now we make special note of the fact that this is a utility, revenue bond election as distinguished from bonds which are payable from the proceeds of property or ad valorem taxes. 
    The applicable statutes provide that the revenue bonds authorized by this election shall be repaid exclusively and solely from the income derived from the operation of the utility. 
    And we maintain that by this limitation it's conceded effectively precludes or prohibits the imposition or use of any tax money to repay these bonds. 
    Additionally, the statutes also provide that the full faith and credit of the issuing authority is not at stake. 
    Only the pledged revenues of the utility are allowed to secure the repayment of these bonds. 
    As I shall show, a property owner has no greater stake or interest in this election than in nonproperty owner as neither his property nor his property rights can in any way be effected by the outcome of this election. 
    Now, the statute of the State of Louisiana which required the ownership of property we maintain therefore invidiously discriminating this instance against the appellant and members of his class who together comprise 60% of the registered voters of the City of Houma. 
    Firstly, as I have stated the property owner as such incurs no liability contingent or otherwise for the repayment of the bonds. 
    Secondly, as the use of utilities which property owners and nonproperty owners are like used, he encourage no peculiar liability as neither the property owner nor his property is in anyway peculiarly liable for the service or utility charge or for the connection charge. 
    It's a contractual obligation in Louisiana between the user and the supplier. 
    And thirdly, if the proposition to be voted on is economically sound and this would result in an increase in revenue over and above the bond repayment funds going into the general city coffers so to speak, this is beneficial to all taxpayers and all residents of the City of Houma. 
    If on the other hand, the proposition will approve economically unsound resulting in less money going into the general fund, this would adversely affect all citizens as additional tax money may be necessary to run the city. 
    Since over 90% of the total money generated as revenues for the City of Houma well over 90% come from sources other than property taxes, we maintain that the greater interest lies with that group or classification who pays more than 90% of the funds into the General Treasury of the City and this would be the general electorate and the general citizenry of the City of Houma. 
    The property owner, a review of the stipulation of facts at page 19 and 20 of the single appendix, paragraphs 7 and 8, together with the official audit of the City of Houma. 
    Now the official annual audit of the City of Houma for the year ending September 30, 1968 shows the gross revenues of the city and this official audit of course covers the period of this election which was October 1967 through that same period in 1968. 
    When these two items are combined and analyzed, it shows that property owners pay substantially less than 10% of the total revenues of the city. 
    We believe that the case of Harper versus Virginia State Board of Elections is controlling in this instance.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you really think that you'd be making the same argument with this with general obligation fund?
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="461.028" stopTime="472.039">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    I don't believe it's necessary for me to go that far, Your Honor, in the sense that we can show here that there is absolutely no relevancy and no possibility of attacks being used.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="472.039" stopTime="477.323">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But some of your arguments really are applicable to the general obligation fund?
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="477.323" stopTime="556.551">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    They may be Your Honor to both. 
    But in the Harper case, this Court was consigned with the requirement of the payment of the poll taxes of qualification to vote. 
    In this case, we are concerned with the requirement of the payment of a property tax as a qualification to vote. 
    In the Harper case, this Court declared that voter qualification has no relation to wealth nor to the paying or not paying of this or any other tax. 
    In fact, we maintain that the present case presents to this Court an easier question than did Harper. 
    Now the dissenting justices in Harper suggested that the State of Virginia may have had a valid interest in the poll tax either in deciding to collect additional revenue or in believing that the voters who pay the poll tax comprise a group which may have been more interested in the general welfare of the state. 
    Under the facts of the present case, neither of these contentions can be taken seriously here. 
    As I have illustrated the property owning taxpayer has no interests in the outcome of the revenue bond election greater than any other voter. 
    In fact, as a group, they have decided a less interest as they pay less than 10% of the total revenues of the City of Houma.

speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="563.398" stopTime="580.541">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    No sir, Your Honor. 
    We have filed our suit within the 60-day statutory provision allowed by Louisiana law to challenge such an election and so actually no rights have become vested in this case nor have any bonds been sold or nor has the question become final.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="580.541" stopTime="594.144">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What in your judgment -- suppose we should agree with you, what in your judgment would be the effect -- might be the effect of our adjudication upon outstanding revenue bond issues?
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="594.144" stopTime="660.975">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    Well, without wishing to presuppose any judgment which the Court may run, I will suggest as we have in our reply memorandum Your Honor that if this Court were to agree with us that it may limit, if you will. 
    It may first of all grant us the relief we pray for, for this class action and that no rights have become vested here nor have any bonds issued nor had the matter become final. 
    We suggested in our reply brief that the Court may limit the retrospective effect of its decision to those cases where rights have not become final or where bonds have not been issued as an example, I think we may have pointed out Your Honor. 
    If the election had actually been held then full time for challenge had passed and the local authority may have been gone on planning as they must pre-plan, we appreciate that, there would be no manifest ill or no adverse effect by allowing that one to stand since the time for challenging had passed. 
    Obviously, where bonds have been issued the same rule would apply, rights have become vested.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="660.975" stopTime="683.878">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In other words, you think that when it comes to constitutional decision that we might make could in the first place be made non-retrospective and in the second place that would not disturb vested rights where at least where the time for challenge and the state law had passed.
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="683.878" stopTime="708.914">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    I think the Court clearly has the authority to give its decision to that effect. 
    We have -- they can grant us the relief prayed for us. 
    No rights have become vested nor the matter was not finalized and the Court could limit the effect of its decision to those cases where rights have not become vested and where it has not become final. 
    I may point out --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="708.914" stopTime="715.524">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I suppose that in other kinds of situations we have just recognized haven't set aside elections.

    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    Sir?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="716.124" stopTime="727.784">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We haven't in some cases set aside elections, once they've been held even if they were held under an unconstitutional apportionment plans. 
    We just recognized that de facto.
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="727.784" stopTime="759.642">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I appreciate that and I can sincerely differentiate between the dire consequences the Court might have encountered in saying that we will wholly completely legislate your ill apportion and therefore acts passed are invalid. 
    Rights may have become vested. 
    The Court has an obligation to preserve order and I think this was to a large extent the Court's concern preserving the due process of order, so to speak. 
    In this case this does not occur Your Honor. 
    No rights have become vested in this instance.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="759.642" stopTime="763.923">
    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="766.485" stopTime="785.453">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    Where the bonds have been issued as we have spoken with Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    Where bonds have been issued, rights have become final and vested. 
    And we see no difficulty in the Court limiting the effect of its decision, clearly, to those cases where rights have not become vested such as in this case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="785.453" stopTime="790.134">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We don't need to do it in terms of retrospective effect of the constitutional decisions, do we?

    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    I'm sorry sir?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    We don't need to do it in terms of retroactivity or prospectivity, do we?
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="797.289" stopTime="868.148">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    I'm not sure Your Honor that at which time you may have to do it. 
    This is one suggestion only of the way in which you may do it in keeping what we consider the ruling of this Court in the Mapp and Linkletter decisions. 
    It's an analogy to the application of this Court of the Mapp decision and the Linkletter case. 
    We may additionally point out in this case, Your Honor that not only is the qualification of paying a tax violative of the Fourteenth Amendment as set forth in the Harper case but the -- the qualification of wealth is given added emphasis. 
    In this case, the property tax presupposes the ownership of property in addition to the payment of this tax and the degree of wealth is even made a factor in the present case by the statutory requirement that the proposition be voted favorably upon by a majority in number of voters and a majority in the assessed evaluation of the property owned by the voters. 
    Therefore, the wealthier vote is given a weighted effect. 
    The wealthier man has a weightier vote. 
    It is appellant's decision --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="868.148" stopTime="871.173">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The richest man in town might not own any real estate at all.
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="871.173" stopTime="1056.387">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    That is correct sir but if this rich man owns real estate, he is given a weighted vote. 
    The court below surmised some possible rational purpose for the limitation and we submit that absolutely non-exist for the three reasons that we have previously given this Court. 
    Appellees have previously advanced the purpose that advance the suggestion that the legislative purpose for the distinction in this voter classification was and I quote, “The desire to place a check upon borrowing by governmental units at page 5 of the trial brief.” 
    We submit that if that classification was permissible, it has no relevance or whatsoever to the purpose of this legislation. 
    To the contrary, the total absence of liability peculiar to the taxpayer or to his property effectively invites him to vote with more or less unrestrained enthusiasm. 
    Exhibits P1 through P7 clearly show that the proponents of the bond issued constantly advice the taxpayers that a favorable vote would protect his low property tax rate and no new taxes could be added. 
    In the present case, all citizens have an equal proprietary interest in revenues, equal proprietary interest in city owned properties. 
    All citizens pay taxes into the general fund as we have shown a comparison of the 1968 audit of the fiscal year ending September 30, 1968 together with the stipulation of fact shows that well over 90% of the revenues are paid by the general electorate of the general citizenry. 
    Now, we maintain that there's absolutely no justification Your Honor, for this classification as set forth in this particular statute. 
    I may call to this Court's attention the fact that a casual comparison if we have set forth in our brief of the three different sections of Chapter 10 of the Title 33 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes indicates that the legislature provided three different methods for submitting the same general proposition to the voters. 
    Subsection B provides for a bond election, subsection D and subsection C -- B, C, and D. 
    The city elected to use subsection C and of the three subsections, this is the only one that restricts the vote to property owners. 
    Strangely enough, subsection B and subsection D both dealing with the same proposition, both dealing with the same authority, both pledging revenues and city properties owned by everybody, two sections allow everybody to vote, one section allows only property owner. 
    We submit that there is absolutely no justification for the distinction.

    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    We maintain Act 33 of the Special Section of 1968 Your Honor has no bearing whatsoever upon this case. 
    As we have tried to point out to the Court in our reply memorandum, the appellees cite a particular paragraph as being a paragraph ratifying this election. 
    Number one, it is very strange to us that The paragraph which appellees claim ratifies this election never uses the word ratifies, confirms, or in any way have sense to it. 
    The next paragraph dealing with previously issued bonds which is not the case here does use these words, ratify and confirmed. 
    Your Honor may find the statute quoted at page 17 of the appellees brief. 
    I did not reprint it as the appellees have reprinted the Act at page 17 of his brief. 
    We maintain that certainly it was not the intention of the legislature to ratify this election. 
    Secondly, we maintain that the legislature cannot ratify action taken under and unconstitutional state act in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    To do so, puts an action of the state legislature of Louisiana on equal footing with Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    We agree with you Your Honor that it would not have been necessary for the State of Louisiana probably to require an election but under Harper, once an election is granted, once the franchise is granted, it must be consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The classification --

    So that if the State of Louisiana here had passed an appropriate statute, presumably and there had been no election, then your position would be different with respect to the force of that state statute, would it not?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well then the -- if you're correct and if that would nullify the election that was held and this statute of your State of Louisiana says that the governing body may proceed with the issuance and sale of the bonds whether or not the election is a valuable action.
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="1261.343" stopTime="1341.256">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    But I point this out to you Your Honor. 
    If you'll notice the language of the statute itself, it says that in the event a property taxpayer's election, I'm quoting form page 18 the last paragraph of appellee's brief where he has set forth the statute, “In the event a property taxpayer's election has heretofore been held and promulgated approving the issuance of the bonds.” 
    Now, even if we were to conceive which we do not that the State of Louisiana has the authority to validate an unconstitutional act, this act in itself is unconstitutional. 
    We maintain and that it recognizes the unfair advantage given to the property owner because this paragraph requires that you have had an election and obviously you must have had it under this present statute the city has chosen subpart C. 
    And if you have had an election, it must have passed. 
    So this paragraph recognizes the discrimination and requiring a previous election and that it have been passed. 
    You could not do it, according to this paragraph, if the City of Houma have had an election and the bonds have been voted down, this paragraph would not be applicable. 
    And we maintain even to the extent that they recognize the discrimination of the present statute in this Act, this Act itself would not be applicable even if they had the power to do it which we deny.

    Mr. Eugene E. Huppenbauer, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    There are really only two issues that this Court need consider itself within this case. 
    Of course, there is the constitutional issue and I think more importantly is the effect of a decision of this Court which may invalidate the procedure under which this bond election was held. 
    You will note in the brief filed by the intervenor State of Louisiana and the Louisiana Municipal Association that there are 14 states in United States which have similar voting requirement statutes. 
    In every instance, of course, this requirement is applicable to general obligation bonds and in most instances, a property taxpayer election is likewise required on the revenue issue. 
    Now, before I discuss whether or not the relief or the decision of the Court should be prospective or retrospective, certainly there will be serious nationwide consequences to municipal securities if the retroactivity of this decision goes back totally or even partially. 
    Nevertheless, there are few relevant facts which I think this Court should be apprised of and one deals with the statistics set forth in the factual situation before the Court. 
    Appellant contends that there are 11,600 registered voters but there are only 4,680 registered property taxpayer voters. 
    This 4,600 was taken from the assessment rolls and the registrar's office. 
    Now, Louisiana is a community property state. 
    Property may be assessed and in most instances is assessed in the name of a husband. 
    But the wife is likewise entitled to vote. 
    She will show not up as a property taxpayer voter on the assessment roll. 
    Therefore, the argument that there are 6,900 people eligible to vote who could not vote is substantially diluted by the spouses of those registered property taxpayers. 
    And likewise in many instances where property was owned by a parent who is now deceased where the state have not been probated through the courts, the property is still assessed in the (Inaudible) name. 
    If they left six or seven children, all six or seven would be entitled to vote. 
    So, we submit that the statistics are not wholly correct. 
    There was no way which correct whole legitimate statistics could be provided in this case. 
    Furthermore, this plaintiff, this appellant brought this action to enjoin the election and also the issuance of the bonds. 
    Now, he brought the action some 55 days after the election was held. 
    The record clearly shows the appellant is the district manager of a private utility operating in this area. 
    He said that he did not vote because he felt like the election would be defeated. 
    We go back to the same antagonism here of public versus private power. 
    No other individual has joined this class action other than this particular plaintiff.

speaker="eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr" startTime="1550.181" stopTime="1551.746">
    Mr. Eugene E. Huppenbauer, Jr. 
    This is purely for expansion.

    Not to create it?
speaker="eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr" startTime="1552.623" stopTime="1695.318">
    Mr. Eugene E. Huppenbauer, Jr. 
    Not to create it, correct. 
    The provisions of the law require many things. 
    The vote here is only one administrative incidental factor. 
    Number one, the City Government must decide whether or not the utility system needs expansion. 
    Number two, it must make application to a state board separately for permission to issue the bond. 
    Number three, it then must submit the issue to the voter who has a veto power we admit. 
    But he also has only one segment of this deal. 
    If it is approved in these three procedures, then the City Government on its own by purely affirmative action must then issue the bonds. 
    Appellant relies heavily on the, what he call the 60-day prescriptive period for vesting certain rights in person to challenge the election. 
    This statute has a 60-day prescriptive period after the election. 
    It likewise has a 30-day prescriptive period after the issuance and sale of bonds. 
    In the municipal securities, there is really no vested right in anyone until the bonds are actually sold and deliver. 
    At any time, bonds can be challenged. 
    Municipal securities are not governed by any federal regulation. 
    Congress saw fit to exclude it from the SEC control. 
    Therefore, there is a complex system of checks and balances in the issuance of these securities. 
    These securities are governed by state constitution, state laws. 
    Also, you'll find that a deal will not buy security unless an approvingly legal opinion by a competent nationally recognized bond attorney follow the opinion. 
    All of this act as checks and balances as constitutional limit in debt amount and limit interest rates. 
    The vote limits expansions. 
    The marketplace actually limits the sale and delivery of securities. 
    In this instance, if these bonds are to be issued they certainly cannot be issued indiscriminately. 
    The city already has the utility system. 
    It has million of bonds outstanding against this system. 
    Unless the system can prove itself to pay additional bond, that comply with many covenants and restrictions imposed upon the city on bonds already issued, then there they cannot be a second bond issue. 
    There are all these facet concerned. 
    We feel that the election here is purely an administrative function.

    But the rates are fixed by the Government itself, the elected officials. 
    The bond issue in most instances will not affect the rates. 
    Therefore, the man without property is not concerned about rates and the bond election. 
    If he is concerned about the rates, then he can vote for a new official at the next election to justify the rates which may be imposed upon the community. 
    We feel the Harper case is not wholly solid in its declaration that there cannot be classification and we think that the classification can be made provided it is not arbitrary and invidiously discriminatory.

    What I'm sure that legislature tried to do is maintain the consistency in voting on bond issue. 
    I think we all must agree that the taxpayer certainly has the paramount interest in the general obligation bond.

    Why not have the non-resident taxpayer who may live in another state of another county, who may own substantial land interest. 
    He's not entitled to both. 
    They're all kinds of stages of classification and in this instance the state has saw fit to maintain a consistent classification for the general obligation bond and the revenue bond because we feel there is a peculiar interest vested in the property only here rather than the entire community.

    In this instance, the city had a bond issue in 1965. 
    They have sold two segments of that issue. 
    There's about $2 million left out of that issue which should involve in this instance. 
    They have committed themselves to long term contracts with Westinghouse, General Electric to buy generating capacity.

    The issue of prospective or retrospective effect here I think is very important not only to Louisiana but to the other 13 states which have similar type of a voting procedures. 
    This Court has in the reapportionment case use the prospective effect where they found inequities to exist where there would be dire circumstances which would arise to vested interest. 
    Now, there are millions and billions of dollars of bonds outstanding by not only Louisiana and the other states but many municipalities which have either voted and sold all the bonds, bonds have been delivered. 
    There are many instances where bonds have been voted but the complete issue had not yet been delivered. 
    If you make your decision retrospectively even to the date of say the Houma election, you're going to cutoff many bonds that have been previously authorized but not yet issued.

    If the state had no election procedure, it certainly I believe could issue the bond by purely the governmental agency itself. 
    The legislature saw fit to protect the vested interest of these municipalities that have extended contract, that have bonds voted but not yet issued to allow them to continue to do so.

speaker="eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr" startTime="2394.217" stopTime="2508.059">
    Mr. Eugene E. Huppenbauer, Jr. 
    This Act went into effect in January and I feel that it definite had a definite effect. 
    They would certainly meant to include this particular case. 
    This bond election was held. 
    The legislature said in effect, if you had an election, no matter what procedure you have, you do not have to have in other election. 
    You can go ahead and issue those bonds. 
    Now, hereafter you have two procedures to follow. 
    In the anticipation perhaps that this Court may nullify the procedures already they then adopt a double system now. 
    The municipality can continue under the same system or you can go to a general election where all property taxpayers, all registered voters are eligible to vote. 
    This however acts prospectively. 
    The Act I think attempted to cure and permit the issuance of all bonds which have been previously voted. 
    The same effect I think, a decision by this Court if it were retroactive would affect all of the other states which had similar statutory requirements or constitutional requirements. 
    In many instances, they would leave projects which are partially completed from financing or projects which have been approved by the voter for which commitments have been made whereby the issuing authority or the municipality or the political subdivision could not then find the financing if this decision is retrospective in any effect. 
    We believe that to avoid a calamity in the municipal market in this country that the fairest prospective relief that could be afforded this case should the find that this procedure is unconstitutional is to apply it solely to elections to be called hereafter which would allow bonds to be issued on elections previously conducted where many commitments have been made by political subdivisions.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I suppose that if one were compelled to defend this what was done here, one might argue that the question that the interest, the class that has an interest and whether revenue bonds should be issued is the class of property owners because purpose ill affect the value of the property and the property owners. 
    That if the tenants, the users of the utilities that therein that they were interest of the users of the utilities is in the rates and that their interest in the question of the issuance of the bonds as the secondary one is too remote to justify vindication in the courts as a matter of Federal Constitutional law.
speaker="eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr" startTime="2578.852" stopTime="2602.583">
    Mr. Eugene E. Huppenbauer, Jr. 
    That I think is our position wrapped up very beautifully and that rates are distinct from the bond issue here. 
    The expansion or development affects more directly the landowner if the user himself as well as the property owner who is also a user is dissatisfied with his rates, he then has the right to elect new city officials who themselves alone have a right to fix this.

    Well, I'm sure you don't accept what I said just now as indicating that I've persuaded myself.

    Mr. Eugene E. Huppenbauer, Jr. 
    I agree sir. 
    It's the -- I think a good wrap-up of the argument that we feel here, there is a justification for a classification in this particular instance because this is not an essential government purpose, this is purely one which involves an administrative function of the Government, a quasi-corporate operation.

    Mr. Eugene E. Huppenbauer, Jr. 
    I think the greater interest definitely in the general obligation bond is predominantly in the taxpayer. 
    But we feel, in view of the statement that Justice Fortas just indicated there is more of an interest in the landowner to see that property of developed utility service is extended.

    No, Your Honor, I don't think you can go that far.

    Mr. Eugene E. Huppenbauer, Jr. 
    Perhaps so but this Court in Avery just last term recognized again the distinction of voting requirements on administrative purposes rather than purely total governmental function. 
    Notwithstanding the decision of the Court to all bond issues or whether it be retrospective or prospective, we feel that since there is no constitutional requirement either state or federal, that the Louisiana legislative had a right and did in fact validate the issuance of these bonds at issue in this instance. 
    We submit therefore that the decision of the lower court should be affirmed. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Kenneth Watkins
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2826.016" stopTime="2828.422">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Watkins.
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="2828.422" stopTime="2911.740">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    May it please the Court. 
    There are only a few comments I think I would like to make with respect to Mr. Huppenbauer's arguments. 
    Number one, I think it's important to point out that these bonds we're talking about in this case are not general obligation bonds contrary to the statistics Mr. Huppenbauer referred to in the amicus brief. 
    Although it didn't reflect it here, the statistics in the amicus brief are somewhat misleading and that that the real gem of this is that no general obligations bonds are here, no tax money can be used, and that the statistics showed in the amicus brief failed to clearly set forth the number of states where the general obligation bonds are not in effect. 
    We believe there are only three states in the union as far as we can ascertain from our research: Louisiana, Texas and Idaho that had any requirement even similar to this with a non-general obligation bond in question. 
    With regard to the -- Mr. Huppenbauer's argument on the specter of confusion, gentlemen, it simply does not exist. 
    The state law can be made applicable as this Court did in Linkletter. 
    Whenever the state law determines finality to an issue and at the time under state law has passed to challenge that issue, this is an easy break off point, should the Court decide to use it so to speak.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2911.740" stopTime="2911.818">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well you?
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="2911.818" stopTime="2917.475">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    In this case, the questions have not become from final. 
    Vested rights have not come into play.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2917.475" stopTime="2931.371">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Can you tell us whether every state has a finality period for contesting a bond issue that finality period that is measurable in months rather than years?
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="2931.371" stopTime="2955.444">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    No, sir I can't offhand tell you that Your Honor. 
    I'd be glad to have that matter checked and submitted to the Court if the Court would feel that it would want it but I cannot -- I'm not prepared to give the Court that statement of fact as to the number of states that required in months instead of years. 
    I would certainly assume however as Mr. Huppenbauer has actually argued that every state has some period. 
    At some point, you have to have your finality for somebody to buy the bond.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2955.444" stopTime="2965.896">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I'm sure of that but if it were in terms of years, a decision such as your request might very well be extremely disruptive --
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="2965.896" stopTime="2966.710">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    I would only suggest that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2966.710" stopTime="2971.419">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- of a great deal of money.
speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="2971.419" stopTime="2997.787">
    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    I would only suggest that the question of years is an old probability not in play here Your Honor, as who would want to wait years before they can sell a bond. 
    And I'm sure nobody would want to buy a bond where the right matter had not become final as Mr. Huppenbauer had suggested. 
    They have to have an opinion from a competent bond attorney and this competent bond attorney is much certainly certified that at the time the challenge has passed and I'm sure no issuing authority would want to wait several years before they issue the bonds so they must be one.

    Mr. Kenneth Watkins 
    Well, the question is this Your Honor, if we go into that phase of it, not necessarily a question of revenue at stake but as we discussed earlier, this is a question of possibly using revenue in lieu of taxes and not giving the majority of people a right to vote on it.
