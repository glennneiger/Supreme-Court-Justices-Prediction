Boykin v. Alabama
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="25.205">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 642, Edward Boykin, petitioner, versus Alabama. 
    Mr. Gibbons.
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="25.205" stopTime="145.962">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I represent Edward Boykin Jr. who is the only man in America that awaits execution for the crime of common law robbery. 
    And if he is permitted to die will be the sixth man to be executed by the State of Alabama in almost 40 years for that crime. 
    This case is before this Court on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
    That court by a four to three decision affirmed five death sentences. 
    Edward Boykin was brought to trial on five separate indictments for robbery. 
    And a plea of guilty was entered and on that plea he was sentenced to death five times. 
    Now, this case as I see it raises three great constitutional issues. 
    The first one is that it violates the Constitution, the Due Process Clause for a conviction to be based upon a plea of guilty where in the record of trial there is no affirmative showing that that plea was voluntarily and understandingly given. 
    Secondly, the imposition of the death penalty for the common law robbery violates the provision of the cruel and unusual Eighth Amendment clause. 
    And thirdly, a statute which allows a jury unfettered discretion in a capital case violates the petitioner's right to due process.

    Now, if I may --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="342.319" stopTime="344.385">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Represented by a counsel?
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="344.385" stopTime="563.328">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    He had a court appointed attorney. 
    I might explain to the Court here that I'm in the same position you all are because I entered this case at the trial -- at the appellate level. 
    I was -- I was not even in the case until after the sentence was given and everything. 
    Now, addressing myself, if I may to this point that the Due Process Clause requires that a trial record show affirmatively that the plea of guilty was voluntarily and understandingly made, I think there are three points of reasoning that inevitably draw us to that conclusion. 
    The first is and I don't think it's arguable that a plea of guilty must be voluntarily and understandingly made. 
    That's because as we -- I think we all realize that a plea of guilty is an admission of guilt. 
    It's a con -- judicial confession in effect. 
    And certainly the waiver of such a fundamental right to contest guilt to give the prosecution the whole vote so to speak. 
    The waiver of that right is so fundamental that I don't think it's arguable. 
    That it should be voluntarily and understandingly given. 
    Now secondly, that in order to be meaningful, it must be affirmative. 
    And this affirmative procedural step must appear on the record because -- what I'm saying here is this, that if you look at this record right here, you do not know and I do not know whether Edward Boykin entered his plea of guilty voluntarily and understandingly. 
    And yet he is going to have to die because of the barrenness of this record. 
    And it's a simple thing. 
    It -- by analogy it's the same reasoning that this Court used in the Miranda decision. 
    There, there was a question of a waiver. 
    There was a -- and this Court said that if a -- in a trial court, if you're going to introduce an out of court confession then you -- then the record must affirmatively show that that confession was obtained voluntarily and understandingly. 
    The -- the same thing is true that we are asking here. 
    If you're going to rely on a plea of guilty then the record ought to show and -- we wouldn't have this trouble right here. 
    This question wouldn't be before the court. 
    It wouldn't give the trouble to the Supreme Court that it gave them if a -- as -- the same sort of litany that -- that's in the record about indigency. 
    If you had just a trial court determining be ensured that the fellow knew that when he plead guilty, he was subjecting himself to the maximum punishment. 
    Now, I'd like to comment about this --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="563.328" stopTime="563.430">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What --

    What effect do you think the Alabama procedure has that the -- notwithstanding the plea, there must be a prima facie case made I doubt.
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="578.840" stopTime="592.322">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    Well, I don't think that has too much to do with the -- the issue that I'm trying to speak about here for the reason that that common after the a plea.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="592.322" stopTime="605.933">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I know but his plea doesn't become effective, the basis for reasoning, the carrying out of the sentence out that additional requirement being fulfilled, namely it ought to be a prima facie case?

    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    Well --

    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    No, sir. 
    That's not the Alabama law. 
    The -- the Alabama law is that you put on a prima facie case as a sort of penalty trial where you determine the -- you let the jury see what kind of a case it was. 
    But a plea of guilty in Alabama is conviction of the offense.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="634.018" stopTime="640.296">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean the jury can't -- cannot find the man innocent?

    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="641.419" stopTime="642.301">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, its -- that's --

    But --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="642.593" stopTime="644.001">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Isn't that your answer?
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="644.001" stopTime="736.525">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    Yes , sir. 
    Now, looking at this record, its 35 pages for which a man's going to die for and all that's in it is an -- the first page is an indictment talking about robbery not the death penalty. 
    It sets bail at $2,500.00. 
    There is a proceeding of determining indigency while the fellow is asked, do you need an attorney and he says no. 
    There is in this record the testimony of the witnesses, the complaining witnesses and then the first time that the death penalty is mentioned is in the almost pro forma instructions of the judge when he gives the jury two forms. 
    If you're going to give him imprisonment, you use this form. 
    If you're going to use death, you use this form. 
    And then at that time the jury goes out and comes back in and Edward Boykin is to die and that's all that this record shows and that's what I'm trying to say today. 
    Now, I just believe that the Constitution Due Process Clause requires that that this affirmative showing be made. 
    I'd like now to turn --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="736.525" stopTime="744.791">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Did you -- did I understand that there was no motion at anytime to withdraw the plea of guilty?

    It was too late as you say to raise any issue on motion for a new trial as the statutory time period had elapsed.

speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="807.407" stopTime="818.677">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    Well, the day of the sentence starts the running of the time when you can file a motion for a new trial and that's --

    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    He -- he didn't set the date until the next day when the defendant was finally brought back in for proper sentencing as to form. 
    But the 30-day limitation run -- started running on the day of sentence which is 21st of September. 
    Well now, I didn't get in this case until the 27th of October when a friend of mine told me that he want -- he couldn't prosecute the appeal and would I take it and that time I got into it. 
    But any sort of motion for a new trial, the grounds, excessiveness of that sort of thing, that's all waived unless you raise it on a motion for a new trial.

    About what, which one?
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="907.509" stopTime="932.770">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    But principally the excessiveness of the penalty in the light of the offense. 
    Nobody, nobody expected -- I can only conjecture about this record just as anybody can. 
    But Alabama gives the penalty for robbery about once every eight years.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And still, if we can just for a moment confine ourselves, if you're willing to, to the question I asked, what could've been done within than 30-day period?

speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="941.390" stopTime="949.412">

    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    Well, it's the view that attorney's take.

    If -- if he needs help, even after he gets parole, if he gets a sentence but technically or by application, the trial appointed -- court appointed attorney's duties are --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="988.458" stopTime="989.492">

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- practice down there. 
    Well now, I suppose after the sentence, it would've been too late then to withdraw the plea of guilty or would it not?
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="1002.901" stopTime="1006.118">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    I -- I believe it would, yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1006.118" stopTime="1010.377">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That has to -- a motion to withdraw of plea of guilty has to be made before sentence is --
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="1010.377" stopTime="1210.294">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    If any -- before submission to the jury. 
    Now, in -- I'd like to address my further argument to the second point and that is the question of applying the provision of the Eighth Amendment prescription, approval and unusual against the death -- against the offense of a common law robbery. 
    Now, this is a direct attack upon Title 14, Section 415 of the Code of Alabama which is the penalty statute for the common offense of robbery and we all know that the common law offense of robbery is the its essential's elements are the taking of property with -- from a person with the violence or with a threat of violence. 
    Now, the attack on this statute is because the breadth and range of it, a simple assault with a larceny can give you the death penalty under this statute. 
    Now, in application of this provision of the Eighth Amendment, this Court has indicated certain standards or certain things that they look at. 
    One of them is that it's not a static concept. 
    That's its not a non-progressive thing that it moves with the times and that they've in -- even indicated -- you have even indicated in an -- a more enlightened society, it might encompass greater and greater things and I am saying to this Court today that Alabama is the only State that has this common law offense of robbery with the death penalty. 
    And I submit that in the light of this Court's decisions, decisions such as Weems 60 years ago when this Court knocked down a punishment where a feller -- he falsified some Government documents and he got 12 years imprisonment and loss of his civil rights. 
    This Court at that time 1910 said that that one of the standards is the disproportionate, disproportionality of the offense with the punished. 
    Now, looking directly at Alabama, Alabama -- the crime of unpremeditated murder with malice in Alabama, the maximum punishment is life imprisonment yet for larceny, and a simple assault, you can get the death penalty. 
    I respectfully submit that that this standard of disproportionality is applicable to Edward Boykin.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Gibbons, as I understand it, you are here attacking the constitutionality of the Alabama statute on its face that is to say you're saying that the statute is bad apart from its -- the facts of this particular case would cause a statute authorizes the jury to fix death sentence in the case of Robert and you point out that Alabama used the common law definition of robbery. 
    Under -- I don't remember saying in your brief, a reference to just how Alabama views the definition of the common law crime of robbery. 
    From your argument I take it that any sort of unlawful taking, they need force --
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="1614.290" stopTime="1619.559">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    A taking with violence or with the threat of violence.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1619.559" stopTime="1627.087">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright, now are there states in which the crime of armed robbery is punishable by death.

    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And what happened here was in fact an armed robbery, there is no dispute about that is there that is to say that Boykin was carrying a gun. 
    Boykin did in fact use the gun in the robbery. 
    Boykin did in fact discharge the gun and in fact a girl in the store was wounded in the calf of her leg, am I correct?

    Yes, sir.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Your point however is that it's not necessary -- is your point, that its not necessary for us to reach the constitutionality of the armed robbery death penalty statutes because you are asking us to consider this statute on its phase without reference to the facts of this particular case, is that right?
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="1690.725" stopTime="1725.768">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    That's correct sir. 
    A -- aside from what this Court may think of murder, say, as justifying the death penalty, the question before the Court as I see it and the issue I'm trying to make is that the death penalty for robbery is cruel and unusual, is disproportionate, it -- it comes in a time when no other state except Alabama applies and it --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1725.768" stopTime="1764.008">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But here your problem however is that here you have an armed robbery and you have an armed robbery in the course of which somebody -- the -- Boykin did shoot and somebody was wounded but its not a -- just a simple unaggravated robbery. 
    Your attack must be and well I suppose you wouldn't be averse to attacking that as a basis for the death penalty but the other prong of your attack I take is that the statute is bad or over breadth.
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="1764.008" stopTime="1776.592">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    Is bad on its face because of the expanse and range to which it can be applied.

    Mr. David W. Clark 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In April and May of 1966, Mobile, Alabama experienced a series of robbery. 
    One Edward Boykin was arrested. 
    The grand jury returned five indictments against him for robbery. 
    I would like to point out the time element and the space of the city involved. 
    These five robberies took place from April the 23rd 1966. 
    That was the first one. 
    There was one on May the 3rd, one on May the 5th, one on May the 8th, one on May the 8th. 
    The manner of operation was that this young man went into either grocery store or drugstore service station and would exhibit a pistol and commit robbery and then when he would leave, he fired the pistol so nobody would follow him out. 
    There was one wounding of a little girl. 
    I believe, the evidence shows that he fired into the floor, the bullet ricocheted and hit this young lady in the leg. 
    Now, at the time of the trial the court appointed, one Evan Austill, is the court appointed attorney to represent --

    As far as it appears from what I've been able to a glean, of course we don't have the briefs of the parties before the Supreme Court before us but really nothing at all was raised at the trial. 
    There was simply a guilty plea and then as counsel has said, five sentences of death on one -- on this petitioner and that's all that appears plus some evidence of his -- of the conduct. 
    And then in the Supreme Court of Alabama all that appears that they considered of the questions raised here was whether or not the trial court failed to protect the petitioner's right to due process for -- with regard to his plea of guilty as you put it. 
    And that's the only thing they considered.

    Mr. David W. Clark 
    I -- I beg your pardon, may I quote from the actual record, record page 30. 
    He said, If that board, he gave a definition of robbery. 
    Now, robbery once again gentlemen is a felonious taking of money or goods of value from another against his will and without his permission by violence of putting him in fear. 
    That boils it down in a nutshell just what robbery is. 
    Now, it carries from 10 years minimum in the penitentiary to the supreme penalty of death by electrocution.

    Mr. David W. Clark 
    No, there was no direction as to how you would do that. 
    However, this Court pointed out in I believe it was Giaccio versus Pennsylvania, I think it was one of them, that they could do that. 
    A jury could find the degree. 
    There was nothing prohibiting that. 
    Now, I would point out that in Alabama, robbery is a capital offense. 
    That of course means it carries a death penalty and the -- they can, to a lesser degree give anywhere from death on down to 10 years. 
    And that's left to the jurors discretion now in spite of no instructions, you do have this, that this jury has heard the entire trial. 
    They have been able to determine how severe or a case of robbery this is in this particular instance that there was a gun used, there was violence and they confessed on that. 
    They are the best ones to judge how severe the sentence should be.

    In Alabama when you have a plea of guilty such as we had here, they put on a prima facie case. 
    Now in all five of these cases, I think they called seven witnesses. 
    That's also required. 
    You have the man pleading guilty which is judicial confession to that effect. 
    He had a plea of guilty. 
    You have that plus the prima facie case made out by the state.

    In my brief I've pointed out one that was in 1964 that I handled that case through the Alabama Supreme Court and it went on to electrocution.

    Mr. David W. Clark 
    Well, I -- I would have politely. 
    But in that particular case, there was a robbery and also that the man committed a murder while -- during this robbery. 
    It just happen that he was going with this young lady, he was a married man with a family and as the district attorney determined in that case that there were -- had two indictment, one for murder and one for robbery that it would be better to prosecute under robbery. 
    In Alabama they regard robbery as a serious offense. 
    Now a good attorney could have possibly --

    There was something brought out about a motion for a new trial, usually that's done by the attorney who is appointed to handle the defense of that trial. 
    Also in a case which results in the death penalty, the same attorney goes right onto the Supreme Court. 
    In one form, it takes back, however, Mr. Gibbons is representing the defendant on appeal to the Supreme Court of Alabama and on a certiorari to this Court.

    May I ask you further sir, let's suppose that a defendant were tried on one count of robbery then the jury has a problem of fixing the punishment, is there any -- I don't suppose there's anything like a pre-sentence report or any evidence introduced as to his history, is there? 
    What is your practice?

    Mr. David W. Clark 
    No, sir. 
    Not in this type of case because jury returns a verdict.

    Yes, sir.

    But suppose he had a led an exemplary life and suppose his counsel decided that for strategic reasons that he didn't want to get the question of guilt whether you did this or not makes up with the facts about the man's life which is of course kind of thing, conceivable, I'd badly described it but --

    Mr. David W. Clark 
    I feel that that this case here represents one of those.

    Mr. David W. Clark 
    That is true. 
    However, he did have those challenges that were set out in Title 30, Section 55 and 57 and in the argument last week, I pointed out that if he had fixed opinion against capital punishment, could be the one on the Section 57.

    Mr. David W. Clark 
    No, sir. 
    I was not present at the trial. 
    However, I'd like to point out to Your Honor, you have Rule 11, your federal rules of criminal procedure that require such warning to the defendant and while no particular writs shouldn't be observed by the trial court such as a form finding a recitation of plea was entered with understanding and affirmed the duty, nonetheless exists on the part of the trial court to advise the accused fully. 
    And that's recited from Hulsey versus United States, that's 369 F.2d 284. 
    So apparently in your federal court volume, on your federal rules you have the duty. 
    You don't have to find, it simply show that in the record. 
    And there is no showing that this man was not advised to the serious and sentence relief. 
    Besides that he had an attorney to represent him.

    Mr. David W. Clark 
    Now there was something brought out in the brief about the finding of guilty by the jury and the fixing of the sentence by that same jury violated his constitutional rights. 
    I believe this honorable court in a footnote in Giaccio versus Pennsylvania held that in so holding we intend to cast no doubt whatever on the constitutionality of the settled practice in many states to lead the juries fixing defendant's guilty crime, the power to fix punishment within legally prescribed limits. 
    Now, I found two cases when courts had followed that one is in California, In re Anderson, California Supreme Court on November 18th of 1968 filed it. 
    That was in a murder case however -- but they had -- they under I believe Section 160 of their Criminal Code, the jury could find the person guilty of murder in the first degree and under the Section 160.1 the same jury could fix his punishment at either death or life imprisonment. 
    And Supreme Court of California held that that was no violation of his constitutional rights and this same thing was followed in the Supreme Court of Washington, Washington versus Smith in the Washington Supreme Court on October 29th, 1968. 
    And the last paragraph of that opinion I think is a burden here. 
    The defendant's argument against the death sentence on moral and practical grounds are persuasive however they should be addressed to the legislature. 
    If as they maintain a majority of people today are impose to the death penalty an effort to get the legislature to eliminate it should have a considerable chance of success. 
    That's our contention if there's objection to the death penalty. 
    The proper way is to take that through the legislature and this --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    May I -- I'm sorry to ask you so many questions.

    -- that we must decide it on this record, that that's all there is on that subject matter.
speaker="david_w_clark" startTime="3831.604" stopTime="3852.511">
    Mr. David W. Clark 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now the case of O'Connor versus Cochran that he cited in support of that had to do with the confession I believe but -- I did cite a case wherein it -- there was no particular format that they had to use or nothing -- in the effect on --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3852.511" stopTime="3878.616">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If it isn't a question of format, there was absolutely nothing here, that's the problem, absolutely nothing. 
    Now, is there anything in the record that we can consider to negate this statement that a trial judge has an affirmative constitutional duty to ascertain whether or not a guilty plea was voluntarily made?
speaker="david_w_clark" startTime="3878.616" stopTime="3886.970">
    Mr. David W. Clark 
    No, sir. 
    But all it appears there is not shown in the record, exactly the questions he asked.

    Mr. David W. Clark 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's -- that's all the spoken and written words that were transcribed and put in the record either in the record that it was before the Alabama Supreme Court of this Honorable Court. 
    However, as I've pointed and I cited one case that there's nothing that requires to my knowledge that it appear in the record that he did so advised and in fact say, Mr. Boykin, you know that you can get the death penalty.

   Rebuttal of E. Graham Gibbons
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3962.017" stopTime="3965.367">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gibbons.
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="3965.367" stopTime="4003.511">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I have just a couple of comments in rebuttal. 
    One is with regard to the post-conviction remedy that the Attorney General suggests that Edward Boykin might follow. 
    I -- when I get back to Mobile, I might be able to think of ten or eleven more, but I can think of three right now. 
    One is that he might be dead before somebody gets interested in filing a post-conviction remedy. 
    The second is that in a post -- in a post-conviction remedy --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4003.511" stopTime="4006.586">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Isn't the sentence had been stayed?
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="4006.586" stopTime="4113.812">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    Sir, it has been stayed by the Supreme Court of Alabama pending the hearing in this Court. 
    Secondly, he has no right of attorney. 
    The Attorney General indicates that he has it as a matter of right and yet here's an excerpt from the Code of Alabama and the first case annotated under this Section of Appointment of Counsel for a Coram Nobis Hearing is that the trial judge in his discretion can determine whether he gets appointed counsel or not. 
    And the third ground that post-conviction remedy is not satisfactory is that in a post-conviction remedy, the petitioner has the burden of proof. 
    He has already sacrificed his cloak of innocence. 
    He's already sacrificed the Court's scrutiny of his fundamental rights because in a post-conviction remedy hearing, he has to prove and I submit that this Court holding that in a trial in a capital case if the record must affirmatively disclose, then think of the burdens that post-conviction remedies would solve. 
    It'd take a lot of burden off of courts to jut ask for -- just to apply this simple rule. 
    Edward Boykin wouldn't need a post-conviction remedy if the record affirmatively showed -- now, there's another point if --

    -- if I may just say it --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4114.640" stopTime="4116.979">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may make your last points.
speaker="e_graham_gibbons" startTime="4116.979" stopTime="4131.389">
    Mr. E. Graham Gibbons 
    There is no automatic clemency hearing that I know of in Alabama. 
    If he has an attorney, he can ask for it but there's nothing in the statute that says he has it as a matter of right. 
    Thank you.
