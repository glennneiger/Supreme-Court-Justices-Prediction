    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from an order of the three-judge Court in Chicago, dismissing a suit for declaratory judgment and injunction. 
    The suit was filed by two pre-trial detainees from Chicago, Cook County jail, on behalf of themselves and all of the persons similarly situated who are registered qualified voters but who are unable to get to the polls on election date because they are incarcerated, either without bail or because they lack the funds to post to monetary bail. 
    The suit sought a judgment declaring that the Illinois --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In other words these are not people who have been convicted of crime, is that it?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="67.920" stopTime="68.553">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="68.553" stopTime="69.769">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    They're just awaiting trial?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="69.769" stopTime="290.069">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Correct. 
    The suits sought a judgment declaring that the Illinois statutes applicable to absentee voting are unconstitutional and so far as they preclude the granting of absentee ballots to pre-trial detainees confined in the county of their residents. 
    A timely notice of appeal was filed from the judgement of the District Court. 
    The jurisdictional statement was filed in February. 
    In April, this Court grants a leave to proceed in 0139 and postponed the issue of jurisdiction until the hearing on the merits. 
    So, I will turn first to the issue of jurisdiction. 
    Under Section 1253 of Title 28, appeals lie directly to the Supreme Court from an order denying an injunction and a civil action which is required to be heard by a three-judge Court. 
    We therefore turn to Section 2281 of the judicial code which provides the three-judge district Court is required where an injunction is sought to restrain the enforcement, operation, or execution of a state statute by restraining the action of an officer of the state. 
    So there are three ingredients here. 
    First, that injunction must be sought, that was true in this case. 
    Second, that there is a state statute or general state wide application. 
    That's what we have in this case. 
    Third, that we have a state officer or pursuant to the decisions of this Court, a local officer functioning pursuant to a state wide policy performing a state function. 
    Now under Illinois law, as far as absentee ballots are concerned, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners has the same responsibility as the county clerk in another county or anybody else who was charged with the duty of furnishing absentee ballots. 
    Indeed, Section 19-2 of the election code which appears on page 15 of our brief states on the ninth line of the provision that the elector make application to the county clerk or were existing to the Board of Election Commissioners or other officer or officers charged with the duty of furnishing ballots for such election in his voting district. 
    So that the fact that the Board of Election Commissioners here are the defendants is not relevant because their function is a state wide function, they perform the same function with respect to absentee ballots as the officers in the other counties and localities. 
    Nor is this case moot at this time. 
    It is true that the two named representative plaintiffs are not in the Cook County jail awaiting trial. 
    Mr. Byrd was discharged a week after the election at his preliminary hearing and Mr. McDonald went to trial, it was a hang jury and he subsequently pleaded to a reduce charge of manslaughter which is a bailable offense. 
    However, since this is a class action and was found to be so by the trial court and I referred to page 30 of the record, where the three-judge Court says plaintiffs and the class they represent are. 
    The fact that this is a class action means that the fact that the named plaintiffs are not members of the class a more is not fatal as this Court indicated a month after the jurisdictional statement was filed to this case and the case was Lee versus Washington which involved the desegregation of the Alabama jails. 
    This Court --

    Yes sir.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="324.818" stopTime="387.540">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, the problem is that the class really cannot be seen very clearly until right before an election because it's very difficult to predict exactly who will be a pre-trial detainee on the day of election. 
    One could ascertain with some degree of certainty perhaps that we go to before the election exactly which persons, which named persons would be pre-trial detainees unable to get to the polls on election day and because this class is rather fluid, it's really impossible to identify any names except right before an election but I think the three-judge court below recognized that there surely must be a number of persons who are registered qualified voters in jail on the day of election. 
    Incidentally, the Cook County jail has about 1800 inmates, 2/3 of which awaiting trial, so that then there must be some number of person although they cannot be identified except right near an election.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="488.235" stopTime="491.440">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you make any due process argument?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="491.440" stopTime="777.177">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well frankly, I would like to allude to an argument which might be considered a due process one I haven't raised it the brief but we raised it with respect to answering the Board of Election Commissioners argument about the fact that persons who can be deprived of liberty cannot assert privilege. 
    In other words, if it is a due process argument, it would be that the mere fact the person is detained prior to trial does not mean that he could be deprived the all rights. 
    I would like to turn to the merits of the case at this time. 
    This case was originally argued on a rational basis test but recently this Court decided the Williams versus Rhodes which seems to have put the right to vote on a First Amendment basis and it appears to us that Williams versus Rhodes makes clear that the right to -- that there is a relation between voting and political expression which is protected by the First Amendment and secondly, that the state must show a compelling state interest in imposing heavy burdens upon the right to vote. 
    Now, in this case, it's not very clear, it's not clear at all whether there are any legitimate state interests who are compelling to justify the denial of the right to vote to a person whose awaiting trial. 
    It would appear that the most that the election board could say would be that there's an administrative convenience in not having to dispense too many absentee ballots, but it seems to me that the mere fact that it's a few more absentee ballots to give out does not justify deprivation of such a fundamental right. 
    The board of election commission has taken the position in its brief that voting is a privilege or the voting by absentee ballot is a privilege rather than array. 
    And it seems to me that by calling something a privilege doesn't mean that the state can arbitrarily deny it to you. 
    Surely, if absentee ballots were dispensed on the basis of race, I don't think this Court would hesitate to say that that would be a denial of equal protection of the law, merely because absentee balloting may be considered a privilege by the state, and the District Court in Brown versus Post which we referred to in our reply brief held that where the Board of -- where the elections people went to the nursing home, the white nursing homes and not the black nursing homes that that was a denial of equal protection of the law and in giving out absentee ballots. 
    We submit that the mere fact that there is an absentee ballot rather than voting in person does not justify such a distinction. 
    Now, the Board of Election Commissioners raises the question, “need prisoners be afforded privileges when they can be denied liberty.” 
    I think this is perhaps the first case that this Court has had an opportunity to determine, whether there are any conditions or consequences of pretrial detention which may be considered constitutionally impermissible. 
    We must recognize that no matter how much bail reform occurs there is just going to be a number of people are going to be incarcerated prior to trial and it seems to me that we must address ourselves to the consequences of the pretrial detention. 
    I don't think it's a basic proposition one could say that the mere fact the man is detained prior to trial means you can do anything you want with him. 
    I think he's entitled to certain minimum standards of decency. 
    I think that if the state attempts to deny certain basic rights, they must show a compelling interest. 
    Now, what kind of compelling interest might be shown? 
    Perhaps institutions have certain rules regarding persons who visit. 
    Considerations of institutional security of course are parallel. 
    I think this Court in Lee versus Washington indicated that it's decision in no way suggested that the warden couldn't make allowances for institutional security. 
    But nowhere in the record of this case or in any case have I ever heard that inmate voting by absentee ballots or some -- have -- going to disrupt the routine of an institution. 
    There's nothing to suggest that it does. 
    I think common sense would suggest that perhaps morale would be a lift when somebody votes from behind bars.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Most of the states have varying provisions from physical disability to absence from various localities. For example, once -- the 12 states say that if you'll be absent from the precinct, you can get an absentee ballot. 
    Six states say if you're absent from the city, you get an absentee ballot. 
    One state, Louisiana says if you're absent from the parish, 23 states say if you're absent from the county, and five states say if you're absent from the state on Election Day, you can get an absentee ballot.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    I think that's the only state that does it. 
    Now, we're not suggesting that everybody who wants an absentee ballot can have one. 
    There are certain limitations which we recognize as constitutionally. 
    For example, the mere fact that a mother who has children or a breadwinner who has a job with long hours can't get to the polls, may find it inconvenient, we feel that we're not submitting that that's a denial of the constitution but what we have is something more than that. 
    We have the state putting the man into disability. 
    They have the state judge putting the man in jail on Election Day. 
    And we have another state agency which refuses the ballot and together that's joint state action which effectively deprives a man of the rights to vote. 
    So it seems to me that the situation of the prisoners can't be distinguished and any decision in their favor would not necessarily have to require that everybody in the world get an absentee ballot.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    In terms of legitimate state interest, perhaps it might be urged that the takeover theory that all of the inmates voting together might outweigh a community. 
    But in the first place, the inmates would vote in the count -- in the precinct in which they lived prior to becoming member of the jail population so that they would not vote in the precinct where the jail was located but they would be in disperse from the various precincts in which they come. 
    In any event, I think that the takeover theory was rejected by this Court in the Carrington case. 
    Now, we would submit that the -- that this case can be decided on a number of theories. One theory would be that the granting of the absentee ballot to a person who is jailed in another county or denial of an absentee ballot of a person jailed in the county of his residence is absolutely irrational.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, the first one is that the classifications that the state of Illinois has employed are not rational or based upon compelling state interest. 
    That is that the Board of Election Commissioners or the state has failed to show in what respect is a legitimate state interest that requires the denial of absentee ballots to this --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1102.337" stopTime="1134.945">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, that's the one that would require -- that would lead at least by the treacherous path of strict logic to the conclusion that we have to examine everyone of these state laws and say that it's not rational or reasonable for a state to say that you can get an absentee ballot if you're out of town on business but not if you're out of -- not up here -- out of the state or some other reason.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="1134.945" stopTime="1152.815">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, I would say yes except using the compelling state interest theory that the state would probably be able to show in a large number of those situations involving their inconvenience rather than impossibility that there is a legitimate -- that there is a compelling state interest, whereas in this case, I don't think that they can show that.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    That's right. 
    There use to be a special provision for servicemen which was article 20 but since the provision was added, anybody out of the county, that automatically swallowed up that group.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    As long as they're out of the county that's all at least are required. 
    The Board of Election Commissioners will give them an absentee ballot. 
    And even if a man is in jail if he's in the county other than the county of his residence, presumably, he'll get an absentee ballot too. 
    So it seems to me that it's difficult to say that this refusal to give absentee ballots to these class of persons is justified by considerations of institutional security, because of that would show, the legislature would have said I hope that we make a finding that because of the routine of the jail, it would be so disruptive that no absentee ballot should go to prisons.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, you don't have a case in which the state has explicitly said, we are going to deny the right of an absentee ballot to people who are in jail. 
    You have rather than that -- you have a case in which the state has said, we are going to grant right of absentee ballots to people who are even though they're going to be in this county on Election Day to the following two groups into these two groups, three groups into these three groups only. 
    Those who are medically incapacitated, those who are celebrating their religious holiday, and those who because they're judges or poll watches or something, or going to be at another pre-voting place.

    No, it just bars those that are well, that are not religious that are unconsecrated in the county of their own residence and it seems to me that that type of classification doesn't make any sense and is certainly is not justified by any compelling state interest. 
    I tried to figure out, if there were any, I looked at the brief of the Board of Election Commissioner as unable to find any. 
    It seems to me what the State of Illinois is done here and it gives this Court a unique opportunity to get into the area of absentee ballots is --

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass

    I think the Election Board probably assumes that if he gives ballots to persons other than those named expressly that this would be a violation of Illinois law.

    Some of the Western States, there are counties that are larger than some of the eastern states and suppose a man went from one end of the county where he lives to another end of that county to live in a -- say in a hotel and he would be there over Election Day, would you say that it was -- it was unconstitutional not to send him a ballot under the law that you have in?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="1703.200" stopTime="1803.313">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, I would say to the extent to which he's really the -- really has control over his situation that that would mean, not like the fact in this situation. 
    I recognize that there are problems of judgment in determining when the state has satisfied its burden of showing a compelling state interest. 
    But it seems to me that where we have persons like persons in the army or persons in jail. 
    That person is precluded by an official act from getting to the polls and he would have to break the law. 
    He would actually have to escape jail or go AWOL in order to try to cast his vote. 
    And we submit that under those certain circumstances, the state must show a very compelling interest in order to justify giving him the ballot which can be easily be voted by mail. 
    I wanted to add one last matter and that is that we have a presumption of innocence under the law. 
    However, in reality, this presumption can be willed away by a lot of circumstances. 
    For example, we're beginning to discover that conditions of pretrial detention in very many institutions across the country are a lot lower standard than we would consider human decency it requires. 
    And it seems to me that unless this Court is willing to say that there are some limitations, there are some rights that you just can't take away from the man merely because he's awaiting trial. 
    He's presumed to be innocent. 
    In order to give full filthy the presumption of innocence, the Court has got to say that it was a very important right the state must show a compelling state interest in order to deprive the man of that right.

    Mr. Stanley T. Kusper, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court. 
    Mr. Beemsterboer, Mr. Bass. 
    Counsel for petitioners, excuse me, has consistently stated this case in the negative, both at the trial level and before this Court. 
    His constant statement has been, the state must show a compelling state interest in depriving this small group of persons of a supposed constitutional right to an absentee ballot. 
    I would care to phrase it in another way for the Court. 
    The state has extended to large ascertainable groups of people the privilege of absentee balloting, the privilege of the ballot, excuse me, the right of the ballot has been constitutionally guaranteed but the privilege of casting it under conditions imposed by the state which are reasonable by an absentee ballot, I think its just that, a privilege and so the state of Illinois has extended to large discernable ascertainable groups of people the right of voting by absentee ballot. 
    Large numbers of people leave the community on business or for whatever other reason and leave the county. 
    In 1968, some 15000 applications were received from persons at the Board of Election Commissioners.

    It may progress from one phase of the problem to another phase of the problem and make corrections as it has seen fit. 
    And in fact, in Illinois as the trial court below has pointed out, absentee balloting was instituted in 1917, at 3208 and it was modified again in 1944, expanded in 1955 and just in the 1967 session of the legislature, short time subsequent to the trial of this case, it extended absentee balloting to those persons who are judges of election who would serve outside the precinct.

    Mr. Stanley T. Kusper, Jr. 
    I don't know sir whether or not they knew about it. 
    There are 177 members of the Illinois House, there are 59 members of the Illinois Senate, I would not presume to know what they thought about it.

    No I believe my burden sir under the language of the cases of this Court is first of all, to demonstrate that, Mr. Bass on behalf of petitioners has not carried his burden to show that there is unreasonable basis so that there is invidious discrimination, whether there is arbitrariness or capriciousness in the action of the legislature in enacting this particular legislation, and secondly, if the burden does shift to me to rational or justify the decision then its my burden to go forward with it and you asked me for a reason sir and I cannot give you a reason why a legislation beginning back in 1917 prior to the time of my birth sir, why that legislation did not contain some provision for these persons. 
    It is my sincere belief as I stated before that the legislature just not ever considered the problem. 
    Either A because it wasn't cognizant of it or B, nobody just took the time to bring it up.

    Mr. Stanley T. Kusper, Jr. 
    No sir, there is nothing in this record that would indicate that and there is nothing in the history of the legislation that would indicate it. 
    The physical incapacity that is discussed in -- is covered in the statute relates itself solely to the question of physical incapacity because of physical illness that properly attested to by the affidavit of the physician or of a Christian Science practitioner and there is nothing in the statute nor anything in the legislative history which would indicate that the legislature ever considered this and deliberately drew distinction between the two classes of persons.

    The election commissioners being statutory creature is bound by statutory requirements in state of Illinois. 
    They have the ability to grant absentee ballots in those specified cases enumerated in the statute allowing the privilege of absentee voting. 
    When Mr. Bass came to our office with an affidavit and an application for a ballot with the affidavit of an assistant warden I believe it was in each case. 
    He did not comply with any of the permissive applications that were provided in the statute and therefore, the Board of Election Commissioners --

    Then the Election Board could not under the law have granted that person an absentee ballot and if they've done so they would have been subjected to criminal penalty simply because there's no provision for that kind of a person voting absentees, isn't that right?

    It does not provide a special procedure with respect to people who are endurance by awaiting trial or otherwise and your point is the state has no duty to do that.

    Item which they require of everyone who is incarcerated and he was subject to bail so that they have a right for the security of the public and the public welfare to keep him in prison until such time as he makes -- in such time as he makes the necessary bail and satisfies due process in the Courts and under state law that he is untitled to walk about as a free man until his trial day. 
    So that I think that we're weighing two interests now. 
    One his right to vote and two, the interest in the right of the other people in the community and also the right to justice to have that man incarcerated until such time as he satisfies the due process requirements and the requirements of the Court to get back out on the street again.

    I supposed another way of looking at it might be to put the question, is this a permissible consequence or an otherwise appropriate deprivation of liberty by the state that is in so state put somebody in jail is deprive of a lot of rights. 
    He is deprived by the right to work, is deprived of the right to go down to the nearby public park and make a speech because he is there endurance by all and I supposed whether one way of looking at this is whether the additional consequence namely that he doesn't have access to naps and tea, he doesn't have the physical possibility of voting regardless of his theoretical right, whether that is a permissible consequence of his otherwise lawful arrest by the state.

    Mr. Stanley T. Kusper, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice Fortas I wished I had said yes, and I hurriedly concur. 
    I believe that it is a permissible consequence here and I don't think that without complaining about the unavailability of bail or anything else or any other privileges, the only one single privilege about which we have a complaint here is the unavailability of an absentee ballot which in hierarchy I think of the constitutionally protected rights may or may not depending upon who views it be the most important right or privilege that a person may have and so I think it depends upon the viewpoint of the person looking at the situation. 
    You may say sir that it is not a permissive consequence. 
    I might say that it is. 
    The other justices may disagree.

    Mr. Justice White, unfortunately I think that alimony role is their call over a county jail and Cook County has loaded with people who got some money, who just don't want to pay it up so therefore they can't get out of jail and there I think as a matter of fact, there're great number of people.

    Mr. Stanley T. Kusper, Jr. 
    Aptly put. 
    I don't know whether that would be a denial of equal protection. 
    I certainly don't think that given the option to put up bail to go vote, they're making the choice themselves as to whether or not they should have the franchise in person at polling place and having been giving that option and having exercise it in the negative that would be a denial.

    No, and I very firmly say no because I think that's what gets to the point of this entire case. 
    Will a statute which does substantial good and substantial justice which does a statute would reaches great numbers of people to facilitate their casting their ballot, to exercise of their franchise. 
    That's the statute because it reduces itself to two persons out of a possible 2000 or 1800. 
    Out of a possible eight million registered in the State of Illinois. 
    Does the statute have to stricken down as unconstitutional as violative of equal protection of the laws because two people can't get out to vote and two people can't make an application for absentee ballot under the law of Illinois?

    He was representing them on many matters. 
    He could have possibly gone before the Court on habeas corpus that was not tried and all we had was this application that came in on the last possible day for application prior to the election itself.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is that on three?
speaker="stanley_t_kusper_jr" startTime="3236.628" stopTime="3362.149">
    Mr. Stanley T. Kusper, Jr. 
    In three instances I believe that what happened. 
    In going back to a subject that was raised and discussed by Mr. Justice Fortas that relative to the varying provisions for absentee ballot in the various states of this union in speaking with the solicitor general and the break just after he argued his case. 
    His wife received an absentee ballot in the State of Massachusetts as a physically disabled person only because she was in a community twice removed from the community in which she lived. 
    In other word, if she was in the town adjacent to the city or town in which she lived and was physically disable, under Massachusetts law she could not have receive and absentee ballot, she had to get one town in between and move to a third town outside to be able to get an absentee ballot. 
    Now, if absentee balloting is going to be looked at with a very caustic eye to see whether or not it denies equal protection of the laws then maybe that kind of statute too should be scrutinized and I would venture to say that in almost every instance having studied election laws at the various states being a member of Illinois election laws commission staff counsel working on recatication. 
    I can see that if this case where to decide, this Court were to decide that Illinois statute was unconstitutional that the great bulk of the statutes concerning absentee balloting would then immediately be suspect and subject to challenge on the same ground because there are some provisions which I think or even more unfair on other states than they are at Illinois. 
    If this be unfair at all assuming argue and that it could unfair but I think what we have here is unintentional omission of the legislature, no intention, no malice, no purpose fullness at all, no discrimination, they're just a classification made by the legislature and a valid attempt to extend the privilege of absentee balloting to large ascertainable groups of persons that has just simply missed in its application, one small and I might even add miniscule group of persons, two persons is all we've had notwithstanding the fact --

    First is to the question about a writ of habeas corpus, I'm responsible for that phrase writ of habeas corpus at both tandem, I thought it was theoretically possible but I -- in discussions and this is off the record but I represent to the Court in discussions with the chief judge of the criminal division that whether persons could be taken over is sort of laugh the idea and didn't think it was feasible at all to have reach Supreme people over -- have deputy sheriffs to accompany them to the polls. 
    With reference to the legitimate state interest to prevent fraud, I would say that if there where state provision that said no absentee ballot for anybody in the jail that would be one thing. 
    But presumably these ballots can be given the persons in jail in another county and the likelihood of fraud is just as great and --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why would it be if its added part of term maybe that -- well, the deputy sheriff would have been glad to do it?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3777.335" stopTime="3779.793">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, it seems on me that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3779.793" stopTime="3788.013">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But you have to go and attack the constitutionality of the law, everybody has attacked constitutionality of the law.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3788.013" stopTime="3801.994">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, we would submit that in terms of the consequences of pretrial detention that this is an impermissible one and this is -- absentee balloting is the only way we can meaningfully talk about a person in jail voting.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3801.994" stopTime="3811.317">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I suppose you had to (Inaudible) to the voting place, (Inaudible)
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3811.317" stopTime="3815.348">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, I suppose deputy sheriff would have to go in there and that would be rather inconsistent --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3815.348" stopTime="3817.248">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Would that violate another provision going on?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3817.248" stopTime="3823.354">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    That would certainly violate secrecy which would not be violated if an absentee ballot were cast in jail with the present of a notary.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3823.354" stopTime="3827.589">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But why would they have to go in there with you into the booth?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3827.589" stopTime="3828.561">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It might not be there --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3828.561" stopTime="3833.230">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Your taking to be witnesses and trials all the time I would say and nobody has to go into witness --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3833.230" stopTime="3835.719">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    He is a small --
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3835.719" stopTime="3862.342">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, I would say this that I made the value judgment and I'm responsible for that that after discussing this thing with the chief judge of the criminal division, I felt that his position was reasonable and that the only way to talk meaningfully about voting is voting by mail rather than in person. 
    And if the right to vote by absentee ballot cannot obtain -- be obtained from this Court, I suppose we'll have to try to exhaust the other possibility legally and see if we could --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3862.342" stopTime="3865.360">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That is the Illinois legislature?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3865.360" stopTime="3874.906">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    No, that is filing of petitions for writ habeas corpus at both tandem to see if we can show that the state is foreclosing all avenues of voting back pre-trial detainees.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3874.906" stopTime="3876.963">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It occurred to you this might be a legislative matter.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3876.963" stopTime="3880.297">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think you could find enough prisoners with that much interest in voting?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3880.297" stopTime="3900.238">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, I don't know that's one of the activities about legal aid project is to try to get people interested in their citizenship rights because at present they seems to be more interested in taking there grievances to the street than to the ballot box. 
    Thank you your honor.
