Dunbar-Stanley Studios, Inc. v. Alabama

    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Now push the Drummer case. 
    This is the Drummer case, this was just different. 
    The Drummer case is the states have sought to license the solicitation of orders in the state out of this series of events. 
    This Court has unanimously so far as I recall held that you cannot split them up into solicitation and put the tax on that -- where there is this interstate activity throughout.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="27.867" stopTime="48.912">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well it seems to me that the complicating factor here is that this could be regarded as a J.C. Penny operation. 
    J.C. Penny rounds up the children and does the selling and delivers the photographs after their maid, as I recall the facts here.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="48.912" stopTime="49.970">
    Unknown Speaker 
    That’s correct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="49.970" stopTime="57.003">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And that -- and in that sense it is different from the typical Drummer case.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="57.003" stopTime="58.154">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    True.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="58.154" stopTime="88.358">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And then you have these out of state photographers who come in and expose film and send the film out of state to be developed. 
    And they the film, then the photographs are sent back to J.C. Penny, so you have them. 
    Situation here that is a little complicated in the intermingling of intra and interstate aspects a little more than mingling than some of the others on that book.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="88.358" stopTime="117.887">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    That’s true. 
    Now of course, response number one, this case doesn’t involve J.C. Penny as the court is aware, the assessment was made against us. 
    And in the appendix it’s pretty clear that the state was very anxious to see to it that no agency was developed between Penny and tax payer and this is true, there isn’t any agency. 
    But this is a slightly different case than the Drummer case as you say where he has no claim.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="117.887" stopTime="127.243">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well the tax is not imposed on J.C. Penny, but the facts inevitably and inescapably involve J.C. Penny.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="127.243" stopTime="190.198">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Well, maybe Your Honor recalls the city case, which is before this Court and we went off on that point there and we don’t think we should have gone off on it. 
    But nevertheless, there they insisted that my suit for declaratory judgment to hold up this, fifty dollar a day license, which of course this is destructive. 
    I mean this stands we are gone, we can’t sell it up for $0.59 maybe pictures to make that kind of a license. 
    But there, after we got to court they met us by saying well you’re the wrong person and we said, no, you tried to put in jail and we are the ones that’s interested, we are the ones that’s going to pay it and this is not the J.C. Penny, it’s not quite like a leased section of a department store, where there, you know the department store will get an overall catch all license and then they will lease out various parts of the departments to. 
    But we are not quite that, we come and go, we come and go at Penny’s.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You’re not quite, but somewhat.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="192.765" stopTime="241.860">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Well somewhat, yes that’s true, but now I would like to emphasize one thing, we deliberately do business this way. 
    That is to say we want a local business where a disgruntle customer or anyone like that has someone to go to. 
    We are not unaware of the fact that there has been criticism of transient photographers, just as there has been criticism of transient operators of any kind, where a man spends his money and can protect himself. 
    So we are very proud of our product, we think we have a good baby picture. 
    But we want the customer to know that he’s got someone with this sort of reputation that J.C. Penny has, that he can come to see about us and this is, we deliberately encourage that but we want to, because we think that’s good.

    Mr. J. Edward Thornton

    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Well, this --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="442.979" stopTime="450.559">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It’s really license on interstate commerce because it isn’t discriminatory, without reason anyway, is it?
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="450.559" stopTime="526.647">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Well, this of course is the plot we want most of all, but if I may on page 27 of the brief, the reason they held The Supreme Court of Alabama held, the reason they held that we were subject to a transient or itinerant license, was because it says this, true in the branch operation, this had to do with Olan Mills case, page 27, there is a fixed location. But it sends its film back to Chattanooga to be processed and the pictures are ultimately made in Chattanooga. 
    Now on this basis you see it was because of this interstate activity that the transient or the $5 a week license is imposed rather than the $25 a year license. 
    Now we say this is a direct discrimination against interstate activity. 
    Now as to the equal protection clause, as to the state making a difference between itinerant photographers and resident photographers, we may make no point on that. 
    Have I made myself reasonably clear? 
    I would reserve the remaining time for rebuttal. 
   
   
   
   Argument of William H. Burton
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="526.647" stopTime="529.477">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Burton.
speaker="william_h_burton" startTime="529.477" stopTime="780.636">
    Mr. William H. Burton 
    Gentlemen, in biased instanced here, it seems that the appellant rather accuses the State of Alabama and the City of Mobile of entering into some kind of evil conspiracy to put this company out of business. 
    But actually the tax levied by the state has nothing whatsoever to do with the tax levied by the city, they are two separate and distinct entities and there is no evidence in the record that there was any kind of collusion or conspiracy here between the state and the city. 
    Now as any if there, where there is a confusion it is in this field of interstate commerce. 
    And as I read the cases, if there is one universal principle that applies to all cases it is that each case stands on its own shoes, on its own facts. 
    Now this particular case, not in this case but in similar cases where the state has assessed this licensed action, against photographers operating for Olan Mills, the Supreme Court of Alabama on not one, but on three occasions has held that this tax is directed at the photographer and the individual photographer. 
    That is a person who comes in and takes the picture. 
    Now we disagree with counsel for the appellant that the Court has said that it’s now sending the films out of the state. 
    If that were true, I wouldn’t be here arguing the case. 
    But what the Supreme Court of Alabama has held in defining the characteristics of this tax. 
    And its authoritative meaning is that it’s directed at the individual photographer and on his activities in the state more or less conducting the setting and taking the picture. 
    And if you read the license, it says, actually this license is levied under title 51 that’s the revenue code of the state, section 569. 
    Now the first part of the statute relates to fixed locations or photography gallery. 
    Then there is a last sentence there which levies a separate and distinct license on transit or travelling photographers. 
    And actually it reads as follows, for each transit or travelling photographer $5 a week. 
    Now in the case of Graves versus Alabama, that was the case involving one of Olan Mills photographs and it was a criminal case in the circuit court and in that case when it got to the Supreme Court of Alabama, the court held that the license was directed at the photographer as the statute says each travelling or transit photographer $5 a week.

    In other words, if a photographer has a fixed location in Montgomery and it’s been so applied. 
    And he sends photographers out in Monroe county and Mobile county, Jefferson or some other county in Alabama.

    Well, we say that the photographer who has a fixed place of business in a different place from the travelling photographer that goes from county to county. 
    That’s a different, you might say operation and it’s a different class or subclass but this court has said that the Congress and the State Legislatures can for the purpose of taxation, they can set up classes and even subclasses.

    Mr. William H. Burton 
    Your Honor, I would like to say this along that line in explanation is that in the case that the fixed location. 
    If you have five places of business in one city, you would have to have five different licenses under the general provisions of the revenue code relating the licenses and more particular Title 51, Section 831A. 
    If you got ten places of business, fixed location places of business then you would take ten licenses. 
    Actually the traveling photographer can take for week on $5 could operate through out every city in the county whereas the photographer with the fixed location would have to pay a license fee for separate place of business.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1246.299" stopTime="1286.082">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Let’s see if it’s in the last sentence here. 
    Suppose the photographer had just been into six counties, takes pictures in six counties. 
    He develops the pictures in those six counties, I suppose there is another photographer who takes the pictures in six different counties but he does not develop them in any of those counties but sends them all to be finished. 
    Could you charge him a license fee, this last one which would buy him from doing that business, if he didn’t pay the license for the whole thing?

    Well I gathered for this case up-to-date may be its wrong, that in the main what they are complaining about is this. 
    They send a representative to finish, he takes pictures with the understanding of those will be sent out of the state, develop and brought back and they complain that on that business you are charging them a license which would forbid them to do business without it and you could prosecute them, couldn’t you not?

    Now Mr. Justice Douglas, has said that the case had been back, he said that the license tax in that case was valid at the time it didn’t need to back. 
    Mr. Justice Harlan, in that case he says that it didn’t make any difference whether it was an entrance fee or not, he didn’t think that resolved the constitutional question involved but this court.

    Mr. William H. Burton 
    Your honor, I have the -- 
    That’s United Gas Pipeline versus Ideal Cement Company, 369 US 134. 
    Now there is also a case by the Supreme Court of Alabama, when the case was sent back, the Supreme Court of Alabama actually defined the characteristics of the tax and it held that that tax was a local tax, although United Gas Pipeline Company was engaged in transporting gas in interstate commerce, that was their business and selling it. 
    But they held that this license levied by the City of Mobile on the selling of natural gas in Mobile was a local license. 
    And you could realistically separate that activity from United’s interstate activities, that’s exactly our argument in this case. 
    Also another case that we rely strongly on is the Caskey Baking case, whereby license was levied on bakeries, I believe those selling bread to people, retailers, licensed retailers in the State of Virginia. 
    And the bread was baked in West Virginia and transported over the state land. 
    It’s more or less one of the Peddler cases but this court held that license tax directed at that local activity of selling the bread and delivering it half of their trucks was sufficient while the license tax validly attached. 
    Another point in the Graves decision, the Supreme Court of Alabama has held that inherently this tax does not discriminate because it applies equally to all transit photographers, whether they come within or without the state. 
    And clearly this type of operation for the appellant relies mainly on the Drummer cases and I suppose the leading case in that line is Nippert versus Richmond but there the license was levied on solicitations and the orders was sent to Washington I believe the Nippert represented a Washington garment manufacturing company and the court held that the solicitations were clearly in interstate commerce and that license could not be valid or levied in that case.

    And along the line of your question that, where that was more or less an entrance fee, this license if you go out to the probate Judges’ office and you put the money down you can get everybody is entitled to buy this license, I don’t care whether you end the business or not, this is a no respect an entrance fee or really a permit or a license.

   Rebuttal of J. Edward Thornton
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2110.174" stopTime="2111.883">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Thorton you may.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2111.883" stopTime="2197.528">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    I just have a word. 
    I think the facts in the Graves case may be of some importance. 
    Olan Mills at that time was engaged in a two-stage operation. 
    It solicitors who went through the state soliciting orders. 
    It had a photographer who followed. 
    Now when the photographer came through, they arrested him for not having a transient photographer’s license. 
    Question number one was, is the mere exposure of film engaging in the business of photography, and the Supreme Court of Alabama held it was. 
    It being so essential, a part of the photography business that a license owned photography generally would apply to the mere exposure of film. 
    Now it’s that holding that comes over into these cases here, where they say, well now we have already held that the license is only on, now that’s not quite true, it was true in the Graves case, because that’s all Graves did. 
    But they’ve now come along and said, but that’s all you have to do in order to be subjected to the license. 
    This is true, but it’s true in a sort of a backhanded fashion but nevertheless it does show that the license is on the mere exposure of film and we’re taking the position that when that is connected with the entire transaction, which goes across the state line, that the state is not --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2197.528" stopTime="2227.590">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now let me ask Mr. Thorton, if I understood Mr. Burton correctly, if you had a photographer based in Montgomery and he sent photographers around this -- among the six adjoining counties, but all of the work was done in the state of Alabama, nevertheless under this statute as to the activities of those photographers who went around in the six states, the license fee would be $5 a week. 
    The $25 a week would be reserved for what was done at the fixed location, do you agree with that?
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2227.590" stopTime="2229.943">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    I believe that would be the correct construction.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2229.943" stopTime="2258.276">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now suppose in that very situation, all that happened or rather instead of developing everything in the State of Alabama, of the pictures taken by those photographers who went around the six counties. 
    This photographer sent that part of the business out of state, would you be making the same argument that then this would be discriminatory against interstate commerce?
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2258.276" stopTime="2262.946">

    No on the $5 license.

    Mr. J. Edward Thornton

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2273.419" stopTime="2291.715">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, but I gather then if you’re right, then all -- the photographer who now does all of his work in Alabama would have to do to escape that $5 week tax, would be to send the developing work out of Alabama to be dealt with.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2291.715" stopTime="2300.636">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Well, the going out of the state is what makes the photography at a fixed location a transient operation.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes. 
    But I was trying to get what your view would be of the position where everything is now done in the state and all the photographer does is to change his practice to send the developing work out of the state. 
    Your position then would be that what maybe a proper tax now would become unconstitutional tax to the extent of the extent of the $5 a week charge. 
    Well that is this case, isn’t it?
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2334.544" stopTime="2371.514">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Well, no, no. 
    The reason we got the $5 a week, there is a reason we became a transient. 
    I’m repeating myself a little bit. 
    We take pictures at -- we exposed film at a fixed location. 
    Now that should be $25 a year if a license is on it, of course we would contest that I think we are contesting license or could we say in the interstate commerce. 
    But if the license at a fixed location with charges, it would be $25 a year. 
    But by reason of the fact that we send it outside --

    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Oh yes, oh yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2438.914" stopTime="2440.143">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that’s your -- that’s the point you would like us to --
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2440.143" stopTime="2442.355">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    That’s correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2442.355" stopTime="2443.473">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They can’t tax you at all.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2443.473" stopTime="2444.215">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    That’s correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2444.215" stopTime="2480.387">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now let’s suppose I’m making -- that I’m a manufacturing steel products, selling them all over the country and I decide to establish an office, a sales office in Alabama, Montgomery. 
    I establish an office, put several employees in there and the state says, look if you’re going to establish a local office here, you’ve got to get a license and yet every order that’s taken is sent out of the state and billed from out of the state. 
    Would you say Alabama could not make them take out a license to set up a local office?
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2480.387" stopTime="2484.774">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    No, I would not say that. 
    I would say that they probably could acquire a license for a local office there.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2484.774" stopTime="2493.576">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well then how do you -- why can’t Alabama do that to you and in so far as you take pictures at a fixed location in Alabama.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2493.576" stopTime="2498.713">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Well, maybe they can’t.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2498.713" stopTime="2501.957">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because that really, dispose of you -- that would your first point isn’t it?
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2501.957" stopTime="2504.468">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    No, my last point.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2504.468" stopTime="2506.314">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I think it exposes your first point.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2506.314" stopTime="2516.455">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Well then, if it does, I don’t want make that concession, because I -- and I didn’t understand your question adequately I’m sorry, this I don’t know --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2516.455" stopTime="2546.865">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well Mr. Mr. Thorton there is a little more to the facts of this case and just the mere exposure of films isn’t there? 
    Don’t we have in this case that Penny gives extensive advertising to the fact that these people will be there at a certain time and will have a fixed location in the city to transact its business and it does transact business in this particular place.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2546.865" stopTime="2548.679">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Yes sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2548.679" stopTime="2560.437">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well doesn’t that bear somewhat on whether it’s a local thing that is being taxed or not or whether it could be taxed as a local activity?
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2560.437" stopTime="2569.177">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Well, admittedly the more local activities we engage here, the more the state has to latch on to.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2569.177" stopTime="2570.912">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2570.912" stopTime="2613.232">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    But we think in this case, see this license isn’t at Penny, if they go at Penny, that’s a different proposition as to Penny’s activities with reference to advertising, our coming into the state to. 
    But here where our coming into the state is purely transient, we come in and out merely exposing film. 
    We say now then that the isolating this part of it and attempting to tax that as a local activity is actually tax on the entire transaction. 
    We say that is attempt by the state to license an interstate activity, which they can’t do and so the $25 license should not apply if I am keeping myself straight.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2613.232" stopTime="2619.521">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And your first point and your last point are inconsistent. 
    I mean they are mutually exclusive.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2619.521" stopTime="2621.452">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    I haven’t thought so.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2621.452" stopTime="2622.091">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What?
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2622.091" stopTime="2625.515">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    I hadn’t thought so.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2625.515" stopTime="2631.319">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Because your last point starts out with the proposition that we are taking photographs in a fixed location.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2631.319" stopTime="2632.171">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2632.171" stopTime="2636.485">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And the only reason you make an itinerant out of this is because we send the photographs out of the state.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2636.485" stopTime="2637.472">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    That is correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2637.472" stopTime="2644.260">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But if you say you’re taking photographs in fixed location, it seems to me they would be able to put the $25 charge on you.
speaker="j_edward_thornton" startTime="2644.260" stopTime="2651.560">
    Mr. J. Edward Thornton 
    Well, I’m backing off on that completely. 
    First we can strike that from the record and I hope.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2651.560" stopTime="2653.558">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well Mr. Thorton.
