Universal Interpretive Shuttle Corporation v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 19, Universal Interpretive Shuttle Corporation versus Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission et al. 
    Mr. Cunningham, you may continue your argument.
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="16.148" stopTime="129.729">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I feel in closing I would like to stress and accentuate two points as to which we feel very strongly about. 
    First, we feel that there must be an accommodation made between the laws of the Secretary of Interior and the compact itself. 
    Otherwise, we fear deeply that there will be irreconcilable conflicts on the streets of Washington served by carriers subject to our jurisdiction and those operating pursuant to the franchise of the Secretary. 
    We feel that someone must be in position to resolve any irreconcilable conflicts. 
    On the one hand and on the other hand to coordinate and improve in every fashion all of this transportation service. 
    This may be accomplished not by accepting the argument of the petitioners that the Secretary's laws are mutually exclusive and cannot be app -- in the compact cannot be applied. 
    We feel there isn't only that there will be no mischief, no harm done if the court accepts the view of the Commission that there is -- that the compact is applicable that dual jurisdiction does exist that on the one hand, the Secretary of Interior has those ministerial duties and the right to organize and supervise his transit service on the Mall or between any part properties. 
    On the other hand, we feel that the Congress very clearly did not intend that any public transportation service would be excluded from the regulation by the Transit Commission.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="129.729" stopTime="141.668">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Excuse me. 
    I thought you told us yesterday that if the Secretary of Interior did it himself that the Commission would have no jurisdiction.
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="141.668" stopTime="142.696">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    That is true sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="142.696" stopTime="148.007">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Or wouldn't you have the same conflict then that you -- that will have under this arrangement?
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="148.007" stopTime="150.480">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    Quite possibly, quite possibly and I think --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="150.480" stopTime="151.924">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What is the difference?
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="151.924" stopTime="247.311">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    The difference is Mr. Chief Justice that I feel that Congress when it enacted the exemption by the Federal Government or the signatories intended to leave a small area open whereby the Government could operates its own service and follow the traditional regulatory scheme -- statutory regulatory scheme that where the Government itself provides a service that that service is not in turn regulated by another governmental agents that on the other hand where it does require a private carrier to provide that same service, then that service must be regulated and that is the holding in the U.S.A.C. Transport case. 
    That has been the holding if every Supreme Court cases, state court decision that I know of sir. 
    This is the primary distinction I think clearly that this was scheme that existed prior to the enactment of the compact and that those -- what Congress in the state legislatures intended to be accomplished in the future. 
    Now we don't feel that there will be any problem arising under this dual jurisdiction. 
    The regulatory agency in most instances accepts the managerial decisions of the owners of transit companies and in this case, the Secretary is free to contract with this concessionaire and supervise it day and night. 
    We welcome a service of this kind that we feel that there must be an accommodation between the Secretary Service and melding of that service in the supervision of that service under the regulatory concept by the Commission.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="247.311" stopTime="263.758">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But if you are correct, it seems to me that -- and this is not transportation by United States then the exemption -- the exception of in the compact doesn't apply.
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="263.758" stopTime="263.988">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="263.988" stopTime="266.865">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And your authority does exist.
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="266.865" stopTime="267.419">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="267.419" stopTime="295.401">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And it seems to me that that the extent of the Secretary's power in that situation be just what you wanted it to be and no more. 
    You would have if you wanted to have exclusive power. 
    There wouldn't be any real legal authority of the Secretary, isn't that right? 
    If it -- you would be operating at your (Inaudible), I'm not saying that's wrong but this is a legal matter if the compact applies that you have the authority.
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="295.401" stopTime="331.572">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    I think Mr. Justice White there is a calming wind of authority here. 
    On the one hand, we have the Secretary saying, “I will allow or I will provide certain service on the Mall area and I will exclude what service that I feel there is no rational basis for to be on there.” 
    Because this Congress said “I shall administer this property.” 
    On the other hand, the Congress has also said “we want the Transit Commission to regulate a unified transit system of all kinds throughout this metropolitan area.” 
    Congress I feel --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="331.572" stopTime="353.460">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, why does in fact go so far if you were right and the exemption does not apply as to mean that your commission can exclude this service if it's a transportation service if this choice of the Secretary is to franchise that to a private operator, doesn't it go that far?
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="353.460" stopTime="354.937">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    Yes sir, I think it does.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="354.937" stopTime="358.572">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But you -- what you're telling us is, that isn't the way the Commission acts?
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="358.572" stopTime="389.888">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    I'm saying in this instance wherever a governmental agency comes in and I would think in this case it would -- being the Secretary of Interior, we carry even more of preponderance of evidence in light that if the Secretary came to the Commission and said -- I'm sorry, if a concessionaire came to the Commission and said, “We wish a certificate of public convenience and necessity,” and here is a contract from the Secretary of the Interior saying that we are the only carrier that he is going to permit to provide this service on the Mall. 
    I would think it's almost --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="389.888" stopTime="390.082">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well that --
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="390.082" stopTime="390.987">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    -- maybe rebuttable, but I'm --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="390.987" stopTime="400.315">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- that maybe but in terms of power, if you are right and the exemption doesn't apply you can still say to that concessionaire “no, we will not give you a certificate.”
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="400.315" stopTime="415.784">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    That's correctly right Mr. Justice Brennan and we feel this is what Congress intended when they set up the Commission and said there will be no longer political subdivisions of any kind chopping up the regulatory agency in the metropolitan area. 
    We want one agency to regulate transportation.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="415.784" stopTime="423.705">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, not dual authority, one authority?
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="423.705" stopTime="436.942">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    There only be one regulatory agency, yes sir. 
    That on the other hand, the Secretary's powers to maintain and supervise and administer the Mall still remains open to him.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="436.942" stopTime="439.988">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    If you let -- if you want, if you permit it?
speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="439.988" stopTime="474.099">
    Mr. Russell W. Cunningham 
    Yes, sir. 
    And we feel under the law this was statutory scheme that the Congress and the legislatures intended that not only the Secretary of the Interior would be subject to this control but any municipality, any county, any other federal government agency and in fact we have this going on today where we have contract services between various carriers and various federal agencies. 
    I went in to that aspect yesterday. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, in the Court that concludes my argument this morning, Mr. Davis has remainder of the time to argue the franchise issue and may I thank you gentleman. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Manuel J. Davis
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="474.099" stopTime="481.570">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may sir. 
    Mr. Davis.
speaker="manuel_j_davis" startTime="481.570" stopTime="659.718">
    Mr. Manuel J. Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I would like to cover an issue that was not covered but Mr. Cunningham which was referred to by counsel for the appellants in this proceeding namely the issue as to whether not the congressional franchise granted to transit. 
    D.C. Transit protect it against such applicants as here today for the for hire transportation operation which Universal proposes perform within the District of Columbia. 
    D.C. Transit franchise, that's Public Law 757, 70 stat 598 grants a franchise to D.C. Transit to perform a mass transportation service in the district of Columbia and in the areas which go on to comprise the metropolitan district. 
    Now that particular authority set out in Section 1 of the said franchise. 
    Two other sections in this franchise are maturely important to the issue which I raise namely Section 3 and Section 6. 
    If I may skip Section 3 for a moment, Section 6 grants to D.C. Transit, the additional authority known as charter sightseeing and contract authority within the areas that I have described. 
    Now, Section 3 of the compact says that no authority or certificate shall be granted to any applicant for that authority. 
    If it intends to operate a given route over in a fixed schedule unless the Commission, that is the WMATC finds that public convenience and necessity demands of such certificate. 
    Now, the lower court in treating this question attempted to allude to the fact and did as a matter of fact that mass transit referred solely to transit within the District of Columbia. 
    Now I am certain that a reading of that Section will show that mass transit was not restricted to transit solely within the District of Columbia or to residents in the District of Columbia but applied to anyone within the areas that we serve and for any of the services that we serve as a result of the franchise and the certificates which were eventually issued to us by the WMATC as a result of the said certificate. 
    The Section 3 which becomes the paramount section in this case as far as our argument is concerned definitely points out that the service which they must endeavor to render must be by a given route are over a fixed schedule. 
    Now --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="659.718" stopTime="669.557">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Do all of the sightseeing agencies in the District of Columbia obtain franchise or something in the sort from the Commission?
speaker="manuel_j_davis" startTime="669.557" stopTime="670.979">
    Mr. Manuel J. Davis 
    Yes, sir. 
    To the best of my knowledge.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="670.979" stopTime="678.408">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You mean to say all of them that we see on the street, not the individual. 
    How about the individuals who run?
speaker="manuel_j_davis" startTime="678.408" stopTime="769.898">
    Mr. Manuel J. Davis 
    If they are running bus operations, they must get certificates from the WMATC, yes sir. 
    Now, (Inaudible) to visualize the underlying reason as to why the lower court endeavored to single out Section 6 as not being protected by Section 3 of the compact. 
    Perhaps, I think because was in a separate section in the compact and I'm sorry, the franchise was set out at a later time but the court seem to conclude that is a general reason, it would not necessarily fall within the protection afforded to D.C. Transit under Section 3 of the compact. 
    We have endeavored and I believe you will find in our brief sufficient law and cases to show that it it's possible for a sightseeing operation to be over a given route and on a fixed schedule. 
    That's easy to visualize, the courts have said, that is possible that as a matter of fact D.C. Transit does it itself everyday at a given hour a particular sightseeing trip goes to the Mall area which begins outside of the Mall and it continues around the areas that are described by the respondent, I'm sorry, by the appellant as to the route, it will operate if the service -- if the authority is granted to the -- to them by the Secretary and it's held to be valid.

    Now sir as to that, the District Court went to great pains to set out the description of the given route and so we didn't even go any further than that over which the respondent will operate. 
    Now, this appears on page 32 of our brief. 
    The fact that universe -- sorry, strike that sir. 
    The fact that the Secretary has designated a given route is further evidenced by the respondent's vice president when he enumerated the 11 points of interest, it will operate over.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    No, I didn't make my question clear I guess.

    Subject to Section 3 of the franchise. 
    We are bound by that Section. 
    Now, if the Commission in its wisdom where to find the public means and necessity, require the service, it doesn't necessarily say they must give it to us but it's -- but there is a Section in the compact which says that nothing in the compact shall abridge or take away from D.C. Transit the rights which they held under the franchise. 
    There is such a section and there is another section under the compact that says that the Commission shall not grant the right to an applicant to run over the roots of another operator without first giving that operator the right and opportunity to render the service so that we feel our protection lies within the franchise and the compact.

    Mr. Manuel J. Davis 
    We have authority from this Commission to operate sightseeing services in the Mall. 
    We hold such a certificate. 
    We hold in addition 10 different certificates -- oh, I'm sorry, one certificate for 10 regular route operations in the Mall and I would say that to the extent that Universal was permitted to operate in the Mall. 
    It would deprive Transit's regular everyday riders of the opportunity of riding exclusively with D.C. Transit even in the Mall.

    He does sir under the compact. 
    The compact reserves to the Secretary after suspending all the laws of the United States which have any applicability to the transportation in this area, it says that the ordinary and normal police powers are reserved to and then enumerates various parties, one of which is the --

   Argument of Clyde O. Martz

    Very well.

    Mr. Chief Justice --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Martz.
speaker="clyde_o_martz" startTime="1306.824" stopTime="1439.365">
    Mr. Clyde O. Martz 
    May it please the Court. 
    Mr. Justice Fortas inquiries pointed out that we have apparently failed to make clear to the court that we have two separate and distinct bases for reversal. 
    First is the exclusion of the United States and its concessionaire under the transportation for federal government exclusion in Article 12 Section 1 (a). 
    The second and completely independent basis for reversal is that the compact by its terms and by any reasonable construction does not extend into the national park enclave and does not purport to regulate activities of the federal government or any contract party it might use in connection with the operations in the Mall. 
    On this latter does not abate rest upon the exclusion in the compact, it goes to the scope to the heart of the compact itself and I take the legislative history and the language of the compact that is developed in the briefs will make this abundantly clear. 
    In the first place, the compact in Article 8 called for Congress to enact legislation that will suspend conflicting federal statutes and to graft jurisdiction to the Commission to carry out the compact so far as necessary. 
    In Section 3 of House Joint Resolution 402 consenting to the compact, Congress performed this function. 
    It granted to the Commission only the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the authority of the Public Utilities Commission. 
    Neither of those commissions in fact and as found by the District Court in this case had any certification authority over any operation within the federal enclave.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1439.365" stopTime="1467.675">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Martz, you directly clarified you have two quite distinct arguments of both of which of course are answered, responded to at least by your opponents, but then in addition, they have a third argument depending not at all upon the compact that upon the 1956 franchise that Congress directly gave to the -- to this company, now how do you -- neither of your points really goes to meeting that argument, do they?
speaker="clyde_o_martz" startTime="1467.675" stopTime="1510.858">
    Mr. Clyde O. Martz 
    Well, Mr. Justice Stewart in addition to the specific answers that were set out in anticipation by petitioner yesterday, it's our general position that there is no difference in construction between the franchise and the compact. 
    Both are Acts of Congress, the construction of both raises the question. 
    Did they run against the sovereign? 
    Did they run against the federal park enclave? 
    Did they apply to a performance of a service by the federal government within that enclave? 
    Now, --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1510.858" stopTime="1535.694">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You don't think there are two questions in the part whether they apply even the franchise who has direct operations by the Secretary, firstly. 
    And secondly whether if they do not in other words, do they require of this franchise apply to an operation by the Secretary to apply this, you don't think they are separate questions then?
speaker="clyde_o_martz" startTime="1535.694" stopTime="1540.144">
    Mr. Clyde O. Martz 
    We submit the same rules of construction would apply to determine.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So that if that -- if operation by the Secretary is not involved at all on either the franchise or the compact, then it's immaterial where the operation by the Secretary is by himself directly or by him to an independent context.
speaker="clyde_o_martz" startTime="1559.107" stopTime="1559.273">
    Mr. Clyde O. Martz 
    Yes.

    Is that your position?

    Mr. Clyde O. Martz 
    That's our position, condition that is explained yesterday by the fact that this is a concession contract in accordance with congressional policy to carry out the governmental program within the national park enclave.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1573.341" stopTime="1605.151">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And how do you suppose that the federal government itself or the District of Columbia as a municipal government despite this franchise given to this company by Congress in 1956 could all of a sudden say, now, well, we're now kind of have governmentally operated, owned and operated public transportation in the District of Columbia and we are not going to pay a nickel to this franchisee, we're just going to -- no condemnation, no purchase involved. 
    We are just going to go in business because where the Government and this franchise doesn't affect us.

    Mr. Clyde O. Martz 
    The franchise by its terms permits termination after 1963 without liability. 
    The District of Columbia could do that.

    Mr. Clyde O. Martz
