    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 60, Dick Gregory et al., petitioners versus City of Chicago. 
    Mr. Patner.
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="37.426" stopTime="369.641">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This is a case where the failure to arrest hecklers resulted in suppression of free speech where demonstrators were peaceful and where the hecklers threatened and attacked them for there mere presence on the streets. 
    Now, the defendant in between 65 and 70 or 80 other people in August of 1965, conducted a protest march and did so by beginning in Chicago's Lakefront at Buckingham Fountain then went to the City Hall, paraded there and then marched to the area in which the Mayor of the City of Chicago lives called Bridgeport, some five or eight miles from the loop, the downtown area. 
    When they arrived, there were approximately 35 people in the neighborhood on the street. 
    They marched silently in the evening but when they first arrived, they sang some songs, they chanted, made several kinds of remarks. 
    They were permitted from the time they started at Buckingham Fountain to City Hall, to the mayor's community to march and proceed with the same kinds of remarks, the same kinds of singing and chanting under the eyes of the local police and the accompaniment of a corporation counsel or a city attorney. 
    After they had marched for sometime in the Bridgeport community, at a request of a police commander on the scene, Dick Gregory who took charge of this march and this group, agreed with the request of the commander that after 8:20 p.m., there would be no singing and no chanting. 
    And after that time, there was no conversation whatsoever by the marchers directed toward the spectators. 
    The only sound whatsoever made except for walking was communication by Gregory to the people, telling them that he was marching with them, telling them to stay in line to obey the police suggestion of where they should march and they did so. 
    They stayed on the public sidewalks, except when interrupted by local people who put hoses in their way. 
    Those were removed at police direction. 
    They did so and stop when one heckler stood in their way and the policeman asked him to get out of the way and he did so and then they proceeded. 
    When a countermarch started in order not to join it, they changed direction for a block or so and then resume the same direction. 
    Now, while they're conduct continued to be peaceful, the crowd began to gather and a crescendo grew in that crowd. 
    Now the hecklers as we call them that the local people who came out were not in anyway captives of these peaceful marchers. 
    The marchers never made any noise as I said after 8:20. 
    They never sang or chanted but the people chose from -- to grow and to come out. 
    The group grew from 35 until ultimately there may have been 1200 or 1400. 
    The subject to this demonstration involved criticism of the then Superintendent of Schools of the City of Chicago, Benjamin Willis who often have been criticize for his policies and racial problems in the city schools, an issue of public interest. 
    Now what is missing from the opinion below which affirm the jury conviction of disorderly conduct on two counts are the following. 
    There was no invective or invitation to violence by the peaceful marchers, sometimes called provocation. 
    There was no effort by the police to arrest any heckler. 
    All of the police in this case were awfully good in trying to protect the marchers. 
    They were very good at that and what's interesting about this case I think a bit unusual in these demonstration of cases. 
    We have very little dispute with the facts stated by the Illinois Supreme Court, very little at all but we have a better difference with the city who seems to move up some of the chanting that occurred earlier, and so it appeared after 8:20. 
    It did not occur after 8:20. 
    The only other factual if I can get rid of that dispute we have in the city. 
    They say that there was a crack force there of task force that was special, that was specially trained to go out and deal with these kind of things. 
    They say so in their brief but at page 33 of the appendix -- that's referring to the page of the appendix, it's 103 of the record. 
    The policeman testified that they have no special training at all. 
    Except for that, this is not a case that involves any dispute in the facts. 
    And the police here did a splendid job in attempting to protect the marchers as they went around the mayor's house.

    In your reply brief?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="540.092" stopTime="573.202">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Yes, sir. 
    In this Court at page 6 and it's to be granted after some of the same language it appears in many of this after a 30-day notice that by an investigation of the police department on the application to see if what's said in it is true and to determine something about the organization requesting the right. 
    However, no permit was requested and there were never -- the marchers in this case never would charge with marching without a parade permit.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="573.202" stopTime="574.884">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now what were their charges?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="574.884" stopTime="705.607">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    They were charged with to accounts of disorderly conduct. 
    One of those accounts appears to be that they were -- that they caused the hecklers by their mere presence. 
    They caused the hecklers to threaten them and to throw rocks, eggs, bottles and they hurl epithets -- to swear at them and to make demeaning comments. 
    And the second count was that their purpose was unlawful and apparently to cause those people to congregate. 
    Those were the two counts. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court does not give us any wisdom, however, in which of the counts or both of them -- whether it's both of the counts that they are dealing with. 
    They treat this as a single conviction in their opinion. 
    Now, those two counts come out of separate provisions of the Illinois, I'm sorry -- of the Chicago Disorderly Conduct Ordinance 1931 which is printed in the brief. 
    Now the Illinois Supreme Court found that when the police commander at the scene after the crowd had grown to about 1400, asked the marchers to leave and he asked them about five times and he asked them clearly and pleasantly, you know, responsibly and he said, “Your presence here will cause a riot.” 
    And speaking through Mr. Gregory, they refused to leave except for three or four people who have decided to accept police protection and we're taking through the crowd and left. 
    But at that time, the conduct of the marchers had remained identical to what have previously been permitted. 
    The only change was that the crowd grew and became more violent. 
    At no time, and this is not disputed I think. 
    At no time did the marchers ever make any gesture, any remark, any statement, anything of incitement whatsoever to those hecklers. 
    They marched peacefully --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="705.607" stopTime="711.018">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    How long the -- how long were they marching before they were arrested?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="711.018" stopTime="717.194">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    They're marching all together about five and a half hours but somewhere over an hour in the community.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="717.194" stopTime="738.949">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose they've wanted to do it all night, all night long. 
    Would your view be any different as to what -- whether they might have been -- whether there would have been a First Amendment protection? 
    I -- as I remember, they were disbanded around 10:00, 10:30 --
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="738.949" stopTime="739.568">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    A little earlier sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="739.568" stopTime="740.384">

    -- at night.
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="740.384" stopTime="741.470">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="741.470" stopTime="769.099">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And suppose they had continued in about 2:00 in the morning as the police said -- had said, “Well, this is it. 
    You've had enough and there's danger here of riot and you're disturbing people asleep and if you don't leave, we're going to arrest you.” 
    And they did in fact arrest some of them. 
    They were convicted toward disorderly conduct.
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="769.099" stopTime="769.935">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    What --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="769.935" stopTime="790.267">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In short, the question that this case present -- may present, I don't know. 
    It may present as to whether there is any limit to let us assume for the moment what is otherwise a constitutionally protected right to demonstrate.
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="790.267" stopTime="802.539">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Your Honor, Mr. Justice the -- in this case because the marchers remain silent, the only danger of the riot would have been at the election of the residence who have come out and attacked them.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="802.539" stopTime="805.896">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, they did a certain amount of singing, didn't they?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="805.896" stopTime="815.150">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Yes, sir. 
    But I was assuming that their conduct would remain as it had from 8:20 as being absolutely silent. 
    I think though that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="815.150" stopTime="824.106">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    They have some agreement did they not with the police as to their conduct in what they would do and would not do?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="824.106" stopTime="825.601">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Yes, sir. 
    They did, Mr. Chief Justice.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="825.601" stopTime="826.888">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is that observed?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="826.888" stopTime="857.709">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Yes, it was observed exactly except for when that the three instances I mentioned when hoses were put in their way, they waited until they were removed. 
    When one neighbor or heckler stood in their way and the police asked them to leave and he did. 
    And third, when a countermarch started and they changed their direction to avoid it and then resume exactly the original route set out by the police. 
    So there was no invective or invitation to violence and that is found in the Illinois Supreme Court. 
    There was no effort.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="857.709" stopTime="859.382">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Did you answer my question?

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I'm sorry, it's a tough one.
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="862.829" stopTime="869.127">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Well, no. 
    I would say, I -- my answer would have been that they could keep going because they were silent. 
    I think --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="869.127" stopTime="891.021">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In other words, you don't think there's any limit at all provided that they don't make any noise except whatever noise may be necessarily incident to the sound of feet of marchers at 2:00 a.m. in residential area when women and children are asleep.
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="891.021" stopTime="891.902">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Yes, sir. 
    I --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="891.902" stopTime="892.615">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I see.
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="892.615" stopTime="977.765">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    I think that's right but the Struthers case is not so different because there, the argument was made that ringing door bells in a community where people worked all night should be prohibited to Jehovah Witnesses and this Court said that that was not the reason to stop the kind of First Amendment activity that would be related to night or day or day or night depending on how people were in their activity. 
    But my implication earlier or I thought I had said that they could go on. 
    Now, there was no effort to disperse the crowd and the odd thing here is that the record shows in the Illinois Supreme Court finds that when the people broke through and the police grabbed them and it literally says in the Illinois Supreme Court, they grabbed them -- the police grabbed them and they threw them back into the crowd and did not arrest a single one of those man. 
    Now, the Tailor case that we cite in our brief in the Illinois Supreme Court, uses to avoid our argument in this case, says that in a vast demonstration that when the police asked the hecklers, the opposition to disperse and they did so, there was no violence. 
    Well, that's what would've happened here. 
    The police never asserted their authority. 
    All they did was to protect our people but they never arrested. 
    They had bullhorns, they never asked the crowd to disperse.

    Mr. Fainer asked the people in the crowd as the facts were found, there were some dissents in that finding but as the facts were found, he invited some kind of violence. 
    He asked the people, the Negro members of his audience and others to take up arms and fight for their rights. 
    To take up arms was the difficulty so that Fainer was inviting physical acts against himself or against the other members of that crowd.

    And in Fainer, there is that provocation and that's missing in the Illinois Supreme Court opinion and it is never argued by our position here except by their presence. 
    No effort by the police to disperse where Mr. Justice Black in his dissent in term in the yellow, I think put it very aptly where it fits in this case that when -- I'm sorry in Fainer, I misspoke -- in Fainer.

    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    I think that -- I think then that the police will have to -- have to arrest them with the hostility that we now have surrounding the circumstance --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Will you remember the --

    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    -- because there were many factors.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1210.300" stopTime="1212.457">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Will you remember what's that?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="1212.457" stopTime="1363.766">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    In the next case? 
    If it comes up but I think sir, what I mean though is -- if -- in a number of variables that would happen. 
    The hostility of the crowd, the reality of what he is saying whether it's clearly flipping to a hollow threat that the -- something like that because there are a number of variable factors. 
    But if the police in this case, it's easier. 
    Because here, they -- they didn't have anybody just saying something, they have people actually breaking police lines, being grabbed but being thrown back. 
    Now, that's the difference here and if they had done that just as they did initially when this began, the first man who stepped in front of that line and blocked it was asked by the police to leave and when he was asked, he did so. 
    It -- we could assume that the people of Bridgeport if asked by the police, by the bullhorn would have left or as the city did the next year, if they'd arrested those violent people, not -- they say they couldn't find the stone throwers. 
    Okay, they couldn't find them but if the people who broke the lines were taken into custody as an example because they themselves had done something. 
    The rest probably would have dispersed. 
    So what we have here is no invective or invitation. 
    No effort by the police to protect and the court below relies in this case, almost totally, and Mr. Justice Black's dissent in Fainer but out of context. 
    It says, this -- the Illinois Supreme Court says, that there's an obligation to protect the speaker but the part they miss that comes both before and after that is where that dissent said. 
    The obligation is to protect his right to speak and that is a dramatic difference, and the way to protect the right to speak is to arrest the hecklers. 
    That's the part of this case, I think that's important and this has become an issue that's grown up as we've come to this Court of great national significance because the Secretary of State has been shouted down, the Senator from Massachusetts with the vice president has been shouted down, the Secretary of Agriculture has been shouted down. 
    We have the problem in Columbia --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1363.766" stopTime="1388.252">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, are you really saying -- I'd like to pursue this for a moment. 
    Are you really saying that people who have shout down public officials despicable as that conduct may be are subject to arrest without any -- without the protection from First Amendment? 
    Is that what you're telling us?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="1388.252" stopTime="1629.221">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    No, sir. 
    I was saying that the context of the shouting down means that the heckler decides. 
    But the problem -- the difference I would make is as in this case where those people not only are shouting but they are taking some physical act to interfere. 
    The next question is really the hardest one I'm sure but I don't think we reached it yet in this case. 
    If the speaker is shouted at in bad taste and without allowing him to have his First Amendment right to speak, we don't have that here because what we have here is a physical threat. 
    But it's ominous in those other cases that I've just mentioned. 
    And what happened is, the police decide that because the speech by its nature which is provoking, using provoking now in the other sense that is annoying causing dissent. 
    As soon as that happens and people don't like it and they get violent, the more violent they get, the more right they have to suppress and terminate the speech and that's why we use the term that we think was aptly coined by Professor Kalven at the University of Chicago in his book, The Heckler's Veto. 
    And we think that the Heckler's Veto is what happened here. 
    Now, we think therefore that there's the -- what's lacking is the invective. 
    What's lacking is the effort to arrest and disperse and what's lacking is the obligation to protect the right to speak. 
    Now, we're not here simply to tear down something and to say again that this is a case in which an arrest in not adequate, the conviction is not adequate. 
    I think that perhaps there are some obligations to suggest something positive and I think that in drawing a narrow ordinance as the court has asked for many times, it's possible to do so. 
    Now, the city argues that the construction below is such a narrow construction and they say that you're bound as the Illinois Supreme Court read the ordinance to take it as though that's how it was written. 
    But in writing it that way and that's the last page of our certiorari petition where the appendix sets out the opinion at page 16 (a), 15 and 16 (a). 
    What's missing there is anything, anything at all by the speakers. 
    It's all imputed to them by the violence of other people. 
    Now, for an ordinance were written and I don't tend to be addressed with this. 
    I just put down some thoughts that said something like this. 
    A disorderly conduct is that doing of and act where the use of speech or other conduct which includes invective fighting words -- I'm trying to use some of the kinds of things that we've taken for some judicial meaning for, which includes invective or fighting words or gestures that are menacing or otherwise invite violence with the intent to cause public disorder then he can be guilty. 
    But none of those elements are here. 
    What we have only are instead, -- not our, what we only have singly is when the policeman who has attempted to protect goes up and -- came quietly and politely and responsibly says leave because there's going to be violence. 
    If you don't listen to him under the Illinois Supreme Court's reading of the ordinance then you suddenly become guilty. 
    He becomes the arbiter, and charge in the whole thing, even if he is acting a good faith. 
    But he has made a mistake here in not trying to stop the violence against the demonstrators. 
    So I think that an ordinance can be drafted, I'm not suggesting that we're looking for some system that's chaos at all. 
    An ordinance can be drafted to accomplish this purpose.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Which purpose?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="1630.609" stopTime="1657.776">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    To control Your Honor the speaker who would invite violence directly by his own action not by his use of free speech, not by his own unpopularity but if he would threaten in some way. 
    If he would invite someone to take up arms, taking Fainer as the majority took it. 
    That is what should be prohibited and that can be done by a narrow ordinance.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1657.776" stopTime="1677.309">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you whether your objection to this conviction here is based on the fact that there was no law in the City of Chicago which they charged him with violence or that there was a law but it somehow is unconstitutional?

    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Your Honor it's on the latter, it's that the disorderly conducts -- I mean as applied, it's the disorderly conduct ordinance which is unconstitutional.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="1685.150" stopTime="1705.768">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Because it's vague. 
    It doesn't tell the person in advance whether or not he can march as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court on the spot. 
    It gives the power to the policeman to determine whether or not he may march when all the time his conduct is peaceful. 
    His speech is protected and he has never used invective or invite -- an invitation to violence.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1705.768" stopTime="1716.197">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well than what does that have to do with the constitutional point that you were saying? 
    The speech was not -- was what you call peaceful, that is he wouldn't -- shaking his fist to anybody or hitting them?
speaker="marshall_patner" startTime="1716.197" stopTime="1722.965">
    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    That's right, so that it was protected, and as such, he should not have been -- he -- neither he nor his followers should have been convicted.

    Yes, sir.

    Yes, sir. 
    The latter. 
    Now, in the former -- I think that we've seen that that marches of any size can be orderly. 
    Washington has a march of the greatest magnitude that was orderly. 
    I don't think it's the size. 
    Now we've asked the court to look at an article which we filed that appears in a speech journal by Professor Heyman which talks about that specifically, it's an indictment -- an excellent rendition of the conflicting interest there and he says that the mere size of the crowd and I think he documents it well, the mere size of the crowd doesn't change in anyway their rights.

    Arbitrary means nothing to me except but the people who are passing on the law wanted to mean.

    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Alright sir, in this way if we begin for example with Cox where the prohibition was to march under the court while the court had its business. 
    Now that -- the state certainly has the right to do because there's an interference with that kind of business. 
    But we work away from that and when we get to the point where the only reason for regulating is to stop the demonstrating then sir, I would use the term arbitrary or I would say that it was an excess of the power of the Government to make such a prohibition.

    Mr. Marshall Patner 
    Oh, no. 
    Not in that kind of highway because there you even have the prohibition of bicycles, individuals walking and the marching does not exceed that kind of thing which is a safety kind of regulation.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But here as I understand it, you are complaining that the state has no law against it, which can cover it unless you are far vague in uncertain statute which cannot be narrowly limited to the thing they want to protect.

   Argument of Raymond F. Simon
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2173.845" stopTime="2184.961">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Simon.
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2184.961" stopTime="2331.046">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    300 years ago in Cox versus Bernard, sir John Paul said, “Let us consider the reason of the case for nothing is law. 
    That is not a reason. 
    If there's a single threat that's woven into every decision of this Court, it's that there's a norm of reasonableness that causes the weight of opinion to shift from side to side as this Court attempts to balance individual rights in societies need for peace.” 
    In the instant case, there are 12 very cogent reasons to support the city's position. 
    The expression of speech is in the form of a march. 
    The march is in a residential community, the picketing by the marchers is at the home of a public official. 
    The public official in this case, the Mayor of Chicago has an office which is well-known and easily accessible. 
    The petitioners demand the mayor, fire the superintendent of schools, an action clearly beyond the jurisdiction of the mayor. 
    The petitioners in speech and placard called the mayor a snake and petitioner Gregory threatened to march in the mayors' home everyday until he fire the Superintendent of Schools. 
    A hundred police protected 60 to 85 marchers. 
    The march covered between five and five and a half hours through the evening rush hour and after darkness had fallen. 
    A seasoned commander of police in the face of a sudden increase and the number of threatening hostile spectators, fearing that a riot would occur because the spectators had gathered at 35th in union -- 35th in Lowe and 36th in Union. 
    Each group numbering well over a thousand, angry during threatening spectators throwing rocks and eggs, shouting, “Get out of here and let's get at them.” 
    In the face of a situation which a seasoned commander of police said, he was afraid that it would lead to a riot. 
    He apprised petitioners of his apprehensions and asked for their cooperation by terminating the march and he was refused the way he asked them several times after warning that if the march --

speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2600.660" stopTime="2622.576">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    I think it is a -- judgment of the police whether that was disorderly conduct, whether they were trying to cross the street because they lived in the community. 
    These were residence of a community whether they wanted to get closer to shout their opinions at the marchers. 
    The police thought that it was the best way of maintaining order to take the neighborhood people and make them stand back up in the sidewalk and they did that consistently.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2622.576" stopTime="2624.487">

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    When two people are guilty of what you called disorderly conduct, it's up to the police to which side he shall arrest?
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2635.344" stopTime="2642.219">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    In an effort to maintain order Mr. Justice Marshall, the police have to make these determinations.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2642.219" stopTime="2642.511">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, I would assume --
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2642.511" stopTime="2643.488">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    This was in the face --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2643.488" stopTime="2648.619">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    -- that would be much easier to arrest the smaller group than the larger group, wouldn't it?
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2648.619" stopTime="2689.711">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Mr. Justice Marshall, the record shows that this was no ordinary situation. 
    This was an incipient riot. 
    The dangerous condition was acknowledged by counsel for the petitioners. 
    We don't contend that the police could not have arrested some or all of the spectators and have made legitimate arrest. 
    What we contend is that in the face of an incipient riot situation, the decision of a commander of police where everything in the record points to as high professional qualifications where there is that one shred of evidence indicating antagonism toward the marchers that this decision has to be given great weight.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2689.711" stopTime="2719.653">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But does the court have to convict? 
    Assuming that the police made a judgment that it's better to arrest these people who are not shouting or throwing rocks or anything rather than to arrest those who are shouting and throwing rocks and you say the police have a right to decide which one is to arrest. 
    Well, even on that assumption, the court doesn't have to convict them.
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2719.653" stopTime="2727.598">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Only if they believe that the reasonable or only if they believe the order of the commander of police should have been obeyed by them, the way it was obeyed --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2727.598" stopTime="2731.524">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So they arrest them now for disobeying the order of the police?
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2731.524" stopTime="2760.848">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    No, Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    That's not what I'm contending at all. 
    I'm contending that under the circumstances when a riot was imminent after the march had gone on for five and a half hours when the marchers were calling the mayor as snake and screaming that he should fire the Superintendent of Schools. 
    We're contending that in the essence, the petitioners were the hecklers and that the police did everything they could possibly do to protect them and in order to avoid a riot, they have a right --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2760.848" stopTime="2761.620">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But they say --
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2761.620" stopTime="2761.873">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    -- to maintain the order.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2761.873" stopTime="2765.389">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    -- anything went -- were they yelling snake when they were arrested --

    No.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2765.599" stopTime="2766.765">

    -- or anything like that?
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2766.765" stopTime="2770.868">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    No, they were yelling snake for approximately 45 minutes earlier.

    And they weren't arrested.
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2772.572" stopTime="2773.278">

    That's correct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2773.278" stopTime="2782.635">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And the police were there and the system corroboration council was there. 
    All the law and order was there and they said nothing about it at that stage.
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2782.635" stopTime="2843.965">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    That's correct Mr. Justice Marshall and the reasonableness of that lies precisely in this, between 9:00 and 9:30 the records shows a sudden increase in the number of hostile threatening spectators. 
    The police sergeant said, they seem to be coming from everywhere. 
    The number at 35th in Lowe was well over a thousand. 
    At 36th in Lowe, it was well over a thousand. 
    The commander of police was apprehensive that a riot would occur if there were not these circumstances, he would never have asked the petitioners to desist their march. 
    The city was determined to resolve all doubts in favor of freedom of expression. 
    In the Fainer case as you alluded to Your Honor, on fireless compelling facts and the instant case where we have an incipient riot, this Court said, the police do not have to proceed against the crowd no matter what at size of temper in order to satisfy constitutional demands.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Simon, apart from a -- what maybe a very reasonable response in the circumstances on a human basis, a problem that we have of course is a problem of law and is it Municipal Code of Chicago, Section 193-1, is that the one that's -- under which these petitioners were convicted?

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    I appoint to the first two sections.

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2898.494" stopTime="2912.857">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright, now, let me ask you. 
    Is it the city's contention that the convictions here are based upon any provision in that part of the code?

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2913.519" stopTime="2914.312">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Which one?
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2914.312" stopTime="2917.854">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Yes. 
    The first -- the entire first and second sections.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2917.854" stopTime="2921.578">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, they made -- you don't say that they made improper noise?
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2921.578" stopTime="2953.822">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Well, Mr. Justice Fortas, I have to answer the question in this manner. 
    The Supreme Court of Illinois, the highest reviewing court of the state said that, “Disorderly conduct occurs when there are five conditions present.” 
    When there is an imminent threat of violence when the police have done everything they can reasonably do to protect the demonstrators. 
    When they request the demonstrators to stop and for when they explained the reason for making the request, and when the demonstrators refuse -- now, we contend --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2953.822" stopTime="2955.974">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And that's the way they construe this section?
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2955.974" stopTime="2956.971">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Yes, and we contend --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2956.971" stopTime="2957.505">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And we don't know if its up --
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2957.505" stopTime="2968.953">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    -- that what we we're reviewing in this Court is not this section but it's the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois which interprets this section to mean those five things.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2968.953" stopTime="3032.346">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well I -- when I look at this through -- as I must through the window of the First Amendment, I have a little problem because of the -- I could understand that that might -- the Supreme Court of Illinois might conceivably, I don't know whether it would be proper or not by conceivably advance that as a common law definition of breach of the peace if there is such thing. 
    By looking at this statute, it seems to me that the base of this record, it's arguable that the applicable provision is the following and the only applicable provision that it is a misdemeanor that those -- all persons commit a misdemeanor who shall collect in bodies or crowds, for any purpose to the annoyance or disturbance of other persons. 
    That's arguable if that is the applicable provision here, isn't it?
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="3032.346" stopTime="3034.162">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    It is indeed the gist of the petitioner's argument.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3034.162" stopTime="3057.342">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, can you look at -- looking -- forget it, for the moment about the -- what you say is the construction of the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    Is there -- did these people make an improper noises, riots, disturbances, breach of the peace or diversion tending through a breach of the peace. 
    Did they?

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Not in the narrow construction which is applied here, no, nor in the specific language. 
    However, the Illinois Supreme Court has pointed out as is noted underneath that the courts leave to the pleader the specific facts which would bring the ordinance within operation and it should be construed in the light of the facts which are charged as a violation of disorderly conduct and not by speculation of facts which might be utilized in the prosecution.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How about this case of Chicago against Joyce back in 1967.

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    By foreshadowing Mr. Justice Stewart, no. 
    The specific language in this Gregory versus City of the Illinois Supreme Court is not foreshadowed in any of the preceding cases. 
    It's an excellently written narrow compact determination of what disorderly conduct constitutes in this context but it's not a decision based upon a number of previous precedents. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart is correct in that observation.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You're of course on sound ground so far as the decisions of this Court go in such cases as Winters and in Cox against New Hampshire that a construction in a very case in which the conviction is affirmed by the Supreme Court of Illinois is efficient to remove the vagueness from the statute but those decisions are always underneath somewhat and I wondered if there was any foreshadowing and you'd tell us that there was none.
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="3321.510" stopTime="3396.716">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Yes. 
    In a very scholarly article that's written by Professor Cayman. 
    This Court has furnished the background of the events which led to this march. 
    Professor Cayman points out that for almost everyday for four months, there were marches from Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park to City Hall where the Mayor's office is. 
    He points out further that on several days proceeding August 2nd and 10 days subsequent to August 2nd, the day in which the petitioners were arrested for disorderly conduct. 
    Mr. Gregory led similar marches around the mayor's home without significant event. 
    The decisions of this Court also recognize that the existence of an organized society, maintaining the public order is a necessary condition for the exercise of constitutional freedoms. 
    Without that organized society maintaining public order, no freedom can be exercised. 
    If the police commander had made a miscalculation in these circumstances, the results could have been disastrous. 
    We've seen --

    To avoid a riot Mr. Justice White.

    He was of a rank of both captain when he was apprehensive, when he was afraid a riot would occur, the petitioners ought to have cooperated with his reasonable request.

    It's because of a riot situation.

    We have amended our disorderly conduct ordinance to reflect this narrow construction of the State Supreme Court also. 
    Abraham Lincoln said 150 years ago that the world is -- has never had a good definition of the word liberty and that the American people just now are very much in want of one. 
    He said, “We all declare for liberty but when we use the same word, we do not all mean the same thing by it.” 
    And Professor Paul for in writing specifically on the topic of civil liberties said, “Not only to civil liberties vary in their quality but in many cases that is far from clear with which side the entrance of civil liberties are to be identified.” 
    Your Honors, for five and a half hours on a hot August day, petitioners exercised their right of free speech. 
    They call the mayor a snake. 
    They demanded that he fire the Superintendent of Schools. 
    They came across loud and clear as the record indicates they could be heard over a block away. 
    They had been in the immediate residential area for an hour and a half. 
    Many of the angry, threatening spectators were life long friends of the Daley family and residents of the community. 
    It had the police commander ordered them to disperse they could have at least deserved an equal right to be at 35th in Lowe. 
    When the commander explained his apprehensions of other riots in Mr. Gregory and asked for his cooperation in terminating the march, he refused. 
    He said he would march for an indefinite period of time. 
    He seemed determined that he would march until he was removed by the police or by the crowd.
