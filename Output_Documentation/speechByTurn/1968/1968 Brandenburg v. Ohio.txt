    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 492, Clarence Brandenburg, appellate versus Ohio. 
    Mr. Brown.
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="19.872" stopTime="262.825">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    We have before us case arising in the State of Ohio under a conviction under Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act. 
    We have indeed before us something of rarity. 
    It is as far as I know a third case ever tried under Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act and the first to ever reach the appellate level. 
    I -- there was earlier in Ohio when their peculiar proceedings in which a prosecutor could bring a proceeding before the Supreme Court on appeal for a question of law only. 
    A proceeding in which -- a motion was made in the lower court in Ohio, attacking the constitutionality of Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Law. 
    The lower court in Ohio held the law to be unconstitutional. 
    It was appealed to the Supreme Court in State versus Kassay and in what is basically in advisory opinion. 
    The Court stated that it was constitutional. 
    If the Court also stated several engaging other things. 
    It stated that the First Amendment did not apply to the states of the union. 
    It also stated that the measure of its application was an issue in its constitutionality and it would attend the first trial of a case to see what is the proper measure of its application. 
    The Court waited patiently for the first application to a case that arose some 40 years later in this case and surprisingly despite the invitation here sent out in Kassay, the Court declined to even hear his constitutional question on the application in this case. 
    It in fact defaulted to this Court, Ohio's privilege are setting forth the limitations of the application of its statute. 
    Ohio's privileges are setting forth potentiality of clarification and delineation of a statute which obviously on its face rushes head long into the First Amendment. 
    These are the facts in this case. 
    A television reporter receives a telephone call indicating that if he wanted to he could come and take movies of a Ku Klux Klan meeting. 
    He came. 
    He met some hooded figures and arrangements were made for the taking of a movie. 
    A movie was taken in which a cross was burned, some figures milled about, and yelled some stupid and rather, a senseless slogans and then a single figure was panned on, and he made a speech, a speech full of conditions, precedents, and reservations, hyperbola self-evidently stupid and silly. 
    The --he asserted that the clan was the largest organization in the State of Ohio. 
    He then went on in a -- with a condition precedent that if the various branch is the Government including this Court, do not mend their ways that revengeance, a word of his own coining I assume would be taken. 
    He did not specify the revengeance and we do not know what particular aspect of the democratic process he was going to involve himself in revengeance. 
    He then spoke of a March not in identifying it as an armed march or any sort of march of any force or violence into Washington and then into two southern states, incidentally, raising federal questions perhaps rather than internal state questions. 
    Another film taken is inside the house --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="262.825" stopTime="264.918">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There were guns? 
    There were guns in this first --
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="264.918" stopTime="265.883">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    There were guns in both films.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="265.883" stopTime="267.020">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- in both of them, wasn't it?
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="267.020" stopTime="525.002">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    In both films. 
    There were guns. 
    It is also to be noted that the film was taken on a remote, private farm in which apparently there is no evidence whatsoever that these people were not invitees present on that farm by authority of the ownership of the farm. 
    There was nothing, nothing adduce an indictment was returned, I have to some preliminary move, maneuvering including a frontal attack on the constitutionality of a statute. 
    The case came on to trial. 
    The state produced nothing but the film in question. 
    The only other evidence that the state produced was basically geared to identifying the personnel involved in the film. 
    In other words, showing that the man Brandenburg had a gun similar to the guns in the film and that he had markings on his person similar to the markings and that his voice was similar. 
    Other than this, the state offered nothing. 
    It is critical that the state offered nothing on the nature and history of the Klan. 
    It offered nothing showing that the course of the Klan's history any continuing historical or expert opinions concerning any possible commitment to violence. 
    It offered nothing on the continuing organization of the Klan, nothing whatsoever. 
    It offered nothing other than the film itself and the words intrinsic in the film itself. 
    The state then rests the defense in which I was not involved. 
    I'm appoint of counsel -- appointed for purposes of appeal. 
    Made a motion for dismissal at that time, I will frankly admit that the motion for dismissal which was made by then counsel was simply our weight of evidence motion and he did not specifically denote the constitutional question that had arisen at that point in the presentation of the state's case. 
    I suggest that it is completely immaterial but he did not. 
    The defense then preceded forward and offered basically a defense of the positive testimony in which various members -- officers of the Klan testified as to their ostensible peaceful purposes and things of this sort and the historical evaluations of the presence of weapons and the burning of a cross. 
    The Court then charged the jury. 
    The Court's charged the jury and I specifically asked this Court to consider it carefully. 
    Begins in the appendix at page 72 and met with the statute that thrust itself clearly within the First Amendment makes on its face no attempt to give us a life indication of a line demarcation between the mere abstract teaching in advocacy or even advocacy in relation to a clear and present danger as to advocacy in a hypothetical sense. 
    That in no way on its face does this. 
    The Court perpetuated the evil of the statute by making the charge even more general, in which he indeed define the term advocacy as involving intrinsic in it in his own charge. 
    Teaching, so that we have at this point a man who had been tried with none of the safeguards of the First Amendment applied to the trial of his cause to the measure of his evidence or to the instructions to those who worked to be the triers of the fact which would demarcate the point at which the First Amendment would be operative in relation to what happen on that isolated farm on that isolated day.

    The difference between us is that they tend to ascribe certain slogans by the person's billing about to the given defendant.

    Mr. Allen Brown 
    That is correct.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="667.036" stopTime="671.682">

    Mr. Allen Brown 
    That's correct. 
    The act of showing it over television which entered the plea and intervening parties, the authorities running the television station are not the basis of the indictment --

speaker="allen_brown" startTime="695.085" stopTime="709.431">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    Precisely. 
    As a matter of fact in the Supreme Court of Ohio, we didn't raise it here because we wanted to see if we can make sure that we get assert -- we asserted that the film was in the same position as a book in an obscenity case.

    I know it doesn't help us now but at that point when we before the Supreme Court of Ohio, we have asserted that saying that the film in and of itself is the entire context of the alleged offense.

    I don't understand your point that, nobody but the audience was being people of members of the group were being addressed, I don't see the relevance. 
    The reason I asked that is in the Dennis case, Dennis versus United States, involving the prosecution of communist teachers who talked the Marxist creed. 
    Nobody was exposed except the students in the classroom.

    Mr. Allen Brown 
    May it please the Court. 
    There is this important distinction to be made between the Dennis case and that case. 
    In the Dennis case, the teachers who taught these classes, this was evidence within a total context of a total conspiratorial activity leading to a total action result. 
    In this instance, the state contented itself merely was showing a given speech and did not choose to present any evidence to make it part of a conspiratorial whole. 
    It took the speech in and of itself that represented only --

    Mr. Allen Brown 
    In any event, it is clear that in the Dennis case there was additional evidence other -- over and above that adduce in this case. 
    In this case, they showed nothing but the film itself. 
    They showed no other plan or purposively other than that.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="905.733" stopTime="917.087">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    So as far as you ask us to view of this case as if it were just a group of school boys, hooded school boys seating in a room listening to --
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="917.087" stopTime="1144.688">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    That is a potential distinction between this case and the Dennis case as well. 
    These are paltry unknown rather silly characters. 
    In the Dennis case, we're dealing with the established leadership of a national organization. 
    This does make a difference in relation to the rights prevailing under the First Amendment. 
    The -- but in this given case, there are other distinctions which I'll pass to in a moment. 
    In this given case, we are dealing with a statute which on its very face thrust itself into the First Amendment. 
    We are dealing in this situation, not with an address to an evil from which we must move back to a possible restraint upon First Amendment for there's a dealing with an entry particularly into the right and then a prescription upon the right as it might engender an evil. 
    For instance, the statute starts off. 
    No person shall by word of mouth or writing at the gate or teach the duty and goes on from that point. 
    It denotes First Amendment here we come. 
    It does not say that no person shall not advocate or teach the duty and necessity of propriety of crime. 
    It does not then become so broad that it could possibly take symbolic acts or acting out that go beyond mere words of mouth and printing. 
    It announces wholly, here we come First Amendment and proceeds from that point on advocate or teach. 
    Now, the prosecution in this case has said that the issue of teach is not involved here because the man was charged only under advocacy but if the distinctions between teaching an advocacy was so simplistic, we would have a very simple solution in this case. 
    But as a teacher, who teaches in the first grade that the American Revolution was a noble thing, is she merely teaching or is she advocating? 
    The lines of demarcation between teaching an advocacy are so difficult that they leave us vulnerable when we charged advocacy alone. 
    In order to reserve a portion of my time for rebuttal, I would like to point out however, what I think is the most absurd aspect of this particular statute. 
    It also forbids not only speech or printing. 
    It becomes very, very evasive on the whole question of intent scienter and mens rea, think carefully. 
    It comes very, very unclear on the whole area of willfulness except for occasional phrase in multiplicity of phrases. 
    In addition to which, it forbids the assembly with any group and it forbids not only membership by problem that is been before this Court. 
    Not only affiliation of problem to this Court but indeed even forbids seating down with such group in an error in which they are trying to preserve the dialogue benefits to society of the First Amendment. 
    It is incredible that the legislature of Ohio forbids us even to seat down.

    Well, I gather Mr. Brown that apart from your argument addressed to the statute itself, divorce from the actual prosecution here.

    Mr. Allen Brown 
    This is our brief Your Honor.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Of your brief that, “We are marching on Congress July the Fourth, four hundred thousand strong.”That seems to tie this group into a rather big national movement.

    Mr. Allen Brown 
    May it please the Court. 
    Let me several things concerning --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Then they go on and they say, “The Jewish should go back to Israel and blacks should go back to Africa.” 
    The whole program seems to be pretty clear.
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="1273.406" stopTime="1275.897">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    How do we know this is a program? 
    How do we know --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1275.897" stopTime="1278.830">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    I mean just saying from -- if you believe what they say what the speaker says.
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="1278.830" stopTime="1296.857">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    If you believe what the speaker says, this absurd hyperbola is a program. 
    However, the program is a program of ostensible social reform but does not necessarily indicate on the face of his remarks an intent to violence or to commit a crime. 
    I agree with the Court, it is assert --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1296.857" stopTime="1304.947">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Oh, how else -- how else is he going to persuade some people to go back there without a violence?
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="1304.947" stopTime="1345.749">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    I assume that he's offering this. 
    I agree that he -- we are operating within an absurd premise. 
    Indeed, the absurdity itself may mitigate against the clear and present danger. 
    But let us assume that he means by this that we will now bring (Inaudible) Congress to repeal the Fourteenth Amendment and to pass an Amendment saying that persons of certain ethnic background are no longer eligible for citizenship in United States. 
    He may be calling upon absurd, horrible, frightful, possible processes of law but they might still nevertheless be processes of law. 
    There is nothing in the standard that indicates his --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1345.749" stopTime="1350.632">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Not against something that will go back that then you can believe more that change the law.
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="1350.632" stopTime="1368.843">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    I have -- I'm afraid that if such law were passed. 
    It might very well leave us in the position, Justice Marshall, a finding that perhaps under certain circumstances, it is necessary to advocate violence to redress abuses of law.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Brown, before you seat down. 
    I've inquired of our clerk as to whether or not the film is here. 
    He advises me that it is not here.
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="1378.793" stopTime="1379.480">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    I know --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1379.480" stopTime="1383.223">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Would you just tell us what efforts you made to get it here?
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="1383.223" stopTime="1434.308">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    Certainly. 
    Upon the filing of this matter I went to the Clerk of the Supreme Court and ordered a transcript of the entire record. 
    The Clerk of the Supreme Court indicated to me that since cert was not allowed that portions of the record were still with the Court of Appeals. 
    I went to the Clerk of the Court of Appeals and ordered for him an entire record specifically in my press be asking for the film. 
    We then actually engaged in physical search for the film. 
    It had last in the possession of Sheriff Dante. 
    Dante went to his safe and couldn't find it but this clerkmanship of the entire remainder of the record and indicated to me he would continue to search for the film and upon receipt of the same would forward it to this Court. 
    I have not checked further. 
    I will upon my return to Cincinnati immediately check further with the Court.

    That's not all that we assume because --

    And there is a second portion on the second --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    No -- no, I mean to say, is there anywhere were we can look and see what -- what's in that film from the first word to the last word? 
    There's one thing to read these things, an excerpt is taken here and that's not maybe quite another thing to read it consecutively.

    Now -- now, is that --
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="1492.945" stopTime="1505.607">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    That describes in full but one film and then in effects synopsizes the second film. 
    I believe that the dispute is to the content of the second film.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1505.607" stopTime="1523.767">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You mean, as the -- on pages 5 and 6, can we read that and after we read that, do we have the full text of the transcript of the film. 
    You give me what the first word and the last word.

    Mr. Allen Brown 
    Of one interpret of it --

    Now, what about -- now --
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="1526.403" stopTime="1527.213">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    There are two films --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1527.213" stopTime="1527.983">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright now, how about the second?
speaker="allen_brown" startTime="1527.983" stopTime="1560.370">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    The second film is indorsed -- is basically the same as the speech made -- the speech portion of the first film. 
    The man apparently repeated basically the same words with some admonition and some additions. 
    These admonitions and additions are substituted -- are indicated in the brief and both prosecutions of defense agreed that this is actual statement of the second. 
    The only questions are assuming the first. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Leonard Kirschner
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1560.370" stopTime="1571.354">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Kirschner. 
    Would you mind stating if you can while the film itself is not to here but it is important as Mr. Brown has stated.
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="1571.354" stopTime="1605.026">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    Mr. Chief Justice and Honorable members of this Court. 
    I do not know why the film is not here at the present time. 
    I do know that I -- well that's I did know where it was as of two months ago. 
    I viewed it subsequent to the Supreme Court of Ohio hearings and it's in the clerk's office of the Clerk of the Hamilton County, Court of Common Pleas in his possession, locked up in a file, fireproof file I might add and I don't know why it is not here. 
    I'm certain that it can be forwarded to this Court for examination.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1605.026" stopTime="1607.189">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And of all that would you see that is done.
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="1607.189" stopTime="1823.804">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    I will never to follow through on the Court's request. 
    The Court's permission as I take it basically there are two points involved in this case. 
    One, is the Ohio Statute on Criminal Syndicalism and two, the evidence that was presented to a judge and jury upon which a finding and verdict of guilty was returned. 
    Now, counsel, I believe that the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism law is constitutional. 
    I have cited various authorities relative to my beliefs in this matter in my brief. 
    I believe that the basic matter before this Court is the application of the evidence as was presented to the jury to determine whether or not there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury could return a verdict. 
    I believe that in this case when counsel says sending the Jews back to Israel, let's give them back to the dark garden that this might not involved violence. 
    I would like him perhaps in his reply to explain how the statement, “Bury the niggers” would not constitute a violent form of actions. 
    Now in this case, there is two basic parts of the film. 
    One, that was taken inside of a room in which the defendant Clarence Brandenburg was identified and I don't believe there is any question or any in the record either between the appellant and the appellee in this matter relative to his identification as he being the person saying, this is an organizer's meeting we have had quite a few members here today which are we have had hundred -- hundreds of members throughout the state and so forth. 
    Then there is a second portion of the film in which a group of people are walking or marching around a burning cross, hooded, armed, shouting profanities in which there is a question whether or not the defendant himself said the words as attributed to him in the transcript and on page 5. 
    “How far is the nigger going to -- yeah.” 
    “Send the Jews back to Israel” and so forth with the other profanities. 
    There is some evidence in the transcript itself which could indicate as a jury sitting and listening in that the defendant himself made one or more of these statements, and I apologize to the Court for not having this as part of my brief. 
    I notified counsel of the possibility of my bringing this matter up. 
    Ohio has a section in its code. 
    Ohio Revised Code Section 1.17 which provides, whoever aids, abets, or procures another to commit an offense may be prosecuted as if he were the principal offender. 
    We have a group of people marching around as an organizer's meeting toward the acts of violence and in that they had attributed and desired the suppression of the Negro.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What was the size of this group of people?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="1826.482" stopTime="1835.260">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    With the Court's permission at the time of the marching around the cross, the size was approximately 10 to 20 as counsel for appellant has stated.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1835.260" stopTime="1835.542">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What is --
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="1835.542" stopTime="1835.922">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    Prior to that --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1835.922" stopTime="1840.594">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is there anything in the record that shows that more people were involved?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="1840.594" stopTime="1861.541">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    Yes, sir. 
    I believe that the defendants own statement. 
    We have had in his statement when he's inside the building. 
    We have had quite a few members here today which are and then he goes on to say, showing that there had been several members there. 
    I might further point out as one of the justices I believe it was Justice --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1861.541" stopTime="1867.427">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Was that before or after he says, he's going to bring 400,000 people to the district?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="1867.427" stopTime="1867.887">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    I'm sorry sir?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1867.887" stopTime="1872.585">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Was that before or after he says, he's going to bring all these thousand down to the District of --
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="1872.585" stopTime="1878.092">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    That was just before that. 
    That is the preface to the opening of that statement. 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1878.092" stopTime="1884.416">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Anything else from the record to show that there was any possibility of -- in carrying out any of these?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="1884.416" stopTime="1979.303">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    Well, if Your Honor please. 
    I believe that we have to take the entire actions of the defendant himself that we cannot limit it to just what these words say. 
    I believe the evidence clearly show that the defendant himself contacted the television station for the purpose of having a television, cameramen, and newsmen out of that meeting to take pictures to put it out over the television station. 
    So, when we say there are 10 or 20 people at this meeting. 
    I don't think we can limit ourselves to just those 10 or 20 people. 
    This is a plan, a concert action on the part of this defendant to broadcast this as it appears to me and upon which a jury could determine this profanities, whatever you would want to call it across a large segment of the community in Ohio. 
    And subsequently, I might add to that was picked up by a network television. 
    I don't think we can limit ourselves to just 10 or 20 people. 
    Although in and of itself, I would say that the statements such as this to 10 or 20 people can cause a one heck of a lot of crime and violence to terrorism in any community. 
    It only takes one person to cause it but you get 10 or 20 with hoods, shotguns, rifles, and other things. 
    Saying, “Kill a nigger”, “Send the Jews back to Israel”, “Send the dark men back to Africa”, etcetera. 
    Riding in a community and I say, you can cause violence, crime and terrorism right at the start with just two men not like -- not 10 or 20 as the record indicates.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1979.303" stopTime="1982.872">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    With out country -- out in the country?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="1982.872" stopTime="1990.298">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    Well, but the broadcast was not in the country. 
    The broadcast was to the community, locally.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1990.298" stopTime="2009.116">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Except Mr. Kirschner the theory of the indictment as I read on page 2 of appendix is that these people were charged with violating the statute by what they did at that farm on two-mile road on that evening not with anything to do with the television broadcast.
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2009.116" stopTime="2009.898">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    Well, as a part --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2009.898" stopTime="2011.072">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Have you tried the indictment?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2011.072" stopTime="2052.743">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    No. 
    I -- I would say that perhaps my interpretation of it is different from Your Honors. 
    As part of that meeting, this man had set up, right then and there a television camera. 
    His acts at that meeting were addressing not only the people who were standing in front of him but the vast audience of the community who would receive this broadcast by way of the television communication. 
    Which he himself has arranged in which the record shows that he was the one that contacted the television station to get them there in the first place. 
    So, I would say, yes, his acts at the scene but I don't think you can limit it to just the 10 or 20 people who were there.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2052.743" stopTime="2059.992">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Part of his acts at the scene you say were saying things knowing that they would be filmed and broadcast --
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2059.992" stopTime="2062.018">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    That is correct Your Honor. 
    That is my opinion.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What was the jury (Inaudible) --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That's my next question.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2067.978" stopTime="2076.853">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What were the elements to the events that is described -- that is given to the jury by the judge?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2076.853" stopTime="2114.779">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    With the Court's permission, the elements of the events as given by the Court instruction in this matter were basically that they shall -- the reading of the indictment and the definition of the word advocacy as pronounced by the statute of Ohio. 
    The definition of advocacy is spelled out in the code section and I believe without giving specific verbiage it is spelled out in the appendix. 
    It is basically that aspect that was spelled out in this matter.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2114.779" stopTime="2117.051">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I thought that was the clear and present danger?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2117.051" stopTime="2124.548">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    With the Court's permission in this matter there were no instructions relative to clear and present danger given by the Court.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2124.548" stopTime="2128.599">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Or its advocacy of action?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2128.599" stopTime="2199.921">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    With the Court's permission in the determination as to a specific spelling out item by item of advocacy of action, no. 
    As to a general interpretation, I believe, yes. 
    I believe the Ohio code in its definition does interpret advocacy of action. 
    It is advocacy of action of crime, violence, terrorism not an abstract doctrine. 
    It is the efficacy of the action to do violence, to do terrorism and with regard to that matter with the Court's permission as I spelled out in my brief. 
    Ohio has a rule that an error of omission is not an error in the charge. 
    I want to point out further that counsel for the appellant giving him the benefit of the doubt inadvertently left out that aspect of the charge in which the Court turned to the defense counsel and specifically ask defendant's attorney, “Do you have anything to add to my charge?” 
    To which at that point, defense counsel says and I may be getting the not quite the exact verbiage, “No, Your Honor we are satisfied.”

    Those raise were?

    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    I believe it was raised in the Supreme Court of Ohio.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, then may I ask Mr. Kirschner, I'm looking at page 85 which is the judgment of Supreme Court of Ohio. 
    What does this mean? 
    It says, the cause here on appeal as of right was heard in the manner prescribed by law and no motion to dismiss the appeal having been filed. 
    The Court that is the Supreme Court, sua sponte, dismisses the appeal for the reason that no substantial constitutional question exist herein. 
    I may -- do I read this correctly if I suppose this means, if they examine the record to see if any of the constitutional questions asserted was substantial.
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2304.431" stopTime="2334.532">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    Let me give this aspect. 
    I can not speak for the Supreme Court of Ohio as to their interpretation of verbiage. 
    I can give this Court procedure, the procedure in the matter if defense counsel files his appeal within time and as of right. 
    At that point, defense counsel and the state appeared in Columbus, Ohio at which time the Court through its representative heard arguments both for and against the allowing --

    Justice Byron R. White

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well if that's so, what difference does it make with the no objection was taken to the charge? 
    If your Supreme Court reached and decided these questions then they're properly here, they overlooked that they didn't get a picture on.
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2368.377" stopTime="2388.955">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    Well, if Your Honor please. 
    What I am saying is this, the charge that the Court gave insofar as it went was not incorrect. 
    I am saying further that the absence of the verbiage clear and present danger did not make that charge void. 
    I am saying --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2388.955" stopTime="2391.094">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Suppose we disagree with that. 
    The problem is --

    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    What's your problem?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2391.259" stopTime="2405.536">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- if we disagree with that whether we can reach it and face with the fact that there was no objection. 
    And as I gather from this judgment with the Supreme Court of Ohio, it considered and decided the constitutional questions, I suppose in that circumstance is immaterial.
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2405.536" stopTime="2416.623">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    I would say that if you disagreed with the basic premise that is the duty of counsel to raise that objection at the time and that the law of Ohio is incorrect --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2416.623" stopTime="2441.781">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    If we disagree with the basic premise. 
    It is that was not given as a reason by the Supreme Court of Ohio not to decide the merits of the constitutional same on the contrary. 
    The Supreme Court of Ohio apparently did consider and decide the constitutional questions, notwithstanding the failure to make objections. 
    And if that so, I think, isn't it so that issues then properly before us?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2441.781" stopTime="2477.399">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    Well, if the Court's permission as I have indicated. 
    It is my humble belief that this is basically a state statute. 
    If you determine that state's statute is valid, you go to the evidence. 
    And I believe that this, the evidence, was there and the only way that it should be thrown out as if there was no evidence upon which a jury could have reach this finding because the Court -- Court's charge that was given was specific enough and direct enough to cover the clear and present danger to cover all of other aspects of the case. 
    Now, --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2477.399" stopTime="2495.879">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And I take it that the state's position is that the advocacy in the form that it took demonstrated by this film constitutes a violation of the Criminal Syndicalism Act, is that right?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2495.879" stopTime="2517.637">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    I believe that the advocacy at the scene which was to be set to the members there as well as advocacy which was planned to go out over the television network constituted a violation of the Ohio Syndicalism Laws insofar as the indictment charge, violence or unlawful methods of terrorism. 
    And I believe that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2517.637" stopTime="2527.158">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well recently, if that so were the people or the network people to use that vague phrase violating your law too?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2527.158" stopTime="2558.911">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    With due respect to the Court, in my humble opinion, I believe that that the network people in working with this advocacy, there has to be an intention, if it can be shown that they intentionally put this out over the television networks with the thought of bringing violence or terrorism that it is my humble belief that they may be indicted the same as Clarence Brandenburg was in this case in violation of the Ohio laws.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2558.911" stopTime="2571.663">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, is there is any evidence in here rather than the film itself and the network arrangements that Mr. Brandenburg intended to bring about violence?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2571.663" stopTime="2660.758">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    If the Court please, I believe that the Court and the jury may looked to the words itself, the surrounding aspects as Your Honor in a reference that you recently wrote on civil disobedience and civil disorder stated. 
    Even if what is said does not create a clear and present danger and I believe that it was a clear and present danger at the time. 
    A physical injury to others, the place where the speech is uttered, the size of the crowd, the circumstances may convert the lawful into the unlawful. 
    It is my humble belief that the circumstances, if this was on a rural farm where nobody was around, nobody would hear this except perhaps five people in a little circle. 
    And Clarence Brandenburg was never tried here, the defendant in this case, to the propagation of this epithets, derogatory statements or column which he made through the television networks, I say that the State of Ohio's case would be substantially weakened. 
    But in this case, it is not someone else contacting the television networks. 
    It is Clarence Brandenburg himself who contacts the television newsman himself, requesting that they have a man there to take his picture, making certain statements and to take his group of which he is the leader and organizer of in propagating these statements to the general public of Cincinnati --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2660.758" stopTime="2693.300">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, as your -- well, I suppose that can be said that there is no question that he intended to advocate, whatever he advocated here. 
    But the next question is, do you have to have some additional proof to the effect that he also intended that steps be taken to carry out this program with respect to the Negroes and the Jews and so on that he described?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2693.300" stopTime="2713.577">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    With the Court's permission, it is my humble belief that you do not have to have anything further. 
    If I were to go and I use this as an extreme statement but if I were to run down Harlem shall we say and say, “Bury the Negro”, “Send them back to the black Africa.”
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2713.577" stopTime="2715.474">

    He wouldn't last that long?
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2715.474" stopTime="2736.353">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    Probably so, Your Honor. 
    And if I were to go to Israel and say the same thing about sending the Jews to the Arab countries or something or to any other, I don't say derogatory but I say that because these are the two groups that the defendant has picked up on in his derogatory statements. 
    I say the very words themselves indicate --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2736.353" stopTime="2744.025">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So, those words would carry on the network, why wasn't that a violation of your law? 
    That's that the question that started over.
speaker="leonard_kirschner" startTime="2744.025" stopTime="2753.786">
    Mr. Leonard Kirschner 
    As I indicated with the Court's permission it is my humble belief that in the addition there must be an intention to cause the violence, the --

    That's right.

speaker="allen_brown" startTime="3077.384" stopTime="3216.028">
    Mr. Allen Brown 
    No. 
    To win my case, Justice Fortas, may I submit that the State of Ohio as just as this moment indicated the massive invasion into the First Amendment that we have here into when Mr. Kirschner suggested that I could run down through Harlem saying, “Kill the Negroes” and Justice Marshall responded, “You wouldn't last very long.” 
    That Justice Marshall who is safe for the moment because the venue is in Washington D.C. but in Ohio could be indicted for suggesting a violent reaction by the Negro community. 
    This is the state of invasion under this statute into the First Amendment rights because under the proposition that Mr. Kirschner outlined here legally that is precisely the effect of Justice Marshall's remark. 
    I suggest further that we have this unusual situation. 
    We have such a deep-seated invasion the First Amendment rights that we get in meshed in difficulties of Mr. Kirschner outlines when he says there was no objection. 
    Incidentally, I was not counsel of record and I have never at this point because I feel certain professional loyalties raised the question of competency of counsel in the original trial. 
    But assuming Mr. Kirschner's reasoning what he has stated here is that the Supreme Court would have stated the record before it, was saying in effect that a constitutional issue is a mere error of omission and it is further saying that the instructions that you have before you to read are the dimensions that Ohio sets upon this statutes invasion of the First Amendment. 
    And I suggest that if that is the state of the record, that perhaps my earlier response to you Justice Brennan is not correct and perhaps, we must then reach the statute and declare it unconstitutional.
