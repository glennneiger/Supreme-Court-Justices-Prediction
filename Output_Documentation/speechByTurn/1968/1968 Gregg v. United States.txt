Gregg v. United States

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 453, Gregg against United States. 
    Mr. Richards.

    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    My name is Dean Richards in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
    Because the facts of this case can be summarized easily, I will begin with a brief summary. 
    The petitioner was convicted of a crime in the Western District of Kentucky Federal Court. 
    Immediately after the jury returned its verdict without pause or recess, the Court ordered the petitioner before the bench to take -- the Court asked if the petitioner had any res -- comment to make and, after a brief response, the petitioner had been quiet. 
    At this time, the Court started to make final disposition of the case and, at this time, defense counsel asked that a presentence investigation be made. 
    The Court, interrupting counsel, stated that a presentence investigation had been made. 
    It was before him and he had read it. 
    And then, the Court pronounced sentence. 
    This was complained of in a direct appeal to the Sixth Circuit and the findings and holdings in the Sixth Circuit were that there was no basis for inferring prejudice from the facts that the district judge had seen the presentence investigation report prior to the time when the jury returned its verdict, and the district judge sentenced the defendant immediately thereafter. 
    Upon -- counsel, upon noting that in a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals case, Collin versus United States, and a summary case, in fact, the Court held just the opposite, in that, in the Seventh Circuit case, the Court stated that the facts in the record before us effectively rebut the presumption of prejudice from an apparent violation of rule 32 (c) (1).

    But, Mr. Richards, matter of fact, there's nothing in this record to show that a judge saw it while the jury was out, is there?

    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals had a set of facts presented in the record to them. 
    The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stated that there is nothing to -- no basis for inferring prejudice from the facts that the district judge had seen the presentence investigation.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="180.487" stopTime="192.160">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, I'm familiar with that statement, but where in any record is there anything showing that he saw it while the jury was out?
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="192.160" stopTime="215.616">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    The jury returned its verdict. 
    The defendant was in the courtroom. 
    The Court-- the trial judge was on the bench. 
    The petitioner was asked to come immediately before the bench. 
    There was no pause and no recess. 
    The defendant was asked if he had any response. 
    He made a response, and then the judge started to dispose of the case.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, did the judge say that “I read this while the jury was out”?

    No, the judge--

    Did anyone?

    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    The fact would be the time element. 
    When would the judge have had time to have read it?

    Justice Thurgood Marshall

speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="252.970" stopTime="264.064">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    Well, the question here is not whether he had read it or whether he had seen it, but whether the judge was in receipt of the presentence investigation. 
    The rules--

    Did he-- When did he receive it?
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="268.323" stopTime="353.611">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    It would be our conclusion that he'd have to receive it and be in receipt of the presentence investigation before the jury returned its verdict. 
    Now, upon noting this conflict between the Seventh Circuit that there is a presumption of prejudice where there is a violation of Rule 32 (1)-- 32 (c) (1) by premature reading of a presentence report and the Sixth Circuit holding saying that there is no significance in a trial judge reading of a presentence investigation prematurely unless, also, it was in the record showing some violation that was actually harmful to the defendant, the petitioner then filed application for writ of certiorari noting the points, one, that there was a conflict between the Seventh Circuit and the Sixth Circuit, two, that why this Court should not exercise its supervisory powers over the federal system of criminal justice to invoke Rule 32 (c) (1), and also to prohibit further the taking of presentence investigations before a determination of guilt has been made by a defendant or the defendant has plead guilty in the absence of an intelligent conc --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="353.611" stopTime="364.788">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that's what the rule says. 
    The report shall not be submitted to the Court unless the defendant has pleaded guilty or has been found guilty.
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="364.788" stopTime="365.549">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="365.549" stopTime="377.091">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I gather your argument is that, in this instance, it was clear since the judge said he had it, that, somehow, it had been submitted to him before the jury returned its verdict.
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="377.091" stopTime="378.895">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    That's right. 
    That he was in receipt of the rep --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="378.895" stopTime="383.829">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or, if the rule means what it says, then obviously, the Court below was wrong, wasn't it?
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="383.829" stopTime="459.788">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    That's correct. 
    There was an apparent violation. 
    Now, the -- stated exactly what position we have and in view of the Solicitor General's brief, I think it's appropriate to state very briefly what this appeal is not. 
    In our petition for writ of certiorari, no constitutional provisions were invoked. 
    No mention was ever made of the United States Constitution. 
    In the Solicitor General's brief, however, a very substantial effort was made to characterize our case as a due process case and then argue it on the harmless error versus prejudicial error from a substitute standpoint. 
    And, in our brief on its merits, no constitutional provisions were invoked, nor was the United States Constitution mentioned. 
    Likewise, it should be noted that, in the granting of the writ of certiorari, no constitutional provisions were mentioned. 
    The Solicitor General's brief has made much of the fact that the petitioner has not demonstrated actual prejudice to himself resulting from this apparent violation of Rule 32 (c) (1).
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="459.788" stopTime="466.178">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, there, I suppose that the dangerous part of the prejudice issue is the power-accepting rule.
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="466.178" stopTime="481.173">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    That's correct. 
    The Sixth Circuit places upon the petitioner, and almost irrebuttable, presumption of non-prejudice when a trial judge reads -- prematurely reads a presentence investigation.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="481.173" stopTime="487.219">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    I suppose we view it as it was. 
    We read it as some doctrine protected by the rule.
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="487.219" stopTime="487.726">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    Yes.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="487.726" stopTime="488.991">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    What was it?
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="488.991" stopTime="531.901">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    Well, our feeling that why a -- it should not be submitted to the Court would be possible prejudice to the defendant and I also, along with this, I argue that the rule also states that a presentence investigation should not be bait before a conviction or a plea of guilty unless there's intelligent consent. 
    A presentence investigation can be very harm -- very helpful to the defendant in granting probation if he is convicted. 
    Now, in the present case, there was no consent by Gregg. 
    He did not know a presentence investigation had been made of him.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="531.901" stopTime="538.110">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, that's not really before us. 
    I know you -- as I recall, your argument had great length, but--
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="538.110" stopTime="539.882">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    Yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="539.882" stopTime="553.240">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That question of whether the presentence investigation may be made without petitioner's consent and before a guilty plea or a finding of guilt is not really presented by this case, is it?
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="553.240" stopTime="565.329">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    That's correct. 
    That this was -- the writ of certiorari was granted upon facts concerning Rule 32 (c) (1) and, because it manifests social importance, I did add it in my brief.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="565.329" stopTime="572.228">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is there really anything for us to decide beyond whether the rule is going to be enforced as written?

    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    Yes.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    If it's a prophylactic rule, whether or not there's prejudice, I would suppose, is unimportant. 
    If, under the language of the rule, it means what it says, then what happened here was wrong.
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="584.532" stopTime="585.341">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    That's correct.

    Alright.

    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    The prejudice that we're speaking of here is not prejudice to the defendant's substantial or substantive rights.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    If your position is that the rule should be enforced is written, why isn't that the end of your case?

    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    Because -- we have mentioned it in our case because the Solicitor General's brief, in response to our brief, has made-- as trying to make a question of this, is why I am mentioning it before the Court now. 
    We're arguing prejudice to the federal rules. 
    The federal rules of criminal procedure are the mandatory or their advisory.

    The judge himself says, by the Court, “I'll ask each individual juror --

    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="841.503" stopTime="845.595">

    If that's your verdict,” which I should suppose means that the judge himself polled the jury.
speaker="dean_e_richards" startTime="845.595" stopTime="978.474">
    Mr. Dean E. Richards 
    That's correct. 
    And then, without pause, without recess, the defendant was called before the bench. 
    This is when the petitioner found that a presentence investigation had been made without the petitioner's consent and the petitioner was asked to respond if he had anything to say for himself, not knowing that a presentence investigation had been made. 
    In Smith versus United States, Justice Cark, in two concurring opinion -- two concurring justices, in a separate opinion in that case, said that there is a presumption of prejudice when there is an apparent violation of Rule 32 (c) (1), and he further -- a judge -- Justice Clark made it clear that the presumption of prejudice that he wrote was reached without due process considerations. 
    His considerations were strictly procedural and that the Court, through its powers of supervision over the exercise of power to supervisions over the federal system of criminal justice, should grant a new trial on this matter. 
    Now, the question before us is whether the conduct of the trial judge and of the conduct of the probation officer, in this case, constitutes such a procedural, not constitutional but a procedural, irregularity as to require an exercise of supervisory powers of this Court. 
    How are the federal rules of criminal procedure going to be enforced if the defendant does not enforce them? 
    The government certainly will not. 
    The rules will not be enforced unless you would give him some type of a bounty to enforce the rules, give him a new trial. 
    If he is not given a new trial, then why would a petitioner ever want to seek his appellate relief if there's a violation of the federal rules of criminal procedure?

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The Court of Appeals decided this case and petitioner's argument rest upon the assumption that the district judge saw the probation report prior to the time the jury returned its verdict. 
    While we believe strenuously that this assumption is not supported by the fa -- by the record and that this assumption developed from the manner in which the issue was presented below, it is also our position that there is no occasion to set aside this conviction even if the trial judge saw the report prematurely.

    At that point, the Court asked defense counsel and defendant if they have anything to say before sentence was pronounced.

    When the Court indicated that such a stay would not be granted, the defense counsel asked for a presentence report. 
    The Court, at this point, replied that “a presentence investigation has been made and it is before me now. 
    I have read it.” 
    The Court, thereupon, sentenced the defendant to the mandatory 25-year sentence.

    No, Your Honor, there isn't.

    My point is that, seriously, it appears to me that in the six-minute period he should've been listening to what defense counsel was arguing in the -- for his client. 
    He should've been listening to what the plain -- what the defendant said. 
    And yet, he used six minutes in reading this four paged document.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="1908.939" stopTime="1922.169">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well, in the first place, all defense counsel said during this period is “I want to stay until Monday morning because my client is facing a long sentence and I would like him to spend the last few days with his family.” 
    Now --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1922.169" stopTime="1927.656">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I also read that his wife was pregnant and other things. 
    There were little other items in there which a judge should listen to.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="1927.656" stopTime="1953.107">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Right, and it'd be very simple for the district judge to just scan the report because this is not a sit -- this is a case where the district judge was familiar with the defendant's background. 
    Six weeks earlier, he had a psychiatric report which detailed defendant's prior record, detailed defendant's prior psychological and psychiatric problems.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, do you suppose it decided on that or is this probation report supposed to have some significance?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2015.806" stopTime="2122.682">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    The probation report has significance but, in this situation, what did the judge have to decide on sentencing? 
    This is not a case where he had the right to decide to impose any sentence up to 25 years. 
    He had -- his options were two, either place this man on probation or give him the mandatory 25-year sentence. 
    Now, this man had been also -- this was -- came out in the elements of the case as well as the psychiatric report, had been the week following the date that this crime was committed, had been arrested for bank robbery in another state. 
    And, that case was also pending in the Federal Court. 
    He -- and the judge, therefore, knew he either had to put him on probation or sentence him to 25 years. 
    The facts of this crime was such that the defendant here with a companion went into a postal substation, tied and gagged two women, put a gun on the one woman's head, an threaten to blow her brains out. 
    Now, on these circumstances, the judge didn't have to study every single word of the probation report to realize he's not going to put the man on probation. 
    He doesn't have to study every single word to decide “should I give him 5 years or 7 years or 25 years?” 
    His options are either 25 years or probation, and it seems to me that this is the type of case where he can just scan the report and, on the basis of that, decide that this is not a case for probation and, since his hands are tied by Congress, impose the 25-year mandatory sentence.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well, normally, if the juries are polled the other way, “Mr. So-and-so, is this your verdict?” 
    The Court reporter would write it down in the record.

    Both the defendant and his lawyer, the only thing they said was that they would like some time, another couple of days, the defendant can remain out on bond and be with his wife. 
    There was no -- neither the defendant nor his counsel made any argument or suggestion or -- of any mitigating factors at all. 
    He allowed them to say what they wanted, and they were just interested -- I have the view point from this record that they expected the mandatory 25-year sentence and they cited --

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well, I think that the whole thing boils down to what is only six minutes is because you know that the Congress hasn't given the federal judge any choice in this case. 
    If the federal judge had a choice, “should I give him 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, or 25 years?,” that would be a different situation, but that's not this case. 
    In this case, the jud -- Congress has said “you have to impose a 25-year penalty.”

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I -- in my case, I'm talking about where a judge gets a probation report.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Well, it seems to me that the judge have -- the moderate time a judge spend on a probation report varies with the individual case. 
    If he has a case of a first offender or where there's a -- where he has an option of putting a first offender on probation, I'd say he should spend a lot of time on the probation report, perhaps ask the probation off --

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer

    You didn't need one.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2824.034" stopTime="2852.439">

    In this case, there would be no need for a probation report because he did not have any option as to what sentence to impose. 
    This is a clear case where probation should have been denied. 
    I can't conceive the judge placing a man on probation who, shortly after -- shortly before this crime was committed, he had been released from a prior institution and had violated a parole previously.

    Well, I would think that one thing he'd be interested is whether the probation officer's can -- recommendation agrees with his. 
    If the probation officer's recommendation agrees with his impression of the case, then I don't think he has to scan every line and carefully read each word. 
    I think the judge properly, based on the evidence in this case and the -- just what he read in open Court about defendant's past history, that was enough.

    I don't see any virtue of delaying the sentencing process. 
    If -- once -- if the judge is clear, the judge is clear that this man rob the postal station with a deadly weapon and he's been out on bond before, seems to me that the -- and if he doesn't sentence him, he'll remain out on bond, it seems to me that it's very reasonable for the judge to sentence him on the spot, and there's no reason for the delay.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2938.090" stopTime="2954.159">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Mr. Glazer, let me ask you this. 
    Assuming that the Court was of the opinion that the judge had this before the verdict was announced. 
    That would be a clear violation of the rule, would it not?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2954.159" stopTime="2955.095">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Clearly.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2955.095" stopTime="2962.938">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Right. 
    Now, in those circumstances, would we -- would this man be entitled to any remedy at all?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2962.938" stopTime="2996.567">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    I would say not in this case for this reason. 
    Where it apparently appears from the record, as it does in this case, that neither defendant's trial, the determination of his guilt, the rulings of the judge, or the sentence were affected in any way by the judge obtaining the report prior to verdict that there's no reason to give him a new trial. 
    The reason I say that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2996.567" stopTime="3009.990">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Your belief is that even though the judge has clearly violated the rule, that it is still incumbent on the defendant to establish that he was prejudiced thereby.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3009.990" stopTime="3040.963">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    No, we -- no, I'd say the government will take the burden of showing lack of prejudice and I say, in this case, lack of prejudice appears beyond the reasonable doubt. 
    An examination of the probation report and the psychiatric report shows that the probation report is derived principally from the psychiatric report. 
    So, if the judge, the judge who was required to examine the psychiatric report prior to trial, he even may have had the psychiatric report in front of him during the course of the trial.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3040.963" stopTime="3055.465">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But do you concede then that in a situation where the judge does violate the rule that it's incumbent upon the -- upon the government to establish there was no prejudice to him?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3055.465" stopTime="3072.556">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Yes. 
    We will accept that. 
    We'll accept that, but -- we'll accept that rule that the government should have the burden of showing lack of prejudice. 
    And, we say, in this case, because of the psychiatric report, lack of prejudice is clear beyond any doubt.

    Page 7 of the appendix.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3406.821" stopTime="3421.172">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Yes, but he first asked you what did you have to say. 
    “Now, does a defendant or his counsel have anything that they wish to say before sentence is imposed?” 
    On page 6.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3421.172" stopTime="3422.188">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    That's correct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3422.188" stopTime="3424.911">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And you did speak.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3424.911" stopTime="3424.944">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    I --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3424.944" stopTime="3428.904">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And then the Court turned to Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Gregg spoke.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3428.904" stopTime="3429.443">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    That's correct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3429.443" stopTime="3430.780">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Right?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3430.780" stopTime="3431.160">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    That's correct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3431.160" stopTime="3433.743">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So, where were you cut off?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3433.743" stopTime="3443.420">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    When I find out that a presentence investigation had been made, that the Court had read it, and then the Court pronounced sentence.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3443.420" stopTime="3445.933">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But you -- I don't see where you were cut off.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3445.933" stopTime="3448.456">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    “Custody of the martial.”
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3448.456" stopTime="3449.931">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That cut you off.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3449.931" stopTime="3452.167">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Maybe if --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3452.167" stopTime="3453.951">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I see.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3453.951" stopTime="3462.306">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean that if you -- if you were to add more to read that -- wanted to see that thing, you wouldn't have asked him?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3462.306" stopTime="3463.863">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    At this time, we were so surprised --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3463.863" stopTime="3467.953">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, why wouldn't you? 
    Would you let him cut you off that quickly?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3467.953" stopTime="3471.007">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    We were so surprised that a presentence investigation had been made --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3471.007" stopTime="3475.257">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, that's right, but did you ask him to see it? 
    Why didn't you ask him to see it?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3475.257" stopTime="3476.354">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Because the --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3476.354" stopTime="3482.868">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Maybe the last paragraph of the colloquy would clear that up.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3482.868" stopTime="3484.873">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I've just read it. 
    It didn't clear it up to me.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3484.873" stopTime="3555.225">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Richards: “Your Honor, I would like to ask that a presentence investigation be made of --" and then the Court interrupting, “a presentence investigation has been made. 
    It is before me now, and I've read it. 
    It shows the juvenile record. 
    It shows that, in 1960, this defendant stole an automobile in violation of the Tire Act, was given indeterminate youth commitment sentence, his was paroled in 1965, he was returned -- no, he was paroled in 1962, returned as a parole violator in 1965, and was not released full time until May of last year. 
    I am also informed that he was convicted of robbery in Yuma, Arizona and given from 7-10 years. 
    Several warrants are now pending against him for robbery of which he is charged. 
    It will be the judgment of this Court that this defendant be sentenced of the mandatory 25 years, custody of the martial.” 
    To me, that's plain interruption and a lack of opportunity for the counsel even to answer the Court because when he said “custody of the martial,” it was all over.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you believe that a lawyer who represents his client from the beginning to the end could be stopped from talking by what was said there?

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    At this time --

    Would you?

    No.

    It certainly was not, except the defendant --

    Did you want to see it?

    Yes.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3580.366" stopTime="3586.460">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    At that time, no. 
    The defendant turned, walked away in the custody of the martial.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You mean after this colloquy was over?

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Yes. 
    The defendant -- the marital stepped forward. 
    The defendant was taken from the courtroom immediately. 
    Then, we were later brought back and he was advised of his appellate rights some minutes later, 10-15 minutes later, after I had left to get my car started from the parking lot. 
    Then, we were brought back in the courtroom and advised of the appellate rights that the petitioner had.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    At that time, I had nothing to say, Your Honor.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, no. 
    When the judge interrupted you there when you asked a presentence report be made, what were you going to say that you didn't get to say?

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    I was requesting that a presentence investigation be made.

    That's something --

    This was all about --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3633.954" stopTime="3640.068">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's something which you sought would take a little time and the sentence would be put off until it was completed. 
    That's what you were after, weren't you?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="3640.068" stopTime="3640.854">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    That's correct, and I was --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And said of which you discovered, I gather that it's something you didn't know, that it'd already been done so you couldn't get a delay in sentence while pre-investigation.

    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    That's correct.

    No, Your Honor, I believe I am.
