    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 6 Joseph Carroll et al. Petitioners versus President and Commissioners of Princess Anne et al. 
    Mrs. Norton.
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="51.380" stopTime="147.355">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Petitioners are members of the National Stater Rights Party, a political party committed to white supremacy to which they wish to win adherence to the Democratic process. 
    Specifically the record shows through running candidate in the Democratic and Republican parties as well as independently. 
    Their major way of reaching the public is through political street rallies. 
    On August 6, 1966 in Princess Anne, a sparsely populated town of 1351 persons, petitioners held a rally. 
    The facts break down roughly two ways. 
    The circumstances surrounding the issuing of the temporary injunction, and the circumstances and facts of the rally as revealed at the hearing of August 17th which led to the final injunction in this case. 
    The temporary injunction was gotten because at the end of the rally of August 6, another rally for the next evening was announced. 
    Though no violence nor even any need for police intervention to control the crowd in any way occurred at the August 6th rally. 
    Town and county officials got an ex parte temporary injunction for 10 days. 
    Rule B --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="147.355" stopTime="151.295">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Are you going to tell us what did occur at the August 6 rally?
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="151.295" stopTime="152.064">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    Yes I am sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="152.064" stopTime="152.381">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You are?
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="152.381" stopTime="152.455">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="152.455" stopTime="153.579">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    All right.
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="153.579" stopTime="378.782">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    Rule BB72 forbids the granting of such an injunction without a showing of immediate, substantial, and irreparable injury to the applicant before an adversary hearing can be held, and expressly grants the right to the judge to communicate informally with the person against to whom the injunction is sought or with his attorneys. 
    No such measures were taken in this case. 
    Such injunctions are indeed extremely rare in the State of Maryland. 
    The temporary order and writ of injunction restrained any “rallies, gatherings, or meetings anywhere in the county that would excite to riot or other illegal acts.” 
    Though the writ of injunction itself addressed to the parties by name may clear that the court construed any gatherings by this party as enjoined. 
    Not simply those that may excite to riot etcetera, for it enjoined to use of any sound amplification equipment in the course of public meetings, such equipment being necessary to hold such meetings. 
    A permanent injunction -- the temporary order said might issue upon hearing. 
    Petitioners were not able to find representation in time for appear before the return date of August 17. 
    But at that time, they did -- they had secured counsel and they filed an answer asking that the temporary injunction be rescinded. 
    Now to the facts and circumstances surrounding the August 6th rally, they were given their first hearing at the August 17th hearing at the court. 
    It is important to note that there was available to the court at the time of the issuing of this ex parte injunction the tape from the August 6th rally, but the court issued the injunction against further rallies without listening to that tape at that time. 
    The tape recording reveals a description of the parties aims. 
    Particularly repeal of 1965 Civil Rights Act and other Civil Rights Act then under consideration. 
    They're speaking caustic terms, was a call to actions but in every case a call explicitly to political action. 
    Examples of these are rampant in the record. 
    They called for example for those who heard them to “organizing intelligently, fight intelligently.” 
    They said for example, that the National States Rights Party advocates every legal, legitimate, and political inaudible word in the book to stop race mixing. 
    As to the specific political actions urged to the whites they said, for example, that they were to phone and write in button on James Bond, to the end that the schools not continued to be integrated in the county. 
    Their only remark that appear to be addressed specifically to the 25% of the crowd that was Negro, urged them to start taking reservations to Africa. 
    Since this remark appears to be among the more controversial in the record, it should be seen in its entirety and context. 
    The petitioner said in the course of that remark, “We don't need you, you're off, you're dead. 
    Get ready to leave this country. 
    You can leave in a lot of way. 
    You can leave on a boat, you can leave running. 
    You can bicycle or you can leave in a box. 
    This is a white man's country. 
    Princess Anne is a white man's town. 
    This is a white man's country.” 
    A witness testified that following this exhortation, both groups appeared interested. 
    Earlier, the party officials --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="378.782" stopTime="386.876">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Why don't you think the -- don't we have to accept that the thought of leaving in a box was a reference at least to violence and murder.
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="386.876" stopTime="471.099">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    Yes it was indeed. 
    It was a possible reference to their leaving in -- as a result of some sort of violent acts. 
    But isn't -- it is important to note that in advance of that exhortation of party officials had noted and this is earlier. 
    This is before this comment that the party's official position about Negroes was an adoption of the position of Abraham Lincoln namely that this country should send Negroes back to Africa. 
    Moreover, the remark in question was not followed by any exhortations to the crowd to either start now or at some future date to seeing toward as Negroes leave in a box or even to seeing toward the Negroes leave in any other way. 
    Rather, immediately following this remark is a classic call to organize politically and nonviolently to wit. 
    Let's organize, let's hear a great human cry come up from the people and I guarantee you white folks out there to win every single political objective. 
    And a few sentences later, another of several calls was specifically nonviolent, political action to wit. 
    Bring your friends back out here tomorrow. 
    We want a shout to come out of this town, a nonviolent shout that every local politician is going to hear. 
    We want to McKelvin to hear it, Governor Talos to hear it, Congressman Morten and all the LBJ's.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="471.099" stopTime="489.291">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mrs. Norton, I'm not clear from or and I have read as for whether there was in the community, state of tension at the time that this rally took place. 
    Where have -- where had there have been disorders? 
    Was there trouble in the community?
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="489.291" stopTime="558.550">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    According to the record Mr. Justice, the last as orders had been in February 1964. 
    It was then August 1966. 
    There was specific testimony that relations between the raises in the town in advance of February '64 had been congenial and since that it had been congenial. 
    It was on the political prociendo of everyone coming back tomorrow and raising a non-violent shout to political leaders that the rally ended as the audience was invited to come up and take out $8.00 memberships into the National States Rights Party. 
    The use of the word nigger to denote Negro occurred throughout the rally but it provoked neither the Negroes present nor the whites. 
    In the first place, no one was specifically called a nigger. 
    One of the petitioners gave as a reason for the use of the word every time you call a nigger appellate person you are apologizing to them because they are black. 
    The -- there was clearly a political reason for the uses of the word. 
    The county's evidence --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="558.550" stopTime="572.112">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, now there was also evidence that wasn't there. 
    That there had been two rapes in the locality of white women by allegedly by Negro assailants.
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="572.112" stopTime="576.019">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    Mr. Justice you mean two rapes recently? 
    When this rally was --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="576.019" stopTime="589.813">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I thought recently that the speaker was asked not to refer to, and did not refer, but instead of that he talked about a 1933 incident which should end about the lynching, the last lynching in Maryland as I understand it over here in the eastern shore.
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="589.813" stopTime="597.989">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    That is correct and at that time he said to the crowd, “And I want you to know I'm not advocating that kind of action. 
    I'm accounting a bit of history”
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="597.989" stopTime="609.161">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, and then he also told them about Chicago incident where a white people rose up, kicked hell out of the niggers, burnt 32 cars.
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="609.161" stopTime="680.733">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    That's right. 
    He recounted -- he recounted incidents at which violence occurred but throughout the record, we have these petitioners telling the crowd, “Look, don't involve yourself in violence. 
    That happened to us before. 
    That's what they want to have happen here and we distort you against it.” 
    The county put on evidence that rally, at the rally were 200 people. 
    That there was an ample police force that the Negroes were clearly disturbed and angry but that they did not so much as even mingle with the whites. 
    There was evidence over the objection of counsel of 1964 riots that had followed sit-ins, not pure speech. 
    There was evidence that there was racial peace before and since. 
    There was also evidence of cooperation between petitioners and the authorities. 
    One of petitioners for example, inquired about the use of a public address system and about general sponsorship of a rally. 
    Captain Randall, one of the officers present, did request that that there will be no mention of the cases and as the justices point it out, there was no mention although there was mentioned of the 1933 case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="680.733" stopTime="684.547">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Was I right in understanding that that case had led to the -- to a lynching?
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="684.547" stopTime="698.370">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    That case had indeed led to a lynching and these petitioners noted that at that time, there was shame cast on Princess Anne but that they didn't feel that -- but Princess Anne apparently at that time didn't feel that was such a shameful conduct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="698.370" stopTime="701.550">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just the opposite, they put stickers on that car saying they were proud to be of --
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="701.550" stopTime="702.602">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    Currently they were proud --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="702.602" stopTime="704.070">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You're back to the lynching.
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="704.070" stopTime="1056.889">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    That's right. 
    These petitioners did relate to this audience by encouraging them that they had participated in activity that might be also considered to be raises although these petitioners did not in fact exert them to participate in such activity at the present time. 
    The court refused to hang down on immediate opinion or even a ruling because they want to see a transcript first. 
    23 days later, a permanent 10-month injunction issued effectively continuing and enforced a temporary injunction. 
    Since then, a sound equipment statute arguably bad under Seija versus New York has been passed by the county. 
    The Court of Appeals of Maryland disapproved neither injunction. 
    However, it held at the 10-month injunction was too long. 
    Of the 10-day ex parte temporary injunction, the Court of Appeals said, “The court was correct in issuing its order dated August 7, 1966.” 
    If the Justices please, I'd like to deal with the mootness questions first. 
    This Court has currently given some time to trial counsel, co-counsel here Mr. Zinman in order that he might relate some of the factual circumstances that might clear up this issue somewhat more. 
    He'll take five minutes to do that when I had finished. 
    We believe that this case is not moot because we believe we come within two exceptions. 
    One, a substantive exception and the other are procedural exception. 
    And this Court has always recognized exceptions to the mootness requirements. 
    We cite a law review article by Diamond and generally in our brief. 
    And in that -- in the course of that article, there is a summary of one of the exceptions to mootness which we feel we fall within. 
    It bans perhaps quoting here this short, “Although the controlling fact situation may be so changed that the specific relief sort is no longer possible.” 
    If the situation is self perpetuating, the parties are entitled to an adjudication which will apply to the renewed phase of the controversy and existence. 
    We believe that this controversy is clearly self perpetuating. 
    These petitioners have been informed that they will not be able to speak in Princess Anne County Maryland unless they sense of their remarks. 
    We have cited in our brief the South Pacific case where -- Southern Pacific case excuse me, where this Court said that short term order is capable of repetition will not defeat a claim for mootness. 
    We've cited two other cases in our brief which we think point out the difference between moot claims and none moot claims. 
    One is oil workers where the Court found mootness to exist. 
    The other is Motor Coach where the Court found no mootness to exist. 
    In both cases, the Governor's seizure of a public utility was at issue and the Governor had returned the property. 
    The difference was that the underlying factual dispute was present in one case in Motor Coach and not present in the other. 
    That underlying factual dispute was a strike which ended in the one case and which continued in the other. 
    We think that the Sideburn case decided last term by this Court also points out a kind of exception this Court will -- it takes normal mootness claims. 
    There, it was pointed out that failures in state procedure will not be allowed as a course for mootness. 
    Now, we think that there are specific failures of state procedure here which this Court in Freidman versus Maryland has already analyzed and condemned. 
    There this Court, looking at the censorship statute noted that there was no prompt way to get judicial review in the State of Maryland. 
    It compared Maryland procedure with New York procedure. 
    Under New York procedure, under Maryland procedure, it found that the statute talked about prompt administrative determination but it said that there was no assurance of prompt judicial review and this Court didn't really know how prompt administrative determination had to be. 
    In New York on the other hand, there is clear, definite language by the time limits as this Court said. 
    For example, a judge had to in New York hand down his opinion within two days after a matter was heard. 
    That kind of time limit saved the censorship statute in New York and didn't save censorship in Maryland and we submit that in this case, we have that kind situation. 
    Moreover, Walker versus Birmingham is procedurally relevant here, because the court there criticized petitioners for making no efforts to challenge the injunction there. 
    And the court gave every indication that if petitioners had made efforts and if petitioners had met with delay, this Court would have decided the case. 
    Yet I believe that that case could not have gotten to this Court either before it became moot. 
    For the demonstration, it was hoped to be held on an Easter Sunday and the injunction was issued some two or three days before hand and even under available procedure. 
    They could not have gotten here so I think there's an indication in the opinion that this Court would have decided that ex parte temporary injunction case because it related to free speech. 
    The court -- this --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1056.889" stopTime="1078.356">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I don't think the indication was that the case could have gotten here in time in the Walker against Birmingham but rather that if the petitioners have gone to the trial court in Alabama and had been met with a rebuff or a delay, and then had proceeded to hold their parade, the case would have been presented here ultimately in quite a different posture.
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="1078.356" stopTime="1168.458">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    That's possible Your Honor but another procedure would have been just as much open to them would have been to somehow seek appeal here and they would have been uncertain as to whether or not to violate the injunction then or not. 
    It certainly is worth noting that this Court in Walker and Birmingham expressed considerable doubt as to the injunction and statute involved even though it didn't have to decide that question because it was a First Amendment case and it had an ex parte injunction in it. 
    We believe that these procedural and substantive reasons which are applicable to cases generally apply here, but we believe this case has another important part to and that is that now it's an ex parte injunction here in a First Amendment case. 
    And we believe that the supremacy clause means that this Court ought not let that ex parte injunction stand as law and rule of the First Amendment. 
    Indeed, even when speech is not involved, equity will normally not enjoin the commission of a criminal act. 
    But when speeches involved, it would seem all the more inappropriate. 
    The court below it should be noted expressly approved the ex parte injunction here though it had run by the time it got to the Court of Appeals and we think this Court can do the same. 
    We like to spend the few minutes on the injunction themselves.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1168.458" stopTime="1174.018">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    (Voice Overlap) as we heard, your clients make any effort to review the ex parte injunction?
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="1174.018" stopTime="1242.483">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    Yes. 
    Yes, they did although not before the answer day. 
    We've submitted a reply brief in which we have shown at the petitioners could not secure counsel in time to force a hearing before they did. 
    Had they been able to do so? 
    They would have done so and as soon as they secured counsel, they did in fact file an answer. 
    We've asked this Court to do two things with respect to these injunctions. 
    Number one, to disapprove the use of the injunctive process to control speech and number two, we've argued that these injunctions in any case were improper because the evidence is finally submitted, did not show that an uncontrollable situation was bound to result from the next rally. 
    The disapproval of the injunctive process we think is necessary and would only repeat what this Court has done in the permit cases. 
    We don't need to tell this Court that a prior restraint is the essence of what the First Amendment bars so much so that this Court has rarely had before it and a speech that has been enjoined.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1242.483" stopTime="1247.687">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There were no -- there was no ordinances or statutes involved here, were there? 
    Involving--
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="1247.687" stopTime="1247.860">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1247.860" stopTime="1248.959">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- permits for a meeting or anything like that?
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="1248.959" stopTime="1251.152">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    That's right Your Honor. 
    There was nothing in existence --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1251.152" stopTime="1252.388">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's right, there were none.
speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="1252.388" stopTime="1326.247">
    Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton 
    That's right at that time. 
    This Court in permit cases has always looked to see whether or not the permit went beyond mere ministerial permission -- ordering the mere ministerial permission be given to give speeches. 
    What we think that means is that this Court has said in speech cases, there shall be no prior restraint. 
    All we're asking this Court to do is do the same thing in the context of an ex parte injunction. 
    We think there's another reason why this Court should disapprove the use of the ex parte injunction because we believe this Court has said and whenever it is used in any free speech test, that the state must use a constitutional way to reach its legitimate end. 
    Now we certainly regard the end here as legitimate. 
    Here the end is control of disorder, but disorder can be controlled without the menacing, without the broad, without the unusual ex parte temporary injunction. 
    This is -- this has been said in this Court time and memorial and can't --

    Ah, Mrs. Norton, I have a little trouble by the procedural aspects of this case. 
    Actually, what happened here was that an ex parte injunction was issued and then later on, two ex parte injunction was issued to restrain the petitioners from holding a meeting in 10 days. 
    Then later on, there was an interlocutory some sort of a interlocutory order entered to restrain petitioners for 10 months?

   Argument of William H. Zinman
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1633.088" stopTime="1636.061">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Zinman.
speaker="william_h_zinman" startTime="1636.061" stopTime="1918.702">
    Mr. William H. Zinman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I'll address my remarks specifically to some of the procedure to which Justice Fortas referred. 
    Were within the context actually of the Freidman case which we were urge a speedy determination from the lowest court to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. 
    The ex parte injunction was issued of course on the affidavit of Commissioner D'Shield who the record discloses on -- did nationally observed the rally for more than five minutes time. 
    Nor as the record indicated that the court actually hear the tape and the order of course continued for 10 days. 
    Now within that period of time -- oh, and this order, the ex parte order of the record indicates who was not served upon Stoner, Brailsford, and Norton nor the National States Rights Party. 
    It was however served on three of the petitioners so that actually there are three people who've never got, even got served as a process. 
    Now ultimately when I got into the case on the 15th of August, I did file a general answer but of course the hearing was scheduled for the 17th which actually gave us only two days. 
    Now under the Maryland rules of procedure, you do have two days within which to request a hearing for an ex parte order. 
    However, in this particular case, we filed affidavits to the effect that the petitioners did attempt to contact two lawyers and failing that and also there's a letter in the record which I sent as soon I got into the case to the president of the Bar Association of Somerset County. 
    Mr. Jones requesting that local counsel be assigned to assist us, because number one, the distance from Baltimore, Maryland from my office to Somerset County is 150 miles and it takes a day to get up and back. 
    And secondly I wasn't altogether familiar with local practice. 
    Of course I got back a letter indicating that this was an unpopular cause and half of the Bar Association consisting of seven around the other side of the case and that in any event, nobody wanted the case. 
    Consequently, there wasn't any real remedy that these petitioners have. 
    And we had a parole intents and purposes addressed ourselves to the permanent injunction and the hearing which of course came later. 
    Now, in connection with our argument under Freidman that we would like a prompt and expedition to termination, I would suggest that even though technically the interlocutory or permit in injunction is not before the Court. 
    From a practical standpoint, this injunction continued in effect from the date of its inception, the date of the ex parte order, which was on the 7th, until June the 7th, 1967 when the Court of Appeals finally rendered its decision. 
    During the interim period, I would like this Court gone to stand that I made certainly every effort to number one, expedite the case according to the Maryland rules of procedure by initially trying to shorten the time for transmission of the record by filing a motion to shorten the time within which argument was to be held and even by sending a letter to the Court of Appeals of Maryland, which is part of the record requesting them to render an expeditious decision. 
    So from a practical standpoint, the defendants were enjoined for almost nine months, and I think that we would like the ruling to the effect that a determination of this kind involving speech and involving assembly should be handled in the same way that censorship cases are handled. 
    That is that they should be able to get from the court of the lowest instance to the highest court in the state within the shortest period of time.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would like to first point out that there are a great deal of matters which are in the appendix in this case and in the supplemental brief which are not part of the record in this case. 
    There were matters involving the issuance of the subsequent petition. 
    The attempts to obtain trial counsel those such items.

    Mr. Rottman, may I just suggest to you before you get into your argument that we have done in this case what we don't usually do.

speaker="s_leonard_rottman" startTime="2027.370" stopTime="2048.462">
    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    Thank you. 
    I would like to, with that in mind, I would to comment very briefly on the issue of mootness. 
    And it would seem to us and we submit that any decision at this Court may make in this particular case would be moot and would operate purely in a vacuum. 
    And therefore the case is moot and should not be considered by the Court on the merits.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2048.462" stopTime="2063.806">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, I would, speaking only for myself, we would suppose that you might well argue that under all conventional, and traditional and normal test, this case is moot. 
    This was a 10-day injunction more than two years ago.
speaker="s_leonard_rottman" startTime="2063.806" stopTime="2064.484">
    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2064.484" stopTime="2095.243">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That -- I mean the 10-days expired more than two years ago and nobody is now heard so far as this record shows. 
    Nobody was ever sent to prison or even find or anything like that. 
    But what does this to allow a state to do? 
    Suppose tonight, a court enjoins Hubert Humphrey for holding a meeting in a community where he wants to hold a meeting tonight for 10 days. 
    And suppose he couldn't get that decided until after November 5th?
speaker="s_leonard_rottman" startTime="2095.243" stopTime="2142.814">
    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    I think this year Your Honor, I think that under the Maryland rules, there is an absolute right to a hearing with two days notice. 
    These petitioners did not avail themselves of that. 
    They say they had difficulty getting counsel and yet one of their petitioners, Mr. Stone, is an attorney and had only the preceding week appeared in Baltimore on a similar case, in which the National States Rights Party was enjoined. 
    He appeared and represented them in that case. 
    I would say that there is an absolute right to a two-day hearing on the injunctions. 
    And under the decisions of this Court, it seems to me that the test is the quickness with which you can get a judicial review. 
    The first instance of a court reviewing, the right of the restraint on speech and Maryland has specifically provided the two-day test, two-day hearing. 
    They can have it on that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2142.814" stopTime="2144.210">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Two-day notice of a hearing not a two-day hearing as I read it.
speaker="s_leonard_rottman" startTime="2144.210" stopTime="2157.649">
    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    No sir, they can have a hearing. 
    They can have a hearing or not less than two days notice. 
    So if they're request a hearing, they must have it within at least two days. 
    I believe that's the interpretation that's consistently been given in Maryland and that's the way the rule reads.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2157.649" stopTime="2160.546">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Do you have the Maryland cases cited in your brief with authorities?

    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    No, I have no Maryland cases cited, Your Honor. 
    I have a reference to the Maryland rule.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2167.647" stopTime="2168.102">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And that rule --
speaker="s_leonard_rottman" startTime="2168.102" stopTime="2169.292">

    I know the application of that rule.

    How does the rule read?
speaker="s_leonard_rottman" startTime="2171.267" stopTime="2204.916">
    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    The rule reads that a party has an absolute right to a hearing on two days notice on the issuance of an ex parte injunction. 
    And the practice in Maryland and Mrs. Norton says that it's an unusual practice issue to issue a temporary injunction, I would submit that that is not so Your Honors. 
    I've only been at the bar some 10 years now but I've been involved and I'm not particularly do a great deal of trial work, but I've been involved in probably no less than five. 
    In my own experience in ex parte injunctions and the Maryland courts uniformly grant a hearing on two days notice on application of one of the parties.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2204.916" stopTime="2209.593">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Were all these people served in times that they could have done that?

    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    They may not have been served Your Honor, but I would submit that if they were not served, they weren't subject to the hearing. 
    They weren't subject to the injunction then. 
    Again under Maryland rules, you're not subject to the injunction until it's brought to your notice. 
    Now, they certainly came in and were aware of it as a practical matter. 
    They were all very much aware of the injunction. 
    We believe that the --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But Maryland contend here that the temporary ex parte injunction was validly issued?

    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    Absolutely.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2240.598" stopTime="2247.640">
    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="s_leonard_rottman" startTime="2247.640" stopTime="2252.991">
    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    Yes sir, they said that the existence of the clear and present danger of a riot in the streets of Princess Anne justifies --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2252.991" stopTime="2255.109">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So this is (Voice Overlap) -- 
    This is the rule -- is this a --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2255.109" stopTime="2268.404">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- this is an interpretation by the Maryland courts, by the highest court of Maryland as to what kind of conduct that a meeting would justify an injunction, as a threat to the public order.

    And now that is -- so there is an interpretation of the First Amendment or of the Maryland law has been permissible under the First Amendment which have now obtains in Maryland and which people who want to hold meetings must observe, unless they want to be subject to an injunction.
speaker="s_leonard_rottman" startTime="2286.480" stopTime="2291.728">

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but the ruling that, the ruling that the -- under the Maryland law pleadings that they be stopped by the injunction consistently with the First Amendment is an ongoing -- that takes the rule of Bowen out. 
    It's the way that the First Amendment and the Maryland law has been and will be interpreted. 
    Isn't that any different I don't suppose, if it's a -- and if there were a statute in Maryland that says, “Under certain circumstances meetings may be enjoined, and the people who want to hold meetings, bring declaratory judgement action that challenging that statute.”

    That they should have gone into the courts to vindicate their rights rather than to violate it.

    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    I don't think that that is the pronouncement in Walker Your Honor. 
    I think this Court went a good deal out of its way in Walker to point out that the petitioners in that case had taken no steps. 
    They had taken no steps to contest the issuance of the injunction and the court made it very clear I think, they were clearly put on notice that they could not bypass orderly judicial review of the injunction before disobeying it. 
    And I think that case, what it does is recognize that you must first, in the initial instance object to the issuance of the injunction. 
    If it is then issued and if you may then object to it, and if it may run out before you have time to follow through all the way to this Court if you will. 
    Then you have the right to protest the issuance of the injunction and if the injunction was wrongly issued, their conviction under it would be reversed.

    Well suppose on this temporary restraining order if they had gone to the court within two days afterwards, and the lower court had decided against them. 
    Could they then violate it and come to this Court?

    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    I don't mean say if they could violate with impunity but I think the way to get it before this Court in a live issue and not a moot issue, would be de-violated. 
    If the balancing of the equities must be between the protection of the state in holding safe its streets by allowing them to issue injunctions or if its to force petitioners and those in their position to test injunctions in a live issue by contesting it and subjecting themselves to criminal penalties. 
    I would say that the better rule would be to force them to take the burden of criminal punishment than rather to force the state to take the burden of allowing their streets to be the subject of rioting over any issue that speakers may wish to make.

    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    That was still in effect, that's right. 
    The reversal was passed by the Maryland Court of Appeals, part of the expiration of that interlocutory injunction. 
    By the way, I may say in passing that I think the term interlocutory was simply used to distinguish it from a permanent injunction. 
    It was no question about being a final order but it was a final temporary in effect that it expired from a given period of time. 
    It was not an unlimited injunction.

    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    I don't know that the tapes are particularly, they are important because they are the words that created -- helped create the clear and present danger but there was a background of violence which was also significant at the time of this particular incident. 
    These petitioners had spoken about three or four days prior in Baltimore City. 
    And their speeches in Baltimore City had created a riot that matters before this Court on petition for their conviction for inciting the riot, right now. 
    The State of Maryland is a reasonably small state. 
    All three of the Baltimore City television stations are being into Princess Anne. 
    The three Baltimore City newspapers, the existence of that riot had been given wide coverage throughout Maryland and particularly in Princess Anne. 
    Not particularly but in Princess Anne. 
    First thing petitioners said when they came down, “Did you heard of us in Baltimore?” 
    They drew a specific reference to their speeches in Baltimore. 
    It was set in a background of violence knowing that the tapes will not justify the issuance of the injunction.

    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    I think that if you must balance the right of the state to protect its streets and make it safe for its citizens, so that their constitutional rights maybe protected by preventing violence speech, and forcing people who wish to stretch the limits of their right to violating an injunction which they consider to be wrong. 
    I think the burden must lie on those who wish to stretch their right of free speech, because I think you must recognize Your Honors, that if you say that a state may not by injunctive action, prevent speech even speech which will create a clear and present danger. 
    Which will create an absolute riot as these petitioners did in Baltimore City. 
    That you are of necessity saying that you're going to deprive other citizens of their constitutional rights of being safe and secure in their person and property. 
    Because this Court has pronounced on many occasions, that there is speech which creates violence. 
    Speech sets off the motor equipment that is violence. 
    And when that violence is set loose, then other citizens are denied their rights. 
    Witness the incident that happened in Baltimore City. 
    When after these petitioners spoke before they were enjoined in Baltimore City, an innocent 12 year old boy was walking down the street in a Patterson Park with his dog, a Negro boy had nothing to do with the rallies, he was three blocks from the rallies, and the crowd from the rallies just swept up and beat him. 
    They put a rope around his neck, and if it hadn't have been for prompt police action, he would have been deprived his ultimate civil liberty. 
    Now, if you're not going to permit the state court's to enjoin this kind of speech which will set off that, then you've got to recognize that you're granting someone the right to exercise or abuse his constitutional privilege at the expense of denying that to other citizen, because the state is not --

    Well, do take it that that is an issue in this case?

    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    My understanding from listening to Mrs. Norton and in their brief that that's the very issue they raised is, "Should a state court ever have the right to issue an injunction?" 
    And we've address to ourselves for that someone extensively.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, like in Freidman, an argument by analogy to Freidman as I understand it, which is at the procedure in Maryland for challenging the ex parte order is not adequate to protect the constitutional right. 
    But I didn't understand that they say that can issue an ex parte injunction at least, in appropriate circumstances.
speaker="s_leonard_rottman" startTime="3380.273" stopTime="3383.700">
    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    Freidman didn't deal with an injunction at all. 
    Freidman dealt with the censorship law.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I understand that.
speaker="s_leonard_rottman" startTime="3384.992" stopTime="3415.776">
    Mr. S. Leonard Rottman 
    And by the way, we would point out that Freidman made it clear that what is required is some procedural requirement of a prompt judicial hearing. 
    And we submit that under the Maryland Rule BB72 there is that availability. 
    Your Honor's I have, I believe taken up most of my time and I want to leave a few minutes for Mr. Jones to tell you and address you on the question of the existence of the clear and present danger in this particular instance.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The irony inherent in this case Your Honors are too numerous and too striking to bear further comment. 
    I would like to restrict my remarks to the clear and present danger as they existed in Princess Anne in August of 1966.

    No sir, not under these circumstances.

    Would you explain that as you go along?
speaker="alexander_g_jones" startTime="3482.415" stopTime="3750.042">
    Mr. Alexander G. Jones 
    Yes sir and I will try. 
    Judge Farnan in his opinion said, “The speeches delivered by the appellants must not be judged as they abstractly read or sound in the sequestered atmosphere of judicial chambers. 
    But with the realization that they were in the nature of a hoorang, delivered in the humidity of a tired August night from the courthouse steps of a county sit whose people were not strangers to racial violence.” 
    We urged that this rally held on August 6 must be viewed in the light of existing circumstance and that the appellants by their own words must be regarded as highly dangerous racial and religious bigots, deliberately operating in the atmosphere of ignorance and prejudice for the purpose of inciting hatred, strife and disorder. 
    And my little town of Princess Anne to its eternal shame first came notoriety as the seen at Maryland's last lynching in 1933, a fact which was not lost upon the appellants. 
    The town next to achieve national prominence has a local of serious racial disturbances in February of 1964. 
    The implication that this had since changed in all that becomes sweetness and light was news to may this morning, because I have to serve as Chairman of the biracial commission in this community during this time. 
    We submit that it was mere chance that brought the appellants to Princess Anne on August 6 '66 but rather that this small town of the many in Maryland that they may have visited afforded the best opportunity for the spread of their gospel and hatred. 
    They recently arrived from what they must have considered a triumphant appearance in Baltimore City. 
    An appearance, which resulted in an injunction against they return and convictions on several criminal counts. 
    We submit further that in these days of mass communications for the press, the radio, on the TV, there is no such thing as an isolated racial incident. 
    The right in Baltimore, Selma, Wats, Jackson or Rochester. 
    Fans had revised the flames of racial hatred throughout the land, a protected land of community such as Princess Anne and Somerset County, which have previously experience similar cases of civil disorder, endangering life and property. 
    And against this background of Princess Anne must be place the appearance of this hate mongers on August 6. 
    Their objectives it was set forth clearly enough by them in the cumulative effect of the statements was not lost upon the Court of Appeals of Maryland, nor was it lost upon their audience on the night of August 6. 
    For these people to come to Princess Anne in the atmosphere, which then existed, was fire in a crowded theatre. 
    It was a match in gunpowder plant. 
    There is direct test among in the record from Colonel Davidson and Captain Randall that only the presence of the police in large numbers on that night actually prevented a riot. 
    Testimony of one of the town commissioners, that the atmosphere was tense. 
    That it was on a thither. 
    That it could have gone off at any moment. 
    The court, the lower court judge do or did in fact hear this tape before he signed the original injunction. 
    It was played for him in his living room in his home. 
    And after he heard the tape, he signed the order granting the original injunction. 
    It was a mixed crowd in roughly the same proportion as a population of our county in town is mixed. 
    It was an ugly crowd. 
    The situation was ripe for violence and that is precisely why the petitioners were in Princess Anne at that time and on that date. 
    Of all the small towns in Maryland, they could have chosen, they picked this one as the one best suited to their objectives. 
    And we submit that there was a clear and present danger and at the presence of the police on the scene, followed immediately by the injunction issue by the Circuit Court was the only thing that prevented this town from going up in flames.

    Because the -- simply because the situation was so inflammatory at the time that almost any assembly of persons immediately set off rumors, counter rumors, and drew others to the scene.
