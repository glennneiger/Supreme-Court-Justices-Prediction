   Argument of Owen H. Page
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="16.734" stopTime="26.266">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You have said -- excuse me, excuse me, I know it Mr. Page, you had already started your argument. 
    You may proceed.
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="26.266" stopTime="130.836">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Yesterday, counsel for the petitioner, I had observed as I recall that the respondent churches had ceased to function. 
    I think this was an attempt to bring the situation within that Section of the Book of Church Order and which has been identified, I think yesterday as Section 6-3. 
    Oh, a complete explanation of that Section, if the court will referred to page 83 of the appendix. 
    But let me just sum it up for you. 
    That refers to a situation in which we either have a church which has withered and died on the vine or one which is in the process of withering. 
    Now, I -- the viability of these churches are, I think is manifested by the fact that these cases are before you today. 
    Furthermore, if you examine the action of the administrative commission which the counsel made some imports, you will find, there was a completely innocuous act. 
    What it did, it did more than -- did nothing more than accept the or recognize the cessation, you might say or removal of the session by their own volition and then it said in effect for those members of the congregation that still wish to worship, we will furnish you a minister. 
    So, as to the question of im -- whether these judges should have appealed the action of the administrative commission. 
    There were two reasons I didn't have to. 
    First, under the guard of the First Amendment, these people individually or collected really have the right to withdraw. 
    Second, the constitution of the Presbyterian church has no prohibition against a church taking this action and this too is in the record. 
    Now, I briefly --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="130.836" stopTime="132.420">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That has no prohibition against what?
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="132.420" stopTime="135.403">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Prohibition about an individual church withdrawing.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="135.403" stopTime="136.466">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh, I see, yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="136.466" stopTime="144.564">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, are you, is this argument addressed to a proposition that there was no implied trust?
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="144.564" stopTime="149.578">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    No, sir. 
    I was just rebutting yesterday that I thought they might have left this impression and I was --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="149.578" stopTime="151.597">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I want to be clear about one thing.
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="151.597" stopTime="152.163">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Yes sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="152.163" stopTime="166.082">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I thought I was but I'd like to get your view on it. 
    You do not contest the finding of the conclusion of the court below --
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="166.082" stopTime="166.480">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    No sir, I do not.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="166.480" stopTime="168.908">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I think there was an implied trust.
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="168.908" stopTime="170.030">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    No, sir, I do not.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="170.030" stopTime="199.385">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And that -- the terms of that implied trust are that this property will be used as part of and subject to the mechanism of the church and the central direction and guidance of the church and the church discipline.
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="199.385" stopTime="244.919">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Yes, with one qualification. 
    In the -- because when we talked about the implied trust Mr. Justice, we are talking about the imposition of the polity which is the doctrine and discipline of a church at the time of the acquisition of the property. 
    Now what the Supreme Court of Georgia found below and this was on its statutory mandate that the court invoked. 
    The court found under Section 28 -- 22408 of the Georgia Code that when a property is devoted to a specific doctrine or trust, the court will intervene to prevent it -- the property being diverted to a doctrine which is contrary to that which existed at the time of the acquisition of the property.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="244.919" stopTime="275.384">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well you have as I see it, and your case comes down to two points. 
    One, assuming that there is an implied trust which you -- are going to. 
    Two, is that trust dependent upon a maintenance of the church polity at the time the trust was cleared and mainly as of the time of the acquisition of the properties by the local church.
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="275.384" stopTime="276.337">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    That has -- that's -- yes sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="276.337" stopTime="294.775">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And three, if that is so, was there such a change in the polity of the church between the time of acquisition and the time of the disaffiliation so as to defeat the implied the trust.
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="294.775" stopTime="295.109">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Yeah.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="295.109" stopTime="295.794">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is that an inquiry where I am right?
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="295.794" stopTime="312.844">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    That's correct, that's it. 
    So, we then -- we look at the constitution to determine what was imposed upon the property at that time then we look at the charged transgressions which are set forth in the action and the resolution of the Judge and let me just briefly refer to it and I think --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="312.844" stopTime="318.560">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would you mind -- would you mind stating to me first how was this trust created?

    This trust Your Honor under the --

    Did anybody signed it --

    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    No Mr. Justice, no sir, there was no -- not -- we are here --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="325.443" stopTime="326.520">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How was it created?
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="326.520" stopTime="361.017">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    It was created under the -- I would assume under what we call the polity of this particular church government which has denied a knowledge to be a representative type of church but the representative type of church is of course have -- may have a variation of polity. 
    For example, a representative type of church may be representative in its spiritual relationships as we acknowledge here but it may have congregational aspects in relation to property. 
    So what we have here under the theory of --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="361.017" stopTime="363.076">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Does your constitution provide that?
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="363.076" stopTime="364.090">

    No sir. 
    This is --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Where do you get that?
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="365.130" stopTime="389.697">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    This is an implication Your Honor from Watson versus Jones that they said in that particular type of church government where you have a series of ascending judicatories that there is an implied consent absent some particular transgression of the constitution that it is held for the benefit of the church as a whole.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="389.697" stopTime="391.396">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is that the only place you get it?

    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="392.349" stopTime="403.320">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This is a -- then its origin is in the secular law in the sense that the -- either the legislature or a court is said that in these circumstances, they trust the right.
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="403.320" stopTime="406.696">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Yes sir. 
    That's in the secu -- that is in the secular law.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="406.696" stopTime="407.424">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And the --
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="407.424" stopTime="411.253">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    There is no canonical laws supporting this in this particular case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="411.253" stopTime="411.875">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    None at all.
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="411.875" stopTime="412.000">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="412.000" stopTime="415.721">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So this is a doctrine of a secular law.
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="415.721" stopTime="416.457">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="416.457" stopTime="437.197">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, do you say -- apparently you don't argue that if the terms of the trust which is imposed by the secular law may not be adjudicated by the secular courts that therefore the trust cannot be observed.
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="437.197" stopTime="499.412">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Yes, that -- in Gonzalez versus Archbishop, Mr. Brandeis -- Mr. Justice Brandeis, I think put this in focus for all of us. 
    He said in this team, this I think was about 1929 decision some years after Watson versus Jones in which he said, “Absent for evidence of fraud, collusion or arbitrariness that the secular courts, all of the findings of an ecclesiastical court in matters involving ecclesiastical law even though civil rights are involved. 
    Now, this theory has been followed by any number of decisions both state and federal subsequent at that time. 
    So, what was acknowledged in Watson versus Jones, you might say it -- by Jones, absolute deference to the authority of the highest church court is no longer, it has been cons -- it has been modified and the court may now look beyond the rule formulated in Watson as to the three -- as to the types of churches that he acknowledge there.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="499.412" stopTime="506.446">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now, absent -- the doctrine of the implied trust, would this case get in to court?

    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    No sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="508.949" stopTime="513.149">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And that's a creation of the court's opinion, do you think in Watson?
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="513.149" stopTime="518.605">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Yes sir. 
    Subject to the modification and -- then Gonzales.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="518.605" stopTime="524.464">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Mixes the court up considerably in connection with the policies of the church at one time and another?

    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    No sir. 
    I -- may I take this exception. 
    When we look -- you see, the charge, when we looked at the charged transgressions, we do not imply into the faith that inspired this particular constitutional commandment of the church in its organic law. 
    All we looked is at this organic law in its doctrine and discipline as a factual, is purely factual matter.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="548.662" stopTime="548.686">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What is the factual matter?
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="548.686" stopTime="565.902">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Well, the factual matter here is that the general assembly made pronouncement concerning civil disobedience and becoming involved in civil affairs in direct conflict with the church -- with its -- with church's constitution. 
    The constitution says, “ You shall not do this.”
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="565.902" stopTime="569.393">

    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Well, I -- under the theory we are having to move along on sir, we'll have to go on a theory that this constitutes a breach of the trust and under the law, if there is a breach in the trust or the part of the denomination on the church at its highest level, there is then the property is restored to those who are still uttering the concepts, the constitutional concepts.

    Yes, which they had financed by their tithes, offering, and pledges and you see, you have a difference here, the other thing I'm think in Kedroff, in Kedroff there was some evidence as I recall in the record that the Russian based church had money in the cathedral in New York.

    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Yes sir. 
    And the subsequent -- this Courts have had expanded the word arbitrariness to mean an ultra vires on constitutional act and these are clearly charged in the initial pleadings on the part of the petitioner, I mean of the respondents.

    Lest by way of humble petition in cases all extraordinary by way of advise or satisfaction of conscience. 
    If they'd be there until required and then the other violation that was found, it is the duty of the people to pray for the magistrates to honor their persons to pay them tribute and other dues to obey their lawful commands and be subject to their authority for conscience sake, these are the parts of the cons --.

    The specifications are in the resolution which bring to the court's attention pronouncements by the highest tribunal in 1965, in 1966 in which the highest tribunal where on the record condoning civil disobedience and embroiling the church in them military and diplomatic affairs over the Vietnam War. 
    Now, these were the basis, the primary basis for the action that's before and these are reflected in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia.

    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Well, it went to two reasons. 
    First, I think that this action was -- as I mentioned has made on a highest level and I believe it might have been a little exercised in futility to have attacked a legislative pronouncement before the judicial body which is -- determine its own legislative act. 
    But more importantly if and this I think is valid, if the act of the general assembly is a con -- unconstitutional act, well, if they did, then this, I don't believe that it imposes any responsibility upon the lesser tribunal which is the local congregation to appeal that act. 
    And certain courts where this situation has been presented where the highest tribunal has been accused of an ultra vires or unconstitutional act. 
    It said known app -- no appeal is necessary because I don't believe this -- it impose any duty on it.

speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="919.777" stopTime="930.093">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Under the position of the churches set forth in the resolution of 1880, there are two types of pronouncement.

    But your point is, as I understand it, that you in effect agree that unless the court properly -- a court properly finds that there has been a departure from the church dogma or church polity as comparing the present with the time of the acquisition of the property by the local church, unless there has been a departure by the central church in church dogma or polity, then you agree that the -- you're wrong and the central church is right.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So that your case really depends as I see it upon two questions. 
    One, did the court below properly go into -- did they have any business going into the question that you put.

    A Presbyterian judge be disqualified from sitting in a case for this thing?
speaker="owen_h_page" startTime="1609.926" stopTime="1755.574">
    Mr. Owen H. Page 
    Mr. Justice I assume that addresses it to the judge himself, I'd say, I wouldn't ask him to be disqualified. 
    In conclusion, I find this -- if you look at the record to it, there is a fatal federal question before this Court and I submit that the -- that this case should be dismissed because there is no federal question before the court since it'll be raise. 
    And here's what the four points that they raised, they said that federal question was raised in the Supreme Court of Georgia on a motion for rehearing and that that many questions thrust before that court were entertained. 
    The federal question was -- the motion was entertained and the many federal questions presented were answered. 
    That is not the record in the writing and it of course, this violates the historic position of this Court that on a motion for rehearing when the federal question is raised for the first time, you must entertain and decide. 
    The other question was that in overruling Matt v. Kahn (ph) it violated the rule of stare decisis. 
    This is -- again this Georgia Court has adopted the federal rule and that you do not have a vested right in a prior decision and the Supreme Court of Georgia so ruled. 
    Looking again at the other, that the overruling Matt versus Kahn (ph) violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment application of Watson versus Jones. 
    This is not the case. 
    Matt versus Kahn (ph) specifically stated that on a proper showing of a complete abandonment of the dogma and doctrine that the court would then protect the rights of the local property, local church who were adhering to the dogma and discipline. 
    So this comes as absolutely no surprise there. 
    All the Supreme Court of Georgia did was to modify its substantive law which had had the right to do any change, the complete task to that of -- substantial. 
    And finally, they contend that the federal question was properly raised on the local at the initial level in the trial court by the general allegation that the -- this act that they -- act in appropriating the property would violate it, the laws of the United States of America. 
    This lack -- they require specificity of the state court and also the federal court and there was no motion or other appropriate action taken in the trial court to bring this federal question to the state court and thus to this Court. 
    Thank you so much.

    Yes, but what if we did because that's the -- the issue here that's been argued, is it the First Amendment to the federal question. 
    The First Amendment forbids that kind of an adjudication of the breach of trust.

   Rebuttal of Charles L. Gowen
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1917.389" stopTime="1920.373">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gowen.
speaker="charles_l_gowen" startTime="1920.373" stopTime="2013.301">
    Mr. Charles L. Gowen 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I think in this question of property, we must consider that the Presbyterian Church is a great church composed of many thousands of people who have joined it over the years. 
    These local churches, when they joined, when they have became members of the Presbyterian Church in this great volume, the church, when they joined it, they placed their property under the polity and control of this church and therefore, they didn't have to do it. 
    They could've remained the congregational church. 
    They could've kept their property but for -- because they wanted to do just as I did and I happen to be a Presbyterian. 
    The justice I did when I joined that church, I put myself under the polity and control of the church and therefore these local churches did it with their property at that time and all these churches -- all that the Savannah Presbyterians has asked to do is to put a minister who is a Presbyterian minister because these churches no longer have Presbyterian members. 
    They renounced the church and withdrew from it. 
    All they asked to do is to put a Presbyterian minister in the church to hold services for any members of this church who might want to come and while the vote was unanimous about those who were there, I think the court will take judicial cognizance at the very few churches that have all the members their at any one given day. 
    And there was no vote taken --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2013.301" stopTime="2014.794">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How about a pretty good vote?
speaker="charles_l_gowen" startTime="2014.794" stopTime="2097.143">
    Mr. Charles L. Gowen 
    That was a good vote but on the other hand, one member of the session refused to follow the action according to the record in the case because the return was all of the members of the session say one. 
    And if there was only one member of that church who wanted the Presbyterian services yield in it, I say he had a right under the constitution and the law to have that service alive. 
    We think Watson versus Jones and Kedroff have decided ever issue in the -- this case in favor of the respondents. 
    We think Watson versus Jones and this case are very similar on the facts. 
    Both involved Presbyterian churches. 
    Watson involved the statement by the church on the question of slavery. 
    This case involved the statement of the church on civil rights because the evidence is that the witness for the plaintiffs said that was the main reason that they withdrew and in each case the state sought to try ecclesiastical issues in the civil courts which this Court said could not be done. 
    The churches in this country have lived under Watson versus Jones for a hundred years and with Kedroff for 15 years with no injury to our religious life.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    What the -- what would be the situation in the case if the -- if it is determined here for example, I'm not suggesting that it would be but lets just assume that the court determines adjudication of church dogma is contrary to the First Amendment and that the -- it -- those at the lower court's adjudications must be set aside. 
    Where does the case stand there?
speaker="charles_l_gowen" startTime="2116.865" stopTime="2133.899">
    Mr. Charles L. Gowen 
    Well, then -- this Court if it reaches that conclusion should instruct the Georgia Supreme Court to deny the relief sought by the plaintiffs and give the relief sought by the defendants which would give them possession of the church property for the purposes of conducting services --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2133.899" stopTime="2137.045">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    On what basis would you -- would your claim then rest?
speaker="charles_l_gowen" startTime="2137.045" stopTime="2144.027">
    Mr. Charles L. Gowen 
    The claim would rest on the implied trust that is recognized in the similar Presbyterian Church in Watson versus Jones.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2144.027" stopTime="2149.235">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But this would be a secular -- a trust implied by the secular law.
speaker="charles_l_gowen" startTime="2149.235" stopTime="2163.831">
    Mr. Charles L. Gowen 
    Yeah. 
    But the courts have held both in Kedroff and in Watson versus Jones that after the church tribunal has made its determination, it is the duty of the civil courts to throw the property in the direction that the ecclesiastical courts have indicated.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2163.831" stopTime="2169.173">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What would be your remedy to get possession of the church?
speaker="charles_l_gowen" startTime="2169.173" stopTime="2178.633">
    Mr. Charles L. Gowen 
    This -- simply that the court would issue an order that the Presbyterian Church, the presbytery of Savannah should have possession of the church for the purpose of carrying this --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2178.633" stopTime="2183.016">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But willing to enforce the ecclesiastical decision.
speaker="charles_l_gowen" startTime="2183.016" stopTime="2194.783">
    Mr. Charles L. Gowen 
    Yes sir. 
    By that, all of the courts have held that it is the duty of the civil court when property rights are involved for the civil courts to enforce the decision of the ecclesiastical court.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gowen you were going to give us the citations of --

    Mr. Charles L. Gowen 
    There is no -- nothing in the church law that deals directly with the disposition of the property of the local churches of the central church (Inaudible).
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2210.500" stopTime="2228.821">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    They are just one other thing that I'd like to know, I understood from your brief that most of these specifications of departure from a dogma of the church were not binding on any of the local churches except one.

    Mr. Charles L. Gowen 
    The forward -- the making women eligible to hold church office and that was an amendment to the constitution of the church, regular devoted by the requisite dome of presbyteries and there's no attack upon the adoption of that constitutional amendment. 
    All the rest of them are merely statements of position and there's nothing in the church, book of church order. 
    There's nothing in the evidence in this case. 
    There's nothing in the case to say that I as a Presbyterian have to believe anyone of those to remain a member in good standing in the church.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, I understood counsel just a few moments ago to say the contrary that there were two kinds of pronouncements that could come from a general assembly and both of them were binding on the --

    Mr. Charles L. Gowen 
    I don't think is an in esse deliverance. 
    This is merely if you will read the statements and they are all in the record that they complained off. 
    If you'll -- part of it is Sunday school literature. 
    But if you will read the statement you will find that it is nothing more than a statement of the position of this general assembly, the next general assembly could have an entirely different position and there's nothing in it that says that any member of the church has to believe it or has to act on it. 
    It simply -- its no more than a deliverance of a minister whom -- and by - and the church might preach a sermon with which he didn't agree.
