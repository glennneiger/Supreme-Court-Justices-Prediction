    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Thank you Mr. Solicitor General. 
    If it please the Court, this case arises under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. 
    The case is here in writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to review that Court's interpretation of the Act's provisions governing the temporary landing of alien crewman for shore leave while their vessels call at United States ports. 
    Before setting forth the facts of this case, I would like briefly to outline the statutory provisions which this case involves. 
    In Parts IV and V of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress set out the basic provisions that establishing the procedures and the standards for the admission and expulsion of aliens into and from the United States. 
    In Part IV dealing with admissions, Congress provided that if an alien presenting himself at the Court of entry of the United States is denied admission by an immigration officer. 
    The alien has a right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer or his admissibility and if he is stand to be inadmissible. 
    He may appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals and from a finding in the Board that he is inadmissible, he may obtain judicial review by habeas corpus. 
    Section 241 of the Act, sets out the grounds in which an alien may be expelled from the United States or deported and under 242 (b) of the Act, when it is alleged that an alien is deportable from the United States. 
    He has the right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer in which he may be represented by counsel. 
    They present evidence and has the right to cross-examine witnesses against him. 
    Sections 242 and 243 and the following Sections also provide for certain forms of discretionary relief from expulsion or deportation. 
    What are these forms of discretionary relief is under Section 243 (h) of the Act which authorizes the Attorney General in his discretion to withhold the deportation of any alien to any country in which his opinion, the alien may be subjected to persecution of an grounds of race, religion, or political opinion. 
    Under the regulations issued by the Attorney General that determination under Section 243 (h) is initially made by the special inquiry officer who conducts the deportation of proceeding under Section 242. 
    In Part VI of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress establish special procedures for the admission and in some cases for the expulsion of alien crewman. 
    Under Section 242 (a) of the Act which is the exclusive procedure for the temporary admission of alien crewman, Congress provided that an immigration officer may in his discretion issue a temporary permit for the alien crewman to land. 
    If he finds that the alien is a bona fide crewman and if he finds under subsection (a) (1) of 252 that the alien intends to depart on the vessel in which he arrives, and the permit issued under subsection (a) (1) is good for the period during which the alien crewman's vessel is in port. 
    The Section further provides that the alien crewman must agree to accept such a permit which is conditioned upon his being deported from the United States as provided in subsection (b) of the statute. 
    That Section, subsection (b) provides that if an immigration officer determines that the alien no longer intends to depart on the vessel on which he arrived. 
    The alien -- the immigration officer may take out and revoke the permit, take the crewman into custody and if practicable remove him to the vessel in which he arrived from removal from the United States on board that vessel. 
    The Act provides it the alien whom and shall be deported from the United States, the expense of the transportation line which brought him. 
    The last section of Section 252 (b) is particularly important in this case. 
    It provides that nothing in this Section shall be construed to require the procedure prescribed in Section 242 of the Act, the hearing before a special inquiry officer to cases falling within the provisions of this subsection Section 252 (a) in the set out on page 41 and 42 of the Government's brief. 
    Regulations issued by the Attorney General dealing with alien crewman also provide for a -- the parole of an alien crewman who alleges that he may be persecuted if he is returned to his homeland. 
    Thus, reflecting the discretionary relief available under Section 243 (h) of the Act. 
    Now in this case, respondent, a native and citizen of Yugoslavia arrived in this country shortly before Christmas in 1964 as a member of a crew, the radio officer of a Yugoslavian vessel. 
    He was issued to conditional landing permit under Section 252 (a) of the Act. 
    Good for the time that his vessel would remain in the port in Oregon and on condition that respondent leave the United States with his ship. 
    He went ashore in January 4, 1965 and he went directly to the home of a cousin in the company of another crewman on board that ship. 
    And a day later they both returned to the immigration office in Portland, Oregon I believe and claimed that they've claim this -- sought asylum in the United States on the grant that they would be persecuted if they were return to Yugoslavia. 
    When representations which respondent made to the immigration officer at that time that he would not under any circumstances return to his ship. 
    His conditional landing permit was revoked and he was detained at the office. 
    On the following day the District Director gave respondent an opportunity to present a statement and evidence in support of his claim that he would be persecuted if he were return to Yugoslavia. 
    This was under the regulation which is set out its Regulation 253.1 (f) now and it is set out on page 46 of the Government's brief. 
    Upon advice of counsel, respondent refuse to give any evidence or make any statement in support of his claim. 
    He contended that he had a right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer under 242 (b) on his claim of anticipated persecution under 243 (h) and he said that he wouldn't give any evidence to the District Director at that time. 
    Consequently, the District Director without any evidence in support of the claim denied the application for parole and ordered that the respondent be removed to a ship. 
    Respondent then brought suit in the District Court and bargained to enjoin the District Director from removing him to his ship.

    He was still in port in the following day when he refused to get any evidence in support of his claim.

    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    The record doesn't disclose Mr. Justice whether there were any special inquiry officers, Mr. Chief Justice, whether there were any special inquiry officers in Oregon at the time. 
    It doesn't disclose exactly what the nature the evidence that he intended to present. 
    We can assume that it would be somewhat of a time consuming procedure. 
    How long I just can't estimate.

    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Conceivably it would be. 
    The supplement -- the Government provide that the record shows that he ship sailed from Oregon sometime after the 7th and sailed from somewhere in California for Italy around the 16th. 
    So, we just really don't know whether it would have been possible to hold such a hearing.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="680.907" stopTime="705.855">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I ask Mr. Connolly, if he had not had a permit for the jumped ship and his ship was still in the harbor when they picked him up. 
    In that circumstance, if he had made this persecution claim. 
    Would he been entitled to a hearing before a hearing examiner rather than before the District Director?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="705.855" stopTime="726.628">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    My understanding, Mr. Justice would be that under the Act, he would not be subject to Section 252 (b) but that he must be preceded against under Section 2 -- on the grounds stated in 241 and under the proceeding in Section 242 (b).
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="726.628" stopTime="738.220">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So that getting the permit, he gets only the summary hearing on persecution plan but if he hadn't got the permit and jumped ship, he didn't have the hearing before the hearing December, is that it?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="738.220" stopTime="750.131">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    That is right Mr. Justice and I intend to deal with that question later on as to whether the discrimination between a crewman who gets a permit and a crewman who jumped ship makes any sense at all.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="750.131" stopTime="755.320">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, isn't it also true if he says, he's going back on another ship, he gets a full hearing?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="755.320" stopTime="1395.541">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    That is right Mr. Justice and I also intend to deal with that form of discrimination. 
    To continue on with the facts, after the District Director denied his claim for parole, he sued to enjoin the District Director from removing him to his ship. 
    The District Court and claim to that time also that he had to write to a hearing before a special inquiry officer. 
    The District Court denied his claim that he had a right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer but remanded the case back to the District Director for the taking of evidence, an opportunity which respondent accepted at this time and presented his evidence. 
    When the evidence presented, the District Director found that there was insufficient, the showing of a sufficient likelihood of the persecution to justify granting the parole of the discretionary relief. 
    And ordered -- and denied the application again. 
    On review, the District Court found that the District Director's determination was not an abuse of discretion and agreed with the District Director that there had been a showing made of any sufficient likelihood of persecution. 
    Respondent did not appeal that determination by the District Court instead he sought relief by private bill in Congress when that bill was adversely acted upon in the following year in 1966, he again petition for parole for withholding a deportation administratively. 
    Again, claiming a hearing under Section 242, that relief was denied by the District Director on the ground that the prior proceeding was a fully adequate hearing and that the determination had been made adversely to respond. 
    He sued again in the District Court to enjoin the District Director from deporting him. 
    The District Court found that the prior proceedings were fully adequate, denied the relief. 
    On appeal of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Court held that in view of the fact that respondent's ship had sailed during the pendency of the administrative proceedings on his claim of anticipated persecution that the revocation of the condition of landing permit under Section 252 (b) was no longer proper basis for the deportation of respondent. 
    The Court held that unless in effect that unless the res -- that the alien crewman is in fact removed on his ship. 
    The revocation or the expulsion proceedings under Section 252 plus the board and the alien crewman is entitled in all matters with respect to the revocation and in all matters of discretionary relief to a hearing under Section 242 (b). 
    We disagree with the holding of the District -- the holding of the Court of Appeals. 
    We believe that so long as the alien crewman's conditional landing permit is revoke during the time that is in effect, that is during the time with the alien ship is still in port, that it presents a fully adequate basis for removal of the crewman from the United States at determination of any administrative or judicial proceedings that he might invoke on the question of his deportability or the question of any discretionary relief. 
    And Mr. Justice Brennan asked the question earlier, what was the basis of his prior claim that he had a right to a hearing under Section 242 (b)? 
    We really don't know. 
    We assume that by the respondent's position in this Court in defending the judgment of Court of Appeals is that he has the right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer under 242 (b) because that's the way such claims are handled in regular 242 (b) proceedings which the Court of Appeals held he now has a right too. 
    I have been unable to find any basis upon which it could be inferred merely from Section 243 (h) itself that it is a right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer. 
    It would seem that the Court of Appeals took the only statutory approach that can be made in this case and that is to find the right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer, in the right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer on all claims and all grounds of deportation in this case. 
    We begin our consideration of the statutory issue in this case. 
    He responded also raise his constitutional claim, the statutory issue with the hypothetical. 
    Suppose an alien crewman is issued a conditional landing permit under Section 252 (a), good for the time that his ship is to remain in port. 
    Immediately leaves his ship and goes several hundred miles inland where he obtains employment and a training program of a manufacturing plant and enters into a long term lease, a year's lease on an apartment. 
    During the time that his ship is still in port, he is found by an immigration officer and on the evidence of his conduct his landing permit is revoked. 
    He is brought back to the port city and without objection placed to aboard his ship which sails the next day for foreign port. 
    Now, as our search reveals that all courts which have considered the question of interpreting Section 252 (a) and (d) including the Court below in the instant case would agree that the immigration officer in that case acted properly. 
    But the difficulty is of course, that in the hypothetical which we presented, the alien's voluntary departure from this country. 
    Well, voluntary in the sense that uncontested departure moots any challenge to the conduct of the immigration officer. 
    Now, we don't believe that Congress enact its Section 252 merely to provide a basis for or direction for conduct by an immigration officer in a situation that it couldn't be challenge in Court. 
    We believe that Congress envision that alien crewman would exercise their rights for admini -- for judicial review certainly of the conduct of immigration officers under the statute and Congress presumably recognized that in those case, it is unlikely to be alien's ship would wait for him until the expiration -- until the judicial proceedings were terminated. 
    The respondent adopts the reasoning of the Court of Appeals that approaches the problem from the other side. 
    They say -- the respondent says, well, the Section 252 (b) procedure did not apply to the case where an alien crewman is jumps -- where an alien jumps his ship and enters the United States without a permit. 
    Under the case where he gets a permit to ship out in another ship, where a case in which his permit is not revoked while his ship is still in port but he stays on longer than that and they say it, well, since the statute is thus narrowly designed. 
    It ought to be construed more strictly to apply only in the case where the alien is in fact deported on his ship. 
    Now, we disagree with that proposition. 
    We admit that from the face of the statute, Congress apparently contemplated that the alien crewman ship would be one of, if not the primary. 
    It means, for removing him from the United States but if Congress had wanted that to be the sole basis, the sole means for removing him from the United States. 
    If Congress wanted to limit the statute only the situations, and where the alien is in fact removed on a ship, it could have done so. 
    We believe that it begs the question in this case, to say as the Court of Appeals did. 
    That the necessity -- the justification for proper removal. 
    The justification for quick resolution departs with the vessel. 
    That assumes the Congress contemplated only that alien crewman would be deported on their ships. 
    We don't believe that that was a contemplation at all. 
    They determined when the basis -- the Congress determined on the basis of evidence that there was a severe problem of alien crewman deserting their ships. 
    That it -- there would be a special class of alien crewman who would be granted conditional landing permits only on their agreement to depart with their ship and then if they fail to that agreement during the time their ships were still in port, they were immediately deportable whether on their ships, whether on another ship with the same line or whether after the determination of any administrative or judicial proceedings. 
    Now a question has been raised, well -- could Congress rationally have made this determination? 
    When it exempted from such procedures the crewman who jumped their ships or crewmen who were admitted to ship out in another vessel, although, the legislative history doesn't provide any guidance on this question. 
    We believe that Congress rationally would have made such a determination. 
    The alien crewman who jumps his ship and enters without a permit at all, where the alien crewman who overstays his conditional landing permit without it being revoked may be found 10 days, 3 months, or 10 years later, and the 10 years later issue is one that I think that provides a basis for distinction between the two cases because unlike an alien who may have been in this country for 10 years, albeit illegally. 
    And it established family relationships and other relationships which presents some equities in this case. 
    The alien crewman whose conditional landing permit is revoked under Section 252 (b) has been here at the most for less than 29 days, at the most for the time that the ship has been in ports.

    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Yes, sir. 
    I do. 
    Now, I'd like to turn in very little time that I have left to respondent's challenge that the statute is interpreted by the United States, violates his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment and also the Government's obligations under the protocol relating to the statute as the status of refugees. 
    I think that both of these -- both claims can be comprise to do a single federal due process claim. 
    The protocol incorporates by a reference, certain provisions of an international convention on the same subject and respondent in amicus cite certain provisions of that convention which relate to the expulsion of refugees on the assumption that respondent is a refugee. 
    But the accepted international construction of the convention as the state department advised the Senate when it was considering the protocol. 
    Is that each of the contracting states reserves the right to interpret the convention to make the determination whether an individual is a refugee and in this case after a hearing in which he was entitled to present which he did present evidence and was represented by counsel, the District Director found that the respondent was not a refugee. 
    Now, on respondent's federal due process claim, we note first that respondent is not here and has not as far as we know at any time during these proceedings challenge the revocation of this conditional landing permit has been anything other than a fully adequate constitutional basis for his removal from the United States. 
    Nor does he challenge -- nor does he contend that the revocation of his conditional landing permit was arbitrary. 
    It hardly can be contended in light of his representations to the immigration officer that it was arbitrary in this case. 
    We ca -- respondent's request for asylum therefore was a request of an alien who is deportability had been properly determined in a proceeding in unchallenged proceeding. 
    Furthermore, it was a request for discretionary relief in case somewhat analogies to the situation before the Court in Jay versus Boyd in 351 U.S. and a case in which respondent had the burden of showing that in his case, he will be subject to persecution. 
    As I said before, he was given a hearing before a -- the Deputy District Director of the Immigration Service in which he was represented by counsel. 
    He was permitted to present -- it testified himself and presented two other witnesses. 
    And the District Director found that there was not showing -- sufficient showing of person -- a likelihood of persecution and that finding was upheld by the District Court. 
    So the only difference between the procedure which respondent received in this case and the procedure which he would have receive under Section 242 (b) under a 243 (h) claim is that the determination was made by the District Director rather than the special inquiry officer. 
    So the question is in the case of an admittedly deportable alien seeking discretionary relief from the ground of anticipated persecution whether it is consistent with due process, to have that discretion exercise by the District Director rather than the special inquiry officer. 
    And we do not believe that in the circumstances of this case fundamental fairness required that in the case in which all other contentions where to be adjudicated by the District Director that it was necessary constitutionally to some and special inquiry officer to determine this claim. 
    I'd like to reserve what time is remaining for rebuttal.

    I think that makes a major difference in this case. 
    The question which I believe is before this Court is whether an alien merchant seaman who enters this country on a D-1 landing permit is entitled to an impartial hearing before an independent and impartial administrative judge on his bona fide claim of right to stay here to escape prosecution. 
    Now, as I originally phrase this question, I insert the words after his ship sails. 
    I'm not sure now after reading the brief of Mr. Ennis' amicus in the -- of the American Civil Liberties of Union whether I need to insert that any longer. 
    In light of the treaty which provides -- which protects refugees and deserting seaman, all the deserting seaman chapter applies only in that treaty or protocol applies only to seaman, foreign seaman flying in our case under the American flag. 
    I believe therefore the question really boils down to this and our theory is that a seaman with a bona fide claim of right is entitle to a plenary hearing with full right of appeal under Section 242 in light of the new treaty and to the Constitution and laws and cases. 
    That's our position. 
    I'd like to state briefly and enlarge upon a statement of facts.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That wasn't -- that wasn't the basis on which we granted the permit -- the writ of certiorari, was it?
speaker="g_bernhard_fedde" startTime="1813.382" stopTime="1988.245">
    Mr. G. Bernhard Fedde 
    No. 
    It was on the ground that he had, I believe it was the question of statutory interpretation after the ship had sailed. 
    I believe that was the narrower question which was presented. 
    I believe that as I have stated it's a broader question Mr. Chief Justice and that the -- this would -- I have stated now, it may not be necessary for my case but I believe that is necessary for the Court each case which is the one which Mr. Ennis in the amicus brief is supporting. 
    But I believe that as stated now it would be adequate to cover both and I have grown to this conclusion as I have been pondering the statute and the cases. 
    Now first of all, the Government has pointed as argued that we had not protested the revocation of the landing permit. 
    The facts are that Stanisic with a valid landing permit on January 6, 1965 sought out the immigration service and presented to the immigration service a claim of asylum before his expi -- before his landing permit had been revoked. 
    There was -- he was making at and he had 10 days to go really as far as it turned out, as far as the ship was concerned. 
    The ship was around for another 10 or more days. 
    He sought asylum. 
    Did he have reason? 
    Yes, 30 out 45 members of his family which was a Chetnik Yugoslav family have been executed or killed in the course of World War II and the war immediately following. 
    His own father, who was an orthodox priest's assistant, had been deprived of his church function and had been deprived of his pension rights, and was living a borderline starvation life in Yugoslavia. 
    The -- he himself Stanisic in 1957, had tried to escape from Yugoslavia. 
    He was caught by some fisherman just outside the (Inaudible). 
    He was brought back and then was threatened with life imprisonment by a court man. 
    Now, this doesn't comport with my idea of fairness and due process when the court in advance of the next defense announces what he's going to do. 
    They said, “You're going to have life imprisonment the next time you appear before this court.” 
    This is why this -- in my opinion is a serious case of a claim of bona fide right of asylum. 
    I think this makes every difference in the world. 
    Now, --

    Mr. G. Bernhard Fedde 
    We have 15 minutes notice. 
    The -- in -- on the bottom of page 3 of my brief, the respondent's brief is a -- an excerpt from an affidavit of Mr. Robinson who was at that time counsel for Stanisic to outline the exact chronology of events. 
    Stanisic appeared on January 6 and asked for asylum. 
    He was taken to Rocky Butte Jail in Portland. On January 7, he was told that -- he was asked by the immigration officials without the benefit of any counsel, “Do you intend to return to your ship?” 
    This of course is the trick question. 
    He didn't know what was the -- he just answered honestly, “No, I don't.” 
    And then they said, “Your landing permit is revoked.” 
    He had announced that he was coming there for asylum, then is subsequently his landing permit was revoked and then it was that 12 -- at 11 o'clock some members on January 7, the day after he had appealed for asylum. 
    Members of his family, Toskovic actually came to Mr. Robinson's office and said, “We need help.” 
    Mr. Robinson was in of the court at that time. 
    He announced -- however he filed a formal appearance about 12 o'clock that day one hour later.

    At 12 o'clock, Robinson filed his appearance and went to another court where he had to be it 1:30. 
    At 3 o'clock that day, he got a telephone call from the Immigration Service saying, “You are due to have your hearing on the question of asylum in 15 minutes.” 
    Robinson couldn't prepare any case in that short order and the -- Mr. Urbano who was then the District Director, simply insisted that the matter proceed at once and it was then that Mr. Robinson said, “we can't proceed and we're not going to present any evidence. 
    In fact we demand a 242 hearing.”

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, I would say they think about it is since the time they threatened him with life imprisonment at least. 
    But what worries me is that nobody gave the office the -- any indication of what the facts were that they wanted a hearing to develop, is that true?
speaker="g_bernhard_fedde" startTime="2371.193" stopTime="2644.301">
    Mr. G. Bernhard Fedde 
    I believe that is true Mr. Justice. 
    I believe that is true in the initial hearing, partly because we were and I identify myself with Stanisic, I can't help it. 
    We were getting on a matter to the hustling process and we -- under the circumstances, all we could do is just to ask for a full hearing. 
    It was apparent to us that Mr. Urbano and Mr. Petillo, his assistant were -- had bias and prejudice. 
    The deposition by the way of Mr. Urbano and Mr. Petillo appears in the files of this case which before this Court and I think the bias and prejudice are quite apparent. 
    It appeared again, again even in the subsequent hearings held January 25 and 26 at which time Mr. Urbano and Petillo or Mr. Urbano, particularly, took official not judicial but official notice that conditions in Yugoslavia were fine and that there was a relaxation of tensions toward political refugees. 
    It -- on that -- in that deposition, it appears that there was no basis and fact whatever for this finding. 
    In other words, they took judicial notice of nothing and yet came up with the offset of what Stanisic had been able to show at that hearing on January 25 and 26. 
    It's -- in the course of these -- well, if I may move on then to a statement of the case. 
    The -- the District Court referred the case back to the District Director for a summary hearing on physical persecution under Section 243 (h). 
    The District Director found no physical persecution. 
    I underscore the word “physical” here which are of course the exact language of 243 (h). 
    The -- and -- but he treated it as a matter of seeking or for request parole under 253 (1) (e) and denied parole. 
    Well, Stanisic then asked the Court to review because of the bias and prejudice of the District Director. 
    The District Court, Judge East refused to change the order of the District Director and then the matter died at that point. 
    Mr. Stanisic and his companion Vucinic applied for a private bill in Congress and it failed June 1966. 
    Then at that point, the District Director ordered Stanisic deported under and also Vucinic deported and gave them 70 hours notice to present themselves to the District Director for deportation to Yugoslavia, and as I understand they were to be sent there in handcuffs. 
    The -- in the meantime however, Section 243 (h) of the statute had been changed. 
    In other words, the goalpost had been moved. No longer was it physical persecution now it was persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion. 
    It had been broadened and we claimed that therefore the goalpost had been widened. 
    And we therefore had a greater right than we had under question of physical persecution. 
    The District Director in the earlier proceedings used always the word physical persecution and we claim that the persecution that we were facing was persecution by reason of religion, orthodox, and political opinion namely Chetnik sympathies, anti-Yugoslav, and Government views. 
    And whether physical persecution would result is hard to say, although, we have in our brief pointed out some 10 different grounds upon which this man could face anything and it's a very vague position that he faces if he goes back. 
    If he sent back he could face anything up to the death sentence back there and he has been promised a life imprisonment. 
    We'd claim therefore the -- that the -- he has now or had now under the amended statute a broader claim that he had under the earliest statute.

    Mr. G. Bernhard Fedde 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    The -- on the second proceeding, he petitioned for parole under the statute Section 243 (h), this was denied by again, the same District Director, Urbano and he then presented them through me. 
    Now, I appeared in this case at this point and I then approach the United States District Court asking for restraining order and cited number of grounds, pointing out among other things that the ship had long since left the shores and that he should be entitled a 242 hearing before a special inquiry officer. 
    It is the court rejected on the ground of res judicata. 
    The Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit reversed on the ground that basically interpret of the statute that when the ship departs the need for haste ends and that he is therefore entitled to a full hearing on the merits of the case. 
    And then --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2764.693" stopTime="2765.978">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That's a real issue that were decided there --
speaker="g_bernhard_fedde" startTime="2765.978" stopTime="2829.469">
    Mr. G. Bernhard Fedde 
    -- that's the real issue of this case. 
    Yes. 
    That is right, Your Honor. 
    The point that I think is critical in this case which certainly strength is my position, is the protocol related to the status of refugees which was ratified November 1, 1968 about 90 days ago. 
    And this, I believe applies to Stanisic and to all other refugee seaman as well as refugees in general. 
    No longer can they be sent back on the ship that brought them. 
    In fact, they cannot be sent back to the country from which they are seeking refuge or seeking it from which they are seeking asylum. 
    The -- in fact no political refugee under this protocol as I understand it, can be sent back at all to the country of origin or the country that is threatening to persecute him and therefore, under the circumstances of this case it appears to me that Stanisic in no event would be sent back to Yugoslavia, no event of course back on the ship that brought him. 
    And --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2829.469" stopTime="2831.326">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is that ratified by the Senate here?
speaker="g_bernhard_fedde" startTime="2831.326" stopTime="2874.775">
    Mr. G. Bernhard Fedde 
    Yes. 
    Yes, it has Mr. Chief Justice. 
    And so, this is our position that the summary expulsion proceedings should be limited to the absconding seaman who has no claim of right. 
    Where there is however a claim of right as in this case, he is entitled to a full and fair hearing on the facts with full right of appeal. 
    This is the minimum of due process in my opinion under the treaty and the Constitution and the cases. 
    If Stanisic is denied this then he faces a severe punishment probably life imprisonment, all we ask is fairness.

    Mr. G. Bernhard Fedde

    Justice Abe Fortas

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, and that -- does that depend on the statute? 
    As I understand it that the United States has reserved to itself the right to determine who is a refugee. 
    Then presumably in the statute to the United States has prescribed a procedure by which in cases of this sort it will make a judgment as to who is a refugee. 
    Now, you're claiming one sort of procedure, your client was given another kind of procedure and I'll be interested to hear what you have to say about the statute and what like a statute sheds upon whether you're correct in your contention or the Government's correct in its contention as to the prescribed procedure, prescribed form of proceeding. 
    I was interested in your argument, this far you seem to drop out with reference to the statute.

speaker="g_bernhard_fedde" startTime="3459.924" stopTime="3603.041">
    Mr. G. Bernhard Fedde 
    The 253, the record is a regulation, it's set forth at the end of the Government's brief, page 46 of the Government's brief. 
    The history of this is set forth rather neatly in the brief of the amicus and particularly, well beginning with page 5 and following on the brief of Mr. Ennis. 
    The gist of the argument is that 253 is a regulatory or Immigration Service Clause and is not required by the statute, and under 243 (h) as Government counsel have indicated there is no procedures set forth. 
    We claim that 242 proceedings apply namely a special inquiry officer hearing and for that reason they -- the regulatory that is the regulations 253 hearing should be stricken. 
    They are not necessary at all and it's a -- it's this which is doing the damage in the case. 
    One part also I want to bring up and that is the point of that we're talking about de minimis matter here. 
    As far as -- now, over the last 10 years, there have been only 276 Yugoslav seamen involved. 
    I pick up Yugoslav seamen because they are the primary ones from refugee countries that is -- countries where they might persecution. 
    There may be seamen from England and other place but they're not claiming political asylum. 
    The 276 over 10-year period, 27.6 men per year on an average, that is the only additional burden that would be inflicted upon the staff of the special inquiry officer if the Court throws out 253 as a regulatory provision and then permits these refugee seamen to have a full SIO hearing.

   Rebuttal of Joseph J. Connolly
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3669.763" stopTime="3672.309">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Connolly.
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="3672.309" stopTime="3826.822">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Mr. Chief Justice, the Chief Justice was very kind in extending the Government's time in which improvidently was terminated its opening statement because there's a matters of some importance, some very great importance in this case in which the Government and the respondent strongly disagree. 
    The first place the respondent has -- respondent's counsel has painted the picture of an individual who in good conscience after coming ashore rather than trying to fade into the population presents himself in the immigration office to claim the asylum under the statute. 
    I would like to call -- to invite the Court's attention to respondent's testimony before the Deputy District Director on remand from the District Court to pages 12, 14, 20 to 22, 29, and 30 of his testimony which is in the record in the Court filed in the little manila folder. 
    It is not printed. 
    It is the Government's position that that testimony gives persuasive evidence that respondent entertained the idea and the intention well before he came into Oregon this time to desert his ship and to remain permanently in the United States. 
    At the time that he came to Oregon, he obtained the conditional landing permit from an immigration officer on his agreement to return with his ship, in his representation to the immigration officer that he was going to return with ship and then he was not going to desert a ship. 
    I think the best thing that you can say on the basis of this evidence is that the position that respondent finds himself now is to scheme that was initially conceived in this representation. 
    If he had told -- if he had been honest with the immigration officer and told him that he is claiming political asylum because of anticipated persecution. 
    He clearly would not have been entitled to a temporary landing permit under Section 252. 
    He would been given a hearing under the regulations as to whether he may be paroled in the United States but in such a case that determination would be made by the District Director as it was actually in the present case then he would have no colorable claim to a hearing before special inquiry officer. 
    So, in the basis of initial misrepresentation he is permitted his status into a situation where he is just completely made a shambles of the whole statutory scheme. 
    And the next point that I'd like to bring out --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3826.822" stopTime="3850.296">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Another way of looking at it is a person off a ship from Yugoslavia coming to a strange country worked up pretty well to get even to the place where he might get justice to think of an American landing in Yugoslavia and trying to work his way through all the nuisances of Yugoslavia law. 
    I don't get this argument at all?

    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Well, I think after Mr. Stanisic got on shore he did miraculously well against what Congress direct from the statute. 
    The only point that I'm trying to -- the essential point that I'm trying to make is that he was asked one question by the immigration officer when the immigration officer came aboard a ship and that is, “Do you intend to depart with your ship?” 
    And he said, “Yes.” 
    And that's how he got a conditional landing permit and the evidence in the record, we believe, discloses that he didn't intend to depart with the ship.

    Now, the next day and I think more important point that I'd like to make is that respondent relies quite heavily on the statement of the brief of the amicus American Civil Liberties Union to the effect that the hearing which the service offers to alien seaman under 253.1 (f) of the regulation is a rather pro forma the hearing which results in the fair shuffle back to the ship. 
    They cite three cases for that. 
    The first case they site is the instant case in which when an opportunity was given to respondent to present evidence. 
    He completely refused to give without any evidence at all. 
    The second case they cite --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I -- I can readily understand that a lawyer faced with that might quickly find that he's way over to the United States District Court and file a bill and because lawyers after all under our system are suppose to have some time to get that fair case for their client and you can't expect the Yugoslav seaman or any layman to go wherein 15 minutes and present the facts in support of his claim of religious or political persecution.
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="4131.243" stopTime="4208.255">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    That's right Mr. Justice and the remedy that's available to a lawyer in that type of case as in any administrative procedure. 
    There's any judicial procedure to ask for continuance and that's what the lawyer here didn't do. 
    The lawyer said that he had a right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer under Section 242 and on the face of the record it wouldn't made any difference if he had 15 minutes, 15 hours or 15 days to prepare for it. 
    What he claimed was a different type of a hearing that didn't make any difference, how much time he got. 
    But the other two cases and I won't go into them now because time is running out or were also cases, the Kordic case in the Second Circuit, the (Inaudible) case in Fifth Circuit, cases in which the hearing was impeded by a claim that there was a right to hearing under Section 242, but more than that I was worried about by this point and I check with the immigration service. 
    And the immigration service advised me and asked me to represent to the Court that in the hearings under the regulations of an alien seaman who claims persecution if he is returned. 
    He gets the exact same type of hearing as he would have got under the full scale 242 proceeding. 
    He is entitled to have counsel -- he is entitled to have the assistance of counsel. 
    He is entitled to present any evidence which is readily available to them. 
    And that's exact --

    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Well, Mr. Justice, I think in alternative explanation on a cold record. 
    The record that doesn't disclose anything is that it was perhaps in the nature of a preliminary examination to find out exactly what nature claim Mr. Stanisic was raising. 
    We don't -- I --

    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    But before we presume on a -- I think its unfair to presume in a cold record that this Immigration Service was giving -- was willing to give him only what he could have got within 15 minutes. 
    And if I may also add to my answer, the Justice use the term a claim of right, perhaps adopting it from what Mr. Fedde had argued. 
    The Government fails to see how under either the Constitution or the international protocol, what is under American law, a discretionary relief entrusted to the Attorney General. 
    Somehow becomes a claim of right in this case.

    You mean the statute.

    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Certainly Mr. Justice, it does.

    He has a full right to claim the relief.

    Mr. Connolly, what effect did the protocol have on this statute if any?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="4479.606" stopTime="4558.503">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Mr. Chief Justice, we've -- I am implicitly assumed for the purpose of this argument that the protocol imposes on the Government a right -- an obligation to allow an alien seaman in this country, a fair opportunity to claim that he is a refugee and a fair determination that -- of his refugee status. 
    We've also assumed that that was the individual -- that was the alien seaman's right under the statute. 
    So, in so far as the Government's approach to handling persecution claims. 
    The treaty has -- the international protocol has not affected that the Government's attitude at all. 
    We've always assumed that 243 (h) is available to alien. 
    That the discretionary relief if available to alien seaman under the statute, that we enacted the right -- we promulgated a regulation which gives the alien crewman the right to obtain such a relief -- claim such relief. 
    So, it hasn't have any effect at all then -- and that is the -- assuming at the best that it has the -- that the protocol has the effect of imposing that obligation to the Government that it has no change in our procedure.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4558.503" stopTime="4580.422">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, as I understood Mr. Fedde the -- he thought the protocol prevented the Government now from sending a man back under this 252 to be -- before the ship left?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="4580.422" stopTime="4599.606">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Mr. Justice, the only -- no. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I think the only way you could get to that is it if you assume that the man is a refugee and under the Government's -- the United States agreement to the protocol reserved the Government the right to determine whether the man is a refugee or not.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4599.606" stopTime="4600.930">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Uh-huh. 
    I see.
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="4600.930" stopTime="4622.170">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    So, if the Government determines that he is not a refugee then by that factor -- by that fact the substantive provisions of the convention don't apply to him. 
    If the Government determines that he is a refugee, then he is entitled to the discretionary relief and the Government will give him the discretionary relief under the statute.
