    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case presents the question of whether or not a District Court has the power or the authority to order the use of discovery interrogatories in a habeas corpus proceeding. 
    This particular question stems from a habeas corpus proceeding below, instituted by the petitioner, Mr. Alfred Walker. 
    Mr. Walker was arrested and his premises were searched on the basis, and solely on the basis, of information supplied to the Oakland police officers by an informant, a lady named Ms. Frances Jenkins. 
    The record indicated, however, so serious a question as to the reliability of the informant which is a sole basis which could sustain -- constitutionally sustain probable cause. 
    The Chief Judge Harris ordered counsel to be appointed in an evidentiary hearing in this sole question to be held. 
    Shortly prior to the evidentiary hearing, petitioner Walker propounded a short set of interrogatories to the respondent inquiring into the possible record that would either establish her reliability or unreliability on the part of the informant. 
    The respondent objected to these interrogatories not on the ground that they were inappropriate, but on the ground that the District Court had no authority for permitting their use in a habeas corpus proceeding. 
    The matter was argued and Chief Judge Harris ordered answers to the interrogatories. 
    The respondent immediately sought leave to file a petition for mandamus or prohibition in the Ninth Circuit, and such leave was granted, thereby, postponing the evidentiary hearing. 
    The matter then was briefed and argued in the Ninth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals did, in fact, enter an order vacating the Chief Judge Harris' order. 
    Petitioner Harris then petitioned for writ of certiorari in the cases now before you on a writ which issued to the Ninth Circuit. 
    In considering any applicability of discovery procedures to habeas corpus, I think it's essential to bear in mind one indisputable premise, and that is that the constitutional and historic validity of the writ of habeas corpus today depends, on a large part, upon the District Court's ability to fulfill its duty to inquire into disputed issues of fact. 
    As this Court stated in the landmark case of Townsend against Sain, the determinations of fact issues and habeas proceedings today is the typical and not the rare case. 
    By giving this duty, the question arises in this case and in other habeas proceedings as to what rules, what guidelines, and what procedures a District Court could look to in order to fulfill this fact finding task. 
    We have suggested two basic guidelines, two basic areas, two grounds which the Court might look to. 
    The first is the application of suitable or appropriate federal rules of civil procedure and the second is an application of appropriate procedures pursuant to the Court's inherent power. 
    I should first like to discuss the applicability of the federal rules of civil procedure since we believe that the controlling rule, that is Rule 81 (a) (2), support such an application and because we believe that an application of appropriate rules is preferable and clearly preferable to a use of procedures pursuant to the Court's inherent power.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In this case, whether that the Court felt compelled to do so by the rules or whether the Court was acting as a matter discretionary power?
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="296.211" stopTime="706.227">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    No, there is no indication whatsoever. 
    All that we can surmise from the record is that the interrogatories were initially propounded pursuant to federal rules. 
    However, at the argument on this matter, the Court did not make a ruling on the federal rules. 
    The Court did take the matter under submission rather than ruling from the bench, and when the order of the Court was entered, it deleted any reference to the federal rules. 
    The order simply states that interrogatories are to be answered, and it did not say pursuant to the federal rules or pursuant to inherent power. 
    We believe, of course, that, therefore, the rule -- the ruling of the Court is sustainable on any valid ground and my understanding of the jurisdiction of a writ of prohibition is that it can only issue if there is no jurisdiction whatsoever to sustain the order in question. 
    We believe that there are two interpretations that Rule 81 (a) (2) will support. 
    One is the interpretation given by the Ninth Circuit and which is urged upon this Court by respondent. 
    And, the second is a broader interpretation which is urged upon the Court by petitioner. 
    Rule 81 (a) (2) provides that there is no doubt that some of the rules of federal procedure are applicable to habeas corpus, but it provides that only those rules will be applicable to the extent that the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United States and, secondly, that the practice is here to for -- conform to the practice in civil actions. 
    The first requirement is not an objection that we concede in this case because there are no statutes governing the practice presently before the Court. 
    It is -- and, indeed, the Ninth Circuit did not have a problem with this first requirement. 
    It is the second requirement that is in issue. 
    Under the Ninth Circuit's interpretation, the Court has read the rule here to require a showing that there is an actual use of the specific procedure, in this case a discovery interrogatory in civil actions prior to 1938. 
    And, that the exact same procedure was reported and used in habeas corpus proceedings prior to 1938 and in that event, and only in that event, says the Ninth Circuit, can rules -- appropriate rules be applied today. 
    We believe that there is no reason to read the rules so restrictively. 
    Indeed, the language does not necessarily dictate this interpretation, nor does the statutory history which actually is very unelucidating on the entire question, but it does not dictate this interpretation either. 
    The language of the statute, frankly, doesn't make sense under this interpretation because the result is to make only those rules or only those procedures applicable which were already applicable prior to 1938. 
    In that extent -- to that extent, of course, that procedure would continue on anyway after the promulgation of the federal rules, or the alternative under this narrow interpretation is to make no rules applicable. 
    In which case, there was no reason for the provision to be placed in the federal rules in the first place. 
    So, even on its face, this particular interpretation does not make sense. 
    But, a more important reason for rejecting the interpretation is the result that would flow from this interpretation. 
    The result would be to freeze all procedures which are available in habeas corpus to those procedures available in the year 1938, and the entire history of the writ of habeas corpus has been one of growth, of flexibility, of permitting the Courts to meet the expanded needs of the writ itself and, certainly, those needs have greatly expanded under the issues of this Court, under the habeas corpus statutory scheme provided by Congress. 
    And, we believe it would be an intolerable restraint upon the District Courts to be restricted simply to those narrow and rather formalistic procedures available in the year 1938. 
    Under our interpretation of Rule 81 (a) (2), we read the statute to require only a showing that there was a practice in habeas corpus conforming to a practice in civil actions in a more general sense. 
    We mean to read it -- we read it to say that if there was a general format applicable on habeas corpus similar to the general format in civil proceedings, then those rules which are suitable to or which facilitate that general form that are available today under the rules. 
    In other words, the general format that did apply to habeas corpus prior to 1938 and to civil proceedings prior to 1938 was the development and trial of issues of fact by a Court. 
    Those two practices were identical or did exist in both civil and habeas proceedings and we feel that, to that extent, rules -- in the federal rules of civil procedure which facilitate that practice should be available. 
    This, of course, would exclude, for instance, rules in ci -- civil rules governing trials by jury, since there never was a trial by jury in habeas proceedings and there should not be such a trial today, but those rules which are suitable, we believe, are supported by the statute and sound policy dictates their use today. 
    For the same reasons, the offers of the restrictive practice that I've mentioned on the part of the Ninth Circuit, the expanded duties under the habeas corpus decisions of this Court would require the Court to utilize appropriate rules to that end. 
    And, indeed, we point out in our brief that this is the -- the vast majority of Courts in this country who have utilized rules in habeas corpus have indeed adopted this interpretation and no fewer than six circuits in this country, over a period of 20 years, have adopted various rules of the federal rules of civil procedure appropriate to the task before them. 
    Five circuits of which, have adopted discovery rules. 
    All of the discovery rules of civil procedure have been used in habeas proceedings and reported other than, I believe it is, request for admissions. 
    I don't believe we've found a case on that particular proceeding, but all other rules have been used, including Rule 35.

    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Yes, Your Honor, every discovery rule, other than, I believe, one has been reported in use in District Courts or in Circuit Court in this country.

    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Well, the full extent of the rules but, when you say full sweep, it doesn't necessarily mean that it would work the same way it would in a civil proceeding. 
    In other words, there are some distinctions in habeas and civil proceedings which exist and which, once the rule is applied, would not necessarily let it be applied to the full extent. 
    What I'm saying is that all of the rules can be --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="745.600" stopTime="748.822">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Can you illustrate that?
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="748.822" stopTime="827.709">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Yes, this particular problem arises from the argument by the state that abuse would occur if certain of the rules, the discovery rules, were permitted in habeas corpus. 
    I think that the basic objection by the state is one of abuse. 
    The state contends that most habeas petitioners today are proceeding in form of paupers. 
    They're indigents, and that's true. 
    We don't dispute that. 
    And, they contend that if such a person who is unrestraint by litigation costs would have the ability to use discovery rules, he would greatly burden the state out of an attempt to embarrass them, to burn them for its own sake, to use the rules in bad faith. 
    For this reason, the state contends that it will be forced to attend hearings to obtain protective orders that it would not otherwise be required to attend or to seek under the present habeas statutory scheme. 
    But, this particular argument simply does not hold water. 
    First of all, if you look at the habeas corpus statutory sch --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="827.709" stopTime="834.410">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now that -- that's not an unfamiliar argument, anyway, in a matter of discovery generally, is it?
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="834.410" stopTime="1000.813">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    That's correct, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    It is not an unfamiliar argument and we think that, initially, the way that argument has been met since -- in the last 30 years can be met here, and that is that the rules themselves provide completely adequate protection, specifically Rule 30 of the federal rules of civil procedure which permits the Court on its own motion or by an ex parte motion or an argued motion to enter appropriate protective orders. 
    Pulling aside from that though, it's important to note that the habeas corpus statutory scheme and the federal rules when integrated, as they presently exist, would still not permit any discovery by any petitioner until the matter has been reviewed by a District Court under present law. 
    Now, this occurs for a simple reason. 
    Section 1915 of Title 28 provides that a form of pauperous proceeding cannot commence until an order of the Court permits it to commence. 
    Normally, that order is entered in a show cause order when the District Court has reviewed the request to proceed, along with the petition itself. 
    Rule 33 provides that there can be no discovery without special leave of the Court for 10 days following the commencement of the action, in other words, following a determination by the District Court that the action does or does not have merit in the entrance of a show cause order. 
    Rule 26, incidentally, governing depositions, provides an even longer moratorium of 20 days before any discovery can commence. 
    The result is that any petitioner, who submits a petition in form of pauperous, or otherwise, cannot even have the action commence under Rule 33 or the federal rules until the District Court has looked at the merits. 
    Of course, if it's an unmeritorious, frivolous, our burdensome petition, it will be dismissed as it is today and no discovery can ensue. 
    If, on the other hand, the petition has merit and the Court determines to enter a show cause order, Section 2243 of Title 28 provides that the state must file a return within three days of that order -- five days of that order, and a hearing on the entire matter is to be held three days thereafter. 
    So, that even -- even if the matter proceeds, there will be a full hearing within the 10-day period that Rule 33 would commence within 8 days. 
    At that particular hearing, and again we point out that there could be no discovery even attempted at this point, the Court will be permitted, in fact it will have several choices. 
    It can either issue the writ, at which point discovery would be immaterial. 
    It can deny the writ, at which point discovery would be immaterial, or it can order an evidentiary hearing.

    The complaints within the federal habeas statute has imposed these special restraint, is that it?
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="1041.594" stopTime="1143.036">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    That's exactly right. 
    Under the present statutory scheme, there are already built-in reviews and restraints on the use of discovery pulling aside from what we believe is a completely adequate restraint in the federal rules itself, Rule 30. 
    So, we really have two separate built-in restraints that will preclude the kind of abuse that the state suggest would occur in habeas cases. 
    In addition to this, we have to note two other experiences with the rules. 
    Since 1938, when the rules were promulgated, a prisoner has been permitted to bring a civil rights action. 
    And, under that, he has been permitted to invoke the entire spectrum of civil discovery. 
    So that, if a prisoner is really interested solely in burdening the stay, as the state suggests that this bad faith prisoner supposedly would be, he could have done so for the last 30 years. 
    And, yet, we have scoured the decision and have been unable to find any number of decisions reported where this kind of abuse took place. 
    In addition to that, we have to point out that several circuits have, for many years now, applied discovery rules directly to habeas proceedings and, yet, over these past few years that this application has been available, we find not cases reported where prisoners have abused the availability of the federal rules. 
    So, not only does the statutory scheme preclude abuse, but experience has already been had with the rules, both in habeas and so civil rights cases, indicates that abuse simply is non-existent.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    How much discovery do you -- in the habeas that is available to a state?
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="1151.150" stopTime="1199.229">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Well, I think that because in habeas proceedings the issue is not one of guilt or innocence and, therefore, it does not involve the self-incrimination privilege and because it is not really often one even involves the testimony of the petitioner, it's one, as in our case, as probable cause. 
    The petitioner couldn't perjure himself or, even if he were syncline, he won't even testify an issue because we're dealing with the process by which one is con -- is incarcerated, rather than guilt or innocence. 
    I think that the state will have just as much discovery available to it as the petitioner will. 
    It, for instance, will be avail -- it will be available to the state to inquire into any of the matters surrounding probable cause to -- that it feels appropriate to its particular case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1199.229" stopTime="1215.114">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I think your Supreme Court allows some discovery in some cases, that is, must keep itself on the part of the state, notwithstanding the privilege?
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="1215.114" stopTime="1280.405">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Yes, Mr. Justice, they have. 
    I would like to point out on this ground that this is a second objection tendered by the state and, that is, the state feels that it's in Congress to have discovery available in a habeas corpus proceeding which is not, to the full extent, dis -- available in a criminal proceeding, but we wish to point out that that objection also is invalid for one reason, because we are involved with the process by which one is incarcerated rather than with guilt or innocence. 
    The reasons for limiting discovery in some instances and criminal cases simply do not apply to habeas corpus. 
    The reasons for eliminating it in habeas -- in criminal cases has traditionally been not the belief that discovery would not lead to the objective discovery of truth but, rather, that there are counterbalancing considerations, and those are two. 
    Number one is the fear that a guilty defendant could tamper with witnesses whom he discovered -- who he discovered through discovery process and, second ,that he could use his self-incrimination privilege to deter the state from discovering against him and, yet --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1280.405" stopTime="1287.131">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Does your state allow an accused discovering the names of witnesses that state may use against?
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="1287.131" stopTime="1369.447">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Yes, I believe that's correct. 
    California does have perhaps the most liberal discovery provisions of any state in the Union but, since we are dealing here in addition with federal habeas corpus, I think it's important to point out, in addition to that, that under any state in the country, the reasons for limiting criminal discovery in some cases simply don't apply to habeas corpus. 
    In addition to that, it's important to note that where Criminal Rule 16, which has greatly expanded criminal discovery, does not fully complement civil discovery. 
    The inherent power of the Court does. 
    In other words, in criminal cases, even where Criminal Rule 16 has not permitted to complete discovery to the same extent as it would be in -- under the federal rules of civil procedure, Courts have quiet frequently exercised their inherent power to go that last mile. 
    And, we have cited cases in our brief, the Shores case, the Nolte case, other cases where the Courts have in fact complemented civil discovery in criminal proceedings. 
    So, we don't believe that there's any valid objection to extending criminal discovery devices in habeas proceedings on this ground. 
    At any rate, it's certainly not objection which could -- should control in this case.

    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger

    Mr. Justice Stewart, what happens is that, in this particular case, the warden will not know of his own first-hand knowledge. 
    Much information, at least to my knowledge, he will not know much information about Frances Jenkins, but the point is that historically, because of the development of the writ, the respondent has always been named as the warden, the person who is in custody, but the real party in interest is the state. 
    And, just as the use of civil discovery has been permitted against nominal parties where the real party in interest comes forth with the real information in question, so it would be in our case an so it would be in habeas cases generally. 
    The warden is still going to be the nominal party but since it is the state who represents him, the same attorneys, it is those -- the real party interest or those witnesses who were state witnesses and who, therefore, should furnish the information.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, under the civil rules, if I star -- if I'm involved in the civil suit at that time and so on, taking into account, I can just serve notice on somebody that I'm going to take his interrogatory. 
    I don't need to take his deposition and I don't need Court approval, isn't that right?

    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Ordinarily, that is the case but I don't' believe that could be the case in habeas proceedings for the simple reason that the Court on its own motion, or the parties, their state in the motion, or the petitioner if the state is seeking to inquire information from the petitioner, any of these parties can simply state that no discovery -- under Rule 30, no discovery will proceed until an evidentiary hearing has been determined to be necessary until counsel is appointed.

    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Yes, that's possible, but I see no burden upon that particular person other than to notify the Court that the notice has been received, and have the Court review the appropriateness of it which, in effect, in this case, means that the Court would have two possibilities. 
    The Court can say -- under without discovery at the present time, the Court can say when it appears that a witness might have relevant information in good faith, I must have this person come to a hearing because this person is -- informant may have relevant information, therefore, any person who it is believed has information, whether they have it or not, is forced to a hearing. 
    They must come to a hearing. 
    At which time, the Court can do one of two things. 
    Have the evidentiary hearing itself and when a person is found not to have any relevant information? 
    The person is dismissed even though the time has been used and the person has had to travel herein, or the Court could have two hearings. 
    They have the first hearing to determine who has relevant information. 
    Segregate those who do not from those who do, then hold the evidentiary hearing sec -- in the second place. 
    Discovery would aviate this per--

    There's no indication of such abuse. 
    And, second, because I think, as a matter of course, protective orders will be entered. 
    When the state files its return, all it would have to do is ask, in a one-line sentence, for a preclusion of discovery until an evidentiary hearing is ordered or until it is viewed by the Court to be necessary.

    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Yes, Mr. Justice, I think that we would much prefer to have the rules applied pursuant to Rule 81 (a) (2) of the federal rules which is tantamount to Congressional provisions since the rules were approved by Congress. 
    That is true. 
    We prefer to have the rules extended pursuant to 81 (a) (2) as opposed to having this order sustained below pursuant to inherent power because, while we believe that there's no question that the Court, in habeas proceedings in particular, has the inherent power and discretion to act to the ends of the duties before the Court, in this case, to try issues of fact. 
    We believe that it's preferable to have the rules applied where appropriate because the rules are codified. 
    They're available to all attorneys. 
    They're available to petitioners. 
    And, the entire body of law that has grown up around the practice set forth in the federal rules of procedure would be available throughout the country. 
    On the other hand, if procedures were to be adopted pursuant to the inherent power of the Court and if that were the sole ground for sustaining the District Court's order in this Court, then we would find that various District Courts throughout the country would adopt appropriate procedures on an ad hoc basis. 
    The decisions would be scattered through various reports. 
    It would be a lack of uniformity and, while it's important to note that, as an alternative, inherent power is an important ground and a valid ground for sustaining the order. 
    We have no doubt that it would be preferable to have the federal rules apply.

    At least arguably, this means that when Congress is provided this much with respect to interrogatories, depositions, and affidavits, it did not mean to provide for anything further by way of discovery.

    But, in determining this provision, such decisions in the history of the Act and the language of the Act itself all indicate that that particular Section 2246 deals only with the limited specific procedure of a manner of taking evidence for habeas proceeding and not for dealing in pre-trial discovery.

    And the state can introduce whatever the defendant -- whatever the prisoner does not introduce. 
    It's a little hard to see that there's any real operator difference here when you relate the two procedures, 2246 and the federal rules of civil procedure, to the habeas proceeding, except for the element of power and the judge and the 2246 to say, “No, I'm not going to proceed by written interrogatories here.”

    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    No, I don't believe that is correct, Mr. Justice Fortas, because Rule 2246 provides for interrogatories only as a means of cross-examining an affiant of an affidavit. 
    The Court is not permitted, under 2246, to permit a party to proceed with interrogatories. 
    The only time interrogatories are available under 2246 is in the event that, in a prior determination, the Court has decided to allow evidence to come in by affidavit. 
    Interrogatories, otherwise, cannot even be permitted under 2246. 
    It's clear from the language and the interpretation.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2464.019" stopTime="2479.014">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I'm aware of that, but I suppose that if the Court proceeds by affidavit, that he could accept as evidentiary the -- whatever comes in on written interrogatories.

    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Well, that is true but, unfortunately, the affidavit provisions do not permit any discovery. 
    In this particular case, there's no reason to believe that we would have the right or the ability to obtain an affidavit from the state.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2491.209" stopTime="2519.800">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But the chronology in a habeas suit -- curious situation of a habeas case, chronology works out so, as I think you've heard, happily and very well put into us. 
    Chronology works out so that you don't have the usual difference between discovery -- a pre-trial discovery and the use on trial that you have in a civil proceeding.
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="2519.800" stopTime="2670.553">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Well, certainly not up until -- it's true that procedure differs greatly until an evidentiary hearing is ordered. 
    At that point, I believe that the procedures are directly parallel because once an evidentiary procedure -- proceeding is ordered, then we find ourselves confronted with precisely the same type of determination that a Court and a counsel are confronted within a civil proceeding, and that is to find, develop, present, and draw a conclusions of fact. 
    And, that's exactly what has happened in habeas corpus proceedings today under, first, Brown against Allen, and then under the mandatory provisions of Townsend against Sain. 
    We're contending that, given that requirement, the Court must have the tools to fulfill it, and the only tools that it can use to fulfill it are provided either pursuant to its inherent power or, preferably, pursuant to the federal rules of civil procedure. 
    There are -- briefly, there are three other objections that the state has tendered. 
    One is, we believe to be somewhat curious, they have contended that the summary provisions of Section 2243 require a speedy hearing. 
    And, for this reason, discovery would actually slow down the hearing and be contrary to 2243. 
    As I've already pointed out, discovery on the contrary will facilitate and speed a hearing by permitting the exclusion of the double hearing and, secondly, I think we need only point out that any delay that is occasioned by a petitioner's use of discovery is delay of his own choosing. 
    And, thirdly, I think it's important to point out that the summary provisions of 2243 require the Court to quickly review the matter and not ultimately to dispose of the matter quickly. 
    In other words, the review process must get on the way quickly after a petition is filed but, if it is in the interest of the petitioner and the Court to develop the facts ultimately to be determined at the evidentiary hearing. 
    Certainly, the summary provisions of Section 2243 would not suggest that the Court or the parties should sacrifice the ultimate justice to be accorded the petitioner through this fact-finding process simply for the sake of speed. 
    If I may, I will reserve a few remaining moments for rebuttal.

   Argument of Derald E. Granberg
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2671.152" stopTime="2677.398">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may, Mr. Pottinger. 
    Mr. Granberg.
speaker="derald_e_granberg" startTime="2677.398" stopTime="2834.709">
    Mr. Derald E. Granberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I'd like to direct my remarks initially to petitioner's argument that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize the use of the discovery mechanism provided therein to a habeas proceeding. 
    This, of course, turns on the construction to be accorded to Rule 81 (a) (2) of those rules which provides simply, these rules are applicable to proceedings for admission to citizenship habeas corpus and quo warranto, to the extent that the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United States and is here to conform to the practice in civil actions. 
    This imposes two conditions, and we will argue later that neither these conditions can be met. Before I reach that argument, however, I would like to present some remarks with respect to what I feel this evidence is as to the purpose of the original framers of these rules back in 1938. 
    First of all, I believe we could discern that it makes it perfectly apparent that the framers of the rules recognized that procedures, with respect to habeas corpus, are set forth in the statute. 
    Secondly, it expresses a clear intention that procedures, with respect to habeas corpus, are to be controlled by statutory changes as well. 
    It is any of that that a statutory change occurs with respect to procedure. 
    That is to control. 
    And, finally, with respect to that second condition, by it conforming to the practice prior to 1938, that offense is a clear intention not to change existing practice in habeas corpus. 
    A clear intention to maintain a few were status quo with respect to habeas practice as it existed in 1938, and not to freeze it there but to leave any changes that are to occur to Congress through the statutory changes that it sees fit to make. 
    Now, certainly, Congress has, since that time, affected changes with respect to habeas procedure. 
    The -- this recent -- excuse me. 
    The most recent evidence of that can be found in Section 2241, an enactment there in 1966, an enactment in 2254 in 1966, enactments which significantly affect procedure with respect to habeas proceedings. 
    I believe that this --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2834.709" stopTime="2838.230">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What are the changes in 2241 and 2254?
speaker="derald_e_granberg" startTime="2838.230" stopTime="2875.422">
    Mr. Derald E. Granberg 
    2241 relates essentially to jurisdiction and provides that when you have a state with more than one federal judicial district, a habeas petition can be entertained either in a district within which the petitioner is confined or the district within which a state criminal conviction and sentence occurred. 
    Now, 2254 provides significant changes with respect to the presumption of correctness which is to attend a state factual determination reached after a hearing and reflected by written indicia or findings.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2875.422" stopTime="2878.690">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And, both those amendments were made in the 1960s.
speaker="derald_e_granberg" startTime="2878.690" stopTime="3120.004">
    Mr. Derald E. Granberg 
    1966, yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, I believe that this policy decision reflected in Rule 81 (a) (2), as of 1938, is a very sound one, but it was sound when made and it remains sound today. 
    First of all, pleading in procedure in habeas corpus is completely inconsistent with pleading procedure as it exists now under the conventional rules of practice for a civil litigation. 
    And, a habeas petitioner is required to allege with particularity, those facts upon which he relies, and which if established, would justify him to relate. 
    When Congress introduced the discovery procedure through the civil rules in 1938, it affronted what this Court referred to as one of the most significant innovations of those rules yet. 
    Those rules came in along with substantial changes with respect to pleading in civil actions as well as simplified pleading. 
    And, part of a justification for the change in pleading exists in the fact that the discovery techniques are afforded to the parties to be exercised by the parties for the purposes of defining issues, for fact revelation, and such similar purposes. 
    Now, the justification with this discovery procedure lies certainly in part in these pleading changes which occurred as well, simplified pleadings, streamlined pleading. 
    Yet, these pleading changes have no pertinence whatever with respect to a habeas proceeding. 
    Now, I believe a second sound reason why the framers sought that not to extent these civil rules with respect to the discovery mechanism to a habeas proceeding is this. 
    It's completely inconsistent with the summary nature of a habeas proceeding. 
    Now, when I say summary, certainly, I'm talking in terms of affording quick relief to a petitioner. 
    I'm talking about other reasons as well. 
    Such factors as minimizing the impact on a state rehabilitated process, such factors as minimizing the impact of the burden of habeas applications upon the Federal Courts as well. 
    There are techniques for resolving these petitions for disposing of them without proceeding through a hearing. 
    Certainly, if petitioner has failed to allege these specific facts as inserted only conclusory allegations in stating his claim for relief, he's not entitled to a hearing. 
    The petition is entitled to be dismissed. 
    Another sound policy consideration, I think, that existed in 1938 and, certainly, that continues today is the fact that in no criminal discovery system that has been initiated within any state or within the federal system does anything akin to this civil discovery mechanism exist, nothing that even approximates. 
    Now certainly, California, in the field of criminal discovery, has gone as far as anyone has, perhaps much further. 
    Now, we afford to a defendant copies of any statements he's made, copies of other witnesses, copies relating to physical tests, copies relating to examination of scientific evidence. 
    Factors such as these, for a long time, we've given them copies of the grand jury transcript that has been indicted. 
    He's afforded a copy of the transcript of the preliminary hearing if he's held to answer through the information process. 
    Yet, California has specifically rejected efforts to utilize depositions for purposes of discovery or interrogatories for purposes of discovery. 
    It's a system which is simply foreign to the procedure and its' been recognized as such and rejected. 
    And, I submit that it is just as foreign within the context of a habeas proceeding.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Oh, yes.
speaker="derald_e_granberg" startTime="3148.413" stopTime="3433.523">
    Mr. Derald E. Granberg 
    It is not recognized by a statute, but the Court appropriately recognized that the provisions, with respect to civil discovery, have no applicability to criminal cases. 
    Finally, I believe that this policy decision made back in 1938 was found and remain sound for further reason. 
    When you balance the potential for abuse which exists here against the value -- potential value of the procedure to petitioners, I think it becomes perfectly apparent that the increase in litigation increased burden on states attorneys. 
    The dangers of harassment with respect to witnesses, arresting officers, prosecuting attorneys, perhaps even defense attorneys, should the procedure be made available, indicates a sound reason for not extending civil discovery to habeas proceedings. 
    I'd like to turn now for a moment to the specific condition set forth in Section 81 (a) (2), and I will argue that the first condition cannot be met, that is, there cannot be a showing that practice is not controlled by a statute. 
    Practice was respect to depositions and interrogatory is controlled by a statute within the Habeas Act. 
    Section 2246 accomplishes this. 
    Depositions may be utilized for evidence. 
    Judicially, in the Ninth Circuit, and I refer now to the Wilson versus Weigel, the Court has indicated that depositions, as the term is used in 2246, includes also depositions on written interrogatories. 
    Now, that's not an acceptance of the applicability of the civil rules. 
    It's simply a recognition that one appropriate way of taking a deposition is by written interrogatories. 
    Of course, this follows a procedure very much akin to that set out in Section 31 of the federal civil rules. 
    But, in any event, 2246 limits depositions to evidentiary purposes. 
    In Wilson versus Weigel, the Ninth Circuit was asked to extend or to reconsider the decision that is now here before this Court in Wilson versus Harris and change its mind, but it did not. 
    It said depositions can be taken under Section 2246 and that it cannot be taken under Rule 26 (a) of the federal civil rules for purposes of discovery. 
    And, if objections are to be made to specific questions, then this is the appropriate matter -- appropriate approach to take but, nevertheless, it refused to extend the federal civil rules to a habeas proceeding. 
    It adhered to the decision that it entered earlier in this case here in issue. 
    Now, I think it's extremely significant the manner in which Section 2246 regulates deposition in interrogatory practice and the fact that this was enacted. 
    2246 was added in 1948, a full 10 years after the federal civil rules have been adopted. 
    Yet, not only do we have the inconsistency between Rule 26 through 37 of the federal civil rules that added 2246 of the Habeas Act that depositions, interrogatories, and so forth are not permitted for discovery in habeas actions, but we also have inconsistencies with respect to the use which may be made of depositions taken or interrogatories, if you will, for purposes of evidence at a trial. 
    Under 2246, the section provides simply that depositions may be taken for use as evidence, may be utilized in taking evidence at a habeas proceeding. 
    Rule 26 (a), on the other hand, provides a number of conditions with respect to the utilization which can be made at trial of depositions taken pursuant to them. 
    Again, when Congress added 2246 in 1948, I submit, it specifically rejected any suggestion that discovery techniques such those found in the civil rules should be applicable in a habeas proceeding.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3433.523" stopTime="3441.778">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is there anything in the legislative history that indicates that apart from the language of the statute?
speaker="derald_e_granberg" startTime="3441.778" stopTime="3522.550">
    Mr. Derald E. Granberg 
    The legislative history which we encountered with respect to 2246 deals solely with the techniques of taking evidence. 
    There's no discussion that we have been able to find with respect to discovery. 
    It does make the point that the use of written interrogatories under 2246, as it appears there, is limited to what -- to offering something in akin to cross-examination of one who has presented an affidavit. 
    That is, under the section literally, written interrogatories can be used only against an individual who has presented an affidavit for use in evidence, technique of testing the evidence in that way. 
    Finally, turning to the second condition with respect to former practice, there simply can't be no showing made that anything, even a perch, the discovery mechanism found in the federal rules in civil procedure existed in the habeas proceedings in 1938. 
    I would submit that there can be no showing that any discovery practice existed in Habeas Court in 1938. 
    The purpose expressed in maintaining status quo certainly militates against any finding that the second condition can be met.

    Thank you very much.
speaker="derald_e_granberg" startTime="3552.245" stopTime="3881.942">
    Mr. Derald E. Granberg 
    Now, I would submit that this absence of authority to make any showing prior discovery practice in habeas proceedings, prior to 1948 that is, is extremely significant. 
    Certainly, this absence of authority was viewed as one of the factors which lead this Court to conclude in Miner versus Atlass that there was no traditional inherent power if you were to order depositions or to authorize deposition for discovery purposes in an admiralty proceeding. 
    Now, as the Court noted specifically that there was no indication, the traditional practice in this regard. 
    Turning to the argument that, apart from the civil rules, the Court have some sort of inherent power to authorize and implement and sanction or fashion, if you were, a discovery procedure akin to that found in the civil rules, I submit that this is simply not an appropriate area for an exercise of inherent power. 
    One of the justifications that had been offered to this Court by a petitioner is that such a power can be found within the habeas statutes themselves. 
    The hearing requirement impose by section 2243 is summarily here and resolved. 
    I submit that that affords no basis for implementing or for permitting District Courts to implement, if you were, discovery practice in akin to this. 
    Now, certainly, 2246 within the habeas statutes affords no basis for implementing a discovery practice into this. 
    The time provisions filed within 2243, the time requirements, are completely at odds with implanting a discovery procedure akin to that found in the federal civil rules. 
    As we've argued earlier, the plating requirements with respect to habeas are completely inconsistent with implementing a discovery procedure. 
    An applicant's required to plead and assert, with particularity, those factual matters upon which he would rely on seeking relief. 
    And, it's also significant to note that the habeas statutes do deal with the production of records, documents, and that this offers one additional reason for finding a real necessity for civil discovery techniques in a habeas proceeding. 
    One of the requirements with respect to a habeas applicant in the Federal Courts is that he had exhausted state remedies before he reaches the Federal Courts or before the Federal Courts, at least as a matter of committee, assume jurisdiction. 
    224 -- 2254 of the habeas statutes now provides, when a factual determination has been made by a State Court and it's been made after a hearing on the merits, it's entitled to a presumption of correctives. 
    And, if an issue passes through the State Courts and reaches the Federal Courts and those records become significant, 2254 also provides a means whereby those records -- Court records and materials relating to the factual determination can be brought before the Federal Court and be relied upon in resolving the petition. 
    Insofar as any suggestion that an inherent power may be found apart from the habeas statutes, just kind of a vague general inherent power, I would suggest that this is not an area which is appropriate for the exercise of inherent power. 
    Traditionally, as I understand the concept, inherent power may be relied upon by the Court, which has a particular duty imposed on it. 
    That is, if a Court has been, say, required by a statute to conduct hearings with respect to certain matters, it does have inherent power necessary to it to carry out its jurisdictional obligations, and if a procedure has not been provided which is absolutely necessary to the exercise of its power. 
    And, through inherent power, it can resolve a procedure to meet the problem, but discovery just doesn't come within that. 
    Civil discovery practice, not by any stretch of the imagination, can be characterized in something that's necessary to a Habeas Court to carry out its responsibilities under the statute. 
    The civil discovery mechanism is simply foreign to the habeas practice. 
    I think it's also significant in this regard that Congress has never seen fact to extend at civil discovery practice to habeas proceedings. 
    It suggests to me as well that this is an area which is simply inappropriate for an exercise of inherent power.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Your position is that even if a prisoner in a habeas proceeding should make some sort of a case and by affidavit, let us say, and a credible case, then he comes to the judge and asks for -- asks the judge in excise of his inherent power and discretionary power, power in the whole writs or whatnot, to authorize him to serve written interrogatories on named people, that the Court would not have such power.

    Now, that's a procedure which authorizes sanctions, if you would, the use of written interrogatories, but as a technique for taking an evidentiary deposition.

    The prisoner says “I want to -- in order to prove this out, I've got to engage in some discovery. 
    So, please permit me to serve written interrogatories on certain persons.”

    Now, before the judge -- district judge orders an evidentiary hearing, he must have determined that, on the basis of the petition submitted by the applicant and initially the traverse submitted by the applicant, balancing that against the or -- return to the order to show cause submitted by the respondent Warden, that there are certain factual questions raised that there have been factual questions raised with particularity by the allegations of the petitioner that, if proven to be true, will authorize -- will, in effect, compel that he'd be released from custody. 
    Now, the petitioner has already spelled out all of the facts that he needs to know if he is to be ordered release from custody.

    What this would be --
speaker="jerome_m_feit" startTime="4908.592" stopTime="5060.404">
    Mr. Jerome M. Feit 
    Yes. 
    I think this is quite clear. 
    Even the figures in our brief on page 12 point this out. 
    I would like also to note that, initially, that government's view is not that the sentencing judge on the 2255 is without power wholly apart from the federal civil rules to permit discovery fact-finding in the rare and unusual case. 
    Essentially, our position is that the civil rules of discovery deposition do not apply the 2255 prosi -- proceedings. 
    One looks at the statute, as Mr. Justice Brennan points out, the claimant has the obligation to set forth the facts that was raised in issue and, most significantly, the Sentencing Court is then to examine the motion of files and records of the case to see if these documents conclusively show that the prisoner is not entitled to any relief. 
    If he so concludes, he shall dismiss or deny the application. 
    If he does not, he can notify the US attorney and schedule a hearing to determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
    Moreover, whenever a hearing is to be held, it is required to be held promptly. 
    It is at such a hearing that the issues will be explored and it is based upon the facts induced on such hearing that the sentencing judge is to make his findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
    What Congress has done perhaps extend to the practice in a criminal case but, in effect on the 2255, it has set up a pleading method of evaluating the claim and perhaps this is the same way of saying, Mr. Justice Brennan, which takes account quite clearly of the fact that the sentencing judge is now operating on a clean slate, but against the background of a criminal conviction which might have fully resolved the issue so that it would be re-litigated in 2255. 
    And finally, it has recognized that, at the hearing, the sentencing judge and no one else has the obligation to determine if the restraint alleged is unconstitutional. 
    On the other hand, the crucial thrust of the deposition interrogatory practice under the civil rules is just the other way. 
    In a large measure, its purpose is to supplant the pleading in trial development of fact that is the basic--

    Well, we're in issue --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5070.222" stopTime="5075.251">

    You're making it an extension of the criminal proceeding.
speaker="jerome_m_feit" startTime="5075.251" stopTime="5075.323">
    Mr. Jerome M. Feit 
    I think --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Am I right?
speaker="jerome_m_feit" startTime="5075.906" stopTime="5149.933">
    Mr. Jerome M. Feit 
    I think the statute, though, puts the primary focus on the examination of the files and records. 
    If they conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the judge must dismiss the motion. 
    Now, if that is inappropriate then, normally, he would hold a hearing and presumably would appoint counsel. 
    We -- we don't think that 2255 is simply an extension of the criminal case per se. 
    What we think it is, is a particularized method by which Congress sought to attack -- permit attack collaterally upon convictions because 2255 still provides that if the relief is insufficient or unavailable or that the habeas corpus might provide it a proper remedy. 
    Now, this Court has pointed out on more than one occasion that the relief under 2255 is the substantial equivalent of the relief under habeas corpus. 
    I think it might be a serious problem to consider 2255 simply of an extension of the criminal case. 
    Then, I presume it could be argued that relief under the habeas statutes would still be available.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5149.933" stopTime="5152.554">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    My whole point was I didn't think it had to go that far --
speaker="jerome_m_feit" startTime="5152.554" stopTime="5152.898">
    Mr. Jerome M. Feit 
    No, I agree.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="5152.898" stopTime="5154.782">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In order to claim your part.
speaker="jerome_m_feit" startTime="5154.782" stopTime="5602.392">
    Mr. Jerome M. Feit 
    I agree. 
    I think that 2255 is a particularized method set up by Congress to deal with post conviction alleged constitutional defects. 
    In civil discovery, the vital developments of the fact is to stem from the pre-trial examination and, primarily, to afford a way out, perhaps, for out-of-Court settlement either by agreement of the parties with summary judgment. 
    Alternatively, if the case needs to go to trial, discovery provides a way to assure that no relevant facts in either party's case are hidden at the trial. 
    In ordinary civil litigation, wholly unrelated to a pre-existing criminal conviction, the benefits, thus arrived, are deemed to outweigh the time expended in such deposition and cross-deposition practice, but such practice is wholly at odds, as I say, with the scheme and definite precision of Section 2255, and it raises the danger of logging upon time-consuming possibly irrelevant investigation better spent at a hearing. 
    But, perhaps most significantly from our point of view, the automatic adoption of the deposition interrogatory rules of civil discovery in collateral proceedings, would we think, remove from the sentencing judge or intend to remove from the sentencing judge direct and immediate control in proceedings. 
    We think the emphasis of Townsend and Sain, fainted away in the Sanders case, is that the habeas judge -- sentencing judge is to exercise close control over the proceedings. 
    Deposition on discovery under the civil rules is governed by entirely different criteria. 
    It is party-focused with the judge settling disputes as to the particulars of the discovery after the fact. 
    It is only after a notice of deposition or written interrogatories is served that he may decide to limit the fact-finding on a showing of good cause. 
    In the -- in most instances under the federal civil rules, depositions and discovery may be sought without leave of Court, as we read the rules. 
    The government's control essentially is a referee. 
    We think to grant such broad range in discovery procedures as automatic attributes of 2255 is to create a real danger of possible abuse of the writ. 
    It is, thus, not unreasonable to forecast that even the most conclusorary allegations will be followed by wide demands for interrogatories and depositions of government prosecutors that have been investigated, etcetera. 
    Of course, the Court may prevent this procedure, but only after the delay of harassment which is -- it seems to us was wholly at odds with the prompt resolution of the const -- question of unconstitutional restraint that 2255 talks to. 
    In short, whatever benefit may be derived by the deposition and discovery in a particular case, these benefits, we think, are wholly disproportionate to the delay, opportunity for harassment, collateral investigation, uncertainty, and loss of direct control by the sentencing judge over the proceedings. 
    If testimonial facts need development, they can appropriately be developed at the hearing or by the evidentiary deposition route. 
    Any change in this regard, we think, should come from the rule makers or, principally, from Congress. 
    I would like to add a word as to our view on the question of power independent of the rules. 
    We do not think this question of -- that question is necessarily raised in this case by virtue of eth Ninth Circuit, as we read the opinion, essentially finding that there was no authority under the federal civil rules and no specific authority under 2246. 
    The opinion did not touch beyond that. 
    Nevertheless, since the issue has been argued and briefed and we have indicated in our brief that we have a position on this, we believe that such a power does exist. 
    I would summarily like to state our views in this regard. 
    We think this power is part of the equity power of the sentencing or habeas judge, and this Court has recognized in Fay and Noia, Brown against Allen, and in the language of this Court has used in its recent decisions in Sanders and Townsend against Sain that the judge is “free to adopt any appropriate means for inquiry into the legality of the prisoner's detention, and the power of inquiry on federal habeas corpus is plenary.” 
    In answer to your question, Mr. Justice Fortas, the government's position is that the power exists. 
    However, we think the power should be used quite sparingly only in the rarest of circumstances since the 2255 route provides the basic framework for resolving these issues. 
    An illustration of a possible fact-finding situation, I think, is Machibroda where the facts -- in 368 US, where the facts were -- claim was made that a defendant had spoken to government counsel on three occasions in prison. 
    The government counsel, in effect, coerced the plea of guilty, and the question arose whether the prisoner was -- need to be present at a hearing and, Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, the sentencing judge uses common sense. 
    That was the kind of thing where the facts were not in dispute where -- that outside the record but easily available and the prisoner would not be -- not need to be at such a hearing. 
    This is the kind of fact finding, I think, that exists in the sentencing judge of the 2255. 
    We -- for example, there might be a case where there are some very extensive scientific records or examinations, physical examinations on a claim of mental incompetency, and the sentencing judge may feel that, well, that these may be or not in the actual record. 
    He may feel that the opportunity of the defense counsel to examine them prior to the actual hearing might be appropriate to advance the purposes of the hearing. 
    What we're really saying is, yes, there is power sparingly to be employed, very sparingly to be utilized, and under direct control of the sentencing judge. 
    I might emphasize that we recognize the dangers of extensive deposition and other interrogatory pre-trial proceedings and we do not think that the judge, as a matter of course, should take this route. 
    On the contrary, we think it should be the rare very unusual instance, and we also think that the basic way the facts are to be developed is at the 2255 hearing that is spelled out in the statute.

   Rebuttal of J. Stanley Pottinger
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6325.061" stopTime="6327.389">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Pottinger.
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="6327.389" stopTime="6686.553">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    May I first correct Mr. Feit in his assertion that there is nothing in the record, at least that he has seen, to indicate that the inherent power authority was raised below. 
    In fact, it was raised and cited in the brief of the respondent below, that is Judge Harris below, and it was so-interpreted by the state. 
    And, in the second part of their brief in the Ninth Circuit, their supplemental brief, they have dealt with the issue by citing the statement that an examination of all authorities other than the rule indicates that there was not appropriate power. 
    So, the issue is, presently, properly before this Court. 
    The respondent has suggested that there is a need for special congressional authorization for the use of discovery techniques in habeas corpus, but I think he fails to recognize that Congress has already dealt with the subject. 
    He tends to argue, I think -- I read his argument to say that there is no room for any application of any of the rules of civil procedure to habeas corpus, that this was the intent of the framers that it is not to apply any of the rules. 
    Of course, Rule 81 (a) (2) on its face shows very clearly that at least some of the rules are to apply because, very clearly, it says “to the extent that certain conditions are met, the federal rules of civil procedure are to apply to habeas corpus.” 
    The question is not whether any of the rules are to apply or not to apply, but which rules are to apply and that's the -- that is the test that we have addressed ourselves to here and in our brief. 
    Secondly, I think it's important to note that Congress has never attempted to regulate the whole of habeas corpus by statute. 
    On the contrary, Sections 21 -- 2241 through 45 -- 54, excuse me, that is the habeas corpus statutory scheme, is a very skeletal framework. 
    Essentially, it codified the common law procedure which is a very widespread and very developed procedure in habeas corpus, but it does not pretend to regulate all the procedures. 
    If it did and if respondent's position were adopted, this Court would have to find, for instance, that the appointment of counsel in habeas corpus is no longer permitted because there's nothing in congressional authority to suggest that counsel can be permit -- can be appointed in habeas corpus. 
    That has been done through the traditional exercise of the Court's power. 
    There are similar other exercises that the Court has taken traditionally in habeas corpus to facilitate the ultimate resolution of fact issues and interrogatories, appropriate interrogatories such as the ones in this case, are really no different in quality and/or in burden from those procedures that the Court has been permitted to adopt without controversy for many years. 
    Finally, respondent relies on a case of Miner against Atlass for the proposition that this Court should look strictly to congressional authority because, in that case, the Court look to congressional authority before extending the use of discovery depositions in admiralty proceedings. 
    Yet, it's perfectly clear from the face of Miner against Atlass that there was an admiralty proceedings and a blanket exclusion adopted in the rules, that is to say a blanket exclusion of all of the federal rules to admiralty proceedings. 
    On the contrary, in habeas corpus, such a blanket exclusion was considered by Congress and/or by the framers of the rules and explicitly rejected, and we have put in our addendum to our reply brief the indication that this was the case. 
    And, in place of this blanket exclusion, Congress did adopt 81 (a) (2) in its present form which clearly does extend appropriate federal rules to habeas corpus proceedings. 
    There are other reasons why this Court in Miner and Atlass decided that it could not use discovery in admiralty proceedings which do not apply in the present case. 
    One of which was that in Cong -- in the congressional adoption of the certain federal rules to include -- to be included in the general admiralty rules, Congress considered discovery and explicitly rejected discovery. 
    And, for that reason, this Court noted in Miner against Atlass that there was an explicit rejection of discovery in admiralty which was tantamount to a congressional expression of will. 
    There is no comparable expression of will in habeas corpus. 
    On the contrary, as I've just mentioned, it is clear that 81 (a) (2) does extend certain of the federal rules to civil procedure. 
    Finally, I think that it's important to note that we consider this case of the utmost importance to habeas corpus proceedings and petitioners throughout the country. 
    Fourth, it's -- if it's clear that Townsend against Sain and the other decisions of this Court which have interpreted the common law practice and the skeletal framework that Congress has set forth require a Court to develop issues of fact. 
    It's clear that it should be permitted. 
    The interrogatory should be permitted in this case and, appropriately, in other cases as well. 
    I'd like to close by pointing out that, in this particular case, there's no doubt that the evidentiary hearing that Mr. Walker will ultimately come to will turn greatly upon the information that we have requested in these interrogatories. 
    Without this information, it will be virtually impossible for counsel to know what witnesses to call at that hearing. 
    It would be impossible for him to know how to resolve the conflicting testimony that took place in the preliminary examination and in the trial which lead to a finding of probable cause but which, since that trial, has indicated was incorrectly stated. 
    That is to say--

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I have a difficulty with, Mr. Pottinger, is this -- why can't you get all that right at the hearing?

    The -- the short answer to that, Mr. Justice, is that we need the information for all the reasons that civil litigants need discovery to prepare a trial in a civil case.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the issue here, as I understand it, is whether or not there was probable cause for a search of a hotel room across the bay and across San Francisco Bay.
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="6738.642" stopTime="6739.109">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6739.109" stopTime="6749.483">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Whether or not one Frances somebody or another was a reliable informant, and that issue could be developed right at the hearing, can't it?
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="6749.483" stopTime="6749.919">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    No, I don't believe it can.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What's the advantage of doing it there?
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="6750.980" stopTime="6856.400">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    I -- I don't believe it can for this reason, and it's important to look at the reasons that exist in this case in which were argued to the District Court because Chief Judge Harris asked precisely the question you're asking now and was convinced that interrogatories were essential. 
    The reasons are this. 
    At the preliminary hearing for Mr. Walker, there was an I -- there was testimony by the arresting officer that they had pri -- 20 prior arrests and convictions and, on that ground and explicitly on that ground, the Court found reliability and, therefore, found probable cause. 
    At the petitioner's trial, that same officer could only testify to two such occasions. 
    One of those occasions turned out to be a lack of a conviction. 
    In fact, it indicates that perhaps the information was unreliable given by Ms. Jenkins. 
    The other occasion, Ms. Jenkins herself has sworn under penalty of perjury she did not give information to the police on it. 
    Now, we have this direct conflict and, for that reason, the Court saw that it very well may be that the informant who now contends in effect that she was not reliable to the same extent that the police contend, the Court finds that that issue must be resolved. 
    If we have to wait until the police officer is called at that hearing, which is the last chance for Mr. Walker, and ask him at that time for the first time the same questions which we ask in those interrogatories, we're simply going to have to take his answer. 
    If he says “I can't remember” or if he says “I --“ or if he distorted or embellished the -- his testimony on the first occasion, I'm simply going to have to take that answer. 
    I will have no way to know how to rebut it. 
    I will have no way to know how to impeach him if necessary. 
    I will have no way to know what other witnesses he should call or I should call.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I would suggest that you're going to be even more limited in your interrogatories because when you're asking the warden these questions, the honest answer to your questions is “I don't know.”
speaker="j_stanley_pottinger" startTime="6867.264" stopTime="6900.051">
    Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger 
    Well, perhaps I that defect or that technicality is controlling, we will have to resolve it by addressing the interrogatories directly to the state under the theory that the state is the real party in interest and, for that reason, we will nonetheless secure these answers directly from the police officers. 
    But, I consider the law to take care of the particular questions at the present time because the real power in interest theory would seem to us to allow us to get behind the warden to the real party in interest under present standards.

    We don't believe so, Mr. Justice Black, but we believe that in the event that the Court is of a different mind that, certainly, inherent power is a second alternative, one that is undisputed and one which flows not only from ex parte Peterson but from the implicit nature, the implications of Townsend against Sain which was to command the Court to inquire into issues of fact and to give the petitioner a full and fair hearing. 
    And, we believe that in this case, as I've just explained, and in other cases it will be impossible to give him a full and fair hearing without appropriate discovery.

    I believe -- I believe with regard to the civil rules, however, to answer your question directly, that the policy decision was made in 1938 when Rule 81 (a) (2) was adopted and that that decision did include not only an application of the federal rules to general civil proceedings, but also to habeas corpus. 
    And, properly interpreted, the language of Rule 81 (a) (2) would lead the Court to that conclusion. 
    Thank you.
