    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Good morning Mr. Chief Justice.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="15.636" stopTime="30.380">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Before you start, I should have said that the orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief Justice and filed with the Court below will not be announced thoroughly. 
    You may proceed now Mr. Goldstick.
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="30.380" stopTime="180.749">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from a conviction of the Criminal Court of the City of New York, where an appellant was convicted for malicious mischief. 
    And that he be filed and cast contempt upon and burned an American flag in violation of Section 1425 (16) (d), of the New York State Penal Law. 
    The charge was that he did willfully set fire to and burn the American flag and shout, “If they did that to James Meredith, We don't need and American Flag”. 
    The judgment was unanimously affirmed by the appellant term of the Supreme Court of New York without decision, and in turn, the Judgment unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeals, Judge Fuld rendering the opinion. 
    The statute in question is set forth in page 5 of appellant's brief. 
    I might, at the Halter say that we agreed completely with Justice Fuld when he states that the central issue in this case is whether or not the deliberate act of burning an American flag in public as a protest maybe punished as a crime. 
    Parenthetically, we believed there was another issue that was raised then and that is raised here today, that assuming that New York State may punish such an act as a crime, may it do it under the statute in question. 
    The facts are really undisputed, on June 6, 1966 at about 5:30 in the afternoon, Sidney Street was sitting in his apartment listening to the radio when he heard news broadcasts that James Meredith, while marching through Mississippi was shot. 
    He went to his door to get an American Flag when down from his apartment to a street corner, put a piece of paper in the street folding the flag in one hand, properly fold it, put a match to it, and set it on fire. 
    A police officer testified at the trial that he saw the smoke, came over to find out what had occurred, saw on the street corner a flag partially burned and folded lying on the ground, heard a man shouting, couldn't quite make out what he was saying. 
    At the other street corner across the street, heard a man shout, “We don't need no damn flag!” Upon identify who the man was who it turned out to be the defendant. 
    Asked him if it was his flag, the appellant said “Yes, it was my flag”, and said the words “If they did that to James Meredith, We don't need the American Flag”.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Goldstick, Judge Fuld and his recital of the facts and his opinions for the Court of Appeals. 
    It does have a little minor error in his factual recital does he not? 
    When he says that your client told the small crowd which collected that quote “if they let that happen to Meredith, We don't need an American Flag”.
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="206.235" stopTime="239.755">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Now, we don't know if factual error then and I'll tell why Mr. Justice, because they also testified that he came over after the burning and that he questioned the person street there at the corner. 
    Now, I don't know whether when he questioned him loud enough for the crowd to have heard the question. 
    I think we may assume that he did. 
    Certainly, we may assume that the crowd did hear “We don't need no damn flag”, that's without question. 
    The other words, with the records just doesn't clear Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="239.755" stopTime="249.004">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I went to the record pretty carefully yesterday and I didn't see that there was anything to support the statement that you're client as he was burning the flag --
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="249.004" stopTime="249.084">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Oh, that's quite so.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="249.084" stopTime="252.314">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It put it off, so he came told the small crowd that he collected --
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="252.314" stopTime="522.423">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Oh that's quite so. 
    The statement was made after the act of burning was done, quite so, quite so. 
    Let me ask the Court if they will turn with me to page 5 of my brief so that we may examine the statute together and that I might point out what appellant's contentions are concerning the infirmities of the statute. 
    I turned to the subdivision d, which it says, “Shall publicly mutilate the face, the file or defy, trample or cast contempt upon either by words or act.” 
    At the outset, it becomes obvious that the insertion in the statute by words, as well as by acts, shows us that the statute on its phase restricts freedom of speech. 
    Secondly, I would like to point out that the word “Cast Contempt Upon”, the words cast contempt upon, the word defile, the word defy, have speech meanings as well as act meanings. 
    As a matter of fact, I find difficulty in seeing where the statute does not, on it's face, have an absolute restriction on the form of verbal speech that somebody may use towards the American flag and this is born out I might say in the District Attorney's brief where he so interprets the statute even in the Court of Appeals' decision. 
    I asked the Court to turn with me for a moment to Judge Fuld's decision on page 8a of the record. 
    About 12 lines from the bottom of the page, we see the observation by Chief Judge Fuld, subdivision 16 of section 1425 is designed to prevent the outbreak of such violence by discouraging contemptuous and insulting treatment of the flag and I infer from the words “treatment” that treatment certainly had contemptuous treatment of the flag maybe by word as well as by act. 
    We find that the opinions of the Mr. Harry Brodbar General the State of New York, as cited in the District Mr. Harry Brodbar's brief, seem to indicate that the statute is prohibiting words as well as acts. 
    In fact, it seems to go farther even then the Court of Appeals' decision. 
    The Mr. Harry Brodbar General seems to feel that all disrespect of any kind shown to the flag is illegal under the statute. 
    Now, the point that I'm trying to bring to this Court's attention is that this is not a fanciful observation. 
    The convictions that we had in New York over the past two years have been really real besides streets conviction. 
    We had a conviction in the Riddick's case that is waiting appeal to the New York Court of Appeals where an owner of an art store, a displayed in his arts store in the window, some 40 odd constructions of an artist's protest against the American flag and as Judge Bissell, observed in his descent, the artist is conveying by his pictures what you or I might be able to convey by words but this is the way he can convey it best. 
    You'll notice in our reply brief, in our reply brief, we have a picture of a poster and I've noticed that Mr. Justice Stewart is taking a look at and I think maybe all of us could look at it together. 
    At two weeks ago, a police officer was--had issued a summons for violation of the statute for showing an American flag in a bookstore window and replacing on the field where the stars are the doves of peace, and the signs of peace. 
    Now the question has to be asked, alright what does have to do with this case. 
    No question that streaked at something that isn't all speech, its act as well as speech and alright, suppose the statute goes too far but we should still be able to convict Street because unquestionably, New York has the power to outlaw this kind of conduct. 
    It is our position Your Honors that even if this Court took that position which we would not agree at with but assumed for a moment that we agree that the State of New York could outlaw this type of conduct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="522.423" stopTime="535.461">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You know really, do you really argue that State of New York could not constitutionally outlaw the defacing of the flag by physical acts?
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="535.461" stopTime="538.183">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    I do not Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    I do not take that position.

    So, it's a speech element here that or the speech or so called “symbolic speech” about issue you here.
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="547.882" stopTime="570.420">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    It bothers me very much and it also bothers me that a statute on its face that is so restrictive goes far beyond the limited powers that Mr. Justice Fortas is referring to, and that even if we assume that it could do what Mr. Justice Fortas says, I quite agree with you and all likely we're going to probably could. 
    It can't go as far as the statute and Mr. Street is in a position to attack the statute.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, Mr. Goldstick, I didn't quite understand, what position do you not take?
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="575.208" stopTime="592.514">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    I do have the position that the State of New York had not regulate conduct towards the flag. 
    I'm saying that the State of New York may, under certain circumstances with a properly drawn statute narrowly construed for the purpose intended, prevent certain acts of flag desecration.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="592.514" stopTime="595.786">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I didn't understand your brief to take that position.
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="595.786" stopTime="626.487">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    You know, last night I really struggled with this problem myself because I've been struggling with it for two years, and I must confess to Your Honor that I have been back and forth on the power of the state to regulate conduct towards the flag, and I have to take the position that in this case it makes no difference, whether or not we were to decide that the State of New York does have such power. 
    I'm willing to concede for the purpose of this argument that it does have that power.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="626.487" stopTime="629.408">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just for this branch of your argument or your whole case?
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="629.408" stopTime="640.011">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    I'm willing to concede for the entire case that there is a limited amount of power that the State of New York has to regulate conduct, conduct towards the flag.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="640.011" stopTime="646.203">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I take it though you would say that power ends as just the moment that the conduct is communicative.
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="646.203" stopTime="648.906">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Absolutely.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="648.906" stopTime="654.770">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Even though and it ends as soon as there is a claim that is communicative?
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="654.770" stopTime="730.322">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Well, I would say first, we may not even have to reach that point because the statute on its face, obviously, restricts communicative acts. 
    So that -- even if we have for example a statute like the Federal Government recently enacted which omits completely any reference to speech except, I might point out for the word “defile” which has an interpretation having speech connotation. 
    Assume even that word was out, and we had a federal statute in question, which then have to reach the question there as to whether was constitutionally applied, but we can avoid that problem. 
    Though, I'm prepare to speak on it because I think even if we have the federal statute of New York, that particular facts in this case would not allow a conviction. 
    But assuming for a moment, that was the statute we had, I'm sorry. 
    Assuming that we did not have the statute but we have the statute that we have, we don't reach the question because that's far beyond the federal statute. 
    I might point out that the honorable Ramsey Clark and I realized it is not binding in this Court at any matter whatsoever, but he still made a very have observation to Congress when they were adapting their statute that the words as used in the New York statute deter and in the proposed statute before the Congress will very much like the New York statute. 
    And freedom of speech --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="730.322" stopTime="771.919">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Let me see if I follow you because your concession doesn't dispose in a matter for this Court, but I want to get your position clear. 
    Suppose you had here a statute that said that, that should be statute of New York that said it should be unlawful for any person in public deliberately to set fire to and burn an American flag. 
    That's all the statute said, I understand that's what Mr. Street did, and he was indicted for that, no speech element whatever. 
    You do not take the position that that would be a violation of the United States Constitution.
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="771.919" stopTime="775.794">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    I do not.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I'd like an addition to that. 
    He uses some language, do you claim with that purged him?

    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    I'm sorry Mr. Chief Justice --

    But if an addition to burning the flag, he uses some language such as he does here? 
    Do you think that purges him of burning the flag?

    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    That is the nub of the problem isn't it, because that is exactly what we are saying. 
    We are saying also that even under the circumstances, these circumstances Mr. Justice Fortas pointed out, that the act could then be coupled with other acts that in and up itself now brings it out of the simple due process problems of a criminal statute and close it with First Amendment problems. 
    And I might point out --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Don't you think there'd be any First Amendment problem and the case put to you by Mr. Justice Fortas?

    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Not necessarily.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="851.800" stopTime="855.900">

    But it is. 
    It doesn't say word --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="855.900" stopTime="857.567">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's right.
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="857.567" stopTime="861.812">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Could it be. 
    The answer to that would be if --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="861.812" stopTime="868.052">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean that we have instead of word here that same word with -- it is like you --
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="868.052" stopTime="926.656">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    If Street had not said a word -- not necessarily. 
    I'm trying to get to the -- to the not necessary part. 
    If the burning of the act, at the burning of the flag took on a secondary meaning, for example if this was a protest where people realized that the burning was for a purpose of protest. 
    There was a communication, before Kleenex was on the market for example for number of years, the word Kleenex has no secondary meaning but it got a meaning because people got using it. 
    The same thing with draft card burning, today when a fellow burns a draft card in public, we very well know what he was doing, it was usually that he was communicating a protest against the Vietnam War. 
    Flag burning hasn't got that secondary meaning but I submit it may very well get to that point. 
    But that isn't our problem at this time, I'm willing to concede right now that simply that -- simple act of burning the flag in New York, but not under the statute, would be --could be illegal because the statute goes far beyond that problem.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes, I might question which you've answered, I assumed that I postulated that the statute did not contain, did not contain any reference to verbal statements but the New York statute does since you pointed out?

    May I ask you a connection with the precise argument you are now making. 
    What do you say about this statement Giboney v. Empire Storage Company, but It has never been deem that abridgement of freedom of speech or prayers, to make a course of conduct illegal merely because its a conduct was in part initiated evidence, or carried out by means of language, either written, spoken or printed.

    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Mr. Justice Black, I hope by the time I finish today, and after this Court has seriously considered the merits of this case that that statement would not be the law of this land.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1004.247" stopTime="1006.451">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    In other words, we'd have to overrule this.
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="1006.451" stopTime="1017.267">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    I'm not saying that because you don't even have to reach that question because we have a statute on its face that it breaches freedom of speech that you don't even have to reach that problem. 
    What I am saying however --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1017.267" stopTime="1027.874">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why don't you have to reach it, if you say that the conduct itself did not violate the Constitution, but it does violate it because of the language use at the time?
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="1027.874" stopTime="1111.643">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    The reason Mr. Justice Black, I say we don't have to reach it is because, Street was convicted under a statute that is unconstitutional on it's face as being a obvious restriction on verbal speech, it says you can't use words and that he has a right I believe, to attack that statute and thereby attack his conviction even though New York may well have the right to outlaw exactly what he did. 
    And I think Thornhill against Alabama is exactly that type of a situation. 
    But to get back to your question Your Honor, I would like to feel that the issue here on an act as well as words is whether a communication was made and whether the communication was understood, because isn't that truly the problem of a freedom of speech case. 
    The communication of an idea to the public and the receipt of that communication by the public, and this is the nub of the issue that Mr. Justice Black has referred to, and this is the nub of the other issue of this case which I freely admit does not have to be reached. 
    But if reached; should be decided on drawing criteria for us to know when act and speech is speech and when act and speech is not speech, and therefore not entitle the First Amendment protection.

    Not so because the Court of Appeals are considered the vagueness question which was not raised at the Criminal Court level. 
    The vagueness question though dispose of in a footnote was still considered. 
    We have pointed out that the statute was vague because he never said what flag they were talking about. 
    That was disposed of in a footnote and that was the total consideration given to the vagueness argument by Judge Fuld.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, except there's something else that the fact is bothered me Mr. Goldstick and that reason I ask you about your answer to Justice Fortas question. 
    Judge Fuld in Footnote 1, appearing on 4a of the appendix of this case, it seems to say before the highest Court in New York that this statute simply prohibits public mutilation of the flag and that's why the way he construes the statute. 
    And of course, we have to take that construction as though the statute were written that way under we've excepted conventional doctrines in this Court.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I must say in the face of it Mr. Goldstick that reached to me something like an argument base on symbolic speech. 
    There is conduct but the conduct as protection of the First Amendment as symbolic speech.
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="1508.339" stopTime="1610.760">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    I might add Your Honor that we also had it in a trial memorandum when we made the motion and the trial memorandum had a full point on overbreadth. 
    I don't have that is in part of the record but it was certainly and I turn – I direct you to page 2 when I was very abruptly requested by the judge, “Sorry Mr. Goldstick no more emotions, lets sit down.” 
    The issue was briefed and argued all the way up and I'm just saying that it wasn't fully treated by Judge Fuld, and just one other point that I would like to make, if I may, and that deals with the problem of this statute as applied. 
    You'll notice in the record that Sidney Street was convicted -- was charge with both disorderly conduct and with breach of the peace. 
    He was acquitted of disorderly conduct there is nothing in the record not a scintilla of proof that there was a breach of the peace occurred where that a breach of the peace was likely to occur. 
    Now, Judge Fuld bases his decision on the right of New York under its police power to restrict acts that would cause a breach of the peace or likely to cause a breach of the peace. 
    But its our contention Your Honors that there was no breach of the peace, no evidence of a likely breach of the peace, and the only way therefore Street could have been convicted under this theory that this is a statute of prevent the breach of the peace would have to be that there is something inherently dangerous in this type of conduct. 
    And so that therefore the State of New York has a right to prevent conduct that is inherently dangerous.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1610.760" stopTime="1653.839">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I thought Chief Judge Fuld's opinion had to be read some what differently that is to say that, assuming that this is within the embed of the First Amendment the statute and prosecution here are within the embed of the First Amendment the conviction was never the less justified on the trial acclaimed present danger principle. 
    That is to say that there was in the circumstances of the case a clear and present danger of public disorder and therefore according to Chief Judge Fuld, a -- it was not – the conduct was not protected by the First Amendment.

    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Mr. Justice Fortas, this Court I recommend to your reading the record and of course under your power you have the right to review the record with regards to the finding of the Court of Appeals and I simply submit that Judge Fuld's observations are not supported by those--
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1669.736" stopTime="1722.109">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I'm not unless I don't argue of that as my reading in your judgment is my reading of what Judge Fuld was saying incorrect. 
    You've now advance to different theory which is Judge Fuld displaces on this read this as of disorderly conduct statute or breach of peace statute, and that reading at that way you arrive at this conclusion. 
    My only question reading his opinion was that he was recognizing that there was a First Amendment problem engaged in this analysis for the purpose of demonstrating dissatisfaction in a way that the First Amendment did not protect this particular conduct.
speaker="david_t_goldstick" startTime="1722.109" stopTime="1774.508">
    Mr. David T. Goldstick 
    Well, his analysis if I understand it, would be on base upon the power of the state to make some regulations even though they may fly in the face of First Amendment problems and the issue then becomes where is the line drawn between what the state can do with regards to First Amendment problems. 
    And I respectfully submit that if you do an analogy of a statute as a breach – if it comes under the breach of a power of the state to prevent public disorder, then the analogy must file -- follow what is that power when we come across a breach – when come across a freedom of a speech problem and the power has historically been. 
    And as far as my reading of the cases in this Court has always been has there been a breach of a peace or will a breach of the peace likely occur and you will examine the record to see if it's there.

   Argument of Harry Brodbar
speaker="harry_brodbar" startTime="1897.272" stopTime="1897.430">
    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    Mr. Chief Justice --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1897.430" stopTime="1899.450">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Brodbar.
speaker="harry_brodbar" startTime="1899.450" stopTime="2077.842">
    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    It is the states' contention that the appellant was convicted only for the act of burning, that any reference to language is mere suffrage. 
    The officers set forth some language and his information his complaint but that language is language that's usually set forth by a police officer to indicate intent on the part of the participant in the crime. 
    It is our feeling also the language used, “if they did this to Meredith, we don't need an American flag.” 
    That language is not contentious. 
    Certainly, the officer wouldn't have arrested him for merely making that statement. 
    The record is clear that the officer came to the scene because he saw a flag burned. 
    He then went over to some of the people a crowd and asked them, “who burned the flag?” 
    He then went to the appellant and asked the appellant whether he burned the flag? 
    And the appellant told him, ”if they did this to Meredith, we don't need an American flag.” 
    The officer then went back to the scene, the opposite corner, attempted to stamp of the fire, pick up the flag, took it to police headquarters and marked it as part of an invoice. 
    By inadvertence, the flag was never marked an evidence, although, I have it here with me. 
    It is obvious then that the arrest was only for the burning of the American flag. 
    There was another statement made by the appellant which the office had overheard, “we don't need no damn flag.” 
    It is also significant that the officer did not make that part of his complaint that he ignored that statement against threatening the states position at the arrest for – was for the act. 
    By -- in passing, I might say that even the word -- that the words “damn flag” might would be consider contemptuous under the case of Chaplinsky against New Hampshire, where the statement damn fuscous and then racketeer were held to be words which might insight to retaliation and the Court they unanimously affirmed the conviction. 
    The appellant cannot find any solace in any argument that the appellant was convicted of under a general of verdict that was perhaps for the words, for the act or for both. 
    It is obvious that he was arrested, tried, and convicted only for the act of burning the American flag, should Judge Fuld precipices the appeal of a unanimous court with the following, “We are called upon to determine whether the deliberate act of burning an American flag in public as a protest maybe punish as a crime."

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Am still on word public --
speaker="harry_brodbar" startTime="2207.673" stopTime="2391.921">
    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    There is nothing on the statute with regards to the word public. 
    We must accept the dictionary meaning of the word public that in connotes say reasonable, sizable amount of persons who are present of a scene, and who might bring disturbance because of an act committed by a person. 
    I think ever two persons present at a scene might justify the conviction of Mr. Street. 
    If this Court should have wise judgment determine that the language defy by words is unconstitutional what I mean to say is this, in Chaplinsky against New Hampshire the Court did not go into a second portion of the statute. 
    The first portion dealt with words and names, the second portion dealt with sounds and noises. 
    The Court there did not go onto the second portion and convicted Chaplinsky for the use of names, epithets heard upon a -- persons in the area. 
    It is our view that this Court although the appellant was sentenced for the act of desecration, it is our view and our hope that the Court also determines the validity of the expression words in the statute for if it does not then any postscription of physical acts will be dissipated because the path will be left open for desecration by words. 
    It is significant also that Chief Judge Fuld discusses in his opinion many case dealing with symbolic expression and it does not go into any cases were pure language was used. 
    It is also the states contention that the Court did not render any consistent verdict by dismissing the more general charge of disorderly conduct and holding him under the statute which specifically prohibited the act. 
    Mr. Street could not be sentenced under two charges, section 1938 of the Code of Penal Law of the State of New York, prohibits that. 
    The entire terror of the 12 revolves about the flag burning itself, at the time of the cross examination of the appellant at the time of the cross examination of the police officer there was nothing discussed about pure language, only the act was discusses. 
    It is also significant that this case, the trial of this case took place six weeks after Miranda against Arizona and experienced counsel did not set up the Miranda rules as a bar language was have been elicited from the officer from the appellant at the time of his arrest.

    Suppose this statute had said it should be a crime to burn the American flag in public or to mention the American flag in public from giving a ridiculous case to illustrate, to explore a point. 
    Suppose that the information read and the officer testified that we found the defendant burning the flag and the defendant said, “This is an American flag.” 
    And suppose he -- that the defendant where then convicted. 
    Now, remember, I am talking here about the statute which prohibited mentioning the American flag in public.

    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    No, it would not be constitutional. 
    It would be over broad because there is a federal statute which permits the dignified burning of the flag --

    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    And there was no way of knowing under the words of your statue Mr. Justice Fortas whether the man was doing it in dignified fashion or with contempt. 
    Therefore, the statute over broad would result in obituary standards and prior restraining.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, you think that it has to be some contemptuous words upon the burning of the flag?

    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    No words at all unnecessary.

    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    Under your statute, Your Honor.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, the point of to which I'm directing your attention. 
    Let's forget about the contempt part even if you will assume that one way or the other whichever way you think necessary. 
    But suppose I have the statute said that, “it shall be a crime, to burn an American flag or to mention it in public.” 
    And here's appellant whose arrested for a burning an American flag and saying, "This is an American flag.” 
    Now, with such a statute or on its face or as applied in a particular case in your judgment, they run a file of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
speaker="harry_brodbar" startTime="2605.922" stopTime="2616.232">
    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    Mr. Justice Fortas, I would say that if they were no Federal statute permitting respectful burning of the flag then that statute would be alright.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2616.232" stopTime="2624.520">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In the state of New York then may prohibit mentioning or discussing the American flag in public.
speaker="harry_brodbar" startTime="2624.520" stopTime="2696.943">
    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    Yes, it may if there is federal statute which permits respectful burning. 
    But if there is a statute that permits it, then the state cannot with that legal language create a statute so over broad that anyone burning a flag, who might be doing get with respect could be arrested and convicted for it. 
    The state is mine form of the fact and I'd made not enact any law which will unconstitutionally have abridge the freedom of speech and expression. 
    Yet, not with standing the sacrosanct nature of First Amendment principles, a state may in the interest of peace and tranquility within its borders has any statute even though, it may have abridge freedom of speech. 
    It will be for this honorable Court to determine whether the United States flag, the object of national parte, and patriotic adoration can be a subject of desecration merely because one wants to use it in a symbolic way to dramatize dissatisfaction with the conditions existing in our country. 
    The need for such a statute was recognized by the First Amendment.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, for my point of view, I hope I should not just my point of view and I hope I'm not indulging myself only. 
    And I can agree with that statement of this case. 
    This is not a case of a simple burning of an American Flag. 
    This is a case where the information included words and that included the words which maybe an objectionable discussion of the American Flag or objectionable reference. 
    But it's not simply a case of burning of the American Flag, do you agree with that or not?

    Mr. Justice Fortas, it is the states' contention of the statute is divisible that can't be separated, that the Appellant was convicted only for the act of desecration.

    We reiterated that the words was set forth only to indicate the intent, and if the words were mere surpassage that they were not necessary.

    It became more clearer because how he said nothing is very demeanor, burning a flag, running to another corner, waving his arms in an agitated condition. 
    Those words --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Maybe that's right but the statute certainly doesn't seem to be phrased in those terms the statute does not confine itself to the act of burning or desecrating the United States together with such words or rather conduct that's would indicate that this act is being done a contemptuous lay of the flag. 
    Would you agree with that? 
    The statute would talks about makes it a crime the use the words. 
    Not merely fall as evidence of intent of the intent with which the action was done.

    I can agree with that Mr. Justice Fortas.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You do not.
speaker="harry_brodbar" startTime="2888.194" stopTime="3023.182">
    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    It is our opinion that the acts -- that the postscription of the statute is directed at physical acts of mutilation, defacing, defiling, trampling upon, and that also the statute post scribes the use of language which also defies or past contempt upon the flag. 
    That the words past contempt is the -- are the keywords which direct the all of the other language that the language indicates dishonor something purposeful. 
    A lively sense of shaming that's either one or the other or both in this particular case, there was only one thing that the Appellant had done burn the flag, his statement was not contemptuous. 
    It was a statement if we -- if this could happen to Meredith we don't need the American flag. 
    There was nothing contemptuous about that statement and that statement in the complaint, although, not contemptuous is set forth by the police officer or the indicated it intent. 
    It was not necessary to have it in the complaint itself because the appellant's act was one of contempt, not only did he set fire to the flag according to my adversary he came down to the street and put a paper down on the ground. 
    What was the purpose of the paper, the officer testified that there weren't no, was no paper. 
    What could with the paper do if the appellant is burning a flag and drops a burning flag on the paper? 
    It is more likely that the paper was there to induce great of burning, that was the purpose of the paper and that the flag was folded. 
    The flag had been folded in his drawer, in his chest of drawers. 
    He was a veteran. 
    The testimony indicates that he put the flag on in every holiday. 
    The flag was not folded because he showed respect. 
    He came down into the street, laid the flag down, burn it, run to another corner, is that the conduct of a person who shows respect? 
    When the American Legion has its ceremony once a year to burn American Flags, they don't run to other corners while they're burning the flags on one corner. 
    They stay with the flag that is considered respect. 
    These words were not even necessary of the complaint. 
    They are mere surpassage.

    This is about the first case from the history of our country where this statute was even used when Patrolman Copeland made his arrest, he did not know that he made the first arrest in the history to State of New York for public burning of the flag.

speaker="harry_brodbar" startTime="3478.280" stopTime="3497.044">
    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    The State interest is to protect the national symbol because the state is part of a nation. 
    If a nation does not exist the state will not exist. 
    In Halter against Nebraska the first Mr. Justice Harlan said to the state has the same interest, an interest to course respect not to mandate respect as a bond that but to prevent desecration.

    That's the case of course was decided long before it had been held at the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the First Amendment.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Brodbar, let us suppose that you had a case involved only words, words expressing the at most contempt in hatred for the American flag. 
    Now, with those words standing alone fall within the condemnation of this statute.

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, that's the nub of the trouble here. 
    I agree with you that electro reading of this statute would catch words standing alone because subsection d of the statute makes up the crime public relate to defile or defy or -- let me take this. 
    Let me withdraw that. 
    Public relate to cast contempt upon the American flag by words.

    Well, in the event that this Court should it in its wisdom feel that the words are unconstitutional, that we'd be blessed with some statute.

    Well, it appears that way, because Chief Judge Fuld makes the statement, “Subdivision 16 of Section 1425 is designed to prevent the outbreak of such violence by discouraging --

    “It's designed to prevent the outbreak of such violence by discouraging contemptuous and insulting treatment of the flag in public.” 
    It is our opinion and this was me a dictum -- victim in a case, but it shows the inherent feeling of Chief Judge Fuld speaking for the entire Court that even if this case had just words in it that the decision might be the same.

    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice Warren. 
    Treatment of the flag, when one insults another he treats it wrongly, does he not? 
    The word treatment is a general word.

    Mr. Harry Brodbar 
    Well, my point is this that the Court was concerned primarily with the conduct. 
    The Court was not considering the word itself, the language used by Judge Fuld later on is dictum that is the opinion I have. 
    And it's also in my belief that if the defendant had been charged with words only and no act at all that the decision would have been the same. 
    But the Court was concerned only with the act, it prefixes its opinion with the statement.

    There is no message at all. 
    He recognizes nothing good in America when he said that, he has consign America to the flames of obscurity, that is not the message. 
    If he said that our country is not giving me the proper rights. 
    That is a message that deserves respect under the First Amendment because at least the governmental self improvement, but to desecrate a flag by words, leaves no message.
