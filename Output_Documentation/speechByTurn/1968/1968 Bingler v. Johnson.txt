Bingler v. Johnson
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="21.526">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    473, John H.Bingler, Director of Internal Revenue, petitioner versus Richard E.Johnson et al. 
    Mr. Larrimer, you may continue with your argument.
speaker="james_c_larrimer" startTime="21.526" stopTime="127.404">
    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The issue in this case is essentially whether or not an employer can make a scholarship grant to an employee with that scholarship grant being excludable from gross income under the Internal Revenue Code. 
    The Government's position is that it cannot because Congress expressly stated that any continuing salary arrangement was not to have attached to it tax exempt consequences. 
    This statement on behalf of the Government is repeated throughout its brief as though the constant repetition would add some validity to it. 
    The legislative history however does not support the statement that a scholarship which may in fact be labeled a continuing salary arrangement. 
    The legislative history does not support that statement. 
    The 1954 Code in which Section 117 was inserted with respect to scholarships and fellowships was new with the 1954 Code. 
    There was no specific provision of the Internal Revenue Code previous to that time. 
    There was acknowledged by --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Can I ask you a question. 
    The Fifth Circuit went the other way in this case, is it not?

    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    Yes sir.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="132.908" stopTime="135.348">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Are there are any circuits about that problem?
speaker="james_c_larrimer" startTime="135.348" stopTime="260.944">
    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    There's another circuit, I think it's the Fourth Circuit if I'm not mistaken. 
    There are at least two circuits which are in conflict with the decision of the Third Circuit in this case. 
    The Congress at the time of enacting the Section 117 recognized the state of confusion which existed as to the tax consequences of the scholarship and fellowship grant. 
    It said about to attempt to provide what it labeled a clear cut method of determining the tax consequences of these grants without the necessity of deciding each case, case-by-case. 
    It did so under the format of Section 117 in which it set forth specifically that a scholarship at an educational institution shall not be included in gross income. 
    It also provided that a fellowship shall not be included in gross income. 
    And then, considering the compensatory possibilities of these grants, it inserted limitations in the code in Section 117. 
    First, it provided with respect to scholarships and it's recognized by Congress at this point that scholarships must be at an educational institution as it is defined in the Internal Revenue Code. 
    Now, the Internal Revenue Code specifically defines an educational institution as an education -- as an institution which has a regular faculty and a regular student body and a regular curriculum. 
    So, Congress intended that a scholarship relate only to a student at an educational institution.

    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, the evidence in the case established that this amount of money, this living allowance or stipend as we call it was classified under accounting records as indirect labor.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    As indirect labor.

    Mr. James C. Larrimer

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How does that breakdown in dollars?
speaker="james_c_larrimer" startTime="566.037" stopTime="571.793">
    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    Well, the tuition is very nominal compared to the living allowance paid.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="571.793" stopTime="575.815">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But most of it, they counted as a business expense?

    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="576.417" stopTime="581.834">

    And they counted that his service during the interim as indirect labor so they could that.

    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    That's right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="583.059" stopTime="597.220">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If they haven't called it indirect labor, could they have done that? 
    Could they have taken a deduction for that? 
    Would it have been (Voice Overlap).
speaker="james_c_larrimer" startTime="597.220" stopTime="610.295">
    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    My opinion is that a company can have a scholarship program or a fellowship program and deduct the cost of it as an ordinary and necessary business expense.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="610.295" stopTime="613.715">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Even if they call indirect labor then?
speaker="james_c_larrimer" startTime="613.715" stopTime="624.984">
    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    There is no clear answer to that except to the extent that they had no account which they labeled fellowships and scholarships.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="624.984" stopTime="631.402">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why shouldn't they if that was an exempt expenditure?

    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    I don't know why they did not have, except perhaps it may have been because of the contractual relationship between Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Atomic Energy Commission because these men were employed at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory which was a government-owned but contractor-operated plant. 
    This means that the Government owned it paid for all the expense of operation but it was operated by Westinghouse. 
    And perhaps it was an accounting method which required this to be labeled as indirect labor because --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="670.396" stopTime="673.557">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Westinghouse was on the cost-plus basis?
speaker="james_c_larrimer" startTime="673.557" stopTime="674.654">

    Essentially, yes.

    This would be charged to the Atomic Energy Commission.

    Mr. James C. Larrimer

    -- that there maybe a compensatory aspect to the grants, in other words, previous to 1954, the tax consequence of a scholarship or fellowship grant was determined by where not it was gift or compensation.

    Well, they couldn't very well do it. 
    There was only one case which held that a fellowship was a gift, but it's difficult in my way of thinking, you cannot eliminate that compensatory aspect of a scholarship or fellowship because the very nature of the grant requires you to render services, to render to go school, and the fact that those services are not a benefit to the grantor does not eliminate that compensatory aspect of it.

    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    For that salary commenced with the other employees, yes. 
    But our position is that Congress specifically provided in the Code the compensatory aspect of a scholarship, once it is determined that a grant is made for the education of an individual, if it's a scholarship at an education institution, there's only one circumstance in which a part of it is taxable, and that is specifically provided under Section 117 and a limitation, and that provision is that if he is required to render services in a nature of part-time employment, then the value of those services is taxable and it's only the balance of the scholarship which is tax free. 
    And there's a further exception on that as if those services which are required to be rendered are services which are required as part of the curriculum of the university for the grant of the degree, then even they do not result in taxable income.

    If you go to the university and you spend all of your time now on that same project than development of the widget and we'll give you what we call a scholarship or a fellowship 90% of your prior salary. 
    Now, is that payment for services that he's received payment for services to Westinghouse and A.E.C., is it taxable, or is it within the statutory provision for deduction?

    If that's what you're talking if you're using curriculum in that sense that the topic of the dissertation is approve, of course it has to be approved by the university authorities.

    It has to be approved and has to be required. 
    That type of an investigation has to be required for the grant of a degree. 
    If it's not required for the grant of a degree, then a service is rendered and it would not qualify as a scholarship at an educational institution.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well obviously, in some relationship between that and this situation in which I understand it, the dissertation has to be in some measure to some degree relating to the work of the laboratory. 
    In any event, and there's a dispute between you and the Government as to precisely what the record shows on that. 
    In any event, the dissertation subject has to be approved by Westinghouse or the A.E.C. or both of them. 
    And so that there are some major of service. 
    I should arguably in a way arguably either some measure of service being rendered by the scholarship recipient to Westinghouse and agency.

    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    The best response I can make to this Your Honor is what in fact occurred in this case, and one of the students selected a thesis topic which he had investigated during his leave of absence. 
    It was a -- of course in an engineering field which would have been a value to engineering generally, but after studying and investigating this for his entire leave period, he gave it up because he didn't have enough time, he didn't have enough equipment to really arrive in an answer which would satisfy the requirements that the university for the thesis. 
    The evidence was then put in the record that Westinghouse was not interested in this particular thesis topic to the extent that they would take it upon themselves to pick it up where this man left it off and get the answer to it, so that the nature of the thesis topic had to be in engineering which is about the limit of the value of a specific topic to Westinghouse itself.

    May I ask you this. 
    This is what's bothering me. 
    If it is -- this is justified as a business expense on the basis that it is part-time employment, why shouldn't there be some pro tanto recognition of the part that is employment and the part that is not employment when the tax returns are made?
speaker="james_c_larrimer" startTime="1389.010" stopTime="1411.937">
    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    The answer must be Mr. Chief Justice as Congress felt that if a student on a scholarship in an educational institution was pursuing the curriculum under or required by that university, then no part of it was should be treated as compensation and taxable.

    Well might it not be one thing that a company just out of a goodness of his heart gave this stipend to a man for this particular period and did not considered it as business expense in this operation from.

    I don't think there has to be a correlation.

    There are other --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1450.784" stopTime="1477.188">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Don't you think one of them should at least pay something by reason of it being part-time employment? 
    Do you think if it's part-time employment that the company should take all of it as tax deduction or if it -- if employees being paid partially for the work he does for the company that he shouldn't pay some income tax?
speaker="james_c_larrimer" startTime="1477.188" stopTime="1487.083">
    Mr. James C. Larrimer

    Yes.
speaker="james_c_larrimer" startTime="1495.350" stopTime="1537.070">
    Mr. James C. Larrimer 
    Yes, I think they did it out of an abundance of caution because of the fact that there are other sections of the code which say that if an employer does not withhold tax, and may I answer your question, there's another section of the code which provides a different employer does not withhold tax from something which is taxable, and the employee who receives it does not pay tax on it, then both the employee are responsible, both the employee and the employer are responsible for the same tax. 
    So out of an abundance of caution, the employer without fail usually withholds tax unless the employee litigate the tax consequences of it.

   Argument of Harris Weinstein
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1678.728" stopTime="1679.760">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Weinstein?
speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="1679.760" stopTime="1837.824">
    Mr. Harris Weinstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if I may quickly deal with several points particularly once of record and of other decisions. 
    In response to Mr. Justice Harlan's question, the cases and conflict are in the Fifth and Sixth Circuit and in the Court of Claims, and there are two cases, one in the tenth and a per curiam in the fourth that would be believed conflicting rationale and they're discussed in our brief beginning at page 23. 
    In terms of the relationship between Westinghouse and the employer during the leave, there's a requirement for periodic progress reports, and this is discussed I believe in the testimony at page 18 of the record at least, it maybe in other places. 
    In terms of Westinghouse's rights against the employer -- employee who defaults on its obligation to come back, we set out that Pennsylvania cases which we think at least give a right to sue for the actual expenditures made on behalf of the employee during the leave. 
    In terms of limitations on amount, respondents now say there's a rule of reason. 
    Congress didn't even think things would go that far because as we pointed out in our brief, Congress expected that this would be relatively small amounts. 
    If I -- although my time is up, if I may just speak to this question of the relationship of the thesis topic to Westinghouse's program. 
    At page 104 of the record which is Westinghouse's regulations on this subject, it encourages employees to find topics of technical interest to Bettis. 
    In the testimony at pages 61 and 62, a Westinghouse official testifies on this question of thesis review. 
    In the first line of page 62, he uses the word “relevance” in determining the relationship between thesis topic and Westinghouse work. 
    Pages 74 and 75, the responsible official of the Atomic Energy Commission speaks of job relatedness in terms of the connection with the thesis. 
    But in closing, I would just like to say that we do not depend just on the fact that the thesis topic is reviewed, but this thesis topic review and the entire program is part of an overall package of compensation the Westinghouse and the A.E.C. have designed to obtain people like the respondents for six or seven years, and the fifth year, they get this leave and this obligates them to return as in the case of one respondent for the sixth year, and the case of the other two for the sixth and seventh years and it is this obligation that to us is the keystone of this case.
