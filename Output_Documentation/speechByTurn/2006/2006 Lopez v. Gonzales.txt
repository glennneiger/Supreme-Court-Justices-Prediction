Lopez v. Gonzales
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="0.000" stopTime="8.986">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Lopez versus Gonzales and Toledo-Flores versus United States. 
    Mr. Long.
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="8.986" stopTime="77.033">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    A drug-trafficking crime is defined in 18 U.S. Code Section 924(c) as any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or two other Federal statutes. 
    "Punishable" is a key term. 
    If that word is omitted, the remaining phrase, 
    "any felony under the Controlled Substances Act. " 
    clearly refers to felony violations of the Controlled Substances Act. 
    The parties agree that "punishable" means "subject to criminal sanctions". 
    So, a 924(c), is conduct that is subject to being punished under the Controlled Substances Act. 
    State felonies are not, themselves, punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. 
    It is not a Federal crime to violate State law. 
    The defendant's conduct may be punishable under both Federal and State law, but a State felony is not a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="77.033" stopTime="92.402">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, do you agree that if there were a State conviction for an offense that would have been punishable under the Federal law, their both being felonies, that enhancement can apply, in that instance, and that that does meet the definition?
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="92.402" stopTime="157.744">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    Yes, Justice Kennedy. 
    Our position is, if the conduct would violate a felony provision of the Controlled Substances Act or one of the other two Federal statutes, it then is a drug-trafficking crime under 18 U.S. Code Section 924(c), and, therefore, it is an aggravated felony. 
    But there are three additional textual indications, in addition to simply the 924(c). 
    The first one is, there are other provisions of Section 924... (e), (g), and (k)... where Congress actually used very similar language. 
    It referred to conduct punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or the two other statutes, or offenses under the Controlled Substances Act or the two other Federal statutes. 
    But then, it added an express reference to State offenses, so--

    Where--

    --the implication is that when Congress meant to include State offenses, it said so.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Where are those sections?
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="164.570" stopTime="171.185">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    The... you can find them; they're in the appendix to Lopez's blue brief, Justice Scalia--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="171.185" stopTime="171.926">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay.
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="171.926" stopTime="191.268">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    --and the provisions on (e), (g), and (k)... 924 begins on page 3A of the appendix, and (e) begins on 5A, and you can pick up... (g) is on 6A, (k) is on 7A.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="191.268" stopTime="192.998">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What are the sections... (b)?
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="192.998" stopTime="196.791">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    They're subsections (e), (g), and (k).
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="196.791" stopTime="197.422">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    All right.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="197.422" stopTime="214.305">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, that doesn't carry too much weight, though, because the provision that... I'm looking at (g)(3), 
    "violates any State law relating to any controlled substance. " 
    can be broader than what's punishable under the Federal Controlled Substances--
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="214.305" stopTime="214.515">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    It--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="214.515" stopTime="214.936">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Act.
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="214.936" stopTime="327.022">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    --It is a bit broader, Mr. Chief Justice, but if you look at all of these provisions, the implication is clearly that Congress was referring to State law when it meant to include State law. 
    I mean, the... if you looked at (e), for example, there it's a parallel construction; it's not broader. 
    I think perhaps the government would say, 
    "Well, we're talking about offenses. " 
    That's a little different from a felony, but "offenses" is actually a broader term. 
    I'll mention an additional statute, which was not in the appendix... 18 U.S. Code Section 3559(c)(2)(H). 
    This provision... it's a similar provision; it defines a CSA. 
    An additional textual indication is, it's agreed... and this Court has already said, in Gonzales against the United States, that a drug-trafficking crime under 924(c), under the criminal statute, must be a Federal crime. 
    924(c)(1)(A) refers to a crime that may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, and that clearly refers to a Federal crime. 
    The definition of drug-trafficking crime, by its term, says it is for purposes of 924(c), so there is no reason why Congress would have wanted to include State felonies in a definition that applies to a Federal criminal provision that all concede applies only to Federal predicate offenses.

    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    --Yes.

    There are a few that are simple possession.

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    --are possessory... there are 924(c), but is it not the case that any... if you interpret "trafficking" to mean trafficking in the way the word would be used in ordinary speech... that any State trafficking offense you can think of would have a corresponding felony violation under the Controlled Substances Act, so that if you read the statute that way, the initial phrase is superfluous?
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="417.761" stopTime="450.772">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    I believe the Government has a footnote in their brief where they suggest there are some State trafficking offenses that actually do not have a parallel in Federal law. 
    Soliciting, I think, may be one of them. 
    So, I think there are, in fact, some. 
    And our position, of course, is that by adding illicit trafficking... any trafficking offense, State or Federal, whether or not it is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, is an aggravated felony.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="450.772" stopTime="478.282">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Let me ask the same question a different way. 
    If... since 924(c) includes some 924(c), doesn't that show that the way Congress used 
    "illicit trafficking in a controlled substance. " 
    is not in the sense in which the term is used in ordinary speech, but's much broader, so that it can include "mere possession" offenses?
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="478.282" stopTime="527.184">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    The... Justice Alito, there is an argument... it's developed in the brief of the American Bar Association... that, because illicit trafficking is the general category, that all the aggravated felonies in this category should have a trafficking component; and, therefore, the felonies punishable under the Controlled Substances Act that are "simple possession" offenses should not, in fact, be included. 
    That is not an argument that we have pressed in our brief. 
    We read the phrase to say 
    "illicit trafficking, including any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. " 
    So, I would agree with you, to the extent that if it is a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has said, by definition, that it is included in the category of illicit trafficking.

    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    --when we get to that language, Mr. Chief Justice... and I do think it helps the analysis to first decide, What is the definition of a 924(c), the criminal statute? 
    Once you've decided that... now, when you move back to the INA, there is this language. 
    The term 101(a)(43), whether in violation of Federal or State law, or the law of a foreign country. 
    Now, we think that's pretty straightforward. 
    It has to be an offense described. 
    So, the simple example is money laundering. 
    It... the offense described in 18 U.S. Code Section 1956, "money laundering", is an aggravated felony. 
    So, a violation of State law or of foreign law can be an aggravated felony, but only if it is the offense described in 1956. 
    If States or a foreign government has a broader definition of "money laundering", that can't count, because it's not the offense described. 
    And when you turn to a drug-trafficking crime, the way that offense is described in 101(A)(43) is... Congress picked up, in its entirety and without any modification, the definition of 924(c), a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. 
    So, if you agree that, in the criminal statute, that means a felony violation of the Controlled Substances Act, the offense described is the felonies in the Controlled Substances Act, not the felonies in the misdemeanors. 
    And State... if State law wants to call a... something that's a misdemeanor under Federal law a felony, they can do that, but they can't expand the offense described. 
    The offense described, the way Congress did that, is--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="901.322" stopTime="907.656">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But are you saying it would also include State trafficking offense, because it's described in the word "trafficking"?
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="907.656" stopTime="928.420">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    --Yes. 
    I'm focusing on the definition of "drug-trafficking crime". 
    It... also, there's the illicit trafficking piece of this. 
    And, I should add, any State offense that is illicit trafficking is going to be an aggravated felony. 
    We recognize that. 
    If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Timothy Crooks
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="928.420" stopTime="932.874">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Long.

    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I would first like to address the Government's contention that Mr. Toledo-Flores's appeal is moot. 
    His appeal of his sentence is not moot, primarily because he is still subject to the sentence that is the subject of that appeal. 
    Even though Mr. Toledo-Flores was released from prison on April 21st of this year, and deported to Mexico, he's still subject to the supervised-release portion of his sentence, because supervised release is not automatically extinguished by deportation.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="969.579" stopTime="974.153">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    But there's no supervised release of people outside the United States.
speaker="timothy_crooks" startTime="974.153" stopTime="987.161">
    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    There's no supervision of people outside the United States, Mr. Chief Justice, but he is still subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court, and still subject to the conditions of supervised release that are not dependent upon supervision.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="987.161" stopTime="989.252">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, like what?

    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    Well, for example, he shall not excessively use alcohol, he shall not associate with persons who--

    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    --If the District Court learns about it he could be violated... he could be extradited back from Mexico, and he could face up to a year more in prison.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1007.794" stopTime="1017.251">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Has anything like that ever happened before with people subject to supervised release who are then deported? 
    It would be the first time, if the District Court did that, right?
speaker="timothy_crooks" startTime="1017.251" stopTime="1055.435">
    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    There have been instances in the case law where people on supervised release have been extradited back from foreign countries based on violations of their supervised release. 
    But the point is, under the statutory scheme, Mr. Toledo-Flores is still subject to the District Court's jurisdiction. 
    The District Court retains jurisdiction to modify his supervised release, to change the conditions, or to cut the supervised release. 
    If the District Court learns of a violation and a violation warrant is filed within the supervised-release period then the supervised-release period is effectively tolled and the District Court--

speaker="timothy_crooks" startTime="1067.794" stopTime="1110.371">
    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    Yes, we do, Your Honor. 
    After April 20th, of course, in accordance with this Court's decisions in Spencer v. Kemna and Lane v. Williams, the Court needs to look for a collateral consequence of the then-expired sentence. 
    And, in this case, we point to the possibility that a retrospective reduction in the term of imprisonment... which, of course, will not give excess prison time back to Mr. Toledo-Flores... but even to reduce the number of the sentence, on paper, could be a favorable factor for him to get a waiver of inadmissibility, should he ever want to get a nonimmigrant visa in the future to come visit his U.S. citizen children.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1110.371" stopTime="1153.160">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We have a case involving standing which says that... you know, the doctrine of standing is more than a... an exercise in the... in the conceivable. 
    And this seems to me an exercise in the conceivable. 
    Nobody thinks your client is really, you know, abstaining from tequila down in Mexico because he's on supervised release in the United States, or is going... is going to apply... having been deported from the country for criminal offenses, is going to apply to come back in the... these are ingenious exercises in the conceivable. 
    This is just not the real world.
speaker="timothy_crooks" startTime="1153.160" stopTime="1182.612">
    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    Well, my answer to that, Justice Scalia, is that this Court has never said that an appeal of a sentence may become moot before that sentence is expired. 
    And in cases like Lane v. Williams and Spencer v. Kemna, the sentences were completely expired, and, therefore, the Court had to look for collateral consequences of the now-expired sentence. 
    Here, in consequence... in contrast, Mr. Toledo-Flores is still under the sentence, which is a direct consequence--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1182.612" stopTime="1205.176">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That depends on whether you consider the sentence to be effectively expired once he leaves the country, if the sentence is one of supervised release, which is impossible once he leaves the country. 
    Supervision being impossible, supervised release is not a realistic consequence of the prior conviction.
speaker="timothy_crooks" startTime="1205.176" stopTime="1218.706">
    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    --But that argument could be made with respect to a person who is in the United States, who is subject to a term of probation where the only condition is that he not further violate the law. 
    In that--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1218.706" stopTime="1219.337">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --in that... in that instance, action can be taken against him if he does further violate the law under the terms of probation. 
    The point is that the jurisdiction of the probation office or the District Court doesn't extend to Mexico.

    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    --Well, that's true. 
    But if we're talking about future violations of the law, it is very often the case that persons who are deported to Mexico do come back, and do have their supervised release--

    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    No, not at all, Your Honor, but I'm saying that, in the respect that you just talked about for the U.S. citizen, it's not any different, that the court retains jurisdiction to violate the supervised release, and to revoke it, and then to send him back to prison.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1264.047" stopTime="1269.881">

    No, but it is different, in the respect that he would first have to violate the law by entering the United States.

    Mr. Timothy Crooks 
    That is true. 
    But in most cases, that is the only violation of supervised release for which they are later revoked.

    On the merits, I would just like to point out that the interpretation that is advanced by the petitioners here promotes the very sort of uniformity that this Court has found desirable in cases like Jerome v.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In order for a State drug offense to be an aggravated felony under Section 1101(a)(43)(B) of the INA, two... there are two requirements. 
    The underlying conduct must be punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or one of the other specified Federal statutes, and it must be a felony. 
    Because Petitioner's underlying conduct here was punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, and was a felony under State law, they are... they were properly found to have committed aggravated felonies. 
    That conclusion follows, not just from Section 924(c), but, more importantly, by the fact that what is relevant here is, What is the meaning of 1101(a)(43), which is the operative provision, which just happens to incorporate the definition of 924(c)?

    --Well, the ground of deportation that refers to "aggravated felony" refers to someone who has been convicted of an aggravated felony. 
    The ineligibility for cancellation of removal turns on whether someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony, and the enhanced penalties under Section 1326 for someone whose illegal reentry, following aggravated felony, is for a conviction for an aggravated felony. 
    So, my point is that, under the INA, the consequences turn on conviction, and it makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of conviction... here, State law... to see whether it... to look at the... to determine the status of the crime. 
    And since State law determines it to be a felony, that's the--

    That kind of disuniformity in an area where the Constitution expressly charges Congress with authority to make uniform laws, it's... doesn't that uniform-law specification in the Constitution tug in the direction of the interpretation that Mr. Long was--

speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1810.999" stopTime="1952.151">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --we think it does, for several reasons. 
    First, with respect to the constitutional requirement, the uniformity provision applies to uniform rules of naturalization; that is, citizenship. 
    This... we're not talking about citizenship here, we're talking... we're talking about the eligibility of aliens to remain in the country. 
    Beyond that, even where the Uniformity Clause applies... and there's, for example, a parallel Uniformity Clause for bankruptcy... that's never been interpreted to mean that consequences of certain conduct under State law can have no impact on bankruptcy law, and that there can't be a variation. 
    The State-law homestead exemption under the... under the bankruptcy laws is a good example of that. 
    But, going beyond that, with respect to the issue of uniformity generally, Congress has established uniform standards in Section 1101, either in terms of identifying the conduct in certain instances; in other instances, by identifying the minimum sentence that was actually imposed. 
    In this case, we think, with respect to drug-trafficking crimes, it... it's imposed a uniform standard, in terms of the length of the sentence; it has to be a felony. 
    That's... that is uniformity. 
    But the... to answer your point more directly, it is a principle throughout 1101(a)(43) that one looks to State law, not to... not to a... some supposed uniform standard of Federal law. 
    And, for example, if you... several subparagraphs... and if you'll... 1101(a)(43) is set out at page 12(a) of the appendix to our brief... three subparagraphs... (j), (q), and (t)... refer to the sentence that may be imposed for a violation. 
    Well, when you're talking about a State conviction, that's clearly referring to the sentence that may be imposed under State law for a conviction. 
    Four other subparagraphs... (f), (g), (r), and (s)... turn on the sentence that was actually imposed. 
    That means that... in the case of a State crime, as we have here, that State law has to authorize the sentence, and that the State Court, applying State sentencing principles, has actually imposed a crime of... for... of at least 1 year. 
    So, it is... it is infused in Section 1101(a)(43) that, in fact, you do look to the consequences of an offense under State law.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I'm prepared to accept perfect ambiguity here, linguistically. 
    And I thought of an empirical question, that you may know the answer to, that might shed some light. 
    Now, going along the way... maybe I'm making a mistake to point it out, if I am... but I go to the key thing here, which is the words in 924(c), What is a "drug-trafficking crime"? 
    A "drug-trafficking crime" is a crime... 
    "any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. " 
    That could mean an act, physically, that is a felony under some law, and is also punishable under the Controlled Substances Act as a misdemeanor. 
    Okay? 
    Felony under... it could pick that up. 
    And it also could mean any conduct which is punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act. 
    And I could look at those words a thousand times and not have a clue which it means. 
    So, I thought of an empirical test. 
    This statute, 924(c), happens to be a statute that, if you engage in a drug-trafficking crime, as defined, and you have a gun with you, you get mandatory 5 years. 
    That's the point of it. 
    And the Government does all the prosecuting. 
    So, in how many cases where a person committed a misdemeanor offense, simple possession, and had a gun, did the Government insist that they get the 5 years minimum? 
    Now, if you're prepared to tell me "a lot of 'em", I'm prepared to tell you, the Government has consistently interpreted the statute the way you are now. 
    But if you're prepared to tell me "zero", I would say I would be suspicious of an interpretation that comes along now for the first time. 
    And my mind is open on it. 
    I'm quite interested in the answer.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --course, that's... when you get to that, it must give you pause that your analysis is of a term, "drug-trafficking crime" or "illicit trafficking", and your theory leads to the conclusion that simple possession equates with drug trafficking.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2163.559" stopTime="2248.087">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Well, the Petitioner has conceded, as I understand it... I heard Mr. Long, I think, concede... that possession offenses can constitute aggravated felonies under this provision, that there is the recidivist possession, there is the possession of the date-rape drug, there is possession of 5 grams or more of cocaine. 
    All of those are specified as being... of being felonies under the... under 940... or 844. 
    But, beyond that, it's important to take into account that a lot of State statutes dealing with drugs do not... are not patterned directly after the Federal statute, and there's no reason why Congress would have insisted that they do so in order for this statute to operate sensibly. 
    And one notable example, for instance, is, when it comes to possession of a substantial amount of drugs, that that certainly would create a strong implication that the defendant was engaged in trafficking activities, or intended to. 
    The Federal statute deals with that by making it a felony to possess with intent to distribute the drug. 
    A number of States don't do that. 
    They, instead, have graduated possession offenses, based on the quantity of drugs that the defendant is possessing; that above a certain quantity of drugs, it would be a felony. 
    They're getting at the same problem, but they've come at it in a different way.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2248.087" stopTime="2264.156">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Then, in those cases, you can say the conduct would constitute a felony under the Federal statute; but here, if I recall correctly, the amount involved would not have qualified for possession with intent to distribute, under Federal law.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, it would always be up to the jury to decide that. 
    Now, in Mr. Lopez's case, he was... he was initially charged with a series of offenses that went beyond the aiding and abetting of possession that he ultimately pleaded guilty to, but, as he testified in his... in his immigration hearing, his aiding and abetting of possession was assisting someone in purchasing drugs, which was, itself, a trafficking element. 
    And so, this shows that the way the State crimes are defined or applied are often getting at what Federal law--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes. 
    We have a case in which we're assuming, for our purposes, we just have possession.

    And I wanted to ask... I have two questions, Mr. Kneedler. 
    One of them... the second one, I'd ask that... you were going to mention three different points, one about conviction; you had two other points you didn't get to. 
    I want to learn what those were. 
    But, before that, it seems to me that, when you put the whole statute... all the... all the different statutory provisions together, you really boil down and focus on 924(c)(2) and the words 
    "for purpose of this subsection, the term "drug-trafficking crime" means any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. " 
    And if the word "Federal" had been inserted before the word "felony" in the statute, would that not make the statute perfectly clear?

    That was one change. 
    The other change that was made in the 1988 Act was to amend Section 1326 with respect to illegal reentries, and it did that by enhancing the penalty for conviction of any felony other than an aggravated felony, and an aggravated felony.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, I realize that. 
    But, if we're asking, 
    "What is important in the mind of Congress, for purposes of the immigration law? " 
    one would suppose that the most obvious touchstone of importance is the way Federal law deals with it... i.e., in the case of a crime, whether Federal law calls it a felony or Federal law calls it a misdemeanor. 
    You know, in your reading, when Federal law calls it a misdemeanor, if State law calls it a felony, it becomes a Federal felony for the immigration law. 
    And that's what seems to me odd.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Right. 
    And this is not the only place where that consequence can arise. 
    There are... there are cases involving "What's a crime of violence"? 
    which is... which, under subparagraph (g), is another aggravated felony. 
    The crime of violence is defined in 18 U.S.C. Section 16, subsection (b) of that... this Court considered that statute in Leocal... requires that the offense be a felony which creates a serious risk of physical harm.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    --It's one thing to turn to State law to get an answer where there is no other answer. 
    The problem here is that State law and Federal law are at odds in determining the gravity of the offense. 
    The Federal law, on my hypothesis, would say, 
    "It is minor; it's just a misdemeanor. " 
    The State says, 
    "No, it is a felony. " 
    It seems to me very odd, given the tension between the State and Federal classifications, to say that, for Federal purposes, the State classification is going to trump the Federal classification; and that's a different situation from the one you posit.

    Well, and... if I could just mention one other... on other example, under the theft... offense category in subsection... I think it's (f)... where a theft offense is deemed to be an aggravated felony if a sentence of at least 1 year was imposed. 
    There are misdemeanor offenses there that... as a matter of Federal law, it can be a misdemeanor for certain types of theft offenses; and yet, they are covered as aggravated felonies.

    Does that mean, if you're convicted, in State court, of a misdemeanor... and even though that action would be a Federal felony, it's not an aggravated felony?

    Well, that... the legislative history of the amendment in 1990 does not discuss the aspect of Barrett that went to the comparison to decide what... in what circumstances there would be an analogous Federal crime. 
    It was clear that it wanted to ratify the result that State crimes are covered. 
    But we think that that was evident from the 1988 amendments to... that both enacted the definition of 1988... and enhanced sentences--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Is the Second Circuit wrong in U.S. v. Hamdi? 
    Because it seems to me that U.S. v. Hamdi is on all fours with respect to mootness.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3265.468" stopTime="3354.725">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Yes. 
    We think it is wrong, be... under this Court's decision in Spencer versus Kemna and other cases, that, if the possible consequence turns on a discretionary judgment that may be made by someone else, that is too speculative to constitute a real live case or controversy. 
    And that's what I understand Toledo-Flores to be arguing, is that if he applied for discretionary relief in the future, that it might... it might matter, because his sentence might be reduced slightly. 
    I should point out that in the District Court Toledo-Flores conceded that if he didn't get an eight... level sentence enhancement, he would get a four-level sentence enhancement, because this is at least a felony, within the meaning of the adjacent provision of the guidelines. 
    That would result in a guideline range of 24 to 30 months. 
    He would then have gotten 24 months, under that guideline range, the very same thing that he got here. 
    And, under the guidelines at the time, a term of supervised release was mandatory. 
    And a 1-year term of supervised release was mandatory in those circumstances. 
    He would have gotten exactly the same term of supervised release if he had been... if he had gotten only the four... level enhancement, rather than the eight-level enhancement. 
    I also think that it is somewhat farfetched to think that, given the fact that Toledo-Flores had more than 12 illegal entries into the United States, and various State offenses, that the determination of whether the attorney general would actually grant discretionary relief would turn on a marginal difference in the sentence on that particular offense. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Robert A. Long, Jr.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3354.725" stopTime="3358.808">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. 
    Mr. Long, you have 4 minutes remaining.
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="3358.808" stopTime="3473.978">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    In answer to Justice Breyer's question, Mr. Kneedler said that a Federal misdemeanor is a drug... trafficking crime under Section 924(c) if a State punishes it as a felony. 
    He said, 
    "Well, the Federal Government never prosecutes Federal misdemeanors under Section 924(c). " 
    "The reason is because of 924(c)(1)(A). " 
    and the language there is, it has to be an offense for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States. 
    But that language... a person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States for a misdemeanor. 
    So, the Government is making an argument that, to my knowledge, has never been accepted by any court, has not ever been advanced by the Government in a criminal context, and that would significantly expand Section 924(c) and numerous other criminal statutes that we cite in our brief that used the same definition of "drug-trafficking crime". 
    The... Mr. Kneedler also said that the aggravated felony provisions in Section 101(a)(43) refer to State law, but I read them just the opposite. 
    There are two kinds. 
    There are 21 of them. 
    Many of them say, 
    "an offense described in 18 U.S. Code Section X.. " 
    I mean, that's really what... we're dealing with one of those here. 
    So, it clearly goes to Federal law to define the offense. 
    Now, if State law or foreign law also punishes that offense, then it's an aggravated felony, but, clearly, Federal law is defining the offense. 
    There are other categories, such as murder and theft, that are defined, in general terms; but the Government's position, as I understand it, is, again, you use a generic uniform definition. 
    You don't pick any definition that the States may have. 
    The Court just granted--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3473.978" stopTime="3479.664">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, I thought... I thought you conceded that a State offense could constitute illicit trafficking--
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="3479.664" stopTime="3480.946">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    --Well, yes--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3480.946" stopTime="3481.166">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --in a Controlled Substance--
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="3481.166" stopTime="3504.851">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    --Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    But, again, to be clear... and I think this is consistent with the Government's position in other cases... ultimately, there will be some uniform Federal definition of what constitutes illicit trafficking. 
    It would be... some commercial element would probably be the definition the Court hasn't decided. 
    States can define it more broadly. 
    But the actual definition... just as the definition of "burglary" or "theft"--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="3504.851" stopTime="3507.753">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    You think there's a uniform Federal definition of a theft offense?
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="3507.753" stopTime="3519.651">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    --Well, it's... I mean, as... this... in the Taylor case, in burglary, the Court has a methodology for this. 
    You pick a sort of generic definition. 
    It may not... it may not come from a Federal statute; it could--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="3519.651" stopTime="3524.344">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    There's... they'll... there's no variation in State offenses that would fall within that, a theft offense?
speaker="robert_a_long_jr" startTime="3524.344" stopTime="3616.024">
    Mr. Robert A. Long, Jr. 
    --Well, it's... again, this is... the provision we're dealing with is... looks to Federal law, the Controlled Substances Act and two other statutes. 
    My understanding of the Government's position... and it's consistent with this Court's cases, in Taylor... is that, even when it's a generic offense, you would... you would still have a uniform definition. 
    And that is certainly consistent with the principle of uniformity that applies both in criminal law and in immigration law. 
    I mean, if there's any ambiguity, at the end of the day, ambiguities are supposed to be resolved in favor of uniformity, uniform Federal law... uniform Federal criminal law, and uniform immigration law. 
    Effectively, what the Government is arguing that... is that States can banish noncitizens, and can do so by enacting drug laws, deciding to make a simple possession offense a felony. 
    That's a decision that a State would make, almost certainly, for reasons that have little or nothing to do with immigration, and it's highly unlikely that Congress would have left that determination to States. 
    On uniformity, aggravated felonies is a condition for citizenship. 
    If you're convicted of an aggravated felony, you may not become a U.S. citizen. 
    You are foreclosed from establishing good moral character. 
    So, in fact, citizenship is at stake here, and the Uniformity Clause is in play. 
    If there are no further questions, thank you.
