Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="0.000" stopTime="41.737">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have two opinions of the Court to announce. 
    In the first, No. 87-283, Budinich versus Becton Dickinson &amp; Company in an opinion authored by Justice Scalia. 
    We hold that in a case where there's a judgment on the merits resolved by the District Court but there remains outstanding a claim for attorney's fees. 
    We hold that federal law governs this situation and that where there is a final decision on the merits, it is immediately appealable and even though there is a request for attorney's fees outstanding. 
    The opinion is unanimous.
