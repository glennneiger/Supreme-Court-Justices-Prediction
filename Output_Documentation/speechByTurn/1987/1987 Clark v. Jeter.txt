    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes to us by writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. 
    The petitioner is the mother of an illegitimate child. 
    She sued the respondent for child support alleging that he is the child's father. 
    The Court dismissed the suit as barred by Pennsylvania six-year statute of limitations for paternity actions. 
    The statute effectively limits the time within which suits may be brought to obtain child support for illegitimate children. 
    By contrast, suits for child support for legitimate children may be brought at any time during their minority. 
    We hold in the opinion filed today that the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The statute discriminates between legitimate and illegitimate children and is not substantially related to an important government objective. 
    Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below and the opinion is unanimous.
