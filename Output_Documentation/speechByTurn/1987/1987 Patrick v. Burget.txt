Patrick v. Burget
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="0.000" stopTime="40.554">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In the third case, Patrick versus Burget is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    We hold that the state action doctrine does not protect positions in the state or on the ground from federal antitrust liability for the activities or fee service of peer-review-committees. 
    Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit. 
    Justice Blackmun took no part in consideration or decision of this case. 
    Believe it or not, this one is otherwise unanimous.
