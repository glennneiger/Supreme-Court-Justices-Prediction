    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
    The United States Tax Court held that the stock that was purchased for business purposes was subject to ordinary-loss treatment. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed this determination. 
    We conclude that petitioner's purpose in acquiring the stock is irrelevant to the determination whether the stock is within the broad definition of capital assets in the Internal Revenue Code. 
    We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit. 
    Justice Kennedy took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
