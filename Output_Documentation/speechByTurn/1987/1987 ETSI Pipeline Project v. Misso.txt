    Justice Byron R. White 
    In the Pipeline Case we review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and for reasons stated in an opinion on file with the Clerk, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    The opinion is unanimous except that Justice Kennedy took no part in the case.
