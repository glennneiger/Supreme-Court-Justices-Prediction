    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    In the case of Kadrmas versus Dickinson Public Schools, it comes to us on appeal from the Supreme Court of North Dakota. 
    Under the statutes of that State, some local school districts are required to provide free school bus service for their students. 
    Other districts are given the option of providing transportation to school and they may impose a user fee on families who take advantage of the bus service if it is provided. 
    Appellants or a school child and her mother who live in a district that imposes a user fee covering part of the school bus service. 
    This family whose resources put it at or near the official poverty level refused to pay the user fee and the child was denied access to the school bus. 
    The family thereafter arranged for private transportation and the appellant sued the school district in the state court. 
    This law suit which sought an injunction prevent the school district from collecting any fee for the bus service, raised two federal claims that are at issue in the -- in this Court. 
    The appellants argued that the bus fee violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it discriminates against the poor. 
    Second, the appellants argue that the state statutes violate equal protection because they irrationally allow some school districts but not others to impose user fees for the bus service. 
    The North Dakota courts dismissed the suit on the merits. 
    In an opinion filed to day, we affirm. 
    We hold that the Equal Protection Clause does not require strict scrutiny in this case because poverty does not define a suspect class and education is not a fundamental right within the meaning of our prior decisions. 
    We therefore test the state laws by asking whether they have irrational relation to a legitimate government objective. 
    For reasons explained in the opinion, we hold that the user fee is rationally related to a legitimate objective.

    Justice Stevens has also filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun has joined.
