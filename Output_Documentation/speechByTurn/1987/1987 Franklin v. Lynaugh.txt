    Justice Byron R. White 
    In this case which is here from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, six of us agreed that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed. 
    There has not an opinion for the Court, however, I have filed an opinion which the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy have joined. 
    Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and Justice Blackmun has joined that opinion. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan and Marshall have joined.
