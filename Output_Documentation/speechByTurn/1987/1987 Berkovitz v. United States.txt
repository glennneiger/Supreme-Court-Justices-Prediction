Berkovitz v. United States
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="0.000" stopTime="23.351">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The other case of Berkovitz is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
    In that case, we hold that the discretionary function exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act does not bar petitioner's suit. 
    Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit.
