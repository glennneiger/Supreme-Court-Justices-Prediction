City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear argument first this morning in No. 86-772, the City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik. 
    Mr. Wilson, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="james_j_wilson" startTime="13.605" stopTime="311.609">
    Mr. James J. Wilson 
    Thank you. 
    This proceeding, brought under Section 1983, involves the imposition of municipal liability upon the Petitioner for the single isolated act of a city official who lacked general authority in the area and whose action was contrary to the policy of the city. 
    This is a Monell type case. 
    In Monell, this Court indicated that it was going to leave to future decisions the full contours of municipal liability. 
    It is our position in respect to single incidents that this Court has shaped those contours in its decisions in cases such as Owens, Tuttle, and particularly the recent Pembaur decision. 
    And what this proceeding calls for is an application of those principles to the facts herein. 
    The facts are largely undisputed. 
    The Plaintiff was a civil service employee of the City of St. Louis. 
    He was a planner for our community development commission. 
    Around 1980, he became embroiled in a dispute with his supervisor. 
    This led to a 15-day suspension for violation of the secondary employment rule. 
    He appealed to our Civil Service Commission which reduced that to a reprimand. 
    In April 1981, because of a change of administrations, the new mayor appointed a Defendant Frank Hamsher as the head of the community development agency. 
    Approximately one year later, Mr. Hamsher, as director of that agency, transferred the Plaintiff to another City department. 
    He filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission. 
    The Civil Service Commission declined that appeal on the basis that no injury was done to him at that time since this was a lateral transfer. 
    Subsequent to that, the Plaintiff filed a 1983 action naming three City officials and the City as Defendants. 
    Defendant Hamsher was one of those named. 
    The Plaintiff was subsequently laid off from his position some 17 months after the transfer. 
    He took an appeal from that layoff and that appeal has been deferred awaiting the outcome of this proceeding. 
    We believe the question is whether or not the acts of the Defendant Hamsher in transferring the Plaintiff fall within the language of Monell which imposes liability for acts which can be said to fairly represent governmental policy. 
    Now, the court below, the trial court rendered through a jury verdict a judgment against the City of St. Louis. 
    It exonerated the three individual defendants. 
    The Court of Appeals in its opinion determined that the jury had found that the act of transfer was a retaliatory act on the part of Defendant Hamsher and he was impermissibly motivated and caused constitutional injury to the Plaintiff who had been exercising his right of First Amendment by appealing to the Civil Service Commission. 
    The Eighth Circuit determined that the Defendant Hamsher was a policy maker and his action, therefore, in transferring the Plaintiff bound the City of St. Louis so that Monell type liability was imposed upon the City as a policy maker. 
    It is our position that the crux of this matter involves the distinction between a City official who has the discretion to act. 
    In this case, the discretion to hire and fire and transfer employees as opposed to the authority of a policy maker. 
    In this case, it would be the authority to set employment policy for the City of St. Louis. 
    Clearly, the Defendant Hamsher had the former: the discretionary power to hire, fire and transfer employees. 
    But nowhere in the record is there presented any evidence that the Defendant Hamsher was a policy maker for purposes of setting the employment policy of the City of St. Louis. 
    The Court of appeals misconstrued Pembaur. 
    They adopted in their opinion what has been labeled the final authority test, which the court said was a two-pronged test to determine Monell liability.

    Mr. James J. Wilson 
    --There is nothing in... my interpretation of the record, there is nothing in there that would support that inference. 
    There is some allusions to the mayor. 
    I think there is an allusion that the mayor knew that there was a transfer of functions from one department to another, but that was different than having knowledge particularly of this Plaintiff. 
    So, our answer would be no, although the mayor was never named in a verdict director by the Plaintiff in this particular instance. 
    We believe that the test of the final... the final authority test that the Eighth Circuit placed in its opinion is erroneous. 
    It is contrary to Pembaur. 
    The delegated authority to act, I think may be categorized as discretion. 
    And this Court made clear in Pembaur in Part 2(b) that discretion is not enough to impose liability. 
    If I may quote: 
    "The official must be responsible for establishing final government policy respecting such activity. " 
    Aside from the being contrary to Pembaur, the test promoted by the Eighth Circuit in its opinion is unreasonable. 
    The question of delegating out authority is one that runs throughout all of City officialdom in employment. 
    We could not conduct business without delegating out discretion to employees all the way down the line. 
    Also, the second part of the test, the lack of de novo review is equally unreasonable. 
    There are countless decisions that are made everyday operationally that there is no apparatus to provide review. 
    As an example, the police officer in Tuttle who was involved in the shooting. 
    There would have been nothing that would have provided reasonably any review for that act prior to what had occurred. 
    We believe the test is totally unreasonable, but the main point is that it is contrary to the opinions... most of the opinions that were rendered in Pembaur. 
    The plurality opinion I think clearly, which relies upon, as a basis the identification of a policy maker. 
    And the policy maker identification is arrived at by an inquiry into state law as to the authority of that official to set policy. 
    Here I believe you have a contrast in Pembaur between the official who was held liable and the Defendant Hamsher, who we assert should not have been considered to be a policy maker. 
    The prosecutor in Pembaur was an elected county-wide official. 
    The Sixth Circuit had held clearly interpreting Ohio law that he was the chief law enforcement officer for that particular county. 
    He was not answerable or responsible in respect to any of his conduct, other than to the voters. 
    There were no parameters or criteria that circumscribed his action. 
    Here, in respect to Hamsher, our purported policy maker, the record is very sparse; but we do know he is appointed by the mayor. 
    He is a functionary in respect to approving development plans for the City and in administering community development funds.

    Mr. James J. Wilson 
    --Yes, that's right. 
    That was their categorization of what the jury had determined. 
    I think the difference between our prosecutor in Pembaur and the Defendant Hamsher here is: Hamsher's discretion to hire and fire was subject to Civil Service rules and our entire Civil Service system. 
    He was not unfettered in making employment decisions in respect to his particular employees. 
    I think there was a number of appeals that the Plaintiff made and that he received relief in the main on those appeals which indicated that Hamsher was not in a position to set policy for his employees. 
    He had the Civil Service Commission of the City looking over him. 
    Footnote 12 in Pembaur, the plurality opinion, we believe anticipated exactly the fact situation we have there. 
    The Court in that opinion hypothesized a county sheriff, a hypothetical county sheriff who, while being the chief law enforcement officer, received rules and regulations in respect to employment from the County Board of Commissioners. 
    In that hypothetical, that county sheriff, if he committed an unconstitutional act in respect to his employees, it would not impose liability upon the county; although, if he acted in respect to his function as chief law enforcement officer, liability would be imposed. 
    That is what we believe is exactly what we have in this record in respect to the Defendant Hamsher.

    So, de facto, a lot of people beneath the mayor are really making policy; but he doesn't know what those policies are in fact.

    Mr. James J. Wilson 
    --In respect I think to single incident liability. 
    Now, we are separating out the types of Monell liability. 
    I think there are three kinds. 
    There is general rules of application. 
    I think there is custom and usage. 
    And then I think there is a third type of liability which I would call single incident liability. 
    Under Pembaur, I think the threshold question is who is a policy maker and that, we would believe, is purely a question of law. 
    If we are in the second category, custom and usage and practice, then that would raise a number of factual issues for a jury.

    Mr. James J. Wilson 
    I think that is an open question. 
    And I think the Fifth Circuit, which rendered an opinion on this particular issue felt that constructive knowledge was enough in that instance to impose liability, constructive knowledge on the part, even though the Fifth Circuit is clearly in conflict with our present decision from the Eighth Circuit because they abandoned what we categorize as the final authority test. 
    I think the key here is, unlike the prosecutor in Pembaur, Hamsher had substantive constraints upon the scope of his employment decisions. 
    The dissent in the Eighth Circuit I think captured the significance of these restraints in our appendix to our petition. 
    The judge stated, Judge Ross stated the Civil Service rules permit appointing authorities discretion in making personnel decisions, but do not grant them the power to set personnel policy.

 Well, what if a lower ranking city official assumes the responsibility for making decisions that could be interpreted as policy decisions? 
 Now, are there circumstances in which the city could be found liable for the exercise of those decisions? 
 For example, if higher authority knows or should have known about those actions of lower ranking employees?

    Mr. James J. Wilson 
    That is our position, yes. 
    The concurring opinions in Pembaur by Justice White and joined in by Justice O'Connor indicate and they are at variance with the plurality, although I think if applied here would reach the same result, which would be reversal, would indicate that where the law has placed limits on the city official and he acts contrary to and outside those limits, that his acts cannot be considered to be policies of the governmental entity. 
    Applied here, clearly there was criteria through our Civil Service system and parameters on the Defendant Hamsher. 
    The Civil Service system has specifically provided in its charter amendment that the system is to be run on merit and fitness based upon service ratings. 
    There is a right of appeal that has been specifically granted. 
    I think that right of appeal in a civil service system carries with it by clear implication that you can't retaliate against an employee for exercising his right of appeal. 
    If you did, you would then be attempting to take away indirectly what the law has conferred directly upon the employee, the right of appeal. 
    Our rules and regulations forbid discrimination. 
    It also provides a substantive rule in respect to transfers. 
    You can't transfer an employee and have them meet a different test of fitness.

   Argument of Charles R. Oldham
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1661.971" stopTime="1666.797">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, Mr. Wilson. 
    I will hear now from you, Mr. Oldham.
speaker="charles_r_oldham" startTime="1666.797" stopTime="1862.171">
    Mr. Charles R. Oldham 
    If the Court please, Mr. Chief Justice: 
    There is a substantial difference between our version of the facts and the version of the facts as presented by counsel for Petitioner. 
    I would like to point out that this was a jury tried case. 
    And Respondent is entitled to the benefit of all evidence in his favor and all reasonable inference drawn therefrom. 
    Now, there are certain facts that are not in dispute. 
    It is stipulated that the acts against Praprotnik were done under color of law. 
    It was stipulated that he was engaged in protected activity at the time he appealed his actions to the Civil Service Commission. 
    And there was evidence that he was also engaged in protected activity when he made some criticism of Seraph sculpture. 
    A jury clearly found that Praprotnik had been subjected to retaliation because of his exercise of First Amendment rights. 
    Now, I want to get briefly into the facts where we are in difference. 
    For example, Petitioner argues that Hamsher was solely responsible for the transfer of Praprotnik from a secure position in the CDA to an insecure position at Heritage and Urban Design. 
    Now, let me explain that situation. 
    Praprotnik had seniority position where he was the top seniority person. 
    He had about 19 or 20 years of service at CDA. 
    There were three or four people in his same position underneath him. 
    So that in order to reach Praprotnik, they would have had to lay off everybody underneath him in the same classification. 
    He was moved from that position to a position at Heritage and Urban Design where he was the only person in that classification. 
    Since we have departmental lay off, he was subject to immediate lay off. 
    Now, in regard to the transfer, there are a few facts that led up to the transfer. 
    There had been the situation with the Civil Service Commission. 
    There had been acts of retaliation against Mr. Praprotnik in terms of taking away his personnel, reducing his scope of his responsibilities. 
    Things of this nature. 
    After that, he was subpoenaed to appear before the Heritage and Urban Design Commission to testify concerning the piece of sculpture, the Seraph sculpture which was ensconced on the front yard of the Civil Courts Building in the City of St. Louis. 
    He testified and his testimony was not well received by the mayor. 
    And he was immediately called into Mr. Hamsher's office and told that he should have mucked it, that he shouldn't have given this particular information to the Heritage and Urban Design Commission. 
    Now, that was in the fall. 
    The following spring, he was transferred. 
    Now, the act of transfer, in his particular situation, involved not only the transfer of the individual, but the transfer of functions. 
    In order to transfer functions, they had to get the approval of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, which consisted of the mayor, the president of the board of aldermen and the comptroller, the three highest elected officials of the city. 
    They had to approve the transfer of functions. 
    Now, the testimony is--

    That's part of the evidence. 
    The other evidence is that Mr. Hamsher testified in his testimony that he went in and discussed this matter with the mayor and he recommended the transfer of Mr. Praprotnik and that the mayor made the decision to transfer Mr. Praprotnik and that he, as a good loyal servant of the mayor, followed his actions. 
    That is in our brief.

    Mr. Charles R. Oldham 
    There was a Mr. Conway who was... preceded a Mr. Famel. 
    And Mr. Spaid was the CDA director who originally took the action against Praprotnik and suspended him and later reduced him, responsibilities. 
    Then, when Mr. Hamsher came in, there was the situation with the Seraph sculpture, there was a further reduction of responsibilities and after that the transfer of Mr. Praprotnik over to the Heritage and Urban Design Commission.

    Every city has a different situation.

    "Under these facts, another individual might have policy making authority. "

    Mr. Charles R. Oldham 
    I think it is a mixed question of law, in fact, like many things. 
    But I think the jury in this case was instructed and given the instructions to determine who was the policy maker and whether or not these high officials represented the actions of the City. 
    They were also told that the City can only be liable if it was part of a policy that was knowingly followed by the City so that this was what was submitted to the jury in this case. 
    And the jury then found the City responsible. 
    And, based upon that, it is our contention that the act of a transfer in this particular situation was a policy action. 
    Now, let me explain that a little further. 
    The decision of Hamsher, Jackson, Duffe, who was Director of Personnel, and the mayor and the other two individuals I mentioned, comptroller and president of the board of aldermen, to transfer Mr. Praprotnik was not subject to review.

    Mr. Charles R. Oldham 
    Yes, the same mayor was involved... in the first instance, the first suspension was done by Mr. Spaid who was then Director of CDA under a different mayor. 
    But Mr. Shamo was the mayor during most of this process.

    Mr. Charles R. Oldham 
    No. 
    They were asked if he were... the instructions were give on which there were no objections made that you could find the City liable if this was done by high officials. 
    It is not limited to the three officials that were named in the law suit. 
    You have to remember that this was a long time process and that in August prior to the trial, I attempted to amend the petition to bring in some additional named defendants, specifically, the mayor, Mr. Nash, who was the Director of the Department of Public Welfare and others. 
    And that petition was denied. 
    So, we were left in the posture where we were not able to get all the named defendants who had taken part in this particular action in that particular law suit. 
    And we were left with the City as a Defendant. 
    Now, both myself and the attorney for the City pointed out to the jury that there were other high officials involved in this action. 
    And that these other high officials, and our contention was that these other high officials did it, then the City was liable even if they should find that the three individuals were not responsible. 
    So that that's a posture that we found ourselves at the time of trial.

    Yes. 
    When you have high officials of the government involved in this process and you have a Civil Service Commission in the position where they know about it because they have an appeal pending before them which they have declined to hear. 
    And they take no action on it. 
    They say, 
    "We will not hear transfer appeals. " 
    Then when we have the lay-off, we also filed that appeal. 
    And that appeal is still pending some three or four years later. 
    We don't think this is an effective review. 
    They have permitted this process to go on. 
    And, so, they have had knowledge of this all during the time.

    Mr. Charles R. Oldham 
    Well, I think the courts have held that there is liability under 1983. 
    And I equate that with the same type of situation, Your Honor. 
    In this situation, we get back to the basic fact that this was a jury tried case that the jury found there was retaliation, the jury found liability on the part of the City. 
    And one of the points that the City has talked about in its brief and presented in its argument is that there is a basic inconsistency about the verdict which exonerates the three individuals and the verdict which finds the City liable. 
    And that is not the posture of the case because the instructions permitted you go beyond the three individuals. 
    The arguments of counsel for the City pointed out that these three individuals weren't responsible, that there were other high public officials that were responsible. 
    And I pointed out that there were other high officials that were responsible so that the jury could, under the arguments and under the instructions, find liability by the City and excuse the three individuals.

    Mr. Charles R. Oldham 
    Under Section 1983 alleging the transfer was a violation of his constitutional rights. 
    And then after... they went ahead and did the lay-off. 
    We then filed another appeal to the Civil Service Commission and they refused to hear that. 
    They placed it on the back burner where it has been all this time so that we have not had an effective appeal process. 
    There is another thing that the Court must bear in mind. 
    On a lay-off, the Civil Service Commission does not give you a full due process hearing. 
    They limit the type of hearing that you can have.

    Mr. Charles R. Oldham 
    Well, because actions against Praprotnik covered a period of almost three years. 
    And it covered a number of incidents. 
    They involved, first of all, he was supposed to get a reprimand saying that he had not obtained a clear understanding of the policy established by Mr. Spaid. 
    Instead, they reprimanded him for what he had originally been charged with before the Civil Service Commission and placed it in his personnel file. 
    And even Mr. Kindleberger, the person who did it, admitted that he was in error on that or didn't do it right. 
    There were other things that happened. 
    Mr. Spaid called him in and they reduced his pay a couple of pay steps right after they had recommended him for a two-step increase. 
    And this happened right after the Civil Service hearing. 
    After that, his responsibilities were reduced. 
    When Mr. Hamsher came in, they had the incident with the Seraph sculpture and after that things went really downhill and he was reduced further in responsibilities. 
    Much of his work was taken away from him.

    Mr. Charles R. Oldham 
    --I think that is within the meaning of 1983. 
    If you have a single isolated incident, that is one thing. 
    That is something that happens within a relatively short period of time to one individual. 
    But when you have a number of incidents and it is clear over a period of three years directed at that individual, I think you have a "Get Praprotnik" policy. 
    And I remember that the case of Parlow v. Fitzgerald where there was a "Get Fitzgerald" policy and it is somewhat similar. 
    Because Praprotnik was as well known within the St. Louis hierarchy as Fitzgerald was within the Federal Government hierarchy. 
    And I don't see how you can say that a person... that if a policy making people and people who are in a position to make decisions that effect an individual and do so for unconstitutional reasons, that that doesn't create the City's... liability on the part of the City. 
    Because, remember, in our instructions to the jury, we said that the high officials had to have the authority to speak for the City and it could only be... the City could only be held responsible where they did it knowingly and with knowledge. 
    And so that is the posture of this particular case--

    The record reflects that the mayor made the decision to transfer him. 
    The record reflects that the mayor made the decision to transfer his functions. 
    The record reflects that the mayor was involved in being unhappy about his testimony about the Seraph sculpture. 
    In order for the Court to understand that, the Seraph sculpture was being promoted by Emily Pulitzer, who is the wife of Joe Pulitzer, who owns the Post Dispatch, whose position is important to the mayor. 
    And they had proposed a Seraph sculpture to be put out in the front yard of the courthouse. 
    And when he testified that there were some problems with the Seraph sculpture, under oath, before the Heritage and Urban Design Commission, he was called in and reprimanded by Mr. Hamsher and was told that he should have mucked the questions, that he should not have responded to them, that the mayor was unhappy. 
    So that the mayor was involved in this situation and knew about it.

    Your Honor, I don't think that a statement of an employee or agent of the mayor is hearsay. 
    I think that is... when you speak for your principal, that takes it beyond the hearsay stage. 
    And, so, we have statements by the employees, agents of the mayor, saying the mayor was unhappy. 
    And I do not think that is hearsay. 
    If the Court please, I know my time is about up: 
    I think that our case should be affirmed for the reasons we have stated. 
    That high public officials were involved, that the jury verdict under the Seventh Amendment should be respected and that the Court should grant the relief we have requested.

    Mr. James J. Wilson 
    We have now in Respondent's argument interjected the mayor of the City of St. Louis into this dispute. 
    I would like to in reflecting the record try to clarify or correct what I think have been some mischaracterizations of it. 
    There was nothing in the record that indicates that the mayor ever had any personal involvement with the Plaintiff. 
    I question whether or not he knew of the Plaintiff. 
    The Plaintiff was a middle manager city planner. 
    We were involved in a cutback of some community development funds that caused a shortfall of $35 million in the city budget and what was attempted to be done was to transfer functions from this large department, the Community Development Agency, to various other city agencies. 
    The reference that the mayor knew of the transfer is actually a reference to his knowledge, obviously, that functions were being transferred. 
    The Plaintiff attempted at various times to involve 15 City officials into this dispute. 
    His verdict director instruction, though, is quite clear. 
    And I would read from it that: The Defendants Hamsher, Patterson and Kindleberger are high governmental officials with the right to make policy decisions.

    We are pointing out, though, his theory of the case in no way is directed to the mayor as a policy maker.

    No, but at the directed verdict stage, you are not really debating the theory of the case of whether there is any evidence that would sustain liability under 1983.

    Mr. James J. Wilson 
    I think, Justice Stevens, I think we get to the point of attempting to identify the policy maker and I think for that purpose we wanted to make sure that it was clear that the mayor, who may be, along with the Civil Service Commission, to be a policy maker, was not in any way involved in this particular retaliatory transfer. 
    It was found by the Eighth Circuit to be the act of the Defendant Hamsher. 
    And I think that is the question is: Whether or not the Defendant Hamsher was a policy maker under state law. 
    In respect to the appeal from the lay-off that Mr. Oldham described which I would have to disagree with. 
    I think the constructive discharge appeal would give the Plaintiff a right to a full hearing, either before the Civil Service Commission or under our state law, de novo in the Circuit Court.
