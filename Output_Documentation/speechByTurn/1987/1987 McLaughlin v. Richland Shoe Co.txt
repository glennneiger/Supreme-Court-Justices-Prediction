    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The Fair Labor Standards Act requires that a civil enforcement action be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued unless the violation was willful in which event the statute of limitations is three years. 
    There's a conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to the proper meaning of the word, “proper standard” to use in interpreting the word “willful”. 
    And for reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we resolved that conflict by agreeing with the approach taken by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and affirm its judgment in this case. 
    Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Brennan and Justice Blackmun.
