Patterson v. McLean Credit Union

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-107, Brenda Patterson v. McLean Credit Union. 
    Mr. Chambers, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="11.530" stopTime="243.100">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The Court's order of April 25, 1988 directed that the parties address the issue of whether the Court should reconsider its decision in Runyon v. McCrary. 
    Runyon held that 42 U.S.C. 1981 applies to private contractual relations and in that case prohibited a private school from discriminating on the basis of race in its admission practices. 
    I will first show that the doctrines of congressional ratification and stare decisis preclude reconsideration of Runyon. 
    I will then demonstrate in the remaining half of my argument that Runyon was correctly decided. 
    Thus, even if the Court decides to revisit Runyon, I submit that Runyon was correctly decided and should be reaffirmed. 
    Congressional ratification and stare decisis, as adopted and applied by this Court, require that Runyon be followed and not reversed. 
    Runyon and Section 1981 have become a significant part of the web of joint congressional and judicial efforts to rid the country of public and private discrimination. 
    Reversing Runyon under these circumstances would not only reject congressional reliance and decisions of the Court but legislation specifically designed by Congress incorporating the Court's decision and attempting to encourage the use and enforcement of Section 1981. 
    It would virtually abandon stare decisis as a fundamental doctrine of a court. 
    Legislative efforts of Congress since Runyon and its precursor, Jones v. Mayer, show a consistent pattern of congressional adoption and ratification of the Court's holdings that Section 1981 prohibits public and private discrimination in contractual dealings. 
    Three months after the decision in Runyon, Congress passed a law providing attorney fees to encourage enforcement or use of Section 1981. 
    The Attorney Fees Act is highly significant. 
    It is not simply that the Congress was aware of Runyon. 
    It is not merely that the Attorney Fees Act shows that Congress approved of Runyon. 
    Both points are true, but there's more. 
    Runyon and Jones were the foundation building blocks for the Attorney Fees Act and its applicability to Section 1981. 
    Congress built on Runyon by passing a law that would have made no sense had Runyon not been decided. 
    That is true because Runyon and Jones held that Sections 1981 and 1982 permitted an individual to use those acts to challenge private discrimination. 
    If Jones and Runyon are now reversed, there would be no basis for lawsuits based on Section 1981 and 1982 in which attorney fees could be awarded if one is successful. 
    The Fees Act applies the private attorney general theory under which Congress encouraged private attorneys to use civil rights statutes to vindicate a policy of Congress by providing a fee for litigants who bring Jones and Runyon types of proceedings. 
    Congress asserted that the people who litigate those claims vindicated congressional policy and Congress wanted--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But the fee-setting, Mr. Chambers... you would still have been able to recover against public bodies in a suit under 1981, wouldn't you?
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="249.694" stopTime="402.804">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    --That's correct, Your Honor, but we also would have been able to recover under 1983. 
    And what Congress was doing was building on the Court's decisions in Runyon and Jones which permitted one to challenge private discrimination. 
    And without Runyon and without Jones, 1981 and 1982 would be of little value at all. 
    So, Congress noted that one could recover under 1983 in challenging public bodies, and it wanted to encourage the use of 1981 and 1982 to encourage lawsuits challenging private discrimination. 
    This is of direct congressional endorsement and ratification of Runyon and Jones. 
    And I don't know of anything else that Congress could do to tell the Court that it accepted and ratified and wanted to use the Court's decisions to encourage enforcement of 1981 and 1982. 
    Congress expressly said we endorse your decision in Jones and Runyon, and we want to build upon it, and we want to encourage private litigants to use this Act. 
    As Congressman Drinan said, the way to make that Act effective is to provide attorney fees so that private parties can use it. 
    Now, this is the same, in our position, as Congress expressly enacting 1981 with an attorney fees provision. 
    It endorsed, it encouraged, and it wanted to make that Act a part of the civil rights provisions that would permit one to challenge public and private discrimination. 
    And reversing Runyon under those circumstances would in our opinion fly right in the face of Congress' efforts to use your decision to prohibit public and private discrimination. 
    And the way the Court and Congress has worked in this area, where Congress has built on what the Court has decided, to try to rid the country of discriminatory practices would be contrary to decisions that this Court has rendered and every precedent that I know of. 
    And I don't think that under these circumstances it would be appropriate for the Court to strike that building block that Congress had built to remove Runyon as a means for now challenging private discrimination in contractual matters.

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Again, Your Honor, I'm saying that the Court... the decisions that the Court has followed in this area where Congress has spoken, and I'm referring, for example, to cases like Bob Jones. 
    I'm referring to cases like Patsy v. Florida Board. 
    You have looked at decisions, and you questioned whether those decisions are arguably wrong... the precedents that were being considered. 
    You questioned whether there are other precedents or exceptions that would warrant the Court deviating from that prior decision. 
    And in this case, what I'm saying is that the record demonstrates that the original decision was wrong... was right... that is, the Runyon decision was correctly decided. 
    And even if you had any question about it, what has transpired since Runyon? 
    What Congress did immediately after your decision in Runyon I submit forecloses the Court now setting aside the Runyon decision.

    If Mrs. Patterson is correct that any lawsuit affecting terms and conditions of employment that alleges discrimination can be filed under Section 1981, then why do you suppose it is Congress established the EEOC and passed Title VII? 
    They've become a dead letter. 
    They're not even needed if Section 1981 is available for every such action.

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Your Honor, I think Congress did, and I think that in 1972 Congress made it clear that it wanted to make both remedies available for challenging discrimination in employment. 
    There was an effort, as the Court knows, by Senator Hruska to make Title VII and the Equal Pay Act the exclusive remedies for challenging private discrimination. 
    Congress spoke then and said that it wanted to continue both remedies. 
    And Congress spoke again, as I said a moment ago, in 1976.

    --The Senate voted larger than that on reconsideration and decided that it wanted to preserve both remedies. 
    Additionally, I would point out that in 1976 Congress spoke again and said that it wanted to preserve both remedies and wanted to encourage the use of both remedies. 
    So, again, under congressional ratification, I think that those acts of Congress foreclose the Court from now... for now reconsidering the Runyon decision. 
    Additionally, I would point out that in applying the doctrine of stare decisis, none of the exceptions that the Court has used is applicable here. 
    What has happened since Runyon, not only in Congress but in other acts of private entities and governmental bodies, demonstrate that the public accepts and wants to perpetuate the use of the Runyon and the Jones decision.

    Well, Your Honor, I don't think that the brief that the Court is referring to poses an inconsistency. 
    What the brief suggested was that it would impose a burden. 
    It would be time consuming for Congress to have to go back and enact a law to replace Section 1981 if you reversed it.

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Well, Your Honor, I don't... I don't want to speculate on that. 
    I think that we would have... we have demonstrated Congress' interest in preserving 1981, and we have demonstrated that this Court has respected that act by Congress. 
    And we are encouraging the Court here to follow the precedents in this civil rights area affecting race and as the Court has done in other areas. 
    Turning then to the legislative history, as I suggested, Runyon was correctly decided in 1976. 
    First, let me address the defendant's or Respondent's position that the 1970... 1874 codification of 1981 in some way made 1981 a Fourteenth Amendment act. 
    We have shown in our brief that the defendant relies here on a headnote and some notes that appeared in a codification of 1981 after Congress had codified the Act. 
    But more particularly, the legislative history clearly demonstrates that Congress in codifying Section 1981 in 1874 was codifying both the 1866 Act as well as the 1870 Act.

    I think you'll find, Mr. Chambers, that until probably the 1920s, we wouldn't have looked at it in anywhere near... if at all... in anywhere near the detail that was used to render our decision in Runyon. 
    So, almost inevitably the decision rendered in 1874 on the meaning of this statute would have been different even assuming that the use of the legislative history in Runyon was correct.

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    I would suggest, Your Honor, that the collection of cases challenging the enforcement of the black codes equally missing as the cases challenging private discrimination against a purely private individual. 
    And there are a number of reasons for the nonenforcement of this particular section of the Act: not only the difficulty of getting to the Federal court, the availability of counsel, the fear of individuals in trying to use the courts. 
    There are a number of explanations. 
    And I don't think that the fact that you don't find a case in 1874 or 1875 challenging a purely private discrimination suggests one way or the other that the Act didn't reach private discrimination. 
    Again, I submit that the 1874 codification incorporated the 1866 Act as well as the 1870 Act and that Congress was carrying over the provisions prohibiting public and private discrimination in 1874.

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    The statutory words prohibit discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts, and that covers the type of conduct that we have involved here with Ms. Patterson. 
    That's the point. 
    And as we look at the legislative history, we see a Congress that saw blacks, freed blacks, harassed in the work place, denied pay, and that's the kind of conduct that this Congress was trying to reach. 
    This case is typical of the conduct that Congress was trying to address in 1866. 
    So, I don't think there's a problem about applying this statute to cover harassment in the work place. 
    Looking at the legislative history, I think we go back to look at where Congress was trying to address--

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    I think we apply the law to the facts and at the time that we are looking at the situation. 
    I think that Congress meant to reach this kind of conduct. 
    And we look at it here. 
    It might different. 
    It might be a different type of employer. 
    We're not working the farms now. 
    We're working in the credit union. 
    So, the type of discrimination may differ, but the conduct... the discrimination, the enslavement, the badges of slavery are the things that we are trying to reach. 
    And that's what Congress meant to reach in 1866. 
    Again, going back looking at the conditions that Congress was addressing in 1866, we had not only pervasive practices by private individuals who were placing blacks back in slavery as before, but we had also some governmental legislation. 
    And what Congress was looking at in 1866 was a... was a condition in which people were concerned about the Federal Government reaching State practices. 
    We all concede that the Thirteenth Amendment reaches private and public act. 
    We all concede that in 1866, the government approved of reaching private practices. 
    And so Congress, in enacting the 1866 Act, was trying to cover pubic and private practices to rid the country of the slavery that we had just enacted the Thirteenth Amendment to cover. 
    I want to reserve some time, Your Honor.

    Thank you, Mr. Chambers.

   Argument of Roger S. Kaplan
speaker="roger_s_kaplan" startTime="1563.113" stopTime="1721.775">
    Mr. Roger S. Kaplan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I think the basic problem in the presentation of the Petitioner's arguments in this case is that they start from the wrong baseline. 
    Instead of looking to 19... the 1960s or 1970s, I think the proper point of departure is really much earlier date, 1883, when the Court handed down the civil rights cases and indicated in a opinion, which was generally respected for a long time thereafter, that this statute would not reach private acts of discrimination. 
    Many years go by. 
    The Nation matures. 
    We encounter other types of problems, particularly in the area of racial discrimination. 
    And in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there's a movement in Congress that something has to be done. 
    And after four years or so of angst and anger and controversy, Congress comes up with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
    I think what we are dealing with here is really the force that sets in motion a pattern of congressional action, a decision that it is the legislative branch which must take control of these things, which must provide the remedies, since none apparently exist, and must control how our society is to develop in terms of meeting racial equality in the work place and elsewhere. 
    The problem that I see with these decisions, Runyon in particular, is they threaten this... this orderly development and this appropriate, I think, allocation of authority to Congress to deal with these... with these measures. 
    Title VII, for example, which is the primary statute where these cases really come up, has a different thrust, a different emphasis, than Section 1981.

    Mr. Roger S. Kaplan 
    I think that what has to be focused on is the impact of this kind of legislation or rule-making evident in Runyon on the operation of Title VII itself. 
    And I think this has been discussed and noted, and I think it bears repeating that what that statute is emphasizing is a conciliatory approach involving a government involvement by the EEOC which is a congressional determination as to how things should operate, and also a specific congressionally determined judicial remedy if that fails, which basically is equitable and remedial, back pay, reinstatement. 
    This rule, the rule of Runyon, allows for punitive damages, for compensatory damages. 
    It cuts the EEOC out of the process. 
    It doesn't allow it to escape... to shape the scope of investigations and determine how broad the remedies should be made. 
    It doesn't certainly encourage a conciliatory approach to settlement of these problems. 
    But it also disregards something else in Title VII which is federalism. 
    And that statute specifically encouraged the States to pass laws and create agencies to take care of these problems and solve it in its own jurisdiction through the deferral procedure. 
    This also threatens that procedure and that concern.

    --Sure. 
    In this case, I think this is a pretty good illustration which occurred in the oral argument which took place earlier this year. 
    And what the Court was trying to define there was the statutory... reconcile the statutory language, as I gather, with the argument that the Petitioner was making that any sort of complaint arising out of working conditions, terms and conditions of employment, can fit into this rubric of the right to make and the right to enforce a contract. 
    If... what is happening here is that the language of a statute which was designed for some other purpose, a more limited purpose, has been used now as a general anti-discrimination device, and what is happening is that the Court is running into a wall as to... as to the interpretation of these... of this enactment which it's going to continue to find problems with. 
    It's very difficult to square the language of this statute even in a... any sort of case which deals with other than the legal capacity issue. 
    Where do you draw the line? 
    How do you determine where... once you go beyond the right to make it, the capacity to make a contract, where do you draw the line as to what is covered and what isn't covered?

    Mr. Roger S. Kaplan 
    I think that a practice that was given judicial effect if it had the force of law that was actually being treated as law, not simply an obnoxious practice that existed. 
    And I think that's what makes it consistent with the rest of the statute. 
    The terminology that appears in this law really goes toward public actors, people acting in the... in furtherance of public... of public goals. 
    And I think that's really why this statute should be interpreted as applying to a narrower field than it has presently been given effect to, and that the decision that Runyon incorporates... and it certainly relies on, for example, the Johnson Railway Express case... should be reviewed. 
    There are other problems that have come up here involving coverage in terms, for example, of the statute of limitations. 
    The Court has had to have at least three cases dealing with that issue in trying to resolve it. 
    What I find concerns me, though, is... and I'm getting back to the Title VII issue because I think that is the... has to be the primary focus because that's where it's primarily being used. 
    Approximately, from what we could tell, three-quarters or more of the 1981 cases come in the employment area. 
    And so, I don't think you can ignore that particular focus on this statute. 
    And what is happening, as we began to mention before, is that it's beginning to push out Title VII as a remedy and, in fact, what it's doing is creating an overlay of additional remedies which Congress did not decide to give. 
    I don't... I don't think that the Court should be in the position of furthering that, and certainly Congress can consider its... the effectiveness of this legislation in that area and also determine whether or not the need is there in other areas.

    Mr. Roger S. Kaplan 
    Well, I think Runyon was based on an incomplete analysis of the statute. 
    It had no independent analysis of its own. 
    It relied on Johnson which itself was a statute that... a case... excuse me... that was not briefed, that did not a thorough consideration of the case. 
    And Jones itself did not squarely deal... which was the earliest decision... with the 1870 to '74 period.

    Mr. Roger S. Kaplan 
    --I'm not expressing an opinion on that particularly. 
    I am saying that there's... there could be a problem of that rationale being exposed... and I think it would be... if this case were turned on the 1866 legislative history. 
    You know, I don't think I can address it much further. 
    I note that the rationale has started to run into some problems other than in this case, which is Title VII, and the Bondari type case which is on... I think it's still on petition here. 
    The Fifth Circuit has refused to apply this rationale, for example, to alienage discrimination. 
    And that may yet focus a broader concern. 
    I guess what's happening is that there's... there's an inevitable push, once you have this statute or endorse it, to keep broadening it. 
    And as this statute or the coverage of the statute becomes applicable in more and more areas, there are more and more decisions that have to be made.

    --Well, it's... the question... I guess the argument is prompted by the fact I believe that it is wrong. 
    If you're saying that it could be limited to its facts, that I suppose is a possibility. 
    I note in the Runyon case itself, though, you were immediately... having created this statute, you were immediately testing the constitutional limits, it seems, by having to deal with the problems of association and the problems of privacy. 
    I mean, this is what I think starts... starts getting to... to happen when you're starting to make this... these rules. 
    Congress might relieve you of that problem in dealing... in dealing... in making its own statute, but when you have to interpret what doesn't really apply to the situation, the Runyon opinion itself suggests that you may run into... create problems yourself that start approaching a constitutional dimension. 
    And that's what the discussion in that case seemed to--

    But the... the question is are we talking about limiting it to a particular institution or... namely, that that type of school... or are we talking about some broader areas. 
    And I don't know where you would... would draw the line with regard to that in view of the somewhat... the fits and starts that have appeared in this... in this legislative history. 
    I guess I would just like to... to finish up by mentioning that the types of issues that are coming up are specific and deal with... with problems that I think are better suited to legislative judgments in terms of their breadth, scope and type of remedy that has to be made, and that the Court should not perpetuate lawmaking in the guise of interpretation. 
    And I think that should provide the resolution for this case.

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Not in this instance from what we've heard and really from what we've looked at and what we submitted in our brief. 
    Second, I would ask the Court, in looking at this Act that's involved in the Patterson case in terms of what the Congress was trying to reach in 1866 and beyond, we're talking about a black person trying to work at a bank who was subjected to harassment and on working in conditions that make it unbearable for a black to survive. 
    This is an Act that Congress was trying to reach in 1866, and it's part of the contract that the 1866 statute reaches. 
    We're not asking for an extension of Runyon. 
    We're asking only that the Court apply the statute as Congress originally enacted it and as this Court has applied it. 
    When Congress looked at--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Chambers, certainly this is an extension of Runyon in the sense that in Runyon you're dealing with a one-shot deal: a black person is turned down for enrollment at a private school. 
    Here it's not a question of a refusal to hire a person; it's a question of the way the person is treated after they're hired. 
    It's a regular employment code that you're asking--

    --Your Honor, that's a... that is one way of looking at it, but we're looking at a black person trying to work on a job. 
    We're talking about a black person trying to get a job, trying to work with a contract. 
    And we're talking about--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --A black person trying to get a job fits much more readily under the terms of make and enforce a contract than a black person complaining of harassment on the job.

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    We're talking about a black person trying to work and make a living. 
    That's what Congress was trying to reach in 1866.

    But 1981 doesn't say the right to work and make a living. 
    It says the right to make and enforce contracts.
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="3446.824" stopTime="3521.764">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    The right to make the contract to allow one to work and make a living. 
    Look at... the legislative history talks about this. 
    And in Johnson, where the Court talked about the applicability of Runyon or 1981 to contractual matters in employment, there we had harassment on the job. 
    When Congress looked at the Runyon decision and the Johnson cases in 18... 1976, it cited cases that talked about harassment on the job, again, a proving of the decisions that the Courts had rendered. 
    So, we're not talking about any extension. 
    We're talking about the applicability of a statute designed to make it possible for a black person to work. 
    That's the heart of the matter, and that's what Congress was trying to reach with 1866 and what Runyon is trying to reach and what the cases subsequent to Runyon is trying to reach. 
    In 1976... 1972 and 1964 when Congress was enacting the Title VII or the Civil Rights Act of that time, it was looking at pervasive practices of discrimination, and it wanted to provide a remedy. 
    And it said it wanted to provide multiple remedies to make it possible for black people and other minorities to challenge this kind of discrimination.
