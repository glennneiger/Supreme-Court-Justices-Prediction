    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case, Goodyear Atomic Corporation versus Miller, is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of the Ohio and it involves Ohio workmen's compensation law which provides at an additional award for injuries resulting from a violation of a state safety regulation may be considered. 
    We hold that because the federal law provides clear authorization. 
    The Supremacy Clause does not bar this application, this provision of the Ohio law to the federal facilities. 
    Accordingly, the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court is affirmed. 
    Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice O'Connor has joined. 
    Justice Kennedy took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
