    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
    We hold here that this federal statute designated as 28 U.S.C. 1404(a), governs the enforceability of a contractual forum, the selection of that forum in diversity actions. 
    We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice O'Connor joined. 
    Also, Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.
