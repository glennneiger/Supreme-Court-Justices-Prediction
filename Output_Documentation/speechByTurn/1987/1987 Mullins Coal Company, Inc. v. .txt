    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinions of the Court to announce in three cases, and the first of this, 86-32, Mullins Coal Company versus The Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, we review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit regarding the burden of proof that the invocation stage of a Black Lung Benefits claim. 
    For the reasons stated in an opinion written by Justice Stevens for the Court, we agree with the Secretary of Labor and hold that a single item of qualifying evidence is not always sufficient to invoke the presumption rather a claimant must establish at least one of the five qualifying facts by a preponderance of the evidence. 
    Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Brennan joined.
