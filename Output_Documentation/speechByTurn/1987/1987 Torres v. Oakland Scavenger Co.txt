    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    Here, we hold that failure to file a Notice of Appeal in compliance with the specificity requirement of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c) presents a jurisdictional bar to that appeal. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion.
