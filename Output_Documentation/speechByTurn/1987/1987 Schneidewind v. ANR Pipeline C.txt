Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Company

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument this morning in Case No. 86-986, Eric Schneiderwind versus ANR Pipeline Company. 
    Mr. Keskey, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Don L. Keskey 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This case involves a review of two major holdings of the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit. 
    The first that Michigan Act 144, which regulates the securities of utilities and natural gas companies, is implicitly preempted by the Natural Gas Act because Congress had the purpose to deregulate securities of natural gas companies. 
    Secondly, for the opposite purpose that FERC was sufficiently regulating securities under its Section 7 certificate powers and thirdly because of what the Court viewed as an imminent possibility of conflict between Michigan Act 144 Securities Regulation and the Natural Gas Act. 
    In addition, the Court of Appeals found that Michigan Act 144 represented an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce on all tests, the per se of discrimination test, the balancing test of Pike v. Bruce Church and also on the basis of a need for national uniformity with respect to Securities regulation of natural gas companies. 
    In reaching these holdings, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals failed to follow this Court's preemption test, and failed to follow Congressional intent in the Natural Gas Act. 
    Congress, in the Natural Gas Act, did not occupy the whole field of natural gas regulation, it did not speak to Securities regulation whatsoever, it did not preempt the States from regulating securities by its silence in the NGA regarding this subject. 
    This Court has held extensively in Panhandle Eastern that the purpose of the NGA was to close regulatory gaps brought about by the prior decisions of this Court in a specific area, interstate transportation of gas and sales for resales. 
    It did not involve the area of Securities regulation of natural gas companies.

    One of the major purposes is to ensure that the extensive pipeline facilities and storage facilities, the property located within the State does not become over collateralized, the company doesn't become over capitalized so that the maintenance and the safety and environmental concerns regarding those facilities are not harmed. 
    Secondly, that there is reliable service to the public. 
    In large part, these are still monopoly companies, or at least oligopolies. 
    The service of natural gas the captive markets substantial markets in Michigan are very integral to the livelihood, the existence of the people in Michigan and to the economic development of the State.

    No, no, not whatsoever. 
    By protecting against financing abuses, and by protecting against over collateralization, you can ensure that service will be available at reasonable rates, that you will not get financing that will eventually end up being a burden on the company and would eventually harm service to Michigan at reasonable rates. 
    It's not an attempt to address rate making because we recognize fully that that is a function of FERC, and we intervene in rate cases at FERC, but it is to ensure that there is not an affect from financing actions which results in damage to the financial viability of both the natural gas assets and to the companies themselves.

    No, it does not. 
    And it does not look at the Key which Act 144 does, and that is what is the relationship between the capital and the value of the assets on the balance sheet and the good will of the business. 
    Neither FERC nor the SEC look at that. 
    Are these securities being issued for a lawful purpose, have they had their board resolutions passed, do they have their stockholders approve this, is it in accordance with the indenturers, are these companies going to engage in something like buy a baseball team or are they going to involve themselves in some illegal securities transactions.

    The obligations of the company are already issued and they're already binding. 
    But this is a peek at looking at the obligations before they're issued, before they become permanently binding on the company to see is this lawful, is this in the public interest, will Michigan be protected.

    Although in the facts of this case, this is a facial attack on the Statute. 
    We did have stipulated facts regarding these particular respondents who have 40 percent of Michigan's natural gas requirements are provided by these companies, 50 percent of their sales.

 What happens, Mr. Keskey, if the State does not allow a particular issuance of debt securities? 
 It says that the company would be over leveraged if this particular new facility should be financed by debt, so the company sells new stock on the market. 
 When it comes around to rate making by FERC, FERC decides that indeed the company has too much equity and should be drawing down more of its capital on the debt market which comes at a lower rate and will give lower rates to consumers. 
 What does the company do? 
 And therefore FERC disallows, disallows the return on the equity investment which the State required the company to go into instead of debt.

    Mr. Don L. Keskey 
    Michigan's review primarily looks at the relationship of the overall capital compared to the overall value of the property and the business. 
    That's where over capitalization comes in. 
    It's not the capital ratio, which you're talking about. 
    That's very indirect.

 I'm just saying, this is what happened for whatever reasons, Michigan did it. 
 Michigan says you cannot issue debt securities for this, you have to do it by stock. 
 And FERC says we think you should have been in debt equities instead at a lower rate of return, of course, and therefore, we're not going to allow you the normal rate of return on equity securities?

    I would presume in that situation that the Company would go to the Commission and present the rate decision of FERC which you're giving me an example of FERC providing a hypothetical requiring a hypothetical capital structure.

    Mr. Don L. Keskey 
    Hypothetical capital structures in the rate regulation business is very rare. 
    Most witnesses in rate cases will testify as to what the appropriate ratios are of equity to debt, and most companies, almost all companies that are utilities in the United States are within those reasonable ranges. 
    Now, if a company has more common equity than debt, the cost of common equity is normally higher, but the business risk is lower, and the economists will testify that the more equity you have, the lower cost you assign to it, because of this reflection of less business risk. 
    So you're on a teeter totter in a sense that if you have more and more equity, usually the economists in a rate case will assign lower and lower costs to that common equity so that it approaches debt. 
    Now, you've given me an example which first of all hypothetical capital structure is extremely rare.

    It's extremely difficult in a hypothetical and we're dealing here with a hypothetical that hasn't happened in the 78 years that the Michigan Act has been in effect. 
    To imagine all of the factual possibilities of how you would get to this, and those are important because there could be any of number of reasons why Michigan would act the way it did, and the way FERC acted the way it did.

    There is a theoretical possibility that Michigan... and it's most theoretical... that Michigan could require that no more debt be issued because the company was over capitalized or because it was issuing debts for an unlawful purpose, and FERC would have required them indirectly... not directly, indirectly... by not reflecting full rates for common equity, let's say, that there is this situation.

    Mr. Don L. Keskey 
    I think the best way to answer it is to give you an example of how Michigan used this statute to protect its local interests without affecting any interests that are national or involve interstate commerce. 
    And that is not a hypothetical but an actual case. 
    In 1981, ANR, the parent company, owned Michigan Consolidated Gas, which was a local utility. 
    The Michigan Public Service Commission, throughout its existence and in more recent years, has promoted in Michigan the development of vast natural gas storage fields which are huge caverns thousands of feet below where the gas can be stored in natural sea beds. 
    It provided recognition of that in rates and encouraged it through help with the local engineers and so forth, with the property owners, etcetera. 
    Many of these fields were developed and MichCon had its transmission lines to these wholly-in-State facilities, and MichCon had its lines between one part of its service area in Detroit and another part of its service territory in northern Michigan. 
    And ANR came up with a proposal to divest MichCon from its system. 
    But it wasn't going to just divest MichCon. 
    It was going to take for itself all of these storage facilities that the Michigan ratepayer had paid for and had developed. 
    It was going to take all of these transmission lines that connected the company together so that MichCon would be left as an orphan on the doorstep of the Michigan Public Service Commission as only a distribution utility with no ability to transport gas within the State to these storage facilities and to the rest of its service territory. 
    It would have to pay ANR for that right. 
    It would have to pay ANR to pay for the ability to transport gas to the rest of its company on facilities that it built itself, and that Michigan encouraged and that Michigan rate payers paid for. 
    And these storage facilities and these lines were not necessary to ANR's interstate system. 
    And if the storage was usable for any interstate purposes, MichCon was ready to lease those facilities its capacity to those interstate companies. 
    In fact, does so now with ANR. 
    So we used the statute because people were walking around saying, what's happening, we can't get any information. 
    What's happening is the fact that the parent company is going to strip our utility of all the assets that are valuable and leave everything that's not valuable on the backs of the Michigan public. 
    Now, we used this statute to start a proceeding to get information. 
    That was the only way we could get information. 
    FERC had no jurisdiction whatsoever because this involved no construction. 
    This involved a situation of financing transactions among ANR and MichCon that had nothing to do with any of FERC's powers, nothing to do with a Section 7 Certificate which is the only area where even respondents arguably say that Michigan and FERC both look at financing.

    We don't have an actual case. 
    If we did, we would have the advantage of citing to you the record. 
    But the situation was, it came down to the fact that this was the Statute that permitted Michigan to get information to find out what was happening to protect the dismemberment of a public utility that serves millions of customers in Michigan and is integral to the very economy of Michigan. 
    And we did so. 
    We reached a settlement. 
    Both sides were accommodated. 
    The ANR system was not harmed. 
    There were no national interests involved. 
    There was no FERC jurisdiction involved in terms of the securities, and there didn't have to be. 
    They didn't have to get approval from FERC to do this. 
    We preserved the Michigan utility as an entity, and by doing so, we saved costs, we saved rates. 
    The cost of that company to the customers would be much higher today if they would have been stripped.

    --The storage company has these vast facilities in Northern Michigan which have to be adequately maintained, they have to be adequately engineered, you can only put a certain amount of gas in these facilities, otherwise you can damage the cap rock, and have tremendously dangerous blowouts. 
    Or you could destroy the facility as a viable storage facility.

    Mr. Don L. Keskey 
    Well, the Michigan Commission does get involved in safety by assisting FERC as the eyes and ears of FERC with respect to safety requirements. 
    But we're looking at a way to prevent over capitalizations or the assets being over collateralized so that they would be neglected. 
    But there's another purpose, also, and that is that in the gas business, interstate transportation, when it goes from storage to customers, let's say in Montana, is done by displacement. 
    So what occurs is that this gas is stored in the center of Michigan, the storage company transports it to 24 miles to an interstate pipeline which does the transportation. 
    Storage has no interstate transportation, it doesn't sell any gas. 
    It doesn't have any transportation tariffs to be approved by FERC. 
    Gas molecules actually are used in Michigan. 
    They are part of the reliability of supply in Michigan, but the storage company delivers it to Michigan located interstate transportation which sells the molecules in Michigan. 
    And on the other end of its system in Montana, it gives an accounting credit to that person over there, and gives them the molecules over there. 
    So theoretically and conceptually, yes, there's interstate transportation if you go right from the beginning, right to Montana. 
    But it isn't done by ANR Storage. 
    It's done by an interstate company that FERC does regulate in terms of interstate rates. 
    Storage company's wholly in Michigan, the gas properties are in Michigan. 
    It does have an importance to supply even in Michigan because the displacement is basically an accounting type exchange. 
    And so if there's a failure of those facilities, it will affect Michigan not only in the viability of the facilities, but with respect to supply applications in Michigan. 
    So in conclusion, Your Honors, we have a vast area of regulation over here and over here. 
    The respondents have said there's potential conflict, only a possibility of conflict in this narrow area about Section 7 certificates. 
    We see there isn't. 
    But why deregulate securities with respect to all the rest of this area when there has been no actual conflict. 
    There is nothing in this record about any actual conflict in the 50 years that the NGA and the Act has survived together. 
    This is a facial attack, and Congress did not occupy the field of securities regulation it intended the States to continue to do so. 
    And it's not a burden on interstate commerce because we are focusing totally on Michigan's interests. 
    There is no discriminatory intent or effect in this Statute. 
    It never was passed for an economic protectionist purpose.

 Argument of Howard J. Trienens

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Keskey. 
    We'll hear now from you, Mr. Trienens.
speaker="howard_j_trienens" startTime="1733.302" stopTime="2020.231">
    Mr. Howard J. Trienens 
    Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    None of those 33 States regulate interstate pipelines. 
    Those 33 States were local distribution companies they were regulating, the local distribution company that also had some high pressure pipeline. 
    The concern of the States at the 1950 legislative amendment proposal... might as well straighten this one out the concern of the States was so broad, the FPC proposal was so broad that it brought under proposed FPC preissuance security regulation local distribution companies. 
    The States came screaming in and said, oh, no, we traditionally regulate the local distribution. 
    We traditionally do that. 
    It's these interstate pipelines like ANR that we don't regulate. 
    And as to what FPC does with that, that's their business, but for heaven's sakes, don't touch these local distribution companies. 
    So the FPC comes along, and it says, well, we'll amend our proposal, we'll amend our proposal. 
    We'll ask for this preissuance authority, this additional regulatory technique only for those companies and those operations that the States cannot reach. 
    Now, just to nail that down, let me give you two sentences out of that hearing where Commissioner Smith made it very plain that his proposed amended legislative proposal was not going to impair the State regulation of those gas companies that are essentially local, meaning, do local distribution. 
    But here's an example of a company that's clearly beyond the reach of the States as to securities matters. 
    The Commonwealth of Massachusetts regulating the securities of a pipeline operating at wholesale within the State of Massachusetts but carrying gas from Texas to Massachusetts. 
    They can't do that, and the States right proponents says, if that's the question, it cannot, we concede that. 
    And of course you have to concede that, because can anybody who... take 1925, when the Missouri v. Kansas Gas was decided. 
    Can anybody believe that these States could have regulated any aspect, securities or anything else, of these interstate pipelines when this Court held that these lines were "beyond State interference" or beyond the reach of State regulations. 
    Now, the Attleboro case which was electrics is a very different problem. 
    Justice Brandeis dissented in that. 
    It was a more localized problem. 
    Even there, the Court at that time said the States couldn't touch it. 
    That case is different, it's electric. 
    Congress in regulating interstate electric power provided expressly provided that States could regulate it. 
    That's a delegation of the States that Congress could have made when it broke its silence, it did make in the case of the interstate electrics, because after all, they're very localized really little grids around a few States, and they sharply distinguished that. 
    And instead of delegating to the States, they created a comprehensive Federal regulatory system. 
    And as far as we know, Michigan is the only State that an interstate gas pipeline of this character has any problems. 
    We serve Wisconsin almost as much as Michigan, and we have no such problem with Wisconsin, although they have a regulatory statute that permits a preissuance approval of securities as to utilities in Wisconsin, but it doesn't apply to this company. 
    Now, the premise of this argument of Michigan is that somehow financing and securities are unregulated. 
    That there's some big gap that has to be filled here. 
    And I'd like to show the Court that that gap doesn't exist. 
    And it's a combination of regulatory tools, the first of which is the certification power. 
    In order to have a project you're going to finance, you have to go to the FPC, FERC now, get a certificate of public convenience and necessity before you can finance it. 
    For example, we want to build a pipeline extension in Wisconsin, say a $75 million one, and we have to go to FERC and get a certificate. 
    And while we're there, because Congress made it very express that Congress was speaking to securities regulation, in 1942, Congress expressly authorized FERC to condition its approval of certificates and to modify the financing as the public interest might demand. 
    So we go down to the FERC and we say, all right, its going to not only cost $75 million but we're going to raise $25 million through equity and we're going to have a $50 million bond issue. 
    That's the way, that's our financing plan, and we get the certificate, and this certificate power along with the rate power is described by this Court as the heart of the Act.

    --The only business that these two entities before the Court, Pipeline and Storage are in, are the transportation and storage of natural gas. 
    They do nothing else, they intend to do nothing else. 
    And our companies have done a lot of diversifying. 
    We've bought coal mines, we've bought truck companies. 
    But we never do it at the FERC regulated corporate level. 
    We do it through the holding company. 
    Bear in mind, these two entities are a long way from any company that holds public stock. 
    The public holds stock in a company called Coastal, a Delaware corporation with offices in Texas, Coastal has a holding company that owns ANR which is a holding company, and only then do you get the ANR Pipelining Corporation and ANR Storage Company.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Certainly some of the corporate interrelationships in the days of Samuel Insull and so forth caused concern among lots of people. 
    It wasn't just buying a baseball team, but it was the loan structure and debt structure from the parent to the subsidiary. 
    I don't think that's an unreasonable concern on the part of the State.
speaker="howard_j_trienens" startTime="2191.821" stopTime="2425.136">
    Mr. Howard J. Trienens 
    The Public Utility Holding Company Act, when the company is subject to it, did deal with those matters. 
    It's true that somebody, either Congress or the States, has a highly legitimate interest in worrying about over leveraging, over capitalization, all the evils, all the financial evils of the Insull era. 
    And here's how it works. 
    As to the certification power, the FERC looks at the initial financing proposal. 
    As to the rate making power, the debt equity ratio is a crucial part of that. 
    Now, it is true that it is only rare that the FERC exercises that power to grant rates that impute a different capital structure. 
    And the reason it's rate is that FERC has made its standards so widely known that you don't dare go otherwise. 
    You're not going to finance it in a way you know is going to get in trouble with FERC so you always keep within a reasonable bounds because FERC makes you. 
    That takes care of over leveraging. 
    Now, over capitalization which, if you read the Michigan Supreme Court decisions, you'd think is the principal evil. 
    Just what is it. 
    And the Michigan Supreme Court correctly defines over capitalization as did counsel. 
    It's a lack of correlation between the debt and equity on the liability side with the amount or value of the property. 
    That's the problem, lack of correlation. 
    Used to call it watered stock, same problem. 
    That cannot happen under a FERC regulated company, and the reason is, apart from certification, apart from rate making, FERC regulates the accounting, and if there's anyone in this world it was Charlie Smith, the head of the Bureau of Accounts of the FPC, who was the most vigilant original cost proponent and insisted on original cost accounting. 
    So the assets all have to be at original cost net and the liabilities debt and equity has to balance and there cannot be over capitalization on a FERC regulated company. 
    It cannot happen. 
    Now, there's one other thing. 
    They say, what if there were financial ruin. 
    Well, if there's financial ruin, there's something wrong at FERC because one of their duties is not only to protect rate payers but to have a financially healthy entity. 
    But if something goes wrong and there is financial trouble, you have to go to FERC to get an abandonment order. 
    You can't just stop serving people in Michigan. 
    You have to go to FERC to abandon service no matter what your financial situation is. 
    So in all elements, FERC regulates these securities. 
    Here's where the problem comes in. 
    The problem comes in after you get a FERC certificate. 
    And here you are, you've told them you're going to raise $50 million in bonds to finance this FERC certificated project. 
    Now, what do you do. 
    You go to your investment banker in New York, and they advise you on timing and placement. 
    As far as placement's concerned, it could be domestic, it could be a Eurobond deal. 
    Our last offering was a $50 million equivalent of Swiss francs, not registered, so nobody in this country could buy it, Michigan or anybody else. 
    Nobody could buy it here. 
    And then the other problem whether it's domestic or foreign is the timing. 
    The timing is everything in financing. 
    You go to these investment bankers and they say, oh, wait a minute. 
    Hold up a month or two. 
    We think interest rates are going up, and you'll save a couple of basis points. 
    Or, get it our right away, we think interest rates are going up. 
    And the timing is everything in this, and that's exactly where this Michigan statute intrudes on the Federal process. 
    Because Michigan says, you've got to come trotting in with your $50 million proposal to issue securities to finance a FERC certificated project.

    Mr. Howard J. Trienens 
    Or the company can go to Europe, or the company can decide not to sell in Michigan, or the company can get a Blue Sky which is a very automatic thing. 
    But the Michigan investors are clearly protected by the Michigan Blue Sky laws. 
    They don't need any protection to the Swiss buying this issue. 
    They're protected by that. 
    They don't need this statute to protect that interest. 
    That's the point. 
    But no matter where the issue is, and no matter how urgent the timing, the Michigan Commission is here insisting that they have a right to have the securities blocked until there's an affirmative order by the Commission. 
    Now, with timing being everything, sure, lots of times, they'll come in and issue it in three weeks, so you know, so you've got some expense. 
    You've got expense of preparing the application, you've got a filing fee. 
    All of that is in our view unconstitutional, but that isn't the real evil here. 
    The real evil is they just don't approve it. 
    Or they set it for hearing, which is the same thing as not approving it. 
    And the hearing can go on, or the hearing never gets set. 
    We had one that I'll give you in a minute that went on for a year. 
    Why do they do this? 
    What interest does Michigan have? 
    And I can speculate on a lot of local interests that they could try, collateral unrelated local interests that they could try to invoke and try to pressure ANR by just holding the securities hostage. 
    But let me give you an actual and it's the same incident, but not quite the same story as you were told about. 
    It's the divestiture of Michigan Consolidated by ANR, the parent. 
    Now, bear in mind, there's two quite separate sets of securities here. 
    One set has to do with the divestiture and at record 118 and 123, the Michigan Commission wanted to investigate that, and they got out orders to investigate it. 
    The orders were directed at MichCon. 
    That's the company the regulate. 
    They were directed at MichCon. 
    They asked ANR to come along and participate, and we did. 
    But the orders were directed at MichCon and properly so. 
    Now, over here in a totally unrelated transaction, FERC had issued certificates to enable Storage to expand its storage facilities and pipelines, $105 million, some such amount. 
    In order to get the underwriter's counsel to go along with it, they had to either get a Court order saying this Michigan Statute didn't apply, or go get an order proving these securities. 
    So we go over to the Commission. 
    We file a nice routine application, and while this is going on, this wholly unrelated construction approved by FERC, financing approved by FERC, nothing to do with the divestiture fight that's going on over here about who gets which assets. 
    So what does the Commission do? 
    It holds hostage the storage application. 
    And you'll find--

    This is a facial attack, isn't it, Mr. Trienens. 
    I mean, it isn't what might have happened in a particular situation. 
    You're saying the statute is just unconstitutional however Michigan applies it?
speaker="howard_j_trienens" startTime="2629.218" stopTime="2734.652">
    Mr. Howard J. Trienens 
    --That's correct, and I'm also saying that we're not speculating about it because this club in the closet... to use a phrase in the reply brief... has been taken out of the closet and we still feel the bruises from it. 
    So this is not a hypothetical case I'm talking about, it is facial. 
    The statute is wrong on its face as applied to this company. 
    I'm saying that this example they give of how wonderful it was for Michigan proves the point that they use it for unrelated purposes, they hold hostage these securities necessary to finance a FERC authorized project, and they'll hold it up until they get what they want. 
    You'll find that the record stipulates that the way we got the certificate for storage was by settling the other case. 
    And November 24, 1981, happens to be the date we made our deal with the State and happens to be the date that they let this security out of hostage and approved it. 
    It was part of that deal and it was putting leverage on us. 
    Now, let's look on the facial part of this Statute to the future. 
    We have a stipulation in the record of what this statute means to Michigan. 
    And the stipulation at record page 60 says that, even without regulatory authority that they have all over these other local utilities, the Michigan Commission can still exert influence over pipeline and storage if it has the right to regulate the security issuances. 
    They can still exert influence. 
    That's what this is about. 
    Now, let me give you an example of what they have in mind for the future. 
    And in their brief at page 5, note 3, they tell you. 
    They tell you that what they're interested in here, and why they want this statute, and bear in mind the club in the closet routine,--

    --It seems to me it's an argument when they say, oh, this is facial and you're speculating and we come and petition this Court because they're just speculating about things to tell you not only what they did with this Statute, but what they plan to do with it. 
    And this is what they say in their brief. 
    They want this Statute because it provides an opportunity for the Michigan Commission to assure that ANR does not violate the divestiture settlements. 
    Now, the divestiture settlements they're talking about are the same settlements... and I was going to say, blackjacked out of us... but I'll honor the nomenclature they now use... these are the same settlements they clubbed out of us before, and how instead of enforcing those settlements which are agreements, actual signed agreements, instead of enforcing those agreements the old fashioned way by going to court to sue on the contract, they want this club to hit us over the head to make sure we honor whatever interpretation they want to place on it. 
    That's what this case is about. 
    It's the only use they have for it. 
    But they've got so used to using it on us, they want to keep it. 
    Now, that's not a legitimate use. 
    And I agree with everything that's said that these examples are not necessary. 
    Maybe we showed the wounds too badly but with or without these examples, past and future, this is a plain flat out violation of the Commerce clause. 
    Now, we cited not only the 1925 cases but the case last year in Brown-Forman and there's a two-tiered test and this doesn't make it past tier one. 
    Because, as the Court said, it's a violation, you can't require a company to seek regulatory approval in one State before undertaking a transaction in another. 
    You can't make us go to Michigan to get approval to finance securities to build something in the Gulf. 
    It's a violation of the Commerce clause. 
    And although there's only one State doing this now, what's to stop Wisconsin, if this Court says this is grand for Michigan, why shouldn't Wisconsin do it. 
    They've got as much interest. 
    Milwaukee's almost as big as Detroit. 
    They've got almost as much interest. 
    Why invite them to have a races to vie with each other as to how much they can extract from ANR? 
    What's the point of that? 
    Now, it's really unnecessary in our view under the Commerce Clause to get to the second balancing test, but if you were to get there and the Court below is correct, what interest do they have? 
    They cite in their reply brief from the Michigan Supreme Court saying that securities regulation serves the interest of the rate payers in assuring continued service and in receiving that service at reasonable rates. 
    The rates are just and reasonable as fixed by the FERC. 
    They can't discontinue service without going to the FERC. 
    Storage doesn't even handle gas that's burned in Michigan.

    So far.

    We have raised both points. 
    The Court below agreed on both points. 
    But as to the Commerce Clause, we think there's no interest. 
    As I said, the over capitalization theme which the Michigan Courts and counsel stress, that cannot happen under FERC regulations, and interests of investors is totally taken care of. 
    So the Commerce Clause test and the so-called preemption test really somewhat overlap in this area because of the history. 
    It was so clear from the Missouri v. Kansas Gas and related decisions that in 1938 by the time Congress go around to breaking its silence, it was so clear that the States could not interfere, the power of regulation could not reach these kind of companies, that Congress came in and they occupied the field. 
    This is not a preemption case like Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator where the States had long been traditionally regulating grain elevators since Mond v. Illinois. 
    All of a sudden Congress comes in in that case with a non-comprehensive statute, Warehouse Act, and the question is whether they had preempted longstanding State regulation. 
    This is not what this is about at all. 
    The purpose of this Statute, as this Court has said a dozen times, is to occupy the field in which the Supreme Court has held the States may not act. 
    And that's clearly this company and this field and this activity. 
    And having occupied the field, having decided to in that comprehensive regulation instead of just delegating it to the States and staying silent, its all occupied by the FERC authority. 
    Now, this preissuance approval, as I said, is just one regulatory tool of many. 
    And when the Statute I mentioned earlier, the FPC proposal, had been narrowed down to whether the FERC should be given this added power, the focusing on that issue, the parties came in, the industry came in and said, who needs it. 
    They don't need it. 
    They've got plenty. 
    They've got certification, they've got regulation of rates, they've got the accounting. 
    Who needs it. 
    And Congress didn't act. 
    It was perfectly obvious they weren't persuaded that FERC needed this additional power. 
    But whether they thought they did or not, Congress had occupied the field that this Court had said the States could not enter. 
    The Court had drawn a bright line as the Court has put it. 
    Congress occupied the field from a bright line that the States couldn't occupy and Congress occupied this field and therefore it's preempted. 
    Now, bear in mind while this is a facial attack on this Statute, it has no affect, no affect on the application of this Statute to the local distribution companies as to which the States always could act. 
    This case has nothing to do with that. 
    It only applies to this one State and applies to ANR which doesn't to any end user business in Michigan and is about as clear and clean and purely exclusively an interstate company as you'll ever find.

 Well, then suppose we disagree with you on preemption that Congress never intended to preempt this kind of thing, but nevertheless, it violates the Commerce Clause, a dormant Commerce Clause?

   Rebuttal of Don L. Keskey

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Trienens. 
    Mr. Keskey, you have one minute left.
speaker="don_l_keskey" startTime="3263.413" stopTime="3350.952">
    Mr. Don L. Keskey 
    Your Honor, this is a facial attack. 
    There has been no problem with Michigan's Act. 
    We are at a disadvantage to argue from a record that doesn't exist with respect to either interstate commerce or preemption. 
    The burden of proof is on Respondents. 
    We have no record. 
    Secondly, look at Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator. 
    That takes care of Your Honor's rate question because in that we have an analogous situation where this Court preserved the securities regulation even though the Federal Government took over all other aspects including rates. 
    And it found the purposes that the State could continue. 
    Interstate Commerce, there's no discriminatory affect, no discriminatory purpose. 
    The Congress itself has recognized that uniformity's not necessary with securities regulation over interstate utilities. 
    It has done so in Federal Power Act 204. 
    How are you going to distinguish in any rational sense interstate natural gas companies from interstate electric companies when those two Acts grew out of the same purpose, the same history. 
    And this Court has interchangeably interpreted both Acts. 
    Congress when it passed the Natural Gas Act displayed a willingness to allow the States to regulate securities because it provided for no preemption. 
    You don't have preemption by silence. 
    And Congress recognized that the States could regulate securities, uniformity was not required.
