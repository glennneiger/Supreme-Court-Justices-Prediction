    Justice Byron R. White 
    In this case the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed with the District Court at an arbitration award under collective bargaining contract should be set aside because it was contrary to what the Court of Appeals considered to be public policy. 
    For the reasons stated in an opinion on file with the Clerk, we unanimously hold that the Court of Appeals exceeded its authority in entering its judgment, and hence, its judgment must be reversed. 
    Justice Blackmun has file a concurring opinion in which Justice Brennan has joined.
