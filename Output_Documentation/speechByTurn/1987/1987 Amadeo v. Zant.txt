    Mr. Stephen B. Bright 
    Right about on the Nat Line, Your Honor. 
    And at the start of the penalty phase of Mr. Amadeo's trial, the prosecutor, the district attorney said that you probably couldn't find a fair jury anywhere in the State of Georgia than you could find in Putman County. 
    Of course, he was the only one who knew at the time he made that statement that he had earlier that same year directed the jury commissioners in Putnam County to underrepresent black people and women in the master jury lists from which Tony Amadeo's grand jury and trial juries were chosen. 
    It was unknown that at that time he had put forward this plan, these instructions to the jury commission for the purpose of making it appear that racial discrimination had been eliminated while actually perpetuating racial discrimination and discrimination on the basis of gender and insulating it from judicial review. 
    Ten months after Mr. Amadeo's trial this scheme came to light when another lawyer in another case inadvertently came across it. 
    He attempted to raise it to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
    That Court rejected his claim, saying it came too late. 
    He later presented it to the District Court below, and that court granted habeas corpus relief, finding cause that the claim was not reasonably available to Mr. Amadeo and his lawyers at the time because it was concealed and unknown to them because of the district attorney's deception.

    The ultimate jury. 
    Now, of course, the lawyers said that what they did was, they got the venue list, that is, the people chosen from the master list for the petit jury in that trial, and they looked at that before trial, and saw that there were women and black people represented there. 
    Of course, that's exactly what the district attorney's scheme was designed to accomplish.

    Mr. Stephen B. Bright 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I will be happy to. 
    First of all, the lawyer's testimony which we were talking about there and relates to this point is that they liked that particular jury. 
    What the District Court had that directly contradicted that was all the contemporaneous evidence, the first thing being, Your Honor, the fact that the lawyers filed a motion to continue this case October the 27th and filed an affidavit saying that there was so much prejudice against Mr. Amadeo and his co-defendants that the trial should not be held until the next term of court, which would have been before a different jury. 
    In addition, the lawyers filed a motion for a change of venue which was litigated right through the jury selection process, and they argued in that motion that a large portion of the jurors had an opinion about the guilt of Mr. Amadeo and therefore that they should not try the case before that particular jury. 
    These lawyers only filed three motions prior to trial. 
    Those were two of the three motions, which were to get another jury at another time. 
    In their brief to the Georgia Supreme Court, and this is in the Joint Appendix, and I would point the court to Pages 16 to 18, and I might mention to respond to the Chief Justice on the page cites--

    Mr. Stephen B. Bright 
    Well, if it's a different position, the fact that it was taken after the trial may be an explanation for it, but it is a contradiction. 
    It was one of those contradictions that the District Court had to resolve in making its factfinding. 
    I'm not saying that there's not a plausible view of the evidence that can be taken in the state's brief or in the Eleventh Circuit opinion, but the District Court is entrusted with the factfinding responsibility under Rule 2, and the District Court not only considering the things that I've talked about but also considering the testimony of the lawyers at the time they found out, ten months later after this trial when this district attorney's involvement in limiting the black people and women on the juries first came to light, the testimony of the two lawyers then of the shock, the statements that the claim would have been brought had it been known, and the fact that--

    "Mr. Jernigan, do you recall Mr. Lambert ever saying, if I had known about this jury issue prior to trial I would have raised it. " 
    and then on the next page, 
    "Yes, I recall that. " 
    "He said it would have been a great issue, I would have raised it if I'd known about it. " 
    And again, the Eleventh Circuit in Footnote 9 of its opinion acknowledged a direct conflict in the testimony here. 
    What the District Court under Rule 52(a) was required to do was to look at the totality of the circumstances, not just what one lawyer testified to ten years after the fact, but to look at the totality of the circumstances. 
    The contemporaneous evidence, I would submit, indicates support for the District Court's finding.

    And I would point as well as another basis for the District Court's finding, without going through each part of it, the brief that was filed in the Georgia Supreme Court at pages 16 to 18 of the Joint Appendix, with regard to how this claim was first found and what the lawyer did upon finding it, and with regard, Justice O'Connor, to the question about deliberate bypass, I think, as the District Court found, the evidence in this case was that once this was discovered, once the prosecutor's actions here were discovered, it was immediately presented to the state courts as promptly as it could possibly have been presented, and the Georgia Supreme Court declined to entertain the claim, but that these lawyers basically did all that they could possibly do. 
    I would point out that when the District Court heard this it took into account the briefs and the continuance motion which were marked and made a part of the evidence, all of that was part of the factfinding process, and I would suggest that under Anderson versus Bessemer City, Pullman-Standard, and the other cases that this Court has decided, that the Eleventh Circuit could not reject that factfinding without making a finding that it was clearly erroneous, and I would point out--

speaker="stephen_b_bright" startTime="935.567" stopTime="1214.517">
    Mr. Stephen B. Bright 
    Well, two points on that. 
    First of all, whatever... and I think the District Court considered this because he asked them something about the nature of that challenge. 
    Whatever it was they decided was not the claim that is presented here, because they didn't know about it. 
    They did not make a knowing tactical decision based on all the available information, because the information was hidden from them. 
    In fact, the whole nature of this plan was to deceive them into thinking that there was sufficient representation of women and blacks, that this really wasn't worth wasting the time on to try to raise a challenge like this. 
    But secondly, I think, given the passage of time and all the other factors that the District Court could take into consideration, looking at the totality of the circumstances, it did resolve this conflict in the testimony by finding that they would have raised the claim. 
    And I would suggest that based upon all the points that I have gone through, that finding is supported by the record. 
    And again, I think the question under Rule 52(a), is that a plausible reading of the record, are the District Court's factfindings plausible, and I would submit that they certainly are, and that they are not clearly erroneous, and that the Eleventh Circuit, the key errors that the Eleventh Circuit made here was in rejecting the finding that it was clearly erroneous... excuse me, rejecting it without making the finding that it was clearly erroneous, and of course since it is supported by the record, it can't be done, and I would point out as well that nowhere has the state in either the Eleventh Circuit or before this Court argued that the factfindings of the District Court are clearly erroneous. 
    And I think besides the one which we have touched upon or talked about, the tactical decision argument that the state has made based upon that selective use of Mr. Pryor's testimony, two other factfindings are critical, one, the discriminatory purpose of the plan, which really had not been contested until we got to this Court, and then second the concealment point, and I would like to just talk briefly about each of those, if I may. 
    For the first time in this Court the state says these are target figures, and at one point in their brief they even say there is no evidence as to the author, the purpose, or to whom this plan was submitted, and I just want to make it clear the evidence is uncontradicted. 
    The clerk of the court, Mr. Dennis, testified that he received the note from the district attorney to the jury commissioners for the purpose of telling them how many blacks, women, and young people were to be put on the master jury lists. 
    He as secretary of the commission communicated this knowledge to the chairman, and the testimony was that they followed it. 
    And indeed in the District Court the state conceded, and I quote, 
    "intentional discrimination on the uncontroverted evidence that was produced in Bailey versus Vining. " 
    which was the case in which this scheme first came to light, and of course the District Court findings in both the Bailey case and the District Court findings below in this case are that it was a plan to bring about intentional discrimination with the purpose of avoiding a prima facie case to set the level of discrimination at just such a place that it would insulate it from judicial review, and therefore deny litigants the opportunity to challenge it and be successful. 
    Really, the fundamental question, it seems, on this case, is who put this case in the posture that it is in today? 
    Why is this claim brought to the District Court after the pretrial hearings and after the trial in state court? 
    And the answer to that has to be the district attorney in this case. 
    There is a lot of argument about whether the lawyers... what they wanted to do or should have looked have looked for a needle in a haystack over at the clerk's office, but the fact of the matter is, the district attorney knew exactly what had happened. 
    He could have stood up at arraignment and said, I just want to put on the record I have instructed the jury commission to underrepresent black people and women in the master list, and once everyone recovered from the shock, you would assume that the same thing would have happened there that happened when this came out in Bailey versus Vining before the District Court, and the District Court said, stop trying people for criminal cases until you revise your jury list there, because what you are doing is patently unconstitutional. 
    With regard to the concealment point, again, using this Court's language in the--

    Their testimony was, we wanted this jury, but they filed a continuance motion in which they indicated they did not want that jury. 
    They filed a motion for a venue in which they said there was so much prejudice in that jury that they didn't want to be tried before that jury. 
    So there is direct contradiction, as the Eleventh Circuit noted in Footnote 9, between those two versions, and that was for the District Court to resolve.

    They thought they might spend that month before trial trying to put together some sort of statistical challenge.

    He set out in one position how many blacks to put on the grand jury, and in another part of that same little note how many to put on the traverse, and the same thing for women, right to the very number. 
    And with regard... I just... there has been some question raised about whether this was... this memorandum, which was nothing but just a yellow sheet from a legal pad type thing that had just been torn out, and if you just look at it... it is set out in the Joint Appendix on about Page 3 or 4, it is nothing but a collection of numbers and initials and a few words, and it really has no legal significance, just to look at it. 
    The District Court, of course, found that this had been concealed. 
    There is no reason for lawyers to know about it. 
    The Eleventh Circuit again rejected that factfinding, made its own factfinding that this crumbled sheet of yellow paper was readily discoverable, and I would point out the support for the District Court's finding first of all and most fundamentally is in Georgia law. 
    All the proceedings of a jury commission in Georgia are secret. 
    The jury commissioners take an oath not to disclose anything. 
    The only thing that is available after the jury commission meets is a certified copy of the master list.

speaker="stephen_b_bright" startTime="1656.566" stopTime="1770.739">
    Mr. Stephen B. Bright 
    I think what the record clearly shows, though, is that the way in which this memorandum came out was totally fortuity and inadvertent. 
    Somebody went who was working on a claim that the at large voting procedures in the county violated the Constitution, was looking for a history of discrimination, went through 30 years of jury lists, and the state indicates in there that this memorandum was with this master jury list. 
    There is absolutely no support in the record for that. 
    He said somewhere in 30 years of documents this yellow sheet is there. 
    Obviously somebody in the clerk's office didn't realize that this wasn't for public consumption, but the fact that somebody's not very good at hiding the plan does not mean that it is readily discoverable. 
    First of all, Mr. Amadeo's lawyers had no earthly reason to go over there and look for it. 
    The work product of the jury commission under Georgia law is secret. 
    It is not available. 
    The only thing you can get is the list. 
    Secondly, there was no basis for them to know that the district attorney in that case was not complying with Georgia law, federal law, the United States Constitution, the ethics of prosecutors, which say that he is to have no role at all in telling the jury commission how to go about its work, but certainly no role in telling them how to limit the participation of cognizable groups on the jury. 
    So there was no reason for them to go to the clerk's office and look for this needle in a haystack because they had no reason to know that it existed in the first place. 
    And finally, again, as I was pointing out earlier, just the nature of the plan itself was such that obviously, if you publish the fact that you are about discriminating on purpose, that plan is not going to survive for very long. 
    The whole nature of the plan was to discriminate, hide the discrimination from public view, insulate the discrimination from judicial review, and deny defendants any chance to challenge it. 
    That couldn't possibly be accomplished if it was public knowledge. 
    If there are no other questions, I will reserve the rest of my time.

    Thank you, Mr. Bright. 
    Ms. Boleyn, we will hear from you now. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Susan V. Boleyn
speaker="susan_v_boleyn" startTime="1774.310" stopTime="1956.537">
    Ms. Susan V. Boleyn 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the existence of the memo which has been the subject of great discussion before this Court and the lower courts is only relevant in the context of this particular case if the memorandum played some part in the strategy decision that petitioner's trial attorneys made, so the pivotal inquiry for this Court to make is what the attorneys knew, when they knew it, and what important factors they knew about the grand jury that called them to make the decision to forego the challenge. 
    The overall strategy of the trial attorneys was to attempt to avoid the imposition of the death penalty on Mr. Amadeo. 
    Mr. Amadeo had confessed, and they had him dead to rights. 
    The only thing they could do would try to be to obtain a sympathetic jury who would not impose the death penalty. 
    In order to do this, of course, under Georgia law the only thing they really needed to try to concentrate on was to get one sympathetic person, because the death penalty has to be unanimous in Georgia, so their whole trial strategy throughout the entire proceeding was to attempt to avoid the death penalty. 
    They didn't just blindly try to do this, though. 
    They went and investigated the actual traverse jury list to determine if there were people on that list who would be beneficial to them for the purpose of avoiding the death penalty. 
    They went to local attorney Dallas Veal, who had practiced in this particular county for a very long time, and they went over name by name the people on the list to determine their characteristics and, as Mr. Lambert said, any significant factor that these particular jurors might have with reference to trying to avoid the death penalty. 
    They went over the fact of their age, their sex, any job that they might have, and of course tried to determine their church preference based on some other particular factors they were trying to get. 
    One of the major reasons they believed and relied upon the jury as being beneficial to Mr. Amadeo is the fact that there was an active religious charismatic group in Putnam County that had a very large following, and in fact some of the members of that church had actually visited the petitioner in jail prior to his trial, and of course because of their conscientious objection to the death penalty and because of their sympathy toward the defendant, the attorneys both said that they wanted these people to be on the actual jury that would be drawn for the trial jury. 
    Another consideration that they had, of course, was that the district attorney had served notice prior to trial that they would introduce other crimes, and the victims of the other crimes in Alabama were black persons. 
    There was violence against black persons. 
    there was a beating and a murder and a robbery of these black persons, and the attorneys feared that a jury which contained numerous black people might be unsympathetic to the 19-year-old white defendant. 
    Not only this, they wanted to select jurors for the traverse array who might have children the same age as the petitioner or who might be mothers. 
    They felt they would be more lenient. 
    Having looked at this 120 people name by name with another local attorney, both Mr. Lambert and Mr. Pryor said, and I quote, 
    "We feel very comfortable with the jury. " 
    "We felt like we had a very good jury. "

    --Right, but the crucial thing, of course, is that the memorandum didn't cause them not to make the challenge. 
    If they had gone and looked at the numbers and said, it's a close case, maybe we shouldn't file it because it's a close case, then you might have some interference between the memo and the attorneys' decision, but what they did was, saying, we're assuming that we can successfully challenge both the grand and traverse jury lists, and of course the only thing they could gain from that was not an acquittal of the defendant, and not an attempt to avoid the death penalty. 
    The only thing they could gain was delay.

    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    My point is, I think, that they're not incompatible. 
    The filing for the motion for continuance and the decision not to challenge the array are not incompatible. 
    I mean, trial attorneys often file numerous motions to protect various rights that they may need as the time goes by, and of course the essential point is on the motion for change of venue is that the motion for change of venue was not ruled on until after voir dire was completed. 
    So what they were essentially doing was hedging their bets and seeing if the beneficial jury they believed that they had had any fixed opinions, they'd still be able to take them off based on a motion for change of venue or exclusion on the peremptory challenges. 
    So they carried through with their actual strategy of trying to obtain a beneficial jury both in the way that they conducted voir dire and the way that they preserved all their motions until after the voir dire had been completed.

    Ms. Susan V. Boleyn 
    --Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. 
    The attorneys went through a weighing process in deciding whether or not to challenge the master grand and traverse jury lists. 
    What they did was weigh the advantages they could gain, which were solely delay, versus the advantage they could gain if they stay with the beneficial jury that they have. 
    Essentially what they did was say that a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush, and of course they were operating on the assumption that they would win. 
    As Mr. Pryor testified, we will gain delay if we win. 
    On the other hand, we had already been through these juries that we had, jurors that we had one at a time. 
    We balanced these two factors and decided not to. 
    He also indicated that he was afraid we would 
    "wind up in worse shape than we were. " 
    so he made the strategic decision that the most beneficial jury to this particular defendant could be obtained from the list that had already been drawn up and from the actual list that he had been provided.

    Your Honor, the bases for the District Court's opinion were these. 
    First, they found it was reasonable for the attorneys not to have known of the memorandum, and that, of course, was not a clearly erroneous assumption of fact. 
    But the major clearly erroneous fact that the District Court found in finding cause was that there was concealment and that the concealment played a part in the tactical decision that the attorney made. 
    The Eleventh Circuit overturned that finding as being clearly erroneous and found that the memorandum was readily discoverable, and because it was discoverable the attorneys chose not to go and look for it, and chose to rely on their assumption that the challenge would be successful, that there really was essentially no nexus between the memorandum and its concealment or nonconealment and the attorneys' decision not to challenge--

    Ms. Susan V. Boleyn 
    --Your Honor, in the first order of the District Court we contend the filing findings are clearly erroneous. 
    At Joint Appendix Page 79, Judge Owen says the failure to assert the issue at trial was not deliberate. 
    We contend that that is clearly erroneous. 
    The second finding on JA79 of the first order is that he said the attorneys were justified in assuming that the attack upon the jury would be futile. 
    In fact, they did not believe it would be futile. 
    They believed it would be successful, and that finding is clearly erroneous. 
    Finally, on JA80 the court said that it was a miscarriage of justice to overlook the intentional act of underrepresentation based solely on the rule of procedure, and of course that is a mixed question of fact and law that we say is clearly erroneous. 
    With respect to the second order of the District Court, the District Court said from a cause standpoint it was reasonable for Lambert and Pryor at the time they were appointed to not challenge the list. 
    Of course, the reasons why it was reasonable are our assertions. 
    We disagree with the District Court on what the reasons for not challenging it were, but we don't contest the reasonableness of their decision overall. 
    The other two findings that we contend were clearly erroneous is Judge Owen's finding on JA92 that if they had known of the memorandum they would have challenged the box. 
    We contend that--

    Ms. Susan V. Boleyn 
    --Your Honor, a fact can be clearly erroneous even if there is some evidence to support it. 
    The only evidence to support the District Court's finding was hearsay testimony. 
    We say that that is clearly erroneous in the light of the attorney's direct testimony, which did not include the statement that if they had known about the memo that they would have raised it, so that finding is clearly erroneous. 
    Even if it is supported, allegedly supported by hearsay testimony, that is still a clearly erroneous finding by the District Court.

    Ms. Susan V. Boleyn 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In light of Mr. Coates' testimony, the person that found it, the question was specifically put to him whether he thought he would have recognized it if he wasn't making a broad-based attack on the jury discrimination system. 
    He said, yes, I think I would have known about it anyway. 
    He only had one year experience at the time that he found it. 
    Mr. Pryor and Mr. Lambert had 25 years of experience. 
    So he did recognize what the memo had of significance even though he happened to be making a review of it in the broad sense. 
    I think to an attorney examining the master jury list, the relevant document for purposes of challenge, they would have recognized the significance of it. 
    If it had been contained in an irrelevant public source, then that might be a whole different question. 
    They didn't have to subpoena the records. 
    The clerk voluntarily gave them, pointed him to it, and he even said, Mr. Coates testified that when he went and took the memorandum to Mr. Dennis, the clerk, that the clerk said, yes, that's what it is. 
    He confirmed that it came from the solicitor's office to the jury commissioners, to Mr. Coates. 
    So not only was there no state interference with it, but they in fact confirmed what it was. 
    If they had really wanted to conceal the document they should have left it in the district attorney's office under lock and key, but instead it is with the relevant public document, so that any attorney making any kind of challenge to the jury in Putnam County has access to that document as well as any other person.

    Ms. Susan V. Boleyn 
    --I think the point to be made about that is first of all that the record is not as complete as the petitioner says that it is. 
    What the record shows is that the memorandum came, was sent from the solicitor's office to Mr. Dennis, who was the clerk of the jury commissioner, and it was given to the jury commission itself by the clerk, and Mr. Dennis did say that the members of the jury commission to his knowledge attempted to comply with the numbers placed on that memorandum.

    Ms. Susan V. Boleyn 
    Yes, they are the same thing. 
    Solicitor and district attorney are the same thing. 
    What is not in the record and what Mr. Coates and Mr. Wright and Mr. Jernigan all say is, these theories... they even characterize them as theories, as to what this meant. 
    There was an attempt to make it look good but not really be truly representative. 
    All that is inference and speculation because there is no direct evidence in the record on that. 
    We know where it came from.

    Ms. Susan V. Boleyn 
    Your Honor, I am not contesting that that memorandum came from the solicitor's office. 
    That has been previously determined. 
    What I am contesting has never been decided either in Bailey v. Vining, the separate civil action, or in this case are the motives of the prosecution, whether it was pursuant to a scheme, and whether it was a deliberate intent to underrepresent black people. 
    Yes, it had that effect. 
    That's what Bailey v. Vining says. 
    And we are stuck with it for whatever it is worth. 
    But all the deliberate nature of this prosecutor is what has never been proven and has always been inferred.

    They never went and looked at the statistics. 
    They just assumed that they would be challengeable and they would show intent themselves. 
    They didn't actually go and make a determination of what the statistics were. 
    They just assumed that they would be corrected based on their general legal knowledge of the community.

    Yes, they were, Your Honor, because that's how Mr. Coates got them, was going to the clerk's office himself and doing the tabulations, and then he presented those in Bailey v. Vining. 
    Our position is that there has never been a sufficient showing of cause by the petitioner in this case, that the attorneys made an intentional, deliberate strategical decision, albeit one that failed, to go with an advantageous jury array and not to file what they believed would be a successful challenge to the grand and traverse juries which would only buy them delay and would not keep the death penalty from being imposed upon the petitioner.

    --And the key inquiry whether if they think they need an element of proof that they don't have for whatever they are trying to show, then there you would have the nexus. 
    You'd have the cause and effect between the lack of knowing about the bribery, in this case the lack of knowing about the challengeability of the jury and the decision, but the key part comes in, of course, when you assume that you have all the elements of proof you needed, and they assumed they would have the evidence of intentional discrimination based on statistics if they looked at them.

    No, Your Honor. 
    They said that if you went back far enough in Georgia, in any county in Georgia where there was not a prior jury challenge, you were going to find underrepresentation of blacks on the jury, so it was more than just some general statistical legal technician sort of notion. 
    It was, they were sure. 
    They had practiced law there for 25 years and known there was never a previous challenge, and figured if you go back far enough you are going to be able to find that underrepresentation of blacks on the jury probably in statistics high enough to show the intent without the necessity of any memo or anything else showing the element of--

    Ms. Susan V. Boleyn 
    --Well, that's, of course, the way you look at it. 
    The way you show discrimination in this one is to show systematic exclusion over a significant period of time, so that's the same sort of analysis you'd have to go in to try to attack the individual jury. 
    The Eleventh Circuit did not reach prejudice, but let me just state that we have never conceded that there was sufficient prejudice under the cause and prejudice standard. 
    What we did concede is that the Bailey v. Vining order established underrepresentation of blacks. 
    There was nothing we could do about that, but whether or not that constitutes prejudice should this Court reach that question is still open for the decision. 
    If there are no further questions.

   Rebuttal of Stephen B. Bright
speaker="stephen_b_bright" startTime="3542.033" stopTime="3603.108">
    Mr. Stephen B. Bright 
    Very well. 
    I would just point to the record very quickly on the prejudice question. 
    The state said, the same attorney general, that prejudice has been conceded by the state throughout the proceedings because of the intentional discrimination and the uncontroverted evidence in Bailey. 
    The other point I want to make is just what has been said repeatedly in both the briefs and the arguments, that this is speculation and inference by myself or in our brief or witnesses, these are findings of a United States District Court. 
    The District Court found discrimination, and it found at Page 79 of the Joint Appendix that it was done for the purpose of avoiding a prima facie case. 
    This is not anybody's speculation. 
    These were findings that a District Court could make based upon all the evidence, and I would just point out as well with regard to what the lawyers would have done that when Mr. Coates testified at Page 47 of the record he talked about this was a death penalty case, we had a hard case, and I wish we had known, because we were looking for every issue to raise, when he testified, so it wasn't just the testimony of Mr. Jernigan.

    Mr. Stephen B. Bright 
    I think the evidence was established at least from... in the Bailey case by the testimony of Mr. Dennis, the clerk of the court and secretary to the jury commission. 
    He said, I got this from the District Attorney's office, I communicated it, they followed it to the letter, and the District Court made those findings. 
    Why the state didn't call the prosecutor, I have no idea. 
    Of course, he did have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege, but I don't know if that's the reason.

    Mr. Stephen B. Bright 
    We certainly did not need the prosecutor in this particular case. 
    And finally, with regard to the motions, I want to make clear there were three motions filed prior to trial. 
    Two more were filed on the day of trial, but there were three filed prior, but with regard to that continuance motion, one of the reasons that it was filed was that, and the lawyers didn't just file a motion. 
    They filed an affidavit, and they swore to this statement that there was so much passion and prejudice in the community that they needed to continue the case to the next term of court so that the passions in that particular jury could die down, and if they had gone to the March term it would have been a new term of court. 
    For all these reasons, we would ask the Court to reverse the Eleventh Circuit and reinstate the District Court. 
    Thank you.
