    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    This case presents a statutory construction issue under the Medicare Act. 
    The Courts of Appeals were divided and we issued certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Six Circuit to resolve the point. 
    Two providers under the Medicare would like to challenge the validity of a regulation in the United States District Court. 
    Providers contended that certain cost were reimbursable. 
    00:34 prohibiting reimbursement was in valid. 
    In the District Court, the Secretary argued that the providers were barred from making a challenge because they had not raised the issue in the cost report that they had filed with the fiscal intermediary the cost report is the first step in the reimbursement process. 
    Construing the statute, we find that the provider is not barred in the District Court. 
    The structure of the statute permits the provider to challenge a regulation if the issue is raised at the Provider Review Board level after the cost report has been filed with the fiscal intermediary. 
    This the provider did. 
    Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Six Circuit.
