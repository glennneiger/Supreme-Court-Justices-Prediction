Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Flight Attendants

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear argument now in Number 86-1650, Trans World Airlines v. Independent Federation of Flight Attendants. 
    Mr. Gartner, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Murray Gartner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves union security provisions, which is another way of saying compulsory payment of union dues. 
    It is also here, as was the last case, on Petition for Certiorari to the Eighth Circuit. 
    For more than a year now, because of the decision of that Court, thousands of flight attendants employed by TWA have contributed more than $2.5 million to the treasury of the union, against their will, and under threat by TWA that if they did not do so, they would lose their jobs. 
    The Court below held that it would be a violation of the Railway Labor Act for TWA to do otherwise, because it said the union has an agreement with TWA pursuant to Section 211 of the Railway Labor Act, which requires TWA to make those threats and which requires those flight attendants to pay those dues. 
    The agreement to which the Court and the union point, however, was part of a contract effective by its terms only from August 1, 1981 to July 31, 1984. 
    From 1984 to 1986, TWA and the Respondent Union, which I will refer to as IFFA&gt; ["], were engaged in negotiation and mediation under the auspices of the National Mediation Board, in an attempt to reach a successor agreement. 
    Those efforts were unsuccessful. 
    No successor agreement was made. 
    No successor agreement is in effect now.

    Mr. Murray Gartner 
    Despite the fact that there is no successor agreement, the Court below held that the union security provisions of the old agreement continue in effect because parts of the prior agreement survive, as the District Court described it, and I quote: 
    "as a mutilated collective bargaining agreement. " 
    That, as Your Honors know, is not a term known to the statute or to the art. 
    The Court below said very little about Section 211, or the words of this Court, in the Street case, about the limited inroads which that section permits, by agreement of the union and the carrier, on the complete prohibition of compulsory dues payment otherwise mandated by Sections 2 Fourth and 2 Fifth. 
    Ignoring that statutory provision, the Eighth Circuit justified the exaction of dues from non-member, permanent replacements and crossovers... that is, people who went to work during the strike and crossed the picket line... during the strike and the continuing self-help period in which we are now, by characterizing the union security simply as an extremely important condition of employment, without regard to what the statute required in order to have that as a condition of employment.

    Mr. Murray Gartner 
    Not under the terms of the contract, Justice White. 
    The Court below was driven by its conception of what the Act required in what it said was its interpretation of the contract. 
    But because of what it believed that the Railway Labor Act required, in terms of bargaining about each single provision, it construed a duration clause which on its face was completely unambiguous and which provided for the non-renewal of the entire agreement, as though it provided for partial renewal of the agreement. 
    So that the Court was not construing the contract. 
    It was simply using the Railway Labor Act to change the words and the meaning of the contract.

speaker="murray_gartner" startTime="492.998" stopTime="642.337">
    Mr. Murray Gartner 
    Because the union security clause is the specific subject of a specific provision of the statute which requires an agreement. 
    It was enacted in complete accord with and adoption of similar provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, which have been uniformly interpreted to require that union security provisions and on the expiration of the contract, regardless of whether all the other provisions of an NLRA contract continue in existence. 
    Now, before the decision below, the first, second, seventh and ninth circuits had recognized that agreements under the Railway Labor Act may expire in accordance with their terms, but that because of Section 6, the conditions established by those agreements nevertheless continue during the status quo period during which negotiations are carried on for the purpose of trying to reach a new agreement. 
    With specific relevance to the question in this case, the Second Circuit, in the Manning case, held that a dues checkoff agreement may expire in accordance with its agreed termination date, but is then continued for the limited status quo period, even though the carrier had not proposed to change it but merely to let it expire. 
    The proposal of the union in that case to include a dues checkoff provision in the new agreement would not seem any different from what the parties here intended. 
    Both parties intended to have a union security clause in a new agreement, but not to have a free-floating union security clause without an agreement. 
    No court of appeals, until the Court below, has held that after a contract expires and after the conditions it established continue in existence, for, in the words of this Court, the almost interminable status quo period, as the Court said in Detroit and Toledo. 
    And no new agreement is reached that parts of the old agreement continue further into the self help period. 
    Even under the NLRA, as I have indicated, Justice White--

    Mr. Murray Gartner 
    --I agree, Justice Scalia, it is not before you. 
    The only reason I am mentioning it is that Respondent has spent to much time trying to persuade the Court that it is before you and only point I want to make is that even under the NLRA, where there is some provision about continuing bargaining about other provisions, the very union security provisions which was adopted in the RLA by the model of he NLRA, is held to expire. 
    So I will not pay any more attention to that question.

    Justice Scalia 
    It seems to me you have to either argue you want to be like the NLRA or you do not want to be like the NLRA. 
    If you want to be like the NLRA, you ought to give up on the proposition that the rest of the contract does not continue but say that nonetheless, the union security provision doesn't continue. 
    On the other hand, if you want to be different from the NLRA, the-- 
    --We have no choice Justice Scalia. 
    That his what Congress wanted. 
    Congress said that the two provisions should be the same. 
    That is what the legislative history discloses. 
    It is not a matter of giving up on the other point. 
    The other points are not here. 
    They were not in the case below, they are not in the grant of certiorari. 
    So we will not say any more about it. 
    With reference to Section 211, which this case is about, that Section requires an agreement. 
    The agreement here was expressly limited in time to July 31, 1984. 
    It did not renew itself, because both parties served noticed that they wanted to have a changed agreement and therefore the condition for non-renewal was met. 
    I make that statement only with specific reference to the union security clause. 
    Section 6 of the Act then required, as the Manning Court in the Second Circuit and as the Ninth Circuit in the Reeve Aleutian case, that all conditions, including the union security clause, be continued during the status quo period. 
    There is nothing in the Railway Labor Act, however, that subsequently transforms that statutory obligation to adhere to that condition od employment embodied in the union security clause, which transforms it into a new agreement after the status quo period has ended. 
    Mr. Gartner, let me just ask this question. 
    Is it not correct that the District Court and the Court of Appeals thought that the agreement, even without the aid of the statute, provided for automatic renewal with respect to the provisions that were not the subject of negotiation?

 If you want to be like the NLRA, you ought to give up on the proposition that the rest of the contract does not continue but say that nonetheless, the union security provision doesn't continue. 
 On the other hand, if you want to be different from the NLRA, the-- 
 --We have no choice Justice Scalia. 
 That his what Congress wanted. 
 Congress said that the two provisions should be the same. 
 That is what the legislative history discloses. 
 It is not a matter of giving up on the other point. 
 The other points are not here. 
 They were not in the case below, they are not in the grant of certiorari. 
 So we will not say any more about it. 
 With reference to Section 211, which this case is about, that Section requires an agreement. 
 The agreement here was expressly limited in time to July 31, 1984. 
 It did not renew itself, because both parties served noticed that they wanted to have a changed agreement and therefore the condition for non-renewal was met. 
 I make that statement only with specific reference to the union security clause. 
 Section 6 of the Act then required, as the Manning Court in the Second Circuit and as the Ninth Circuit in the Reeve Aleutian case, that all conditions, including the union security clause, be continued during the status quo period. 
 There is nothing in the Railway Labor Act, however, that subsequently transforms that statutory obligation to adhere to that condition od employment embodied in the union security clause, which transforms it into a new agreement after the status quo period has ended. 
 Mr. Gartner, let me just ask this question. 
 Is it not correct that the District Court and the Court of Appeals thought that the agreement, even without the aid of the statute, provided for automatic renewal with respect to the provisions that were not the subject of negotiation?

    No, Justice Stevens. 
    I think it is very clear in both opinions that the only reason that they reached the decision that they did is that they believed that the statute required there to be contracts in the Railway Labor Act coverage which were interminable and did not have any termination date. 
    This contract had a termination date.

    They say there were two issues. 
    The District Court stated there were two issues. 
    One, did Article 28, the duration provisions of the contract, cause parts of the contract that were not subject to bargaining to continue in effect, or did notice of certain attendant changes trigger a total termination of the agreement? 
    And he said he answered that a different way than you would answer it. 
    Then they said the second issue is a statutory issue, and they don't reach the statutory issue. 
    Maybe they are dead wrong, but it seems to me that they held, if you have just nothing but the language of the contract, that the contract, in a mutilated form, as you put it, did survive.

 The District Court stated there were two issues. 
 One, did Article 28, the duration provisions of the contract, cause parts of the contract that were not subject to bargaining to continue in effect, or did notice of certain attendant changes trigger a total termination of the agreement? 
 And he said he answered that a different way than you would answer it. 
 Then they said the second issue is a statutory issue, and they don't reach the statutory issue. 
 Maybe they are dead wrong, but it seems to me that they held, if you have just nothing but the language of the contract, that the contract, in a mutilated form, as you put it, did survive.

    But on Page 5, they say, we construe the terms of the duration clause of this agreement in light of the national labor policy enunciated by the Railway Labor Act, which governs airlines as well as railroads, and in light of pertinent decisions bearing on the issues. 
    And then they go into a long discussion about the purposes of the Railway Labor Ac and the Florida East Coast case which dealt with an existing agreement, no with an agreement which had a termination date or which purported to have a limited effective term. 
    And they construe, as they say, they purport to be construing the language of the contract, but they are not construing the language, they are saying that the Railway Labor Act requires this result; and in effect what they are saying is, whatever the parties said, the Railway Labor Act says that you can't do it that way, so we are going to pretend that they did it another way.

speaker="murray_gartner" startTime="996.417" stopTime="1161.118">
    Mr. Murray Gartner 
    Justice Stevens, I think this is an important point and I would like to dwell on it for a minute or two. 
    Every other Court which has construed a similar contract, which has construed the contract, without the baggage of its interpretation of the Railway Labor Act, have held that this kind of a contract provides for the non-renewal and the termination of the agreement. 
    So the only way that the Eight Circuit reads the contrary result... and they said specifically, we will not follow the rationale of Reeve Aleutian. 
    The practical effect of the Court's decision offends all reason. 
    What the Court has done is to say that after an agree contract term has ended, if a union insists upon striking to attain its new contract objectives, and the employer decides to maintain its operations by recruiting and employing permanent replacements, the employer must induce the replacements to come through the union's picket line to work in order to defeat the strike, and in the same breath, tell those permanent replacements and crossovers that they must pay initiation fees to the union... not only dues, but initiation fees... to the same union which is conducting the picket line so that the union will have the funds to continue the strike. 
    That is the effect of the Court's decision. 
    In the many cases in which this Court has defined the scope of Section 211, and parallel provisions of the NLRA, it has never suggested that without a current agreement, and in the self-help period, 211 permits such a requirement. 
    Nor do I think it needs much argument to establish that if the Unions had asked Congress to pass a law in those words to achieve that objective, that they could have attracted much support. 
    Our submission to this Court is that Congress did not pass such a law with respect to union security clauses, that this Court has not interpreted union security clauses, particularly under the Railway Labor Act, to have that meaning.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1161.118" stopTime="1179.190">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Then you do say, Mr. Gartner, that a union security clause in a collective bargaining agreement under the RLA, whatever may be the law with respect to renewal or implied continuance of other such clauses, union security clauses are different because of the special statutory treatment in 211?

    Mr. Murray Gartner 
    I do not think, Your Honor, that this Court is bound to say that. 
    This Court has never addressed that question as to whether in those other situations the permission granted by Section 211 allows unions and employers to threaten permanent replacements and crossovers with a loss of their jobs if they don't pay money to support the strike. 
    This Court has never made that decision. 
    And I think that it is an open question. 
    But it is not a question that we have to deal with in this case because we fortunately did have a contract which had a termination date. 
    The Respondent prefers not to talk about Section 211 or to acknowledge that it is a limited exception to the otherwise complete prohibition of compulsory dues requirements in the Act. 
    Instead, it has directed the Court's attention to Section 2 Seventh. 
    And with respect to Section 2 Seventh, I would only think it necessary to direct the Court's attention to what the Court itself said in Detroit and Toledo, that 2 Seventh is not a status quo provision which has anything to do with a major dispute procedure. 
    All that Section 2 Seventh does is to provide for the enforcement of existing agreements and then to call Section 6 into play. 
    Well, Section 6 was called into play in this situation. 
    It was in play for two years. 
    TWA complied with all of the requirements of Section 2 Seventh and Section 6 and those sections have no further application in this case. 
    I would like, if I may, to reserve the rest of my time.

    Yes.

    And I would add that the reason that we do not believe that there is a comparable impasse procedure under the RLA as there is under the NLRA is that the RLA imposes such a very long and detailed and specific bargaining duty and procedure--

    Mr. Steven A. Fehr 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I would like to start by attempting to clarify some things in the record. 
    First, the notion that this case was tried upon a narrow ground related to the sole change of union security is untrue. 
    TWA filed this case as a declaratory judgment asking the Court to declare, among other things, that the contract expired. 
    The Court declared the opposite. 
    In our answer, we specifically alleged twice that TWA could make only those changes which it had submitted to the statutory procedures. 
    And there is no question but that that is what both Courts held.

    Mr. Steven A. Fehr 
    They mean expire so as to get to the status quo period, expire so as to get to the self help period. 
    There is no case, other than the Ninth Circuit case, that says once you get to self help, anything goes, the carrier can change anything and everything. 
    Perhaps the best example of it is Judge Posner's Opinion in the Seventh Circuit in EEOC v. United when he uses the words "expiration date". 
    But even as he uses the words "expiration date" he says that the passing of the expiration date does not allow the carrier to implement any changes. 
    It only allows the carrier to implement those which were the subject of Section 6 notice.

    Mr. Steven A. Fehr 
    It did make comments to that effect, yes, Your Honor. 
    You should also perhaps look at how both Courts framed the issue below. 
    As Justice Stevens pointed out, the issue was framed by both Courts in broad terms as to whether the contract survived both under the statute and under the contract, and the framing of the issues did not even specifically mention union security. 
    Also in response to a question you posed, Justice White, there is no formal decertification procedure under the National Mediation Board. 
    There are certainly methods in which a new union can be voted in. 
    In fact, TWA's flight attendants have been represented by four different unions over the course of 40 years. 
    There is a rather central point, a rather central case which has not been mentioned yet today. 
    And that is the decision 22 years ago by this Court in BRAC v. FEC Railway, and I think we need to talk about that case a little bit.

speaker="steven_a_fehr" startTime="1996.329" stopTime="2118.705">
    Mr. Steven A. Fehr 
    Rather extensively, Your Honor. 
    This is, I believe, the case the Court envisioned 22 years ago in FEC when the Court said that it would make a sham of the bargaining and mediation processes of the Act if the carrier could unilaterally achieve what the Act requires be done by the other orderly procedures. 
    And TWA has barely mentioned the rationale of the FEC Court in its brief, and with good reasons, because that rationale really has nothing whatsoever to do with duration clauses in contracts. 
    The Court talks about the spirit of the ACT. 
    And I think we have to ask and answer the question today of what is the spirit of the Act the Court was talking about in FEC. 
    TWA claims that spirit is that existing agreements be honored. 
    But that has nothing to do with the rationale of FEC which talks about the community of carrier and employees which is only interrupted by a strike, which talks about a reversion to the jungle if the carrier may use the occasion of a strike to tear up the entire contract, which talks about a carrier using a dispute over limited issues to make sweeping changes that the carrier did not bring to the bargaining table, and which talks about providing the carrier an incentive to provoke or prolong a strike so that it may break the union and simply annul the entire collective bargaining agreement. 
    They key word is "incentive". 
    The purpose of the RLA, which flows directly from Section 1, is to promote bargaining to the fullest extent possible so as to avoid self help. 
    And what violated the spirit of the Act in FEC was the carrier's interpretation of the ACT, which would have given the carrier a substantial incentive to engage in self help. 
    We have these elaborate processes, what the Court has described as machinery, designed to adjust disputes and avoid self help. 
    But if the carrier can so easily side step that elaborate machinery merely by submitting some changes to the processes of the Act while hiding others until self help, then those procedures are indeed a shambles.

    Justice O'Connor 
    It is hard to envision that Congress would have intended a scheme under which the working flight attendants here have to finance the union's efforts to displace them. 
    It is rather strange, isn't it?
speaker="steven_a_fehr" startTime="2133.498" stopTime="2167.305">
    Mr. Steven A. Fehr 
    The union's primary objective is certainly not to displace the working flight attendant. 
    And secondly, Justice O'Connor, that was exactly the result in the FEC case which has been on the books for 22 years and Congress has made no effort to change it. 
    The FEC Court specifically found that a union security provision was a working condition subject to Section 2 Seventh of the Act which may not be altered unless there are negotiations over that provision, except in certain instances during a strike, which is certainly not at issue here because the strike was over long before the District Court even ruled.

    Mr. Steven A. Fehr 
    I don't know that, Your Honor. 
    I only know that union security provisions is one of the issues as to which the carrier attempted to change without bargaining and the Court indicated that you could not do that, except insofar as necessary to operate during the strike. 
    And the rule of FEC is that the carrier and the union must bargain over that which they intend to change. 
    Under any contrary rule, I submit, the Railway Labor Act simply does not work. 
    A Section 6 notice of intended changes is of little value if during self help the carrier may make any change it wishes. 
    How effective can the National Mediation Board be, if it is only mediating the changes the carrier has proposed and does not know what other changes the carrier intends to implement during self help?

    On the other hand, I really wonder how successful any mediation effort is going to be if you are requiring the carrier, if it wishes to avoid the situation that has occurred here, to put on the table elimination of the union security agreement every time. 
    That doesn't seem to me something that is likely to produce a quick agreement between the union and the company, and that is the effect of what you are saying.

    Mr. Steven A. Fehr 
    There are several answers to that, Justice Scalia, the first of which is that that pretty much is the result of FEC. 
    Second, if somehow the carrier cannot operate if it has to enforce the union security agreement during a strike, it can apply to the District Court, as authorized by FEC, for an exception to the requirements of 2 Seventh, which we haven't talked about yet. 
    And third, in fact, TWA has in its proposals issued some provisional proposals that would be in effect only during a strike. 
    If you will examine TWA's opening proposals that are in the Joint Appendix, they talk about changing the crew complement, et cetera, in turn, if there was a strike. 
    So I think there are ways to deal with that.

speaker="steven_a_fehr" startTime="2303.931" stopTime="2611.698">
    Mr. Steven A. Fehr 
    TWA made just such a proposal, Your Honor. 
    I question how often a carrier would submit to interest arbitration if it knew that in self help immediately following its rejection of arbitration it could obtain far more from self help than the arbitrator could even conceivably award. 
    I also question how seriously a carrier would take the recommendations of a Presidential emergency board when the board will not even address the carrier's hidden agenda for self help. 
    In short, we believe, as the Courts below believe and as I believe was the message of FEC, that the machinery of the Railway Labor Act only has a chance to work if it is given the chance to do so. 
    With that, I would like to focus for a few moments on the specific language of Section 2 Seventh of the Act and Section 6 of the Act, and of Article 128 of the contract. 
    Section 2 Seventh says, no carrier shall change conditions embodied in agreements except in the manner prescribed in agreements or in Section 6. 
    And the emphasis on changes in conditions in agreements as opposed to just changes in agreements is significant. 
    It clearly contemplates that there will be changes other than by agreement. 
    It clearly contemplates that there will be changes other than by wholesale substitution of one agreement for another. 
    The phrase 
    "in the manner prescribed in agreements. " 
    has no relevance here. 
    There is no agreement requiring TWA to eliminate the union security provisions or the grievance procedure or make any of the other changes that it made. 
    So that leaves us with the question of what changes may be made in the manner prescribed in Section 6. 
    And Section 6 requires that carriers and unions give notice of their intended changes and agreements. 
    So when you may make changes in the manner prescribed by Section 6, is that any change or is that just the changes of which you gave notice? 
    I would submit that the only logical conclusion is that pursuant to Section 2 Seventh, the carrier may make only those unilateral changes of which it gave notice. 
    We should then perhaps focus a little more closely on the language of Section 6. 
    Section 6 says three times in the space of a single paragraph, it uses the phrase "intended changes or intended change". 
    A carrier and union must give 30 days' notice of intended changes. 
    If the services of the NMB are invoked, no changes may be made until the NMB has finally acted upon the quote "controversy" close quote. 
    What is the controversy? 
    I think obviously the controversy is the changes intended. 
    So when a carrier may make those changes of which it has to give 30 days' notice, what changes are those? 
    The only logical conclusion it seems to me is that they are the changes which were the subject of the controversy, the changes which were acted upon by the NMB, the changes which were the subject of the Section 6 notice. 
    Any other conclusion would simply completely eviscerate the meaning of the words "intended change". 
    And as to the contract itself, it provides that it renews itself indefinitely without change unless you give notice of specified intended changes. 
    And again, as with its construction of Section 6, as with its construction of Section 7, TWA contends that what was intended was that notice of specified intended changes would be a signal that the carrier could do anything it wanted during self help. 
    There is just nothing in the Act, or in the contract, I believe, that allows, much less requires, such an interpretation, so at odds with the Act's primary objective, which is the prevention of strikes. 
    This Court has described the RLA as an integrated, harmonious scheme. 
    No less than four sections... Section 2 Seventh, Section 5, Section 6 and Section 10... forbid changes so that the processes of the act will have an opportunity to work. 
    The position espoused by TWA would make those procedures optional for carriers. 
    It would allow, as the District Court said, the carrier to opt out of the bargaining process and submit only selective changes or perhaps no changes, if the Union had submitted some, knowing that there are no limitations once self help begins. 
    Moreover, it is absurd to contend that the result below has somehow deprived TWA of its right to engage in self help. 
    TWA has engaged and is engaging in massive self help. 
    It has operated with substantially a work force that includes a large number of replacements. 
    It has implemented each and every one of its bargaining proposals without compromise and it has implemented many other changes as to which it never bargained. 
    And all that is at issue today is whether TWA may unilaterally implement that which it never proposed. 
    If I could borrow a line from the United States, in a brief filed in the FEC case: 
    "The self help the Act contemplates is self help in adjusting the particular disputes being negotiated. " 
    In other words, the carrier must bargain over that which it intends to change.

    I find it hard to conceive of the notion that Congress enacted Section 2 Seventh only to deal with contracts that happen to be of indefinite duration without saying this section shall apply to contracts that are only of indefinite duration. 
    A more logical conclusion is that the statute was intended to say, you shall not have contracts with what the District Court characterized as comprehensive termination dates where every change, every part of the contract, completely self destructs if you give notice of one change.

    Mr. Steven A. Fehr 
    --Well, sure. 
    You can construct a duration clause that says you shall not change certain things before a date certain. 
    That does not relieve you of your obligation to bargain over that which you want to change, at some point. 
    I did want to point out that obviously TWA's desire to take a strike, that is settle, once it had begun, is clearly colored by its belief it could obtain far more through self help than the Act contemplates, far more than its mere bargaining proposals. 
    For all we know, but for TWA's belief that it could annul the entire contract during self help, there would never have been a strike. 
    And also, if TWA is limited in its scope of self help by the scope of its bargaining proposals, that merely puts it on an equal footing with the union. 
    A union cannot make a unilateral change. 
    It can only strike to secure change through an agreement. 
    And clearly, any proposed changes in agreements must be submitted through Section 6. 
    As the Court said in Shoreline, only if both sides are equally restrained, can the Act's remedies work effectively. 
    And I think, under the Act, we have a comprehensive scheme where both sides are limited in their exercise of self help by the scope of their bargaining proposals. 
    I would like to speak briefly about the only case which the Court--

    But when the union agreed to it, the union, perhaps their counsel had read the FEC case and knew that you could only make the changes that you had submitted to the bargaining process. 
    Look at the rationale of FEC and tell me what that has to do with duration clauses.

speaker="steven_a_fehr" startTime="3226.995" stopTime="3387.640">
    Mr. Steven A. Fehr 
    It is somewhat of a facetious example, Justice Scalia. 
    But I suppose that is possible. 
    That is not realistically what happened or what is likely to happen. 
    The theme of the Act seem to be clearly that you have to bargain over that which you intend to change. 
    Otherwise, a carrier can submit a single change to the bargaining process, wait for self help and then change anything it wishes. 
    And there was not a single change proposed here, but there were many, many changes made other than those which were the subject of the Act's statutory procedures. 
    Right along the lines of the FEC Opinion, it really has made a sham of the Act, to say there can be no bargaining over union security or the grievance procedure or many other things, but that as soon as self help comes, we are going to eliminate them. 
    The carrier can simply hold back and wait and say during self help I can break the union by implementing all these changes. 
    And that is pretty close to what happened in this case. 
    I have only a few moments, so I would like to say something about the Reeve Aleutian case. 
    I think that the Court simply missed the boat entirely. 
    It did not analyze the contractual language. 
    It did not discuss what the meaning of Section 2 Seventh was. 
    It did not discuss the rationale of FEC. 
    It accepted a distinction of FED which its own District Court said was not clear and which has nothing to do with the rationale. 
    It says that the Act is concerned with changes in agreements, when the Act in Section 2 Seventh and in the FEC Opinion, clearly we are concerned with unilateral changes, where there is no agreement to change. 
    And Reeve gave us the anomalous result that a carrier that proposed no changes in bargaining could make any change it wished during self help. 
    I would refer to Justice Posner's, in the EEOC case, his discussion of the use of the term RLA contracts. 
    I think it explains many of the semantics which TWA poses. 
    As the arguments that you should adopt National Labor Relations Board, there are many reasons why you should not do that. 
    You start with the statement in Burlington Northern and Jacksonville Terminal, to the effect that you simply do not adopt, import wholesale a detailed panoply of law from the NLRA into the RLA. 
    Second, that simply begs the question. 
    Before you would say that Board law should be applied, you would have to first determine that the contract expired contrary to the Courts below. 
    You would have to first determine that Section Seventh does not mean what we say it means and what the District Court said it meant, before you even reach that issue. 
    In addition, the case law under the Board is really not all that different. 
    I would refer the Court to the TRICO Products case. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Murray Gartner

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Fehr. 
    Your time has expired. 
    Mr. Gartner, you have three minutes remaining.
speaker="murray_gartner" startTime="3393.283" stopTime="3552.583">
    Mr. Murray Gartner 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I wish I had more time to respond to many issues, but I know I do not. 
    One issue I would like to deal with immediately. 
    I have heard this and the Court has seen it so many times in the Respondent's brief, that TWA was under an obligation to negotiate about and to deal with the changes it intended to make. 
    TWA did not intend to make a change in the union security clause in the new agreement. 
    And that is all that the Railway Labor Act requires it to do. 
    The Railway Labor Act says you shall tell the other party for the purpose of negotiation what changes you want in the new agreement... not what changes you want during the self help period. 
    The self help period is uncontrolled by the statute and this Court has said so many times, but most recently in the Burlington Northern case that the self-help period is not dealt with by the Railway Labor Act. 
    Now, to a few other points. 
    Counsel says that there was a request for a declaration in the complaint below with respect to the expiration of the contract. 
    The prayers for relief in both with respect to the plaintiff and the defendant appear on Page 94 and 107 of the Petition for Certiorari and they very clearly limit themselves to a request for a declaration that the union security clause and related provisions have expired. 
    That's it. 
    That is the request for relief. 
    Counsel says that the framing of the issues by the Court below did not even mention the union security clause. 
    If the Court looks at 1(A) to the appendix to the Petition for Certiorari, the very first sentence by Judge Bright in his Opinion is: 
    "The question presented in this case is whether the union security induced checkoff provisions contained in Article 24(AL) of the 1983 Collective Bargaining Agreement between TWA and the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants are now in effect and should be enforced. " 
    That is the Court's statement of the issue. 
    And counsel says that in framing the issue the Court did not even mention union security. 
    The FEC case, I think, has been dealt with adequately in the briefs.
