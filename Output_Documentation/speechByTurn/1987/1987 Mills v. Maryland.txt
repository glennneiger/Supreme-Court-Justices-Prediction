    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, this case comes to us from the highest court of the State of Maryland and it concerns that State's capital sentencing system. 
    The case doesn't blend itself very well though announcement from the bench. 
    It involves the type of jury verdict form that was employed at that time in Maryland. 
    I think it must suffice to say that in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland insofar as it sustained the imposition of the death penalty upon the petitioner, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings, not in consistent with our opinion. 
    Justice Brennan and Justice White each have joined the opinion but have filed brief statements in concurrence. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion and has joined therein by Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy.
