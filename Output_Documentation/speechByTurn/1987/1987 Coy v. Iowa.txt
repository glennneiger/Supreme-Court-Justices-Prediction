    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    This case, Coy versus Iowa that comes to us on appeal from the Supreme Court of Iowa. 
    The appellant was convicted after a jury trial of two counts of lascivious acts with a child. 
    At trial, the State made a motion pursuant to an Iowa statute to place a screen in the courtroom during the testimony of the two complaining witnesses, both of whom were 13-year-old girls. 
    The trial court allowed the use of the screen, which was positioned between the appellant and the two witnesses, so as to permit appellant to see the witnesses but blocked him from their view. 
    Appellant argued that the screen violated the Sixth Amendment's guaranty of a face to face confrontation and violated due process. 
    The Iowa Supreme Court rejected these arguments. 
    We reversed on Confrontation Clause grounds. 
    The right to face-to-face confrontation has ancient roots although our opinions have discussed it less frequently than other more complicated aspects of the Confrontation Clause, such as the admissibility of out-of-courts statements. 
    But both ancient and modern sources suggest that a face-to-face encounter as the words of the clause suggest is an important element of a fair trial which serves the goal of assuring the integrity of the fact finding process. 
    Today, we reaffirmed the core meaning of the Confrontation Clause. 
    It is difficult to imagine a more obvious or damaging violation of the confrontation right than the screen in this case, which was specifically designed to prevent the witnesses from seeing the appellant. 
    We do not decide whether exceptions to the right exist since any exception would require more than the legislatively imposed presumption of trauma that was the sole justification for use of the screen here. 
    There was no individualized finding that these witnesses needed special protection. 
    We believe that violations of the confrontation right may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and rather than decide whether the error here was harmless, we leave that issue for the court below. 
    Justice O'Connor, who joins the opinion, has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice White has joined. 
    Justice Blackmun has filed a dissent in which Chief Justice Rehnquist has joined. Justice Kennedy took no part.
