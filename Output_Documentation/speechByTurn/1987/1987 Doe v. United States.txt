    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, this case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    Petitioner is the target of a federal grand jury investigation and pursuant to a subpoena he produced some records but invoked the Fifth Amendment when he was questioned about the existence or location of additional records. 
    There were foreign banks concerned and they refused to comply with subpoenas served upon them. 
    The Government then filed a motion for an order directing the petitioner to sign a consent directive authorizing those banks to disclose records of any and all accounts without identifying or acknowledging their existence. 
    The District Court denied that motion. 
    The Court of Appeals, however, disagreed and it ordered that petitioner to execute the consent directive and he refused and was found to be in civil contempt, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    In an opinion filed today, we affirm that judgment. 
    The consent directive here is not testimonial in nature and compelling the petitioner to sign it does not violate his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
