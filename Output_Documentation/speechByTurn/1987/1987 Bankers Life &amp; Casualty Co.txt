    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In the Bankers Life case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Mississippi. 
    In that case, we hold that a state statute imposing a 15% penalty on parties who appeal unsuccessfully, this money judgment does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. 
    We therefore affirmed the judgment below. 
    Appellant also challenges the substantial punitive damages award but we conclude that this challenge has not raise below and therefore, we do not reach it here. 
    Justice White has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Scalia has joined. 
    Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring into judgment in which Justice Scalia has joined. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring into judgment. 
    Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. 
    And Justice Stevens and Justice Kennedy took no part into consideration or decision.
