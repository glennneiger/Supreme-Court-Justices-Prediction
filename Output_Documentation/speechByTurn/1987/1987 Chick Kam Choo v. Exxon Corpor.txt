    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinions of the Court to announce in three cases and the first of them, No. 87-505 Chick Kam Choo versus Exxon Corporation, is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    It involves the propriety of an order issued by a Federal District Court enjoining the petitioners from litigating a certain wrongful death action in the Texas state courts. 
    The question presented is whether this injunction is permissible in light of the Anti-Injunction Act, which generally bars federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings. 
    We hold that the injunction actually entered is broader than the limited, one we find permissible. 
    In an opinion authored by Justice O'Connor, accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for the District Court for further proceedings. 
    Justice White has filed a concurring opinion.
