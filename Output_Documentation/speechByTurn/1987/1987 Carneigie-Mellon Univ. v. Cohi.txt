    Justice John Marshall 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals to the Third Circuit. 
    Here we hold that a Federal District Court has discretion under the doctrine of pendant jurisdiction to remand and remove the case to a State court when all federal-law claims in the action have been eliminated and only state law claims remain. 
    Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Third Circuit denying petitioners' application for a writ of mandamus. 
    Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia have joined.
