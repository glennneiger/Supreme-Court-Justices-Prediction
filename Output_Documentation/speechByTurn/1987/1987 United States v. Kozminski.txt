    Ms. Justice O'Connor: 
    The first is No. 86-2000, United States versus Kozminski. 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    In 1983, two mentally retarded men were found living and working on a Michigan dairy farm in squalid conditions and in relative isolation from the rest of society. 
    Dairy farmer, Ike Kozminski and his wife and their son John, were charged with violating Section 1584 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code which makes it a crime to hold another person in involuntary servitude. 
    The Kozminskis were also charged with violating Section 241 of the same code which prohibits conspiracies to interfere with rights secured by the constitutional laws of the United States. 
    And the conspiracy charged was a conspiracy to interfere with the Thirteenth Amendment right to be free from involuntary servitude. 
    The Government relied in part on evidence that the Kozminskis had used psychological coercion to cause the victims to believe they had no alternative but to work on the farm. 
    The District Court gave the jury a broad definition of the term involuntary servitude. 
    It encompassed situations involving purely psychological coercion. 
    The jury found the defendants guilty of some of the charges and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    The case was reheard en banc and the Court of Appeals reversed the convictions and remanded the case for a new trial. 
    The Court of Appeals ruled that the District Court's definition of involuntary servitude was too broad and also held that it generally can't exists absent the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion to compel labor. 
    And the Court found an exception to the rule in cases where the defendant uses fraud or deceit to compel services from a minor and immigrant or one who is mentally incompetent. 
    We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the meaning of the phrase involuntary servitude for purposes of criminal prosecutions under the statutes. 
    In the opinion filed today, we hold that absent further guidance from Congress, the term involuntary servitude under Sections 241 and 1584 necessarily means a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant either use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process. 
    We agree with the Court of Appeals that the convictions must be reversed because the District Court's instruction on involuntary servitude was too broad. 
    Justice Brennan with whom Justice Marshall joins and Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins, have filed opinions concurring in the judgment.
