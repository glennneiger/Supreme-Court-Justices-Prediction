speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="0.000" stopTime="50.827">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In the EEOC case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
    In that case, we hold that a state agency's waiver of the 60-day federal period provided by Title VII constitutes a termination of state proceedings so that the EEOC may immediately began to process the charge of discrimination. 
    Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case. 
    Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring into judgment. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia have joined. 
    Justice Kennedy took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
