    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    In second of the two cases, No. 87-4, Mark Erick Wheat versus United States. 
    Here the petitioner and numerous co-defendants were charged with participating in an elaborate drug distribution conspiracy. 
    At trial, two of the petitioner's co-defendants were represented by an attorney named, Eugene Iredale. 
    Shortly before his -- his trial was to commence, petitioner asked the District Court to allow the substitution of Iredale as his counsel as well. 
    Both petitioner and his co-defendants were willing to waive the right to conflict-free counsel but the District Court denied the substitution motion on the basis of what it perceived as to be irreconcilable and unwaiveable conflicts of interest for Iredale. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 
    In an opinion filed today, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that the District Court did not err in refusing to approve petitioner's proposed substitution of counsel. 
    Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Brennan joins. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun joins.
