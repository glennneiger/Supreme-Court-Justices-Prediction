    Mr. Richard D. Woods 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is a criminal case from the State of Texas, involving a death penalty which was imposed on the Petitioner, and a case that was tried in 1979, error complained of and the question presented before the Court is whether there was a denial of effective assistance to counsel in the allowing of testimony of Dr. James P. Grigson, a Dallas psychiatrist, during the punishment phase of the Defendant's trial. 
    The complained-of error is couched on this Court's decision in Estelle v. Smith in that counsel was not advised nor notified previously to the order appointing Dr. Grigson to examine the Defendant for two reasons. 
    One was for the purpose of determining competency to stand trial and the other was the purpose of determining future dangerousness.

    Mr. Richard D. Woods 
    Yes, sir, it was. 
    This order was signed and filed by the District Attorney's Office, the prosecutor in San Antonio, Texas, on April 18th, 1979. 
    Trial counsel was appointed April 10th, 1979. 
    The order was submitted to the Court in whose case, the Petitioner's case, was indicted. 
    So, counsel should have been advised prior to at least the examination of the Defendant. 
    The Defendant was not examined by Dr. Grigson till May 3rd of 1979.

speaker="richard_d_woods" startTime="739.898" stopTime="897.885">
    Mr. Richard D. Woods 
    Exactly. 
    And as far as the harm to be effected, we have to, of course, look at what a jury is going to do. 
    Is a jury... and do we have any type of a standard in which we can say what a jury is going to say. 
    I think as this Court said in Cal v. Romulus, California v. Romulus, that there's no objective or normative marker available to say what a jury is really thinking, and if, in fact, there is a harm or at least there is the error and if the error is of constitutional dimensions, such as in Estelle v. Smith, without the notice, then this Defendant has been harmed because the jury very well could have used that testimony, even though there may have been some very horrible fact situations underlying the prosecution. 
    We don't know, and for that reason, we cannot really peer into the minds of the jury and see exactly what they would do, and it's on that basis that I believe that harm has been made. 
    It is the conduct so much not of a state agency as it is of the prosecutor of an attorney, one in which knows by the ethical rules should be noticing opposing counsel of motions that are presented to the court. 
    This is exactly what is being complained of. 
    More so than anything else. 
    The harm... if this is harmless error, it is still the Government's burden of proving this beyond a reasonable doubt, and they have got to prove that the error did not contribute to the verdict of taint. 
    Now, I don't see how that could possibly in this case, especially since this Court has before reviewed the testimony of Dr. Grigson, and there's no question about it but for the notice provision, but for the availability of a defendant to have his counsel, at least to talk to him prior to such examination, he may not have said anything and there may not have been an examination, there may not have been even testimony, and this is one thing that is just so ever-presently clear. 
    There is continued repeated references made to the Dallas psychiatrist and that he was a medical doctor in the jury argument, and it's this basis in which the state's use of this improperly-admitted evidence that the Defendant was denied a fair trial, was denied effective assistance of counsel, and it's on that basis, following Chapman, upon the harmless error doctrine, that harm was made. 
    Harm was committed. 
    I reserve my time. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Charles A. Palmer
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="897.885" stopTime="906.389">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Woods. 
    Mr. Palmer, we'll hear now from you.
speaker="charles_a_palmer" startTime="906.389" stopTime="966.779">
    Mr. Charles A. Palmer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In disputing the harmless error finding of the Court below, the briefs filed by Satterwhite and by the amicus advance essentially two arguments. 
    The first being that this type of error can never be harmless, and as I understand Mr. Woods, he's abandoned that argument here today. 
    The second argument then, and the issue for the Court to decide, is whether on the facts of this case, the state proved that Dr. Grigson's testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    Now, we have made an argument that there was no Sixth Amendment violation in connection with Dr. Grigson's examination of Satterwhite. 
    Assuming for the sake of argument that we are wrong on that point, given the trial record before this Court, any error in the admission of Dr. Grigson's testimony certainly was harmless.

    Mr. Charles A. Palmer 
    Well, for a number of reasons. 
    First of all, Dr. Grigson's testimony was not as critical to the state's case on punishment as Satterwhite would have the Court believe. 
    It is true that his testimony was important in that it went to an ultimate issue on punishment, one of the two special issues submitted to the punishment phase of the Texas capital trial.

    Mr. Charles A. Palmer 
    He was the only medical doctor. 
    There was testimony from a psychologist, Dr. Schroeder, whose testimony was very similar to that of Dr. Grigson. 
    Her diagnosis of Satterwhite was virtually the same as that of Dr. Grigson, and there was no evidence by Satterwhite to the contrary, psychiatric or otherwise. 
    There was no evidence whatsoever presented by Satterwhite in either the guilt or the punishment phases.

    --I would not agree with that. 
    I've never met the man or heard him testify. 
    I don't have a personal opinion, but it's the state's position in this case that a particular witness' testimony cannot be deemed to be never harmless simply because he is a persuasive witness. 
    Under traditional harmless error analysis, the Court looks at the entire record of the case and considers the number of factors, including whether the state's case is overwhelming, whether the evidence is cumulative, whether it was important.

    There is no court order appointing Dr. Grigson. 
    There was an order entered on April 18th appointing Dr. Holbrook and I think, as Mr. Woods has stated, it was Dr. Grigson performing the examination instead of Dr. Holbrook.

    --He might have. 
    Our argument that counsel was put on notice is really twofold; one being the fact that the order was on file for two weeks prior to the examination, and the second part being that prior to counsel being appointed, Satterwhite had been examined by Dr. Schroeder, at which time he waived his Sixth Amendment right. 
    Between the time of Dr. Schroeder's examination and that of Dr. Grigson, counsel was appointed. 
    It strains credulity to assert that Satterwhite and counsel did not discuss the previous examination and any possible future examinations in light of that.

    Mr. Charles A. Palmer 
    But, again, the letter was placed in the file on that same day. 
    At the punishment hearing, the punishment hearing lasted five and a half hours, Dr. Grigson was one of a number of witnesses. 
    There were eight witnesses to Satterwhite's bad reputation. 
    There was testimony by the psychologist, Dr. Schroeder, whose diagnosis of Satterwhite was the same as that of Dr. Grigson. 
    There was testimony about Satterwhite's prior criminal record, two misdemeanor convictions, two felony convictions. 
    There was testimony about Satterwhite's violent nature. 
    A year and a half before the capital offense, he attacked his blind father-in-law in the man's home, shot him twice through the door, put him in the hospital for a month. 
    Some six months prior to this capital offense, he was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon which he attempted to pull from his waist band and use it on a policeman who accosted him. 
    In the face of all of this very damaging testimony, Satterwhite presented no evidence whatsoever, no psychiatric testimony, a reputation evidence, nothing. 
    It's... as I said, the punishment hearing lasted five and a half hours, and we really can't tell from the record how long Dr. Grigson was on the stand, but it was certainly not the bulk of that time or anything approaching it. 
    Now, as far as how the prosecutor relied on the testimony, again the record doesn't show how much time elapsed during the final argument on punishment, but it does show in the printed statement of facts of the trial that the prosecutor's argument occupied 291 lines of argument, nine of those were devoted to Dr. Grigson. 
    I would submit to the Court that that is not heavy reliance on Dr. Grigson's testimony. 
    Unless the Court is prepared to say that this type... well, perhaps I should back up a moment. 
    Only last term in Buchanan v. Kentucky, the Court stated that this type of error can be harmless. 
    In Buchanan, the defendant claimed that he was examined in violation of his right to counsel and that there was error in the admission of psychiatric testimony. 
    The Court rejected that, holding there was no Estelle v. Smith violation and then also stated, however, even if there had been, it would be harmless. 
    So, I think there's no substance whatsoever to Satterwhite's argument that this particular type of error cannot be harmless. 
    That being so, I would submit to the Court that certainly on this record, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    When the state puts on overwhelming evidence to support the issues on punishment and when the defendant puts on no evidence whatsoever, and when the complained-of testimony is essentially the same as that of properly-admitted testimony, it would seem that any error was harmless beyond any doubt whatsoever. 
    Satterwhite has chosen to focus on the fact that Dr. Grigson testified on a critical issue and from that argues that this can never be harmless. 
    However, the admission of a confession taken in violation of Miranda can be harmless. 
    Certainly, Dr. Grigson's testimony on punishment is no more damaging to the defendant than his own word inculpating himself. 
    If that sort of error could be harmless, we submit to the Court that this can, too, and that on this record, it certainly was.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Palmer. 
    Mr. Woods, you have fifteen minutes remaining.

    Mr. Richard D. Woods 
    I'll be short. 
    Your Honor, just in response, the representations I made are accurate. 
    It's one of these things that I don't think in a city the size of San Antonio, about the tenth largest in the nation here, that the counsel here can be charged with the responsibility of going each and every day to check the Court's jackets, and also with regard to this practice, local practice, in Texas or specifically San Antonio, usually motions are noticed to opposing counsel, and very rarely have I seen otherwise, and I believe that the Court can take the same posture.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1877.640" stopTime="1885.579">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, now, does this ordinarily require a motion? 
    Does the state ordinarily make a motion to the judge for an examination?
speaker="richard_d_woods" startTime="1885.579" stopTime="1892.934">
    Mr. Richard D. Woods 
    The practice has been. 
    Now, I'll say since the Estelle v. Smith was handed down, Dr. Grigson has not been used in San Antonio.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1892.934" stopTime="1902.473">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But supposing the state wants an examination of a defendant by an expert witness, is that ordinarily accomplished by a motion under Texas procedure?

    Mr. Richard D. Woods 
    Yes, sir, it is.

    Mr. Richard D. Woods

    Mr. Richard D. Woods 
    You may be right. 
    Or maybe not Mr. Satterwhite. 
    Counsel referred to Buchanan v. Kentucky in his argument and I'd just like to point out that in that case, the defense was used of extreme emotional disturbance. 
    They, in fact, did join with the prosecution in the motion for the psychiatric examination. 
    So, therefore, it could very well be deemed proper to use psychiatric evidence in rebuttal to a defensive issue. 
    We don't have that in this case. 
    There was no such allusion to any psychiatric evidence by the Defendant because no defense was raised. 
    And with that, I'll close. 
    Thank you.
