    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    In No. 87-267, D. H. Holmes Company, Limited versus McNamara, involves a state tax on commercial activities. 
    D. H. Holmes is a department store based in New Orleans and it had its merchandize catalogs printed out of state and shipped to its customers in Louisiana. 
    Louisiana levied a used tax on the value of these merchandize catalogs. 
    D. H. Holmes who was required to pay the tax argued that the imposition of this tax on its catalogs violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. 
    We disagree and find instead that the tax was fully consistent with the Commerce Clause. 
    We therefore affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Louisiana Court of Appeals and that opinion is unanimous.
