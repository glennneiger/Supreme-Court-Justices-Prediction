    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 87-6 Huddleston against United States. 
    This case involves the rules under which evidences admitted at trial under federal courts. 
    The defendant in this criminal case, Guy Rufus Huddleston was charged with possessing and selling stolen video cassette tapes in interstate commerce. 
    The only real question at his trial was whether he knew the tapes were stolen. 
    To prove this, the government sought to introduce an evidence at trial similar acts including evidence that Huddleston had previously sold for $28 purportedly new television sets were -- which were supplied to him by the same source that supplied the video tapes involved in this case. 
    The government's theory of relevance was that the television sets were stolen, and proof that Huddleston had engaged in other sales of stolen merchandise from the same suspicious source, would be strong evidence that he knew that the cassette tapes were stolen as well. 
    The District Court admitted the evidence under Federal Rule of evidence, 404(b) and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the conviction. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Contrary to the claim of the defendant, we hold that a trial court need not make its own preliminary finding that the similar act actually happened before it admits evidence to this effect. 
    Similar act of evidence they -- may be admitted so long as the jury can reasonably conclude that these similar acts occurred, and so long as it complies with the general provisions of the rules such as those requiring a balancing of the relevance of the evidence against the possible prejudice. 
    In this case, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant had previously sold stolen television sets and was entitled to weigh that fact against him in determining whether the video cassette tapes involved in this case had been stolen. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous.
