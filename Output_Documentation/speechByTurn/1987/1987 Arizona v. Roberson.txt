    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals of Arizona. 
    It involves custodial interrogation and its outcome is controlled by two other cases which also came to us from Arizona. 
    In 1966, in Miranda against Arizona, this Court announced an opinion that was intended to give concrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow in situations involving the questioning of a suspect being held in custody. 
    In 1981, in Edwards against Arizona, the Court held that a suspect, who has expressed his desire to deal with police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him unless the accused himself initiates further communication. 
    In 1984, in State against Routhier, the Arizona Supreme Court held that the Edwards' rule applies not only to questioning about the offense which gave rise to the suspect's arrest but also the questioning about an unrelated offense. 
    In this case, the Arizona courts followed the decision of the State Supreme Court in Routhier and the State has brought the case here for a review asking us to make an exception from the Edwards' rule. 
    For cases in which the police desire to interrogate a suspect about a second offense that is unrelated to the offense about which he was initially interrogated, we agree with the Arizona Supreme Court that this factual distinction does not have any legal significance for First Amendment purposes. 
    Accordingly, for reasons stated in the opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Arizona Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice has joined. 
    Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
