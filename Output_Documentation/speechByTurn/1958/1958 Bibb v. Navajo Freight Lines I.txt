speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="0.000" stopTime="136.691">
    Mr. David Axelrod 
    -- understanding of Mr. Wines' position in part of the oral argument -- I think Mr. Wines' position on the part of the State was that the statute here burdened interstate commerce but he did not concede, as I understand it that it was an undue burden on interstate commerce. 
    I apologize. 
    I perhaps misunderstood him. 
    And part of my argument wasn't predicated on that proposition but I do want to set the record the straight. 
    Yesterday, the question was asked as to whether or not the Interstate Commerce Commission had promulgated certain safety rules and regulations with respect to the kind of equipment that should be upon motor vehicles operating in interstate commerce. 
    And I'd like to direct your attention, if I may please, to the parts and accessories provision of the safety rules and regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    And the specific question was the extent or the type of equipment which was regulated pursuant to these safety rules and regulations. 
    The safety rules and regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission which governed the movement of motor vehicles in interstate commerce cover generally the category of lighting devices, reflectors and electrical equipment and there follow a detailed explanation of the kind of electrical equipment and lighting devices which are required. 
    There also follows a description of brakes with respect to their adequacy and detailed description with respect to that kind of regulation is also set forth. 
    There follows also a discussion and a requirement concerning the windows, the glazing and the window construction of the vehicles. 
    There follows a requirement with respect to the kind of fuel systems which are necessary. 
    There follows a requirement with respect to coupling devices and towing methods. 
    And then there is a subdivision which concerned itself with miscellaneous parts and accessories. 
    And among them are these, tires, heaters, windshield wiper, defrosting device, mirrors, horns, speedometer, exhaust system, protection against shifting cargo, flags and so forth. 
    Now, the Commission in connection with --

    It is best located, if I may suggest, in 54 M. C. C. 337 which is the Interstate Commerce Commission investigation report which I referred to yesterday wherein the question of the mudflaps was taken under consideration by the Commission in 1952. 
    And wherein that proceeding, the Commission determined that the question would be eliminated for the purpose of prescribing any uniformity with respect to mudflaps. 
    And the proceeding was discontinued on that basis. 
    In other words, the Commission there had before it, if it so desired, the opportunity to prescribe uniformly with respect to the mudflap requirement but decided not to do so.

    The safety rules and regulations from time to time are amended and changed as developments follow. 
    This proceeding in 1952 was a proposal which had for its purpose the possibility of revising the safety rules and regulations. 
    It was an interim step to determine whether or not in 1952, there should be any further revisions of the safety rules and regulations.

    To my recollection, it did not, Mr. Justice Black.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="334.411" stopTime="337.828">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, are you merely saying that the subject matter was canvassed before the Commission?
speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="337.828" stopTime="420.455">
    Mr. David Axelrod 
    Yes. 
    I am saying that the subject matter was canvassed and the report doesn't give a clear indication of the exact mudflap which was under consideration pro and con. 
    But I'm saying that the subject matter was canvassed. 
    And may I point out further that in the same decision of the Commission, the same investigation proceedings, the Commission went on to further indicate that, and I quote from it please if I may, that it is not the purpose either to abrogate the present state or local laws or to preempt the safety field to the exclusion of future state or local laws. 
    We believe that states and subdivisions should be allowed to enforce their laws and regulations relating to safety to the extent that compliance therewith by the person subject thereto would not preclude such persons from fully complying with the regulations prescribed here. 
    In other words, the Commission went on to say that although it was prescribing rules and regulations with respect to parts and accessories, it did not wish to abrogate, if it could or I doubt that it could, but it did not wish to abrogate the right of the rule -- of the states to require safety rules not inconsistent with its own federal rule, with its own ICC rule. 
    Now then --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="420.455" stopTime="422.307">

    But is it on ICC rule?

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="423.757" stopTime="435.422">

    Mr. David Axelrod 
    They say that in effect but they say it on a modified basis.

    They take the position that where they have covered the subject matter, they have preempted the feel.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, have they -- but -- but they refused to deal with this subject matter.

    Mr. David Axelrod 
    The -- the question was whether or not there was a need for a safety rule with respect to the subject matter, having in mind what I've indicated earlier in my argument that many of the States did not have any such rule whatsoever. 
    The Commission therefore, as I see it, took the position that there was no need for a rule by it, in connection with the subject matter at this time.

    Mr. David Axelrod 
    That is correct. 
    And I say that because apparently, the local rules existing then and the contour statute was not then in effect, were sufficient.

speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="555.180" stopTime="583.573">
    Mr. David Axelrod 
    No, it was not. 
    The contour statute was passed in 1955 and amended in 1957. 
    And we're challenging the 1957 Act. 
    The ICC report was in 1952. 
    At that time, the States have a uniform rule with respect to the kind of a mudflap, it was the straight mudflap. 
    And all States authorized the use of the straight mudflaps. 
    So that at that time, the Commission knowing the rules in existence in the various States, took the position that there was no need to cover the subject matter.

    We don't -- we do not take the position that there is a question of preemption of a field here.

    It would be -- yes, it would be a much lesser -- we would say that it was not a violation because the State or Arkansas in its rules and regulations, promulgated the kind of a rule which was uniform to the 25 other States which had a similar rule. 
    In other words, Arkansas, its requirement was for a straight mudflap. 
    This was the same requirement which would allow a vehicle licensed and equipped in Arkansas to be legal in every other State but the State of Illinois under the contour mudflap statute.

speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="778.456" stopTime="852.596">
    Mr. David Axelrod 
    In order -- well, the statute doesn't say how they should be put on but the testimony in the record show that this kind of a flap can only be put on either on the basis of it being welded or if it would be bolted, it would have to be bolted on the basis of having somebody go to the inside of the vehicle in order to put the bolt on the vehicle for the purpose of affixing the flap. 
    And so either way whether it's welded or bolted, the point is not whether they could be put on at the beginning. 
    The point is whether or not the vehicle could be stopped at the state line of Illinois. 
    And at that point, because of the owner requirement, could somebody put on a mudflap as a contoured kind at -- at the state line? 
    And the point we argued and showed was that this was impossible and the three-judge court so found that it couldn't be done, it was impracticable, and we pointed out that it would be unsafe and -- unsafe and contrary to the rules because nobody could enter a trailer that was carrying explosives for the purpose of either opening the trailer and these trailers move under seal. 
    They move close. 
    They move pursuant to Government orders. 
    And nobody could go into the inside of the trailer either to bolt or to weld this kind of a flap onto it.

    Mr. David Axelrod 
    Mr. Justice Whittaker, this isn't a case relating to the use of the state highway. 
    This is a case which relates to the right of a State to provide only a safety accessory. 
    There is a vital distinction as we see it between the use of a state highway and an accessory to be placed upon a vehicle which uses the state highway. 
    And that distinction is pointed out in Maurer versus -- in the Maurer case, Maurer v. Hamilton where the -- this Court pointed out the distinction between the right of the State to legislate with respect to size and width and weight. 
    That means the right to use the state highway. 
    And that right is predicated upon the reservation to the State in the Interstate Commerce Act in Section 225 specifically of a delegated and reserved right to the State to prescribe the weight, height and road condition. 
    I'm trying to point out the distinction as I see it in connection with your question.

    I'm sorry, but I presume those -- those exhibits -- they're pictorial exhibits, I beg your pardon. 
    They may not be in front of you. 
    But the contour mudflap is made of either a metal or a flexible material which is designed to contour the tire. 
    It in effect shrouds the tire. 
    Whereas, the straight mudflap is a mudflap which is affixed at the end of the trailer and is further removed from the tire wheel. 
    So that perhaps -- if you seen some vehicles operating on a highway, you probably noticed that of the back of the trailer, there are mudflaps hanging down almost to the roadway.

    These are made of rubber material and they're flexible. 
    And -- we point it out in -- in this connection.I think it might be interesting. 
    In this record, the indication shows, the evidence is clear that these contour flaps, because they are required by the statute, the contours of the tire are so close to it that the result is a very, very great brake fade characteristic. 
    In other words, it suffocates the heat. 
    It doesn't allow the heat to dissipate. 
    And we've shown in this record here where the result of the contour is to create a danger with respect to the efficiency of brake. 
    And we have had engineers testify in this case. 
    And the record so show that there result a brake fade.

    The State put in reference of the fact that it was a wet weather State.

    It may or may not be that they were taken under consideration. 
    But, we -- I would like to say this in response to your question. 
    I would say that the State -- the Commission would not be interested for the reason that our record very carefully describes the dangers and the unsafe characteristics of the contour mudflap. 
    We have safety engineers who said that they would not voluntarily put this kind of equipment on their vehicles unless they were forced to. 
    And they pointed out that this was a thing which was dangerous, not just safe. 
    In other words, they also pointed out simultaneously that wherever they could find anything else that was safe for their vehicles, and they were very proud of their safety records, they would put it on without respect to the question of cost.But here, they said, "Unless we are required to. 
    We will not put them on.”

    May I ask, Mr. Axelrod, was that under the power to do a tribute to the Commission, it could outlaw this contour device if it thought it would be a hazard to safety as you claim it is instead of being a protection against hazard. 
    But they outlaw it by saying we find that this uniform of this mudflap, it's all right if we find this as -- not only not all right but also creates a conflict and therefore we -- in the interest of uniformity practically adopt or allow instead of making a rule of our own or a prescription of our own, we allow any State that wants to have this flap uniformity but not anything else. 
    Could they do that in your view?

    I think that their power is one of a right to do it. 
    But I don't think that as a corollary thereto, they would have the right to say that a specific kind was unsafe because, then we would be running to the question of whether or not the ICC's power could supersede the right of a state legislature. 
    And I doubt whether the Commission would think that it had the power to say to a state legislature, “that which you have prescribed is unsafe.” 
    I think that --

    This Court has held repeatedly that the reserve power of a State can be invalidated by the Commerce Clause, that the Clause is a bulwark of protection against the attempt on the part of the State to legislate with respect to burdening interstate commerce.

    Mr. David Axelrod 
    That is correct but because of the fact that there was nothing at the time when it did not do that that had any question of conflict. 
    In other words, in 1952, when the Commission spoke on the subject, there was no question. 
    There was no conflict of questions. 
    We're talking here in terms of a subject matter that requires uniformity if there is to be action. 
    But if there isn't uniformity, then absent to any federal action. 
    We take the position that the Commerce Clause stand.

    That it --

speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="1492.737" stopTime="1505.915">
    Mr. David Axelrod 
    Our position is that the Illinois legislature cannot, not that the ICC could not.

    You have said that this law insofar as it was restricted to local intrastate Illinois traffic. 
    You're not challenging. 
    You're not -- your case doesn't allow you to challenge it. 
    You haven't got that kind of a case and your State Supreme Court has already sustained its restricted application to intrastate Illinois business.
speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="1525.633" stopTime="1572.173">
    Mr. David Axelrod 
    And the State Supreme Court has also pointed out in its decision sustaining the law that it did not concern itself with the burden question. 
    And may I quote from the State Supreme Court in Rudolph versus Bibb, the State Supreme Court said, “No question is raised under the Commerce Clause of the federal constitution.” 
    And further, the State Supreme Court, after the decision of the three-judge court in our case, acknowledged that fact and I referred to pages 36 and 37 of the appellant's brief where the State Supreme Court said, “It is difficult to see why the specified splash guard should be required on foreign vehicles passing through this State citing Navajo versus Bibb our three-judge court decision.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, then the real question and the only question is whether this is -- since you're not here challenging this as violative of due process --
speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="1580.487" stopTime="1581.279">
    Mr. David Axelrod 
    We are not.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1581.279" stopTime="1585.682">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- so the only -- the real question is, is this Southern-Pacific case?
speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="1585.682" stopTime="1654.292">
    Mr. David Axelrod 
    We rely on the Southern-Pacific and Morgan versus Virginia. 
    On those two cases, the State relied to Maurer versus Hamilton and the Barnwell case. 
    The State in its reply brief took the position that another case which it cited the Terminal Railroad Association brief was more applicable to our facts than the South -- Southern Pacific-Arizona case. 
    I've distinguished that yesterday by pointing out that in the Terminal case which was the caboose case, there was no record there with respect to the cost on the burden question. 
    But in the Terminal Railroad case, interestingly enough, there is a discussion of another case by way of a footnote known as the South Covington case. 
    It was a case involving a -- an ordinance of the City of Covington which attempted to regulate the number of trains which would have to operate between Covington and -- Covington and Cincinnati. 
    And the Court in that case held that statute was bad because it conflicted with Cincinnati. 
    And therefore, because of the conflict question, a burden on interstate commerce was invited and struck that statute down. 
    That case, we say supports our position and is in further support of Morgan and Southern Pacific.

speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="1687.733" stopTime="1714.196">
    Mr. David Axelrod 
    I will answer that no because they took the position that that issue was irrelevant. 
    That the sole issue was the right of the state legislature to act and that the state legislative act carried with it a presumption of validity. 
    And they generally took the position that that was not involved because as a matter of fact, much of the testimony of the plaintiffs in the lower court was admitted. 
    The basis of the interstate commerce interchanged operations and the like.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm turning to the question put to you by Justice Stewart yesterday. 
    If the State said that issue is not before the Court because if this is a safety measure and would be found to be a safety measure and it may be found to be a safety measure on the presumption that the legislation itself carries then why didn't they say that that is not an issue and therefore they ought to meeting the issues.

    No. 
    I mean isn't that the fact if -- if Illinois said, “That is not an issue before, Your Honors.” 
    At one point they were asked whether they weren't really suggesting that as to automobiles, the Southern Pacific case doesn't apply because railroads are different.

    If that is rejected as -- even though the question of undue burden of interstate commerce as to which you did address yourself the witnesses. 
    But as to what the State said, that's not an issue. 
    Why does it not become an issue if the ground of their defense falls?
speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="1807.541" stopTime="1814.407">
    Mr. David Axelrod

    That's correct.

    I don't think that the State in trying its case tried it properly under the facts in Morgan and Southern Pacific. 
    We think we did. 
    We think we've adhere to the principles annunciated in Morgan and Southern Pacific. 
    The lower court thought so because it distinguished Morgan and Southern Pacific from Maurer and Barnwell in a very interesting discussion. 
    And I think that the lower court accurately summarized the law applicable to the facts. 
    We think it was a commendable opinion with respect to a dissertation upon the subject.

    If I may request a question.

    You did but they didn't. 
    They thought that they could rest on their claim that this is a safety measure justified or indicated by local police policy. 
    Now, whether rightly or wrongly, they didn't go into the other issue, they didn't so it appear. 
    And my question is what Justice Stewart's question yesterday was, are they therefore foretold from leading the issue if they choose? 
    In case one should agree with you and say, yes on this record there is ostensible or prima facie of undue burden.

    So they attempted to justify it a little bit but they didn't go far enough.

    Well why if -- if your position is correct that the entire constitutional question depends upon resolutions of factual issues. 
    Why in conformity with this Court many times repeated to you that it will not determine constitutional questions until or unless the necessity to do so arises, why wouldn't it be appropriate if this Court agree with you to remand this to the District Court to give the State a full opportunity to present its evidence on the facts and to give therefore that court a fuller opportunity that it is not add up to now to resolve the facts.

    The larger point is the delays and the insurmountable objects that would be involved in connection with the attempt to move trailers by interchange from California to New York through Illinois where a carrier with a trailer in California would be required under the statute to have his California trailer start out with a contour-equipped trailer so that it could go through Illinois to get to the State of New York. 
    That trailer carrying explosives, that trailer carrying perishables which is the lifeline of the truck business, is the kind of burden that would be involved in this case among other things.

    As to issues, the case was not tried as adequately. 
    It was scared to try it. 
    It went back as to issues not actually contested for, not as to that it might deal with the same question that it is being (Inaudible) more contemplated.

    Well, I may say if you are the Attorney General who made that statement over your signature, one member of the Court, I will give a great weight in connection with whether you had -- the issue had been properly presented.

    Mr. Axelrod has made apparent what the situation is with respect to the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    The text -- the diction that Mr. Axelrod read to Your Honors proclaims that Commission's intention to leave intact state regulations. 
    And we submit that this regulation is a reasonable one so shown even on the present record for the reasons that I have urged.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You're not implying though, you just said that -- that it may take fair attitude on the part of the Commission. 
    It draws a challenge to a state law that in fact it does undue burden commerce.

    Yes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3015.266" stopTime="3044.199">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- just to see what your position is. 
    Suppose it is true that Arkansas forbid the use of the kind of mudflap that your State does, and your State forbids the use of the other one and that it is a fact that Arkansas shipment coming up with (Inaudible) have to make changes in connection with the mudflap that would be dangerous. 
    Would you say that was not to be an undue burden or would you?
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="3044.199" stopTime="3086.130">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    I would say that the evidence in this record shows that the contour type mudguard required by the Illinois law although not nearly as equivalent as the flat-type mudguard is a superior mudguard. 
    There is no reason that I know of for requiring of flat -- a flat-type mudguard and -- although the question is not -- was not raised in this record, I say that the Arkansas regulation is an unreasonable regulation not because it permits but because it requires a flat-type when there is no reason for requiring.

    What does yours require?
