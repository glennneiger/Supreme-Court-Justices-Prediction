The Monrosa v. Carbon Black Export, Inc.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 178, Steamship Monrosa, petitioner versus Carbon Black Export Company. 
    Mr. McGowan.
speaker="joseph_t_mcgowan" startTime="13.003" stopTime="325.344">
    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    In this case, an Italian ship owner issued 27 bills of lading at United States ports of loading Houston, Texas and New Orleans, Louisiana. 
    These bills of lading were issued with the purpose of covering a shipment of some 30,000 bags of carbon black from those ports to various ports in Italy. 
    Prior to the execution and the issuance of those bills of lading, the Italian ship owner inserted a clause in that bill of lading which is substance provided that in the event that any dispute arose under the bill of lading that that dispute must be litigated in the courts of Genoa -- Genoa, Italy exclusively. 
    The assertion of that bill of lading or that clause in the bill of lading gives rise to the two questions now before the Court. 
    The first question is, is that clause valid and enforceable against an American citizen? 
    And the second is whether the prohibition of a legal action against the captain or ship owner or their agents includes an action in rem or an action against the carrying vessel itself. 
    Sense the issuance of the bill of lading and that document is a very important feature in this case. 
    I think perhaps we take -- we should take a minute or two to discuss briefly the background of a shipment going from the United States to foreign port. 
    Usually there are three parties involved. 
    You have the American producer, the manufacturer of the goods. 
    You have the far consumer and you have the intermediary ocean carrier. 
    Usually the procedure and the consumer get together and arrange for the delivery of certain specified amount of cargo to be delivered at a certain specified date in a foreign port. 
    Thereupon the American producer, even through its own traffic department or through its agents, usually a freight forwarder contacts various steamship companies who have or which have vessels going to the port of destination. 
    These steamship companies are not very hard to contact because they have their own solicitors, their own salesman who are constantly contacting shippers of cargo. 
    The ship owner who has a ship available, who will meet the date agreed upon by the producer and the consumer is chosen. 
    And arrangements are made for the shipment of the cargo to arrive at the port of loading in time to meet the vessel so that the vessel concerned can arrive in time at the foreign port. 
    When the cargo arrives at the ports of loading in the United States, they are received for by the carrier. 
    And when they are loaded on board the carrier's vessel, thereupon a bill of lading has issued. 
    Now what is a bill of lading? 
    A bill of lading is loosely called a contract. 
    But is it -- it is an important commercial document because it is an acknowledgement by the ocean carrier that it has received the certain amount of cargo and of course it enables the consumer to obtain delivery of that cargo when the cargo arrives at following port. 
    Now oftentimes a shipment never sees a bill of lading until it is signed by the carrier or its agents at the port of loading. 
    It is not a contract in the usual sense. 
    That is, two people do not sit down over a table and discuss the terms of carriage. 
    This bill of lading has been printed and used by the carrier for a number of years in its business, and everytime there is a favorable decision for the carrier issued by the court, you can be sure that that clause or it's concern which is going to give the carrier that benefit, is inserted in this bill of lading. 
    Now this bill of lading is about legal size cap and I can demonstrate. 
    And this one, one of these bills of lading which issued in this case contains besides the usual acknowledgement of receipt of a cargo, 39 printed clauses. 
    You cannot read these clauses unless you want to strain your eyes without a magnifying glass. 
    Now the courts of our country have called a bill of lading a contract of adhesion. 
    That is, a shipper of the cargo has no alternative but to accept the bill of lading and to adhere to its terms. 
    It is not a contract issued at the negotiation. 
    Now applying to those facts to this case --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="325.344" stopTime="331.211">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was all bills of lading regulated by any kind of governmental oversight?
speaker="joseph_t_mcgowan" startTime="331.211" stopTime="355.412">
    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    No sir. 
    The only thing that I would say is the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act provides that when you have a bill of lading issued in this country, covering cargo being shipped out that the terms and conditions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act must be inserted in that clause. 
    Now of course there are some others like the Pomerene Act also that covers the issuance of the bill of lading.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="355.412" stopTime="366.546">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well those carry the goods -- carry the goods by sea allow the carrier to put anything he pleases into a bill of lading? 
    You said the restrictions in Carriage of Goods Act itself aren't they?
speaker="joseph_t_mcgowan" startTime="366.546" stopTime="389.807">
    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    Well let me put it this way. 
    They have this in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act clause Section 3 subdivision 8 which provides that if a carrier attempts to insert any bill of lading, any clause which number one, relieves enough liability or attempts to lessen its liability, then that clause is null and void. 
    And that's also becomes important in this case sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="389.807" stopTime="404.926">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So presumably if anything else put in the bill of lading not in conflict with the Carriage of Goods Act is deemed to be a voluntary act of the contractor or the party unless a matter of public policy if the court tracks it down as against public policy, is that right?
speaker="joseph_t_mcgowan" startTime="404.926" stopTime="417.692">
    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    Well no sir, because I don't think that it's a voluntary act to the party because I don't think a bill of lading can be termed in the same classification as the ordinary contract.

    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    Well not declared against public policy, there could -- I think sir, it comes now to the point that you have to recognize the fact that a shipper is in a no bargaining position. 
    I mean --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="440.744" stopTime="446.205">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well I don't recognize the fact if a shipper has a choice of carrier.

    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    Well there is no issue here sir, perhaps he has a choice of carrier, so a load of this are mentioned in this case (Inaudible) does have vessels calling at the ports of Genoa. 
    There is no allegation in this case that those vessels could have met the delivery dates, shows somebody a different consumer of the cargo.

    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    Sir I don't think -- we had that yesterday sir. 
    I don't think -- I think it's in the holdings of our Courts where you have an arbitration agreement. 
    The court says that an arbitration agreement itself does not answer the courts of jurisdiction. 
    What it does is, an arbitration agreement, two parties get together and they have agreed that they're going to -- they are going to settle their dispute very quickly and in an economic fashion. 
    But the courts do retain jurisdiction over -- over the arbitration because I can come back If I lose in an arbitration, I can come back into court and I can offset that arbitration agreement if -- if -- let's say -- if the arbitrators have been prejudiced or biased or some of the other various grounds set forth in arbitration to laws.

    If you call (Inaudible) on the arbitrator, he can be guilty of murder.

    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    That's right.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1089.550" stopTime="1143.134">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I'm suggesting to you that when there's an arbitration agreement and you bring this to court and the defense is made that there's an arbitration clause, that litigation and that court ceases. 
    And subsequently the arbitrators commit fraud or decide that there is not enough pride, then you can say this arbitration has no findings. 
    But that doesn't uphold this largely fact that the shipper and a carrier may constitutionally decide not to go to court. 
    That's what this court is held, as you well know in 264 U.S. 
    And the government is subject that that oust the court of jurisdiction. 
    Because, they can make an agreement not to go court, that's all right with regard to the (Inaudible) clause of constitution is concerned, is that true?

    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    Yes sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1329.637" stopTime="1331.363">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I'd like to hear that myself.
speaker="joseph_t_mcgowan" startTime="1331.363" stopTime="1575.524">
    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    I'll go into that now sir. 
    One of the arguments advanced by the petitioners which says that the -- this clause 27 is valid, is that Congress and the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act did not state any particular form of forms in which an agreed cargo owner could insert -- could litigate its claim. 
    Now the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act contains a clause, Section 3 subdivision 8, which reads, “Any clause covenant or agreement in a contract of carriage where leaving the carrier or the ship from liability or loss or damage to or in connection with the goods arising from the negligence fault or failing of duties and obligations provided in this section or lessening such liability otherwise then is provided in this act shall be null and void and of no effect.” 
    Now I say that that clause states in substance that the carrier has only those benefits which are provided for in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act. 
    That holding was set forth in the United States against (Inaudible) Sugar Company which is affirmed by this Court. 
    But I am referring to the opinion in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    I say this clause, clause 27 which gives a carrier an additional benefit not provided for in the Carriage Goods by Sea Act is null and void and of no effect as so provided by Section 3, subdivision 8. 
    Now while I am on a point, I would like to go -- I like to tell the court this. 
    I don't think that Congress could really set forth a sufficient number of forms in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act to provide for all possible litigation under this Act. 
    Now there are a number of what we call one-ship operators. 
    That is a ship owner which is incorporated to operate one ship only. 
    Now they are both United States and they are foreign. 
    So if you have this one ship, call it the Port of Houston as to this case and pick up the cargo and carry it to Genoa 50 and a cargo was discharged in a damaged condition because of the negligence of the carrier, and if there would -- should be certain provisions in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act which would say that litigation could only be brought in a form or a jurisdiction where the ship or the consignee has it's place of business or the ship owner has its place of business, or the place in which the cargo was shipped or delivered. 
    And the ship returns to the United States and is calling up one port only and that should be the Port of San Francisco, then we would be prohibited by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act starting an action in San Francisco. 
    That is a universal rule of -- in Admiralty Law that a lifebelt who has a maritime lead against the vessel has the right to sue the vessel in a jurisdiction where the vessel can be found. 
    I quote -- I stole that language from the case in the Fifth Circuit, it's called -- it's the (Inaudible) case. 
    So I say that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, not having provided for any special form or not having given any particular court jurisdiction over any particular claim does not disturb that universal rule in admiralty law and gives us the right to start and -- and act in any jurisdiction where the vessel can be found and then we get back to Section 3, subdivision 8 and I say that the clause herein is limiting our forms especially as far as in rem causes of action is concerned and is invalid.

    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    No sir. 
    I don't have to assume that there will be anything. 
    Well I'm on a public policy question. 
    The petitioners make the further argument in this case and that clause 27 should be enforced because it would have to be so that American ship owners -- shippers of cargo will in the future use American ships solely. 
    I think that argument is very unique because here we have an Italian ship owner pleading before the United Supreme Court that this clause should be enforced -- enforced with that sole purpose only. 
    With the only result could mean that the Italian ship owner would suffer a severe economic loss because it ships and they have ten of them would be returning from the United States to Italy with empty hauls. 
    I also say that the court cannot say that American ships, shippers of cargo should use American ships only, because as I think Judge Whittaker raised a question yesterday, “What would happen if American ships were not available to call at foreign ports within a certain specified period. 
    What would happen if the American ships do not port at certain ports at all? 
    I don't think that this court would place American manufacturers or shippers of cargo in a position where they could be sued upon contracts for breaches of contracts and failing to make late deliveries or suffer an economic loss because we don't have American ships falling at certain ports. 
    I say, if an Italian ship owner or a foreign ship owner is doing businesses in our country and is soliciting our trade, the least it might be bound is by the rules of our courts and they should submit themselves to the jurisdictions of our courts of courts. 
    They should not be granted any special immunity whereby they could escape the practices of our court or for litigating in our court. 
    They should not be given a special privilege whereby they can deprive an American citizen of a substantial right of selecting the form in which to litigate his action.

    It being understood and agreed that every other tribunal in a place or places where the goods were shipped or landed is incompetent. 
    I understand by that sir that this clause or the Italian ship owner says that the District Court in Houston, Texas where the cargo was loaded is without jurisdiction.

    Sir, as an accepted rule, a principle that shippers of cargo do not deal at arm's length with carriers. 
    And may I quote sir from this case, as found on page 25 in a footnote and It says, “Obviously the individual shipper has no opportunity to repudiate the document agreed upon by the trade even if he has actually examined it at all of its 28 lengthy paragraphs of which this clause is number nine. 
    This lack of equality of bargaining power has long been recognized in our law. 
    And the stipulations for unreasonable exception of the carrier have not been allowed to stand.”

    Yes sir, I think so. 
    That's what I cited my brief sir. 
    So I'd like to deal if I may, I think we've covered the public policy and I would like to deal with the substantial right of American citizens to sue on this court. 
    I referred this court to the case of Ford against the Grand Trunk Railway Company. 
    Now I admit that that case involved a Federal Employer's Liability Act and that that Act provided that an injured employee may sue in a place where he resides, the place where the court of action arose or in any place where the defendant carrier was doing business. 
    The defendants in the -- I'm sorry. 
    The railroad employee was injured, and the railroad company made certain payments for -- necessary to the employee. 
    When these payments were made, the railroad company had the employee sign a receipt which stipulated that in the event that the employee's case could not be settled and it was forced to go to litigation. 
    That he would bring in -- his action in one, the place, the jurisdiction where he resided or two, the place where the course of action arose that is where he was injured.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2577.889" stopTime="2579.241">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    To what case are you referring to?
speaker="joseph_t_mcgowan" startTime="2579.241" stopTime="3039.086">
    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    Floyd Case sir. 
    It's found on page 21 of my brief. 
    The railroad employee sues, and instead of suing in the two places specified in the agreement, he sued in that very jurisdiction. 
    The railroad company thereupon moved to dismiss the action. 
    And this court, the case found its way up to this court and this court says that the agreement to the railroad company and the employee violated Section 5 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 
    In that, by the agreement the railroad companies sought to exempt themselves from liability. 
    I say in this case, clause 27 should be raised with Section 1303 (a) or Section 3 subdivision (a) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and we must come to the same inevitable conclusion. 
    Now the ruling in the Floyd case, I say was enlarged by the ruling in Wilko against Swan which involved an interpretation of the Securities Act. 
    In that case, a broker and a customer was doing business. 
    The cause of false representation by the broker, the customer ports certain stocks which instead of going up, went down and he sued the broker to recover for his loss. 
    There was an agreement between the broker and -- and the -- and the customer which provided that there was any disputes between the two, the agreements would be arbitrated. 
    Now in the course of its discussion, this Court said that citizens have a substantial right in which to select the form in which they are to litigate these claims. 
    It also said that any agreement made in the advance of controversy, which is the agreement here. 
    Is good or a different footing from those made in agreements made after the controversy has arisen and it infer and I think it really helped that agreements made in the advance of controversy which seek to oust the courts of jurisdiction are invalid. 
    The petitioners in trying to enforce this clause as being reasonable rely on three cases, commonly referred to as the Muller case, the Kearsarge case and a (Inaudible) case, all of which were decided in the Second Circuit. 
    I call the court's attentions to this fact, that in those three cases, it is recognized that the courts, by contract cannot oust that the parties, I'm sorry, by contract cannot oust the courts of jurisdiction. 
    What those cases -- or the courts did on those cases was to consider the facts and each one of those cases. 
    And then find out whether or not the form selected by the libeler was convenient for the file of issues. 
    Now in the Oklahoma or the Muller case, the cargo was loaded on board the Oklahoma at Dockenberg (Inaudible) suite. 
    During the voyage from the United States -- from Sweden to the United States, the Oklahoma sunk. 
    It never reached the United States. 
    One crew members was saved or returned to Sweden. 
    In the Kearsarge case, the cargo was loaded on board the vessel in Peru and the cargo was discharged at European courts. 
    That vessel on that voyage never called at any port in the United States. 
    No part of the contract of carriage was performed in the United States, so too in the (Inaudible) 
    The cargo in that case was loaded on board the vessel and headed for Belgium and discharged at the (Inaudible) 
    No part of the contract of carriage was performed in the United States the vessel did not call on the United States either. 
    So on every single major issue in all three cases that is, the condition of the cargo, the storage of the cargo, the seaworthiness of the vessel, the issuance of the bill of lading and the loss while all -- all of the testimony on all issues was available in foreign courts only. 
    In this case, I repeat, the cargo originated in the United States. 
    It was delivered to the ocean carrier in the United States. 
    It was loaded on board the vessel in the United States. 
    The voyage commenced in the United States and the Bills of Lading were issued in the United States. 
    Thus, on all important issues, testimony is available right here in the United States. 
    Now I'd like to get back to this question of the origin -- where the voyage originates. 
    All of the case law is that the vessel must be in a seaworthy condition where the cargo was taken on board the vessel. 
    In this case, the vessel must have been seaworthy on loading of the cargo at Houston and New Orleans, not in Genoa of Italy. 
    Now, I like to call the Court's attention to this fact. 
    The bill of lading is printed in English. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said, that that was indication on a part of the parties that I dispute arising under the bill of lading would be decided by an English court. 
    The bill of lading also incorporates the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act. 
    And this Court has held in the Gulf Case, which is referred on -- on page 32 and 33 of my brief, that there is an appropriateness to, in having the trial of a diversity case and a form that is at (Inaudible) with the state law that must govern the case rather than having a court in some other form untangle problems and conflicts of law and in law foreign to itself. 
    Thus I say, this Court has recognized the fact that where the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act or some other American law is involved and if there are sufficient reasons to keep the case in the United States that that case should be kept in the United States. 
    Now, I like to deal with my course of action in rem. 
    It is conceded in this case that we have two courses of action. 
    One, in personam and that is against the ocean carrier. 
    And the second one, in rem, that is against the carrying vessel. 
    Law 27 states that no legal proceedings against the captain or ship owner or their agents may be brought in any jurisdiction other than the courts in general already. 
    It does not speak of an action in rem.

    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    No, no, I mean I'm thankful for it. 
    The petitioners say at least in their brief -- the argument is not made and they reply to it. 
    That in the Muller, the Kearsarge and the (Inaudible) Cases, the courts in the Second Circuit did not make a dis -- did not distinguish between in personam and in rem actions. 
    I think my statement of the facts in those cases really answers the problem. 
    That this vital point was not before the courts in those cases for the simple reason, in the Muller case, the carrying vessel, the SS Oklahoma sunk. 
    In the Kearsarge case, the Kearsarge was not named as a respondent, and if it was named a respondent, jurisdiction was never obtained over the vessel. 
    And in the (Inaudible) case, I will admit that the (Inaudible) was named as a respondent. 
    But jurisdiction was never obtained over the vessel. 
    In other words, process was never issued against them. 
    It was really not a respondent. 
    Just naming a vessel as a respondent in a libel does not necessarily give the court jurisdiction over the vessel. 
    The carrier, the petitioners also refer to three cases which they substantiate the proposition that you cannot divorce an in rem action from an in personam action. 
    Those cases are the Smith, the Bennett, and the Samuels Cases. 
    And each of those three cases, the court found that a longshoreman employed by a ship owner and loading or unloading the ship owner's vessel was injured. 
    The longshoreman's right against the ship owner or his employer are governed by the longshoreman and Harbor Worker's Act. 
    That act provides that the longshoreman can recover in certain instances and sort of regulates the amount. 
    The longshoreman was not satisfied with this procedure and went against the vessel. 
    The Courts of Appeal I think for the Second and Third and the Fifth Circuit said, “That Congress, when it enacted the longshoreman on the Harbor Worker's Act intended that they ensure -- longshoreman's right should be exclusively adjudicated by the provisions of that act. 
    The holding in those cases is clearly expressed in a case of Central Railroad Company of New Jersey against Burns Brothers which is referred to on page 43 of our brief. 
    In that case, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated that Smith against (Inaudible) McDowell and Samuels against Monsoon Steamship Company on which the Central Railroad relies are irrelevant. 
    They decided no more than that in a longshoremans and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act, Congress meant to make exclusive the liabilities that it (Inaudible) opposed. 
    And that same proposition can be applied to the Consumers Products Case or Imports Case which is referred to in the petitioner's reply brief -- I think it's in this last point.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    One thing that puzzles me on the argument that you are making based on the Second Circuit case, is you seemed to be on a head-on collision with your opponent as to where the convenience, balance of convenience lies. 
    You say all the witnesses in New York this is all the witness are related. 
    Are you as far apart as that?
speaker="joseph_t_mcgowan" startTime="3398.295" stopTime="3589.771">
    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    I say no sir. 
    I'd say in this case, I'd like to say, I'd like to go -- I'll attack his points one by one. 
    He says that the more convenient to try the issue here or reasonable to try the issue here because one, the s -- Monrosa -- the Genoa vessel, the crew members are residents of Italy the third one is that the seaworthiness of the vessel becomes important because a lot of testimonies in Italy in general average has been declared the cargo was discharged to the port of Genoa. 
    The market value is available. 
    The testimony in Genoa and the seventh argument is that American shippers of cargo should use American ships. 
    Now I say, the fact that the vessel is Genoese has absolutely no bearing on the merits of this case and can be excluded. 
    The fact that the crew members and the offices are residents of Italian -- of Italy is very important in this case because when this action was commenced, we thought the responded, Carbon Black Export Inc. 
    sought to take the testimony of those witnesses in Houston, Texas at the same time the vessel was on port. 
    Now the vessel has also returned to the United States on a number of occasions but the respondent, the petitioners here never sought to take their testimony. 
    Thus, all of those issues, all of those issues could have been resolved if they had submitted the crew members and -- and the offices to the jurisdiction of the District Court in Texas because we could have taken their testimony and we were willing to pay for all those expenses. 
    So I say on that point, we can discount that point because that really shows the unreasonable attitude of the petitioners where we expect that the seaworthiness of a vessel, I say that most of that testimony is available here in Houston and -- and New Orleans. 
    Because in a number of five polls together with the Carbon Black, there was stone, a number of iron clumps of chemicals. 
    The iron drums broke loose, crashed against the plates of the vessel and one of the plates being wasted, cracked and allowed to the entry of sea water into the hole. 
    So the storage of the cargo becomes very important and that's only available at the ports of Houston and Texas. 
    The market value and the amount of cargo damage can practically be stipulated. 
    And the fact that a general average has been declared has no bearing on this case because if the loss in fact was occurred because the vessel was un-seaworthy on leaving the ports of Houston and Texas and the general average resulted there from, the general average is invalid. 
    So I say as against that, we have all of the testimony on condition of cargo, storage of cargo, seaworthiness of vessel and the commencement of the voyage, the issuance of the bill of lading and other -- all other important issues available right here in the United States. 
    So I say there is a great convenience but a trial of this action here in the United States and not general rhythm.

    District Court, another one?

    Mr. Joseph T. McGowan 
    Well, they said if there was -- the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit went to every single fact involved in this case. 
    It wrote a seven or eight page decision and it analyzed all the facts. 
    The District Court, all it said was the clause was not unreasonable and dismissed my libel. 
    It didn't even discuss my action in rem. 
    I think it was an abuse of discretion. 
    Of course it's reviewable -- it's reviewable and appealable since my libel was in fact dismissed. 
    I say in conclusion that this clause should be held invalid because is it against -- it is against public policy. 
    I also say that my in rem action should be restored. 
    I also say it is more convenient to try the case here for the reasons that I have given. 
    There is not one single reported case in any book whereby a clause similar to the one involved in this litigation has been declared enforceable or whereby any court has review, has declined to take jurisdiction of the action where the cargo originated in the Untied States. 
    The contract, at least the part was performed in the United States. 
    The bills of lading were issued in the United States. 
    The American -- the dockers are American citizen and an in rem cause of action has been perfected.

   Argument of E. D. Vickery
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3690.228" stopTime="3691.549">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. E. D. Vickery.
speaker="e_d_vickery" startTime="3691.549" stopTime="3990.783">
    Mr. E. D. Vickery 
    May it please the court. 
    The onset I would like to say, if the petitioners -- because they attempted to get their respondent to live up to the provision of the contract, they wouldn't take testimony in this case until they got a decision of the District Court on that question. 
    If that makes us unreasonable in connection with this litigation, then we have taken an unreasonable attitude with respect to it. 
    Now on the depositions of the crew in Houston, this libel was filed two days before those depositions were noticed. 
    They saw them on two grounds, discovery and De bene esse under the admiralty statutes. 
    We objected to the depositions because our first knowledge of this case in any damage came when the libel was filed. 
    We had no information whatsoever from Italy. 
    We had no opportunity to get any information to prepare for the deposition. 
    This matter was submitted to the United States District Court and he held in both instances that the respondent was not legally entitled to take the deposition. 
    Either De bene esse or as discovery. 
    No further attempts were made to get these depositions. 
    We received one phone call in the summer of 1956 indicating that they thought the ship would be back in September and they might want to take the depositions then. 
    At that time the motion was pending before the United States District Court and no effort was made to proceed with the deposition. 
    I think that really is a collateral matter. 
    It's true. 
    have we not had the jurisdictional question involved in this case, this case would have long ago been tried and disposed off before the United States District Court down in Houston. 
    But that doesn't have anything to do with the convenience of the forum for a trial of the issues. 
    Now I want to allude just very briefly to the Muller Case of the Second Circuit. 
    I think that in the Muller Case, you have just as much evidence needed in the Muller Case and the United States as you have in this case. 
    That cargo was destined for Philadelphia. 
    The market value of the cargo did not reach Philadelphia would have to be proved and obviously would have to be approved by the best available evidence that would be available in Philadelphia. 
    All of the other evidence was foreign. 
    And I think the record amply reflects that in this particular case, substantially all of the evidence is obtainable only in Italy. 
    Now I recognize that Mr. McGowan and I don't agree on this particular point. 
    What I'm saying to this court, I only wish that my duty in representing the petitioner in this case to show due diligence to make the vessel sea worthy attached in Houston and New Orleans. 
    Boy that would be easy and I submit to this Court, I would be delighted if that was the extent of my burden in this case. 
    But the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act says, “You have to prove due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy before and after commencement of the voyage.” 
    We can't just stop by proving the condition of the vessel. 
    At Houston, we've got to show that we have used due diligence all along the line. 
    We don't have to show that the vessel in fact was seaworthy at the time it left Houston. 
    We only have to show that diligence was used. 
    It may have been un-seaworthy when it left Italy because of a latent defect. 
    But we don't have to prove it was seaworthy, we have to show our diligence and we have to show our diligence starting not in Houston and New Orleans but we have to start in Italy. 
    And in all probability to make out a case, we're going to have to start with the last annual inspection of this vessel. 
    Just when this was, I don't know. 
    It may have been as long as eight or nine months prior to the time that the vessel broke down in Italy. 
    So it's not a simple matter of offering a few witnesses in Houston or a few witnesses in New Orleans and the petitioners discharging their burden show that they used due diligence to make this vessel seaworthy. 
    Our burden is substantially greater than this and I submit to this Court on the fact the amount of evidence required in this country, in the Muller case and in this case they are almost identical. 
    Now if I may, I should like to elude you some questions previously asked by some members of the Court, particularly Mr. Justice Frankfurter made an inquiry early in the argument with respect to whether or not the shipper actually signed the bill of lading. 
    It's true the shipper does not actually sign the bill of lading, but the shippers own broker, the shippers agent in Houston prepares the bill of lading and submits it to the vessel owner for his signature and the vessel owner issues it if it is in proper form. 
    Now admittedly, the broker normally gets a printed form of the particular line on which he is shipping. 
    That is the type of bill of lading that the ship owner wants and normally requires but it --

    Mr. E. D. Vickery 
    We are -- we are consulted frequently in our practice both by American and by foreign ship owners with respect to the advisability of either deleting or adding additional policies to the bills of lading. 
    I cannot state to the Court in my tenure experience that we have ever had a request for a deletion of this type of clause or whether or not, it would be granted. 
    I -- I have not had any experience on that. 
    We're consulted frequently with respect to clauses either deleting certain portions of clauses or adding additional clauses on the front of the bill of lading to specify the particular requirements. 
    This often is necessary in connection with the financial arrangements that have been made and so far as the cargo is concern.

    39 was the date which I had. 
    Now they mention -- I believe Mr. Justice Harlan had a question with respect to the Carriage of Goods by Sea and the possible lessening of liability under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act of by this particular agreement. 
    Counsel touched on that very briefly, but I think if you will look -- if you will read the Muller case which undoubtedly, you will do, you will see the real basis for their argument that -- that it lessens liability. 
    It is nothing more than it would probably be cheaper for them to try the case as they would add some extra expenses if they went to Italy or they argue in their brief that if you send them to Italy then they're going to have to forego any $1,000 claim they have because it's not economically feasible to submit a thousand dollar claim in a foreign form. 
    Those are -- those are just great stretches of the imagination to try to bring this agreement within the limiting liability clause. 
    And of course in both instances you have to assume that the foreign tribunal is not going to correctly apply the law or that they're going to ignore the provision in the contract with the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act apply before you can in fact have any lessening of liability and I don't think that -- that this court or any court should take judicial notice of the fact that a foreign tribunal will not apply the contract in the terms as written.

    All the legislative history indicates to us, Mr. Justice Black, is that Congress was aware of acts in Canada and acts in Australia that had such clauses in them as well as the acts of various other countries. 
    They were very careful in enacting this legislation to ensure that they had a uniform act.

speaker="e_d_vickery" startTime="4553.595" stopTime="4565.013">
    Mr. E. D. Vickery 
    Well I think simply because of Congress' attempt to specifically spell out those things that it wanted to apply to ocean shipments and those that it did not.

    Or why should it reaffirm the law which according to the Muller case had been the settled law in this country for a long time.
speaker="e_d_vickery" startTime="4572.808" stopTime="4625.067">
    Mr. E. D. Vickery 
    At least insofar as internal cases were concerned not with respect to Admiralty and Maritime Law, there were no such cases, Mr. Justice Black, and the reason I say that I believe Congress should have acted on this is simply because Congress was aware or should have been aware from the legislative history that most of the countries did not permit such -- did not have such clauses in their bill of lading, but two, had prohibited such agreements which would indicate the Congress at least that some of the other countries dealing with this problem felt it necessary to have a specific agreement in the Act and as Congress was trying to eliminate as many controversies as possible between shipper and ship owner, that it would have -- it seems to me Congress would have specifically cover this particular problem.

    Do you agree with the Muller new rule that these conflicts are invalid if they are unreasonable and if so, what's the test of unreasonableness?
speaker="e_d_vickery" startTime="4641.555" stopTime="4655.076">
    Mr. E. D. Vickery 
    Well, the Muller case as I understand it, says that these contracts are enforceable if reasonable and the question of reasonableness turns on the convenience of the forum.

    I think (Inaudible) that -- that I've got. 
    What is your answer to Mr. McGowan's suggestion that this clause 27 in any event does not include in the in rem action?
speaker="e_d_vickery" startTime="4748.409" stopTime="4781.276">
    Mr. E. D. Vickery 
    My answer simply to that is simply this, that the obvious intention of the party was that it includes both in personam and in rem and if actually you don't have two causes of action, you have one cause of action as Mr. Justice Stewart has pointed out. 
    The recovery in personam is res adjudicata and decision in rem and you have actually the in rem proceeding as a security device for the purpose of guaranteeing the payment of any damages to which they may be entitled.

    Is -- is a language have cost of 27 and if so which words in that clause embrace specifically in rem --?

    Mr. E. D. Vickery 
    I think Mr. Justice Stewart has come up with the best answer made by in this case and that is the word “agent.”
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4799.203" stopTime="4800.941">
    Unknown Speaker 
    That is a question not an answer.
speaker="e_d_vickery" startTime="4800.941" stopTime="4828.372">
    Mr. E. D. Vickery 
    I -- I know but quick to see on the answer the Court reported me. 
    I think this is probably a case were a counsel couldn't see the forest or the trees. 
    Normally, looking at this clause, I would not say that agent included the ship but normally looking at this clause, I would not have advised the client and I would not now advise the client that it did not also include in rem action because of the obvious intent of the parties. 
    I don't believe Mr. McGowan would either.

    Well of course all I can --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4843.913" stopTime="4859.473">

    Well let's say the owner, master, agents, and if they want to include the in rem proceedings, why wouldn't they say or the ship that they're rather meticulous in -- in their language, I would think?
speaker="e_d_vickery" startTime="4859.473" stopTime="4898.757">
    Mr. E. D. Vickery 
    All I can say to the Court is, I agree it's rather inarticulately drawn and of course obviously I had -- I had been drawing it out. 
    I have included the word “ship” and certainly will from now on. 
    The word “ship” is -- the word -- the word “ship” is used further on down in the -- in the clause not withstanding the ship as represented there. 
    There's no answer to Mr. Chief Justice's question other than the fact that the clause is inarticulately drawn and of course the contention would -- could never have been made if the word “ship” were used and it's just inarticulately drawn. 
    Perhaps the language difficulty is responsible, the only answer to that I can think of.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    (Inaudible) this after all, you're relying on this being a conceptual arrangement of some kind and if the shipper can't read this as precluding an action in rem because of, you say, and article language employed, how can you really say this is an agreement by which the shipper is found? 
    And he had no part as I understand; the drafting of this wouldn't be ordinary rule of the holding against the draftsmen. 
    That -- that often doubts against the draftsmen.

    Perhaps I did, but I couldn't be less than frank with the Court. 
    All I can say there is that the Court enforces that rule if I may. 
    I know I'm indulging on the court's time. 
    The court applies the rule that the contractors construed against the framer of the contract. 
    But it does not do so, if to do so violate the obvious intent of the parties. 
    That's my position. 
    That's my position --

    My difficulty is that perhaps this is so ambiguous that we can't really say that the shipper would so understand it, that's my problem.
