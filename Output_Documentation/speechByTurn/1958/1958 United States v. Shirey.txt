United States v. Shirey
speaker="malcolm_anderson" startTime="0.000" stopTime="109.400">
    Mr. Malcolm Anderson 
    May it please the Court. 
    The one issue that is raised is the desirability of encouraging as a policy in our republican form of government, the contributions to political parties. 
    This is of course a major problem with both political parties. 
    It is estimated that as much as $40,000 is needed to elect a Congressman. 
    If we are to have a representative form of government, we can't limit the representatives as -- the Congressman to persons who are able to afford that, so that we do agree that it is proper to encourage contributions to political parties. 
    Both major parties have endeavored to broaden the base so that the contributions will come more from the actual person's representatives numerically, but I'm quite sure that neither major party, no matter how great this problem would want to encourage the -- this method of obtaining money for political parties. 
    In other words, I believe the policy is not applicable where you're -- apply it to a fact situation of selling or buying public office. 
    And that this was the purpose of Congress setting forth this policy of the country that this is one way in which money is not to be raised for political parties.

    Mr. Malcolm Anderson 
    Then we come and that is true in the broad sense of the term, “thing of value”, we could get down to charitable contributions could possibly be a thing of value to the offeree. 
    Then, I say, we come into that area where there is a certain amount of faith placed in the processes of the law, and the District Attorney and the judges, and the juries. 
    I think that perhaps the best illustration of its working, day in and day out isn't the main act where we have a very general provision that any person who takes a female across a state line for immoral purposes and that is a broad term, and yet, as it is used and exercised, it is limited largely to commercialization, the overreaching of children, female children of tender years. 
    But it is capable of all sorts of interpretations of what is an immoral purpose and for that reason, I say that this falls, not because it would not be a thing of value, but because in the processes in carrying out criminal law, there has to be some faith placed in the offices of the prosecuting judge.

speaker="malcolm_anderson" startTime="198.124" stopTime="249.649">
    Mr. Malcolm Anderson 
    Of course, both statutes were passed at the same time and the only language we find is that they were considered together and that they were considered as both aimed at the bad practice of buying and selling offices. 
    And we believe that it is in the solicitation section as an additional word to define or give color to a thing of value because they anticipated this difficulty arising more specifically with the solicitor. 
    The solicitor is saying, “If you will make a contribution of $10,000 to the party, I'll support you for this job.” 
    And then later, the solicitor is saying that this was not the sale of an office but a legitimate political activity and they aimed that section at a specific hazard which they've had testimony on.

speaker="malcolm_anderson" startTime="262.206" stopTime="325.220">
    Mr. Malcolm Anderson 
    From my reading of the congressional issue, I would say that elected on dead center, they talked generally about this evil of buying and selling offices. 
    There is no explanation that I could find as to why it was put in one section and not in the other, no discussion of it. 
    As we point out, this is -- this is not unique in these two sections. 
    In our brief, we pointed out at least two other instances where in this same chapter, between bribery and graft, that there is a difference in the language used defining thing of value or not defining it but -- run in with it between the person who solicits and the person who offers. 
    And we think this is just the overall attempt of Congress to anticipate some sort of an offer of a thing of value which could not be specific -- specifically spelled out and be safe to cover the whole area that they wish to cover.

    Mr. Malcolm Anderson 
    Oh, this -- this may be, but my personal opinion has always been that this is a bad trend in formal procedure that we should not go off into detail and informations or indictments, that we should be broad in scope and then if is -- if it is clear that the man is not able to defend, then we should answer the bill of particulars. 
    I don't think than an information should be thrown out or an indictment thrown out because of particulars.

    Thank you.
speaker="donn_i_cohen" startTime="835.915" stopTime="987.219">
    Mr. Donn I. Cohen 
    An answer to the question presented with regard to the sufficiency of the indictment on what the Government contends as its main position, and this contention that is its main position appears at page 10 of the Government's brief where they say, “Our main position is that the offer to an individual (Congressman Stauffer) to contribute money to his political party (the Republican Party) is an offer of thing of value to the individual person in the prohibition of 18 USC 214.” 
    This does not take into account the requirements of the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure (7)(c), which states that the indictment or information shall be a plain concise and a definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. 
    And when the rule says the essential facts constituting the offense charged, I presume that they mean all of the essential facts constituting the offense charge and not just the selection of them. 
    Now, the Government would have this Court conclude from the fact that we have an offer to donate a $1000 to the Republican Party to use as they see fit. 
    Ipso facto, that is a thing of value to Congressman Stauffer. 
    It may or may not be a thing of value to Congressman Stauffer. 
    These funds contributed to the Republican Party may indeed be used against them if you were not in favor with the -- in favor with the recipient of those funds. 
    But the important thing is not whether it is used for or against them, but initially, the important thing is whether there is any allegation in the complaint that he stood in anyway, whatsoever, to benefit from the contribution of these funds, the Republican Party. 
    It is not inherent. 
    It is not like the rule of gravity. 
    The money contributed to a political party enure to the benefit of a Congressman, though he be of that party. 
    I am sure that these moneys did not enure to the benefit of Joseph Martin or any other member of the House of Representatives. 
    They may have enured to the benefit of Congressman Stauffer, they may not have, but the point initially is that in the information and it's not alleged that they did. 
    And no nexus, no nexus whatever is said forth in the information between Congressman Stauffer and the Republican Party. 
    They're completely separate and they are not connected in any way.

    Could it take also judicial notice of the (Inaudible) facts which would have to show that these were a thing of value to him? 
    If this Court -- if this information has alleged that an offer of $1000 was given to the XYZ corporation of which Congressman Stauffer was a stockholder, a common stockholder, under that sub position of facts, conceivably, we could say that it is inherently true that an offer to contribute money to a corporation is a value to a stockholder, a common stockholder of any rate of such a corporation.

    But what is the gravamen of the charge here? 
    Isn't it that to the fact that someone promises to pay some money to get a federal job?
speaker="donn_i_cohen" startTime="1287.394" stopTime="1407.571">
    Mr. Donn I. Cohen 
    The gravamen of the charge here, Your Honor, is that there was an offer or promise of money or a thing or value to a person, firm, or corporation. 
    And the defendant's position is that the information must allege somewhere that there was a thing of value offered to a person, firm, or corporation, taking the Government's main position. 
    And if there is no allegation, either by conclusionary words such as the use of the word “thing or value” or by statement of facts to the -- to show the relationship between one and another, then a crime has not been stated. 
    To give money to another person is not a crime. 
    It is only a crime in the event that that other person, using the Government's posture this case stands the benefit from that gift, and there was no allegation in the complaint and the information whatsoever indicating in anyway, that Congressman Stauffer stood to benefit from that gift. 
    And I am using the word “stand to benefit” now, because the Government seems to construe the words “thing or value” as meaning stand to benefit, which I don't believe they do. 
    But taking the Government's position at least on that point, the information must show because its -- it is an essential fact of the offense charged that there'd be a thing of value and to be a thing of value to Congressman Stauffer under their consideration. 
    Now, there is nothing here to show that Congressman Stauffer benefit in any way whatsoever and therefore, now crime is stated. 
    We can suppose that he might benefit. 
    We can suppose that all of the Republican Party would take this money or the recipients of these funds and put it into his campaign or future campaign for Congress, but there's nothing in the information stated indicating that. 
    All we have now is an offer of money to the Republican Party, ipso facto, the Government's contention is that that's a thing of value to S. Walter Stauffer. 
    There is no connection between the two.

    I would think that the information would have to indicate that there was some value accruing to Congressman Stauffer as a result of that gift to his son.

    Mr. Donn I. Cohen 
    Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly the point and I think if these facts and the information were proven and only these facts were proven, a crime would not have been committed because under that posture, you would not know one way or the other whether it was a thing of value.

    Mr. Donn I. Cohen 
    I don't think that makes any difference, Your Honor. 
    Republicans sometimes do benefit from contributions to the party and sometimes, it hurts them, and sometimes it's completely neutral. 
    And I think if we're going to pin the statute down and call for it and it calls for an offer of a thing of value, then the information was alleged that there was a thing of value offered to S. Walter Stauffer. 
    And our position is that it is not alleged, and therefore, insufficient under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c) insufficient because it does not state the essential facts constituting the offense charged. 
    Now, with regard to the statute itself aside from the sufficiency of the information, the thing of value contemplated by the Government is quite different from what the defendant believes the thing of value contemplated by the United States Congress was. 
    In the first place, the word “thing of value” follows to word “money,” and it is given some coloration by that word. 
    Now, the defendant readily admits that the word “thing of value” is a broad thing, as a broad connotation but it has to be something measurable and not the illusory meaning that the Government would give to it.

    Some times it would benefit him as a thing of value and we can hypothesize a the Government would have it hypothesized, at page 14 of its brief when it says, “It is obvious that it would be a great value to a Congressman to be the person responsible for obtaining such contributions.” 
    Indeed, the increasing party funds might well be available for a future campaign of its own. 
    They might well be available and they might not well be available, but the point is it's not alleged in the information that any thing of value accrued to Congressman Stauffer.

speaker="donn_i_cohen" startTime="1787.800" stopTime="1950.647">
    Mr. Donn I. Cohen 
    I think not because I think that is an essential fact to constitute the offense charged. 
    With regard now to the statute itself and what is a thing of value. 
    I submit that that has given some coloration by the word “Money” and that while it is a broad concept, it is at least something measurable. 
    Now, the Government's position is that it would inure Congressman Stauffer's benefit some time in the future and therefore is a thing of value. 
    And I think the Government argued basically the thing of value and inured to the benefit of another or one in the same, and I think they are not. 
    For if the Government's example were correct, the examples they give at page 14 of their brief, then if the defendant in this case had offered to work hard as a postmaster, in consideration or receiving that appointment, it would, under the Government's contention the equal thing value and I don't think Congress intended prescription to that effect. 
    Also, money was not paid here. 
    It was only offered and in order to prove these benefits which the Government conflicts as inuring to Congressman Stauffer, payment would have in fact had to be made. 
    One proof of this case, under this -- under this information in any rate, all we have is an offer. 
    You can never know whether it was or it only did turn into a thing of value to Congressman Stauffer. 
    And finally, we have an offer of money, $1,000 a year to the Republican Party to use as they see fit. 
    Now, that is used in money or thing of value in its injunctive sense and I do not believe that you can when you have an information plainly alleging offer of money, then substantiate that information as an offer with thing of value. 
    With regard to these two points stand are in a sense distinguishable. 
    They are, one, the sufficiency of the information and secondly, even assuming the information is sufficient, the words -- the meaning that the Government would seek to give the word, “thing of value,“ is not the meaning intended by Congress. 
    It is something I think measurable and not something so illusory and true by only such as secured as fashion. 
    And I believe the fact that we are construing a penal statute here which requires its construction in strict terms substantiates this position and limits the meaning of the words, “thing of value” to something at least measurable.

    Do you mean by that, to say the thing of value means it's something tangible?
speaker="donn_i_cohen" startTime="1956.355" stopTime="1977.691">
    Mr. Donn I. Cohen 
    Not necessarily tangible but measurable in some way. 
    The benefits that are going to accrue to Congressman Stauffer, assuming they do accrue, as contemplated by the Government, are not at all measurable and they are not going to accrue until money is actually paid, and this information does not allege any payment. 
    It only alleges an operative pay.

    That is what's being offered to him. 
    No money is being offered to Congressman Stauffer.

    Charities are frequently given.

speaker="donn_i_cohen" startTime="2290.823" stopTime="2463.785">
    Mr. Donn I. Cohen 
    Well, I don't think that would come within the terms of the statute. 
    The Government at one point has argued that the Republican Party is a person and therefore, regardless of the other arguments thus made that this is an offer of money to a person and they conclude this by an application of Title I Section 1 of the United States Code which defines person to include such words as, “partnership, firm, corporation, association, joint stock company, or society,” then they take from that and to plant association into the word “person” in 18 U.S.C. 214. 
    And the question is, is this supplantable because 1 U.S.C. 1 specifically says that these meanings described to the word “person” apply only in less -- apply unless the context indicates otherwise. 
    And it's the position of the defendant to the context of 18 U.S.C. 214 does indicate otherwise and that immediately, following the word “person” in 18 U.S.C. 214, come the words “firm or corporation”. 
    Now, it seemed to indicate that this exhaust of specification would exclude further entity by implication. 
    And also, the fact that the word “firm and corporation” are also mentioned in 191 U.S.C. 1, if we take the meanings described in 1 U.S.C. 1 and apply it to 18 U.S.C. 214, then the words “firm and corporation” in Title 18 Section 214 United States Code become complete superfluous. 
    And it is submitted that Congress would not place in the statute words which would intends to be superfluous. 
    Finally, I think we must recall that we are dealing with a penal or criminal statute, and that statute requires strict construction. 
    The rule of strict construction is the reason as the decision of this Court in December of this year in which Justice Douglas and its decent referred to United States versus Wiltberger with approval and applied the rule of strict construction. 
    That case was United States versus A &amp; P Trucking Company and Hopelet Trucking Company. 
    But not only is this a criminal statute, but it is a peculiar criminal statute and that it would seem to involve a crime which is truly the creature of the Congress that it is, in short, malum prohibitum and not mala prohibita as said, and that therefore the rule of strict construction applies with even greater strength. 
    And finally, the act of making political contribution --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2463.785" stopTime="2475.520">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I think it marked my word the other way around since way it really required in malum prohibitum and it is such a threatening thing.

    In the act in and of itself with which we are dealing, namely the act of making a political contribution assigned for the moment or the purposes for which that act may be done is in of itself laudatory act and while certainly it may be proscribed and certainly under certain conditions, it is wrong. 
    If that proscription is to be made, it would seem that it should in explicit terms. 
    And the comparison between 18 U.S.C. 214 and 18 U.S.C. 215, the latter in which a section does contain an explicit proscription would seem to indicate that Congress do not intend the proscription of political contributions in the context of 18 U.S.C. 214. 
    For these reasons therefore, the defense submit, number one, that the information is insufficient to allege a crime under Title 18 Section 214 United States Code because it does not contain the essential facts necessary to constitute the offense charged and that there is no allegation that a thing of value was offered to Congressman Stauffer. 
    And secondly, even if it were sufficient, in other words, even if all the essential facts stated were there, the construction placed on the statute by the Government gives two broader meaning to words “thing of value” and gives an inappropriate meaning to the word, “Republican Party”. 
    Now, I might mention at this point also that the Republican Party is not identified as being in association or a person in the information. 
    And if this offer or if the proscribed offer would be to a retail shoe store, then it must be alleged that it was a retail shoe store in the information and we have no knowledge whatsoever as to the nature of the Republican Party. 
    It is not alleged in the information and on that ground, the information is insufficient aside from the fact that as we argue in our brief, the Republican Party is not an association but rather a concept. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Malcolm Anderson 
    I would only say one word, Your Honor, that is this problem of nexus. 
    It seems to me that we're getting away from the issue and that is what was in the mind of Mr. Shirey? 
    Would this what he offers to the Congressman, persuade the Congressman to give him an office improperly? 
    And so, it doesn't matter whether it was paid or not paid whether anybody else would know about it or not, at that moment, was Mr. Shirey trying to corrupt the Congressman to sell a public office. 
    He may have in his heart never intended to make the first contribution, but was he offering to buy a public office. 
    We think that the reading of the information would indicate that he was offering to buy a public office.

    I think that should always apply. 
    I have no objection of that rule. 
    I don't see that it applies here. 
    I think there are things that should be said. 
    I think this man should not have been hovering of whether he's guilty or not guilty for six-year or four years that he's been on the distance of punishment perhaps he should not have had, but I think that's not our problem today. 
    I do see though that there are many items needs be seen involved in this case.
