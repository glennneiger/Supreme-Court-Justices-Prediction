In re Sawyer

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 326, in the Matter of Disciplinary Proceedings against Harriet Bouslog Sawyer. 
    Mr. Barlow, you may continue your argument.
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="25.786" stopTime="521.629">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Perhaps some of the Court may be wondering why a speech that was made in 1952 is before the Court in 1959. 
    I may be facetious, yet, I am sincere when I say that the reason for the long delay is the fact that the petitioner has been accorded due process all the way along the line. 
    In 1952, December 14, she made this talk at Honokaa on the Island of Hawaii. 
    The case in which she was engaged as counsel terminated sometime in June of 1953. 
    Subsequent to the termination of the trial, Federal Judge John Wiig, who presided at the trial, referred the behavior of the petitioner to the Bar Association. 
    The matter was then referred to the Ethics Committee in July of 1954. 
    In September of 1954, the petitioner requested a bill of particulars, which, were supplied to her. 
    In November of 1954, the Ethics Committee conducted a full-scale hearing. 
    At which time, the petitioner was represented by a very able counsel and at which time, she had the opportunity of presenting on her behalf any and all witnesses that she thought were people who could testify to what she had said at the time of the incident related to in the complaint. 
    The hearing consumed 468 pages and ended on December the 8th, 1954. 
    The Ethics Committee Report which found Mrs. Bouslog guilty of impugning the integrity of the Court, of interfering with the administration of justice, and creating disrespect for the courts on the first complaint, and on the second complaint, with conducting a studied interrogation of a sick juror immediately after the trial in violation of Canon 23, the American Bar Association Opinion 109, and the rulings in the Rakes and Millie cases. 
    Subsequent to that report by the Bar Association Ethics Committee, the Supreme Court issued an order to show cause. 
    That order was issued July 8th, 1955. 
    The petitioner was granted an extension of time to September of 1955, within which, to file an answer. 
    Instead of the return of the order to show cause, she filed a motion to dismiss the order to show cause on October 19, 1955. 
    More time for filing petitioner's return to the order to show cause was requested and petitioner was granted to December. 
    And finally, the argument was set for January of 1956. 
    On January 7th, 1955, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the order, denying the motion to dismiss the order to show cause. 
    This motion was extensively argued and denied by order filed November 29, 1955. 
    A return to the order to show cause was finally filed by the petitioner on December 2, 1955. 
    Another motion for continuance by petitioner followed, and another hearing was held.On a date set for trial, which was January 9, 1956, a pretrial conference was held with counsel for the Bar Association, counsel for the Attorney General and counsel for the petitioner being present. 
    Two days later, another delay was occasioned by the petitioner filing a suggestion of disqualification of Associate Justices Stainback and Rice of the Supreme Court. 
    Extensive argument on this motion was again held by the Territorial Supreme Court. 
    The Territorial Supreme Court, incidentally, held that neither Justice was disqualified. 
    However, Justice Stainback withdrew on his own motion. 
    At the pretrial conference, it was determined that under Rule 19, the petitioner could avail herself of a trial de novo. 
    However, the petitioner, through her counsel, and counsel for the Bar Association, and the Attorney General, and the Court stipulated that instead of a trial de novo, the matter would proceed upon a record submitted before the Committee. 
    The opinion of the Court was filed April 6, 1956. 
    The Court found that the complaint was sustained by convincing proof, by credible evidence of more than a mere preponderance. 
    The Court found that the charges under both complaints were proven and found that the petitioner was guilty of gross misconduct on both counts. 
    The petitioner then appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals under Section 1293, alleging that there was a constitutional question involved and also alleging that her right to practice law had a money tag or a value attached to it that by virtue of the fact that she was suspended for one year, the matter in controversy or the value in controversy was the amount of money that she had earned in previous years. 
    The Bar Association took the position that this was a simple matter of discipline involving the Canons of Ethics, that there was no First Amendment constitutional question involved. 
    The Bar Association took the position that insofar as the license to practice law was concerned, it was priceless and you could not attach a price tag to it. 
    The petitioner filed her affidavit, stating that she made an excess of $5000 and the Court, on the first hearing, granted her a stay pending the determination of the case on its merits. 
    Two Justices Justice concurring, and Justice Lemmon wrote a dissenting opinion in which he indicated that as far as he was concerned, that it was a very simple disciplinary matter. 
    There was no constitutional question involved and that insofar as he was concerned, you could not attach a price tag to the practice of law.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It seems to be that petitioners -- it seems to have been and continue to be the petitioner's position throughout these proceedings that how the penalty imposed was purportedly a suspension of practice for one year, in actual practical effect, it was disbarment. 
    What do you have to say about the matter? 
    I don't want to interrupt your presentation, but I was --
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="545.761" stopTime="546.073">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    Well --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="546.073" stopTime="546.138">

    -- need to know.
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="546.138" stopTime="584.409">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    -- the only thing I can say about that Mr. Justice Stewart, is that under our rules that if you are suspended for a period in excess of six months, that you then have to take a written examination and you again have to pass a character test. 
    We, in the Territory of Hawaii, at the present time, have no reciprocity with any other state insofar as admission by a motion is concerned. 
    When I went there, 13, 14 years ago, I had to take a bar examination that lasted five days. 
    I had to pass a character test. 
    So --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="584.409" stopTime="587.204">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And somebody suspended for more than six months has to do the same.
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="587.204" stopTime="588.333">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="588.333" stopTime="599.931">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And presumably, I suppose that these very proceedings would make it difficult, if not impossible, to pass the character test if that were true.

    Mr. A. William Barlow

    It --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    To get some answer on it --
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="604.245" stopTime="642.704">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    It depends on what the -- possibly, if it ever came back into the Supreme Court, it's what this Court would consider good moral character. 
    Maybe our Court might decide that based on these proceedings, she doesn't possess good moral character. 
    It may very well be that this Court on review, as they did in the Schwerin and Cunningsburgh case, stated “In our opinion, your finding is arbitrary. 
    You're dogmatic, and we think that this one little incident doesn't -- shouldn't deprive the present from her right to practice law.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="642.704" stopTime="646.218">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But you're not here today characterizing this as one little incident, are you?
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="646.218" stopTime="665.729">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    No, sir. 
    Now, insofar as the Bar Association of the Territory of Hawaii is concerned, we consider this a very serious breach of the Canons of Ethics and that's all we do consider, as a breach of the Canons of Ethics.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Who -- who determined -- who would determine in Hawaii qualifications to be readmitted to the Bar?
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="675.566" stopTime="677.824">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    The Supreme Court itself, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="677.824" stopTime="681.785">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And the Supreme Court suspended this member of the Bar for a year.
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="681.785" stopTime="682.825">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    That's right, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="682.825" stopTime="711.790">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I should think it would be a very hard time. 
    I should think any court or tribunal would have a hard time suspending misconducts or violations of the Code of Ethics of a lawyer for a year and then say that because he suspended you for a year, which means, a year thereafter, you never can be admitted again. 
    That they will ask -- indeed, wasn't there one member who thought she should be disbarred?
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="711.790" stopTime="713.631">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    One member of the Court --

    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="716.241" stopTime="724.291">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, they can't subsequently disbar under the pretense that they won't allow her to take the examination if she doesn't satisfy the requirement. 
    I should think --
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="724.291" stopTime="726.057">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    It's very possible, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="726.057" stopTime="742.078">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I -- I don't know anything about it, but I should have a hard time finding that the Court was justified when it found that the appropriate punishment is a year -- to be suspended for a year then say, "Oh well, that meant -- that year meant that you'll forever have to disqualify.”

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- I'm not talking about that but that's a different story. 
    If fair questions were put and the intellectual test isn't met, I'm merely suggesting that the Court that said a year's suspension is appropriate response to the misconduct that they've found, they couldn't, afterwards, say the year's suspension meant light suspension.

    That's right.

speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="781.065" stopTime="794.330">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    Well, they could say that “it's up to you to carry the ball,” so to speak, “to prove to us that you're a person of good moral character” but as Justice Frankfurter indicates, that they suspended her for a year.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="794.330" stopTime="811.090">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Anyhow, we took a case that didn't have -- that was, I should think, less clear than this and we thought we could review a determination. 
    I think your Court that solemnly said “you are to be suspended for a year” can, on the same basis, say, “All we meant was that meant life.”
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="811.090" stopTime="821.551">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That would depend on the feelings and beliefs of those who presided in the Supreme Court of Hawaii and those who passed on the case here as it came back at the time it came here, wouldn't it?

    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    I might say for the Court's benefit that as soon as we become a state, we'll have a new Supreme Court and the people that participated in this proceeding more likely will not be members of the Supreme Court.

    Why is that?
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="840.803" stopTime="850.538">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    Because of age considerations. 
    Under our constitution, there's an age limitation and two of the Judges would be automatically disqualified because of age.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="850.538" stopTime="877.767">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm merely suggesting that I thought we had decided the Court can't be or a state court can't be arbitrary even as to admission or continuance at the Bar, and I can't imagine anything more arbitrary than for a court, a predecessor court, if you will, who said a year would be appropriate response to wrong doings then saying a year meant life.

    Presently on the Bar?

    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    Three. 
    When -- when we got to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, may it please the Court, we contended, initially, that the Ninth Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to accept this case under Title 28 Section 1293. 
    The Court ruled against us two-to-one, Justice Lennon dissenting. 
    Then, the matter was set down for a hearing, a full-scale hearing, before another three-man panel. 
    We argued the case, we argued the merits of the case before this panel, and the panel never came up with a decision. 
    Either by hearsay or through the grapevine, we found out that that panel did not agree with the first panel. 
    Insofar as jurisdiction was concerned, they felt that the Ninth Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction, so they set the matter down for a full- scale hearing before a nine-man court. 
    And we then argued the matter before a nine-man court. 
    The opinion reflects seven members four-for, and three-against. 
    Justice Denman, who was the Chief Justice at that time, retired after the case was argued and Justice Lemmon died, leaving seven Judges to participate. 
    That Court found that the Bar Association had sustained its burden. 
    That Court found that the petitioner was guilty of the conduct that was charged in the complaint. 
    That Court indicated in its decision that they thought that they held jurisdiction by the very narrowest of threads insofar as the first count of the complaint involving her claim of freedom of speech was concerned. 
    Insofar as count 2, involving the incident with the juror pool was concerned, they indicated that if we weren't -- if the petitioner wasn't in Court on count 1, she certainly wouldn't be in Court on count 2.

speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="1292.306" stopTime="1364.196">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    A pattern. 
    The reason that we introduced the pamphlet “Fear” and some of the other speeches that she had made was to show the Committee and the Court that this was not a spontaneous exclamation or a spontaneous suggestion on her part, that it was part of a program, part of a plan and design to bring discredit upon the Judges and discredit upon the courts and to show the community in which she resided that Smith Act trials were, in effect, a conspiracy. 
    If the Court will read very carefully the notes, Matsuoka's notes, the thoughts contained in Matsuoka's notes, the testimony of all the witnesses that testified at the hearing, I think the Court can very easily come to the conclusion that she was preaching to the community at large that the Government and the Court were conspiring. 
    She talked --

    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    Under the First Amendment, you can express yourself insofar as the Smith Act is concerned, but that's not our problem here. 
    Our problem here is that she not only held these views, but expressed them during the pendency of a case in which she was one of the very active counsels. 
    And if the Court will read the colloquy between Judge Wiig and a petitioner, the Court will find out that the petitioner, apparently, was a little aggravated because the Judge was allowing certain kinds of testimony into the record because when the Judge asked her, “Did you make the statement that rather, horrible and shocking things go on in this trial?” 
    She said, and this is only two days later, “I have no recollection of making that statement,” she says, “but I want it clearly understood.” 
    And I would like to invite the Court's attention to page 29 of the record. 
    This is Exhibit A, the colloquy between a petitioner and Judge Wiig. 
    “As the Court can see, my remarks were directly toward the conduct of the prosecution and were not directed toward the Court.” 
    And this is the part that I want to invite the Court's attention to, “By that I do not mean to say that the defense counsel, in any way, received from the position that was taken in the brief filed in connection with the Crouch's testimony in which we believe we have cited authorities showing that Your Honor has admitted evidence which is not admissible even in ordinary conspiracy cases.

    I think if the Court will look at our brief, we have tried to itemize and corroborate each one of the statements that was made by Matsuoka in his notes. 
    And before I get off that subject, I would just like to say to the Court that it isn't only Matsuoka's notes that is part of this record. 
    If the Court will look at the record, the Court will find out that Matsuoka was put under oath and he testified for 17 pages, and petitioner's counsel cross-examined him extensively and intensely. 
    And Matsuoka testified under oath to many of the statements that are found in his notes and in a newspaper article.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, no, but if you're going to relate the conversation, I would suggest that you relate the important parts of it so that -- so that we can understand what the genesis of this whole thing was. 
    Well, don't bother about that now. 
    I'll give you three minutes to -- to state your position on this because your time has expired.
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="2446.414" stopTime="2628.791">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    Alright, sir. 
    The -- anyway, Mrs. Cabreros indicated to Mrs. Bouslog that her brother wanted to see her. 
    Mrs. Bouslog came down, she found the brother sick in bed. 
    She did not interview the juror on that occasion. 
    She came back the following day and conducted a very searching examination, an inquiry of the juror as to what transpired in the jury room. 
    And I think that our brief shows that the juror, presumably, related 30 different incidents that occurred in the jury room and she submitted that affidavit to Judge Wiig in an attempt to impeach the verdict. 
    The judge, as I recall the situation, did not have a hearing on that affidavit, but the Bar Association charged her with this violation of conducting a studied interrogation of the Juror Fuller. 
    And the evidence before the Court in the record will indicate that Mrs. Fuller had made many of the statements to Mrs. Bouslog, that Mrs. Bouslog did not advise Judge Wiig of the exact physical condition or mental condition of the juror, that she related to Judge Wiig the conversation that she allegedly had with the juror, and the many things that the juror told her occurred in the jury room. 
    And the -- Mrs. Bouslog did not tell the judge in her affidavit that the Juror Fuller was too sick to sign an affidavit. 
    She did not tell the judge that she tried to get the wife, Mrs. Fuller, to sign an affidavit but Mrs. Fuller said, “I won't sign that affidavit because what you have in that affidavit is not what my husband said.” 
    So, Mrs. Bouslog decided to sign the affidavit instead. 
    And the Court has before it the record of the doctor that treated the juror. 
    The Court has before it the record of the psychiatrist that treated the juror. 
    And we feel that under all the circumstances, that studied interrogation violated Canon 23 and it violated the holdings in the Millie and Rakes cases.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was it -- was it misconduct for her to go out and see this juror?

    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    It depended on what she went out to seem him for.

    Well, in response to this telephone message that her client had been framed, was it misconduct for her to investigate that after her juror had been discharged from duty?

    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    The Canon 3 says -- or 23 says that a lawyer should never communicate with a juror, that's before or after and during the course of a trial.

    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    Well, it's possibly so and if the Court feels that you can interrogate a juror after verdict, why, I'm sure that there are lots of us lawyers who adhere to the Canons and don't interrogate jurors. 
    We would like to know because we'd like to get to the jurors too --

    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    There is no statute against interrogating a juror, sir, except that the Ninth Circuit Court has laid down a rule in the Millie case which indicates that it is a violation of the Canons of Ethics to interrogate jurors, to -- to conduct a studied interrogation of jurors after verdict.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2713.396" stopTime="2732.433">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    Well, the Ninth Circuit Court, may it please Justice Black, has decided in the Millie case that it's unethical and it's not proper for a lawyer to conduct a studied investigation or interrogation of a juror after a trial.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2785.136" stopTime="2788.227">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. A. William Barlow

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So, then, under that rule, as you understand it, even if a person's file had been convicted of a crime, and he's learns that one of the jurors says there has been some misconduct that they ought to know about, that he would be subject to disbarment if he went down to the juror and made inquiries on it?

    I did not make any statement to Justice Frankfurter that the affidavit contained a false one. 
    I say that the Court can easily, after it reads the evidence and evaluates the evidence, come to the conclusion that perhaps, the affidavit didn't state facts. 
    And my answer to Justice Frankfurter was that Mrs. Fuller stated to Mrs. Bouslog that “I will not sign this affidavit because this affidavit does not contain the facts as they are.”

    Page 15 of the record, sir. 
    “With respect to the charges in paragraph 3, the Committee finds that after rendition of the verdict in Criminal 10 Corps 95 mentioned above Mrs. Bouslog visited one of the jurors, David P. Fuller, Jr. while he was in a very poor mental and physical condition, and thereafter, submitted her affidavit concerning an interview with the juror to the presiding Judge. 
    While the affidavit of Mrs. Bouslog indicates that on the first occasion, he was gravely ill, the Committee finds that she did not fully disclose to the Court the condition of Mr. Fuller, nor the fact that she had attempted to get affidavits from Mrs. Fuller who refused to sign one and could not get an affidavit from Mr. Fuller because of his condition.”

    No, it doesn't say it's false. 
    I didn't say it was false either. 
    I said that the testimony of Mrs. Fuller indicated that Mrs. Fuller made the statement that the matters contained in the affidavit weren't factual. 
    That's all I said.

    Since I got you into this, I think I will just state what my question was. 
    My question was whether there is in the record evidence that an affidavit prepared by the lawyer purporting to set forth the facts was submitted to a witness, to a person to sign, Mrs. Fuller, who refused to sign because she said it didn't conform to what she understood her husband had said.

    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    That's one facet. 
    That is not the reason why the Court voted suspension, and I might say to the Court that insofar as the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii was concerned, they did not impose any punishment on the second count because they felt that their one-year suspension on the first count was adequate, so that she was not given any suspension for the second count.

    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    As a matter of fact, the Court decided that she was guilty on two counts. 
    It isn't very artfully set out by the Supreme Court and as a matter of fact, the petitioner herself did not bring the matter up on appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court. 
    They took it upon themselves to look into the matter and write the opinion that they did.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I ask a jurisdictional question about this. 
    I'm fully ignorant. 
    As I understand from the cases that have come here, the two cases, we have said over the last 20 years that there are certain limitations upon the reviewing power of the Ninth Circuit of judgments in the Supreme Court of Hawaii.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, assume, as you indicate, assume that the second -- the proceeding -- the disciplinary proceeding had related solely to the second count. 
    You just indicated that Judge Lemmon held that that was not a given basis for review, is that right?
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="3608.606" stopTime="3618.125">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    No, I indicated that Justice Lemmon, at the very first hearing, indicated that the Ninth Circuit did not have jurisdiction over this matter for two reasons.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In your view, is there a difference between the subject matter of the two charges so far as the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit was concerned? 
    Suppose the second charge stood alone.

speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="3650.777" stopTime="3652.701">
    Mr. A. William Barlow

    Well --
speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="3653.388" stopTime="3664.402">
    Mr. A. William Barlow 
    If she got a punishment for the second charge, I would say that is was not reviewable for the very simple reason that I don't think that the right to practice law carries with it a price tag.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well that's -- that's the question that we have in other relations, namely, whether the monetary requirement giving jurisdiction is satisfied, which we struggled with that. 
    The Court has struggled with it for 50 years. 
    This is another case, but that would be equally true as to the second count -- or, rather, the first count if he had been given the sentence of it, is that right?

   Argument of John T. McTernan

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. McTernan.
speaker="john_t_mcternan" startTime="3728.220" stopTime="3800.262">
    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Although I did not have time yesterday to get to the jury point, I would like not to get to it today but to speak to the speech point because I think that's the more important aspect of the case. 
    Mr. Justice Harlan, if I might reformulate the question you put to my adversary, I would say that the holding below was that it is unprofessional conduct for a lawyer of record in a pending case to comment upon that case in the manner petitioner did here because, and this is the guts of it, I think, that is an attack on the administration of justice. 
    And I think that is the question begging aspect of the findings of the courts below. 
    What is meant by “attack?” 
    “Attack” obviously embraces criticism and fair comment, and a lawyer's utterances have to go beyond, it seems to me, criticism and fair conduct even of the conduct of the judge himself before he brings the Court into disrespect, before he interferes with a fair administration of justice, before he loses his First Amendment protection.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3800.262" stopTime="3810.181">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Didn't you say, as certainly I understood you, on the trial in the District Court, you're not supposed to talk about the cases, in public, being tried in the courts?
speaker="john_t_mcternan" startTime="3810.181" stopTime="3856.247">
    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    I think that this is a convention which most lawyers observe. 
    It's one that I observe in my practice. 
    I do this and I think lawyers do it because they are solicitous to avoid even the appearance of interfering with the fair administration of justice, but I don't think that it is something that is compulsory upon lawyers just because they are in that situation because what they say may well not interfere with the unfair administration of justice or bring the Court into disrespect as a matter of fact. 
    And I think this is what we're concerned with here. 
    Did it, in fact, do these things? 
    Now, I would also like to address myself to what I think --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3856.247" stopTime="3868.631">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't suppose you could prove that except by having the jurors say, “We heard about it over the radio or some gossip or the way things are in the air and travel,” and they really impose our judgment. 
    That's the only way you could prove that.
speaker="john_t_mcternan" startTime="3868.631" stopTime="3870.220">

    Isn't that true?
speaker="john_t_mcternan" startTime="3870.302" stopTime="3952.086">
    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    -- there is another way. 
    I think there is another way and I think it's the kind of way this Court has used in many cases in the past. 
    What it does, it weigh the facts which the record show. 
    Let's weigh them here, a speech given over and over or a hamlet of a thousand souls deep in a plantation where the people who listen to the speech were, largely, union members who had contributed to the defense of one of the defendants. 
    No publicity sought by this petitioner. 
    She spoke to a gathering in using words which at no time were directed to Judge Wiig by name or by implication except in criticizing a ruling that he had made. 
    So far as her intent may be relevant here and intent was considered in Pennekamp, for example, look at this situation of a lawyer of unblemished reputation for 18 years, appearing daily before this judge in defense of her time, bearing that kind of responsibility. 
    Is it reasonable to suppose that she intended to bring this judge into disrespect or to attack him in a way that goes beyond the fair criticism and fair comment? 
    I think, Your Honor, that it requires blowing this thing up into proportions all out of relationship to the facts of the record.We have an objective way of deciding whether this reasonably could have interfered with the fair administration of justice. 
    This Court has done it time and again, and it --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That isn't the basis on which lawyers make it physical that would reasonably interfere with the administration of justice. 
    The basis is whether they behave according to the low standard by which even -- even by the low standard by which the Bar likes to be judged.

    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    Your Honor --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3968.984" stopTime="3971.193">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's what we've heard this morning.
speaker="john_t_mcternan" startTime="3971.193" stopTime="4143.090">
    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    Your Honor, those standards set up the conduct whereby we decide whether this lawyer conducted himself unprofessionally, and the questions here come down to bringing the Court into disrespect or interfering with the fair administration of justice. 
    Now, I would like to address myself, if I may, to this concept, “administration of justice,” because I think that it embraces far more than what is involved in the adjudicatory process. 
    In the administration of criminal justice, we find a substantial area which is determined, in the first instance at least, by the prosecutor. 
    It is they who decide whether the case is going to be brought. 
    They decide whether it's going to be a trial of doctrine, as the Fujimoto case was. 
    Remember, that this is a case that exploded along with all the others after the decision of this Court in the -- in the Yates case. 
    They are the ones who decide to employ the conspiracy charge in its dragnet. 
    They are the ones that decide how remote and how much hearsay is going to be used and the -- and they also decide, if it please the Court, whether they will employ or otherwise purchase a stable of witnesses who run about the country for these political prosecutions tailoring their stories to fit the facts as they're required in a particular case. 
    It was these things, if it please the Court, that this petitioner was attacking. 
    This kind of administration of justice, she was attacking. 
    She was not attacking Judge Wiig and I say to you, because I've had a lot of experience with these cases, that in 1952, this sort of thing was reaching the proportions of a national scandal and I, as a member of the Bar, am proud of what my client did in attacking this kind of administration of justice and it took only a few more years for these things to reach the level of this Court. 
    And this Court did what was necessary in some of these respects to cleanse the springs of justice, and I am proud of that too. 
    And it is, I say, that a lawyer engaged in a trial of a case has the right to cry out against this kind of injustice in the administration of our temples and he has, therefore, a valuable and important contribution to make to public discussion. 
    And it is -- it seems to me, it is to -- it is to adopt the false ideals, false criteria of protecting the adjudicatory process, and I'm as concerned about that as Mr. Justice Frankfurter is, but I -- it seems to me that we have this area around the adjudicatory process which closely affects it, in which the bar has a duty to speak out when that area around it so intimately affects and indeed, and sometimes pollutes and taints the very adjudicatory process --

    Your Honor, I think, as I said yesterday, it would be one thing to cry to the public, “Judge Wiig is a crook” or “Judge Wiig is biased in favor of the prosecution.” 
    This is not what this petitioner did. 
    This petitioner said, “The Government, the prosecutor is handing Judge Wiig a stacked deck.” That's what it -- he -- what she was saying in effect.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4187.897" stopTime="4193.327">

    But the Judge has to rule on the evidence.

    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    I don't think -- it seems to me that it is false and artificial to say that the -- because I think this is what it is involved in what you said, that because what she said in condemning the conduct of prosecutors and the methods of prosecutors dealt with a case that was pending, she was therefore interfering with the adjudicatory process. 
    I think that she was not. 
    She did not reach that and I think that we can rely on a good sense of our -- of our citizens to know the difference between criticizing the conduct of prosecutors which disturb the adjudicatory process and attacking that process itself. 
    I agree that it would be a bad thing for a witness to go out and say -- I mean, a lawyer to go out and say, “This man who is now testifying before this Court is all a matter of evil men and we intend to prove this and -- and reach the minds of the juror or put pressures on the -- on the courtroom in that respect.” 
    This is not what was done here. 
    I was -- it was suggested yesterday that we've -- that I made an over refined analysis of that speech. 
    I ask you to look at this speech in terms of the cc she said, the subject that she was talking about in her sentence, and break it down sentence by sentence and phrase by phrase, and you will not find -- not only will you not find what the Territorial Court said that she was saying. 
    You certainly will not find what my opponent here says that there the -- that she charge a conspiracy among the Judge --

    Mr. John T. McTernan 
    No, sir, it was not an abstract speech.

    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
