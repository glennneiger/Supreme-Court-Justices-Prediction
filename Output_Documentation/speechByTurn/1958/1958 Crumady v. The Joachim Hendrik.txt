    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    Thank you, sir. 
    If it please the Court, as I previously pointed out, there is uncontradicted testimony in this case that the cut off or circuit breaker was installed solely for the purpose of protecting the electric motor. 
    Now, in accordance with Mr. Justice Harlan's request, I wish to point out that this testimony appears on page 42 at the top, and that there is further testimony on this point at -- starting at the bottom of page 42 and continuing to the middle of page 43, and that also on page 44 at the top thereof commencing with the Court, there is -- such testimony. 
    That is the only testimony which is in the case as to the purpose of this circuit breaker. 
    Now, in the words of the chief mate of the vessel, who happens to be the only person here who had personal knowledge and personal experience with this mechanism, it was nothing more than what we know as a ordinary household fuse. 
    That was its sole purpose. 
    It had nothing to do with controlling the load. 
    It would of course be unfair to say that --

    Justice William O. Douglas

    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz

    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    Yes. 
    This is not suppose to control the load. 
    When it controls the load, the longshoreman themselves and what this -- what -- it points out to them what the load is or what load they should lift is a marking which appears on the boom. 
    Its -- its international practice, every vessel has --

    -- three ton.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="313.623" stopTime="325.537">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You must say more than that, that it isn't supposed to, that it had no effect, that it wasn't an ingredient in the -- in the -- in the result.
speaker="victor_s_cichanowicz" startTime="325.537" stopTime="387.326">
    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    It was not an ingredient because of -- because this happens, sir. 
    At the motor, you have a current with this set off -- cut off, said as it was, you get a current quantity of six tons. 
    That is true. 
    But, by the time -- because of the nature on the operation of this mechanism, by the time you get down here to where the load is, you cannot lift a six-ton load because if you are lifting a six-ton load this would cut off. 
    You have a six-ton load here, it would never start up because -- I mean, this -- this is a machine and there are number of forces acting here which require a setting here, sufficiently high so that you can overcome inertia, you can overcome these other forces and raise a three-ton load at the end of the runner. 
    Now, if you had this set at three tons here so that the winch as soon as the current quantity which reads the winch was three tons, you would not lift (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="387.326" stopTime="388.542">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Voice Overlap) you say.
speaker="victor_s_cichanowicz" startTime="388.542" stopTime="436.566">
    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    You'd never lift a three-ton load. 
    You see, that's -- that's why a setting at six tons on the current here is not an unseaworthy condition. 
    It's not a condition that causes this accident because what happened here was this, when the longshoreman permitted the lumber to become caught under the coaming here and continued coaming. 
    What happened was this winch then started to pull. 
    It was exerting this power on here but this load was not then moving upward so that your current kept on building up. 
    It had to build up being caught here. 
    You actually have strange as it may sound, this was computed by the expert. 
    You have the force is actively doubling while up here.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="436.566" stopTime="453.629">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you saying -- are you saying that in the circumstances of what actually took place here, the fact that the lumber got caught and they couldn't tow up. 
    The -- the cut off at six, whether it was fixed or even more it could be, would be irrelevant. 
    Is that what they're saying?
speaker="victor_s_cichanowicz" startTime="453.629" stopTime="510.184">
    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    It's -- yes, it was irrelevant for this reason that if the longshoreman had not permitted this timber to become caught here. 
    And if after it had become caught, they did not continue to operate the winch. 
    The force would never have been built up here. 
    This equipment was not furnished for the purpose that these men were using, that they were trying to jam out a piece of timber that had become caught. 
    That obviously is not the purpose of it. 
    The purpose was to raise timber whether the boom was in this position or in this position that's originally had -- it was when the vessel came in. 
    They had operated this winch for one hour and have discharged lumber this vessel for one solid hour without any trouble at all. 
    One of the reasons was they weren't trying to pull the vessel apart. 
    That's why nothing happened. 
    And that's -- that's the reason --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="510.184" stopTime="533.609">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you saying further that if they had stop trying to lift, to get the lumber from its -- from its snare, they'd stopped trying to lift it, it wouldn't have made any difference with what the cut off was and indeed that the -- whatever the cut off was, it had no effect on the power that's gathered up on the boom and on the wire, is that right?
speaker="victor_s_cichanowicz" startTime="533.609" stopTime="535.199">
    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    That's correct, yes.

speaker="victor_s_cichanowicz" startTime="536.403" stopTime="546.602">
    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    In other words, the power that was built up was the power that was caused by this timber becoming caught here. 
    And that's what caused the build up of the power.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="546.602" stopTime="559.849">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And is -- do I get from Judge -- is Judge Hastie's opinion really an endeavor to make almost a mathematical demonstration of that kind?

    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    Well, I wouldn't say precisely but he does speak of mathematics and I think the mathematics he's referring to is this -- if there was tremendous amount of calculations. 
    There were many exhibits. 
    And one of the calculations was showing how when a timber is caught or when something is caught here, the power stops building up here so that it throws everything else out of filter.

speaker="victor_s_cichanowicz" startTime="605.281" stopTime="651.978">
    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    No, it's because this load -- when you're lifting a load (Inaudible) -- just for the little weight on here, you will notice that this -- the boom does move but as soon as it overcomes the weight, it moves smoothly. 
    In other words, I'm now applying three pounds -- say three tons to lift three tons here or only roughly. 
    So the sample point of course has to lift that three tons here. 
    When I -- when this becomes caught that I start pulling here, this is -- this was computed by an expert. 
    I'm not only having this boom that's pulling this down but this because it's not moving is also pulling it down so you are getting a build up of a force cork up here from this boom and this -- and the fact that this is not moving.

    Before that, they have been discharging lumber and the weight of that was never obtained but even the pieces of lumber that they piled up in there is another more than that weight. 
    The weight I would say was -- the pile, the graphs up on the woods rail and then what they were trying to lift at this moment here. 
    They made a -- that this is a special graph that they when they're -- when they're discharging lumber, they have but it's a certain height and a certain width.

    Yes.
speaker="victor_s_cichanowicz" startTime="1049.741" stopTime="1068.962">
    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    And actually they -- I understand that they compute the working load by taking a piece of cable and stretching it until it breaks and then when it -- whatever tonnage it breaks at, they usually take one-fifth of that and say that that is the safe working load.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1068.962" stopTime="1069.376">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="victor_s_cichanowicz" startTime="1069.376" stopTime="1176.979">
    Mr. Victor S. Cichanowicz 
    Now, there is still with a three-ton safe working load and this cable having a breaking strain of 15 tons, there's a safety tolerance of 12 tons. 
    If we go to six, there's still a safety tolerance as of nine tons. 
    So that in -- in order -- in permitting something like this to be built up was -- we are working with a safety tolerance. 
    I mean, we are way within that point where it becomes dangerous. 
    In other words, this is -- it's still safe. 
    We have a safety tolerance of nine tons before this thing will break and I dare say that within this wire cable, it's not like a piece of wood. 
    It starts breaking -- wire cable this actually a machine, this -- these are parts that move. 
    I mean if you can take a piece of wire cable, you'll see that they move. 
    They -- it's like a machine, they move over each other. 
    They don't break like the fibers do on a piece of wood. 
    So that by being used, by being subjected to, say in this case, occasional stresses of six tons and that happens very rarely incidentally. 
    It only happens when something like this occurs. 
    That doesn't weaken this cable. 
    In fact, the trial court found that the breaking strain of this cable had not been diminished, that the topping-lift was -- the safe working load of that topping-lift was at least 15 tons. 
    They didn't say -- this trial court didn't say it was just 15, it said it was at least 15 tons and the wire cable had been tested shortly after the accident occurred.

    And after the accident occurred, it was taken to a testing laboratory and a test was made where the testing laboratory, by means of a testing machine which they have which applies pressure to this cable showed that this cable broke, if I recall correctly, under a pressure of 19,600 pounds which indicates --

    Suppose they had turned it over to Nacirema with all of these parts that you talked about in the position that you say brought them out, the dangerous condition. 
    That's the way to turned it over to Nacirema.

    Mr. John J. Monigan, Jr. 
    Well, I think not, Your Honor, because our contract in this case was not with the vessel within the terms of Ryan. 
    Our contract was with the charter of the vessel and the suggestion has been made that -- and I don't know whether, Your Honors, want to get into this aspect of it currently or not because the problem then presents itself as to, can a party to a stevedore contract -- a person not a party to a stevedoring contract avail himself of the principles annunciated by this Court in Ryan. 
    It is our contention that to do so is lacking any support. 
    Particularly, we don't have to reach the main argument even -- so long as the vessel has done something at fault even if a person can be the beneficiary of a contract to which he is not a party within this framework. 
    Nevertheless, I'm quite confident that no court would construe any part of warranty under Ryan to exculpate a person from fault which he himself has committed.

    Mr. John J. Monigan, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    Now, so far however as the situation on indemnity which is presented in the matter, the principles of Equating Act has been passed as negligence and in this circumstance doesn't apply. 
    Now, the counsel to the vessel has suggested that this matter was caused by the negligence of the longshoreman. 
    Now, the whole principle which is -- somewhat, I'm concerned to some degree in this matter as to whether or not the accident was caused by any mischief of the longshoreman regardless -- of course, if this Court is lead to the conclusion that the craft was not unseaworthy for whatever reason, then I don't have to concern myself about why, so long as it is considered that it is not unseaworthy. 
    However, if it is determined to be unseaworthy then we have to determine upon what theory is this vessel unseaworthy. 
    Now, there was a considerable mention yesterday and this morning about these parallelograms of forces in the vertical and component effects. 
    Now, we, this morning from the Congressional Library got a couple of books on rigging which I don't know -- I -- these are not cited in my brief, but possibly they will explain this for persons who are not a physicist, and I'm not, as to how this comes about.

    Mr. John J. Monigan, Jr. 
    Well, now that leads us to where we were going before, to the -- in the opinion of the Court of Appeals of course didn't reach the legal propositions for which I believe there is sufficient authority to justify my exculpation from liability. 
    Now, so far however as the unseaworthiness aspect of this craft is concerned, the forces which are assessed and I believe in the question to counsel, Mr. Justice Whittaker, you suggest that that the rotation of this pole has an effect upon this matter and it does. 
    And the position also of these matters here was for the guy -- preventer also have a factor. 
    Now, the reasons that this matter becomes important is that the theory of -- on theory of act of negligence which the trial court suggested in the matter was predicated upon the assumption that the location of these two guy and preventer was established without factual contradiction in order to have this astronomical strain which was in the vicinity of the 19 -- 17 to 19 tons. 
    Not alone does one have to assume a contingent pulling, but he also has to assume certain locations as to these ropes. 
    Now, there -- as a matter of fact, our longshoreman testified that rather than be in the position which was shown here and which was testified too, by the vessel, these matters were -- those -- that being their position. 
    Our witnesses testified that in fact they were in a position opposite the block at the base of the mast, so to create this position. 
    Now, as a consequence of that, all of the parallelograms of forces and factors and he adds up -- effect upon alters considerably. 
    So that in this position and there is a conflict in the testimony as to that which conflict --

    Mr. John J. Monigan, Jr. 
    That it appeared without contradiction that the position of this was and originally demonstrated. 
    And as a matter of fact, there was a short conflict assessment. 
    So, if unseaworthiness in the present case is to be predicated upon this protection for a location of the preventer then our interest in the matter is solely to determine whether that factual controversy should not be resolved because counsel for the vessel today has suggested that the continued hold is the factor after the wire became or the logs became jammed if they did become jammed. 
    There is a finding of jamming by the trial court, but the effect of the jamming is projected by the trial court upon the combination of that assumed location of the preventer as being without contradiction. 
    Now, it is our submission that the movement of that in order -- and all this testimony at the trial court as to which was referred to upon the several hypotheses was projected upon the theory that two things, and this the trial court found that the winch was bad. 
    The combination of the winch and the gear caused the craft to be unseaworthy, but that was triggered by this movement of the guy and preventer. 
    But that movement of the guy and preventer can have no effect upon the stresses which are imposed unless the position is such that mathematically on this parallelogram of forces that there would be those assumed locations. 
    Now, the -- as a consequence then that this Court should be inclined to consider that the unseaworthy, that the craft was unseaworthy because of some action of the longshoreman in moving gear. 
    Then we submit that that movement cannot be predicated upon the trial court's opinion because the trial court overlooked the fact that the longshoreman testified the one position for the gear and the vessel officer testified to another. 
    So, it was not without contradiction.

    But the -- this whole manner of -- of the -- well, I say this is as far as the beneficiary of the undertaking is concerned, the Third Circuit in the case that is cited on page 20 of our brief. 
    Well, it's not an identical situation. 
    It's quite similar and which they was held that the charterer or a vessel -- of a vessel was not the beneficiary of a stevedoring contract made between a stevedoring company and avoids charterer, so to permit the time charterer to sue the stevedoring company for damages sustained by reason of the failure to discharge a cargo when there was a work stoppage.

    Mr. John J. Monigan, Jr. 
    Well, the reason I -- the reason I suggested originally that there was not a situation of a third party beneficiary. 
    There -- as far as an intended beneficiary is concerned, there is no question at all that ordinary mercantile considerations of profit caused charterers to charter vessels and owners to hire them to charterers. 
    The time chart -- now, this is not a bareboat charter and the time charterer, when he enters into a contract to cause his hired vessel to be unloaded is not concerned about benefiting the owner of that vessel by reason of that contract. 
    What he wants to do is get the cargo discharged and get the ship on her way.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3386.372" stopTime="3390.846">

    I don't -- and it raises the whole question of what is and what isn't implied in the contract.
speaker="john_j_monigan" startTime="3390.846" stopTime="3452.102">
    Mr. John J. Monigan, Jr. 
    Well, there -- as far as an implied contract is concerned there certainly isn't any illegal obligation employed -- visited upon charterer which he is advised to discharge in anyway which would so far as his cargo discharged is concerned. 
    As far as the negligence is concerned, he doesn't owe any -- duty in negligence to his employees, so there's no basis for an employment agreement. 
    And so far as security of action is concerned that will arise only if the charterer is liable to the owner, and in this case there is no possible way for us to resolve that question because the ship was a German vessel. 
    The charterer was a South American company. 
    The charter party is not before the Court. 
    We don't know even by what law is to be determined of obligations under the charter party.

    It had something to do with it because there's a theory which is projected by the vessel here that the reason the whole affair happened was because there was a constant hold by the longshoreman on the cargo runner because it was jammed. 
    That that could not have continued to operate if the cut off device had ceased at three ton --

    Mr. John J. Monigan, Jr. 
    Well, it did to this extent. 
    As we referred before to 31 and 32 or rather 32. 
    The Court concluded that on the basis of the facts, it has found that the setting of the winch cut off device rendered the vessel unseaworthy.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now, is that consistent with what he found above unless you go to the -- instead of saying that even though your people -- the negligence brought about an unsafe position. 
    The ship was directly liable on the unseaworthiness premise.
speaker="john_j_monigan" startTime="3907.873" stopTime="4019.760">
    Mr. John J. Monigan, Jr. 
    Well, I think that's -- that's true, except that there isn't anything in the -- in the testimony that says this. 
    But there's no question at all from -- from physical factors that if the cause of this accident was pulling the gear apart as counsel showed that the gear couldn't have been pulled apart if the -- there had been exerted upon the gear no more than three -- no more than something plus three tons of strain. 
    Now, whether or not it's designed for that purpose or not, it is the fact that this machinery which they had on the ship and about which we knew nothing was capable of putting whether it was putting on this additional load which even if the timber was jammed could not have been done if the -- if the energy transmitted to the cargo runner by this electric winch could not have generated sufficient energy to increase it over the safe working load of the gear. 
    And for that reason, the integration, all of these things are integrated into one working machine and when one puts into that one working machine a device which creates energy greater than the rig can stand, that is a cause of the factor which -- without which the accident would not have happened. 
    And as a consequence of which, the indemnity claim can -- if we get that far, would be necessary to construe a contract which did not exist between the parties as indemnifying the vessel --

    Well, the Coast Guard thing, I think that -- that there are two factors which the Court of Appeals mentioned two facts and I think it's quite true. 
    There is the factor of two and a half times power which this -- mentioned in the Coast Guard regulation which quite obviously has nothing to do with this affair, I think, I submit. 
    Because in the first place the vessel was built in Bremerhaven and it was not connected with the Coast Guard affair on -- on that.

    It is our position, sir, that this Court has established the beyond to venture that the shipowner has a non-delegable duty to provide a safe place to work, on board the ship for the longshoreman as well as the seaman. 
    That he may not delegate that duty although he may delegate the job and if the job is performed improperly then the shipowner is liable. 
    We had not go insofar in this case as to state that for negligence alone the shipowner is responsible, although I think that we would be completely justified in taking that position on the basis of Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in the case of the Dixon versus United States where, Your Honor, passed aside the question of whether unseaworthiness is involved and said that the shipowner is liable on the basis of his non-delegable duty to the people on the vessel for the negligence of an independent contractor. 
    However, what we say here is based more on the Petterson case which Your Honors handed down following the decisions in Sieracki and in Hawn and Mahnich versus Southern Steamship Company.

    Mr. Abraham E. Freedman 
    Your Honor, that's exactly what the Court held there. 
    Now here, following Your Honor's decision in the Petterson case in which, Your Honors, will recall that the shipowner was held liable for a defective block which had been brought aboard, supplied and brought aboard by the longshoreman. 
    Following that in the case of Grillea, Judge Hand speaking for the Second Circuit had this set of facts before him. 
    There were -- the longshoremen were engaged on that vessel at that time and replacing the hatch boards. 
    And after some of the hatch boards had been replaced, some of the men who were engaged in that very practice stepped on one of the hatch boards which was set on top of the pot-eye and therefore unsteady, and down he went into the hole. 
    It was conceded that it was a negligent act in putting it there by this very longshoreman. 
    However, the Court there held that pursuant to Your Honors decision in the Petterson case, it was an unsafe condition for which the shipowner was responsible regardless of whether the condition was created by the longshoreman or by the ship -- the ship itself. 
    Now, similarly here, sir, we say that the condition which was created here whether it was by the ship or whether it was by the longshoreman was a terribly dangerous and unseaworhty one. 
    Aside of the cut off device completely, let me cite to Your Honors, Judge Hastie's decision or part of his decision which he sets forth on page 113 of the record. 
    My friend here has said that the exclusive and sole factor which was the approximate course of the accident was the negligence of the winch operator in continuing to apply pressure. 
    As a matter of fact neither courts so held, neither courts so find. 
    Here is what Judge Hastie said which was the -- as to what was the deciding factor, “The decisive fact -- this is the second paragraph about down in the middle of the page in record, page 113, “The decisive fact as the Court found it was that the employees of the Nacirema had so changed the position of the head of the boom as to seriously distort the normal composition of forces which is presented by a straight lifting operation. 
    It was for this reason that the topping-lift was subjected to an enormous, abnormal, and unanticipated strain.” 
    It was on a basis of that unsafe condition therefore and we urge Your Honors that on a basis of that alone there should be liability in this case. 
    And my friend's contention that the courts below --

    It may delegate the work but it cannot delegate that duty.

    Mr. Abraham E. Freedman 
    Well, I -- if Your Honor -- I -- I would like to understand Your Honor's question. 
    If Your Honor is saying that while a ship is in the control of the vessel owner or while the ship was being manned by its crew and it engages an independent contractor to perform certain work, let us say, it engages instead of just normal stevedoring work. 
    Let's say it engages a caterer to conduct the services in the stewards department. 
    And that caterer obtains a very bad food as a result of which the crew is poisoned. 
    This ship, let us say, was entirely careful in selecting a good caterer, a reputable caterer and even a (Voice Overlap)

    I'm not talking about that case. 
    I'm talking about the physical ship, the gear, the booms, all the components that a make ship what we call seaworthy. 
    And every expert would say and you would say it was seaworthy. 
    But it could be twisted out of shape. 
    It could be contorted, couldn't it, by some misconduct of those who handle it. 
    And therefore, your proposition is that whenever any non-crew members do these things that negligence per se renders the ship unseaworthy.
speaker="abraham_e_freedman" startTime="4950.568" stopTime="4950.845">
    Mr. Abraham E. Freedman

    Mr. Abraham E. Freedman 
    As a matter of a fact, that was the -- that was almost the bare statement which this Court made in Mahnich. 
    In the old days under the general maritime law before the Jones Act was handed down, there were numerous cases where the courts, this Court included in the -- in the Wily, and the others as they are out -- set out in the Mahnich case where the courts predicated liability on really negligence, although it was the negligence of a fellow servant which created an unsafe condition. 
    So that although there could not be a recovery on the basis of pure negligence of a fellow servant. 
    The Supreme Court in many instances as is outlined in the Mahnich case, allowed recovery where that negligence created an unsafe condition. 
    The Court has held that there would -- there need not be any scienter. 
    There was no notice. 
    The Court has held that it is an absolute duty.

    Mr. Abraham E. Freedman 
    Well, under the old law -- under the old law, there could be no recovery for the negligence of a fellow servant. 
    In the Mahnich case, a mate and a bosun selected a defective piece of rope from a group of rope which was an abundant supply of rope which was entirely satisfactory and they rigged the scaffold with it. 
    And the man went up on the foredeck and started to paint and down he came because of the defective rope. 
    It was their contended on the basis of the Pinar del Rio case that the ship could not be responsible because actually it was the negligence of the mate and of the bosun which created this condition. 
    And therefore, there could be no liability. 
    The Supreme Court said no, that rope was defective. 
    It didn't make any difference. 
    If it was an abundant supply of good rope, if there was an abundant supply of good rope, there had to be liability because it was an unsafe scaffold which had been rigged. 
    And the Court there specifically overruled the Pinar del Rio which had held expressly to the contrary.

    Only on the assumption, either that the presence of sound rope under which scaffold afforded an excuse for the painter to provide a safe staging or that anteceded negligence of the mate in directing the use of defective rope relieve their owners from liability to furnishing their barge, thereby rendered unseaworthy.
