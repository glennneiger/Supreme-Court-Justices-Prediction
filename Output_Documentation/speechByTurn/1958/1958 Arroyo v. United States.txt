Arroyo v. United States
speaker="john_r_hally" startTime="0.000" stopTime="131.657">
    Mr. John R. Hally 
    -- and that is we feel the unfairness inherent in the scope of the evidence, it opens up to use by the Government in such a trial. 
    We have charged this here or raised it as a second question namely that there was a fatal variance between -- fatal and prejudicial variance between the indictment and the particulars and the proof. 
    The Government contends that we have, in effect, smuggled a question in. 
    I don't -- I feel that it was fairly raised, but certainly, it was not expressly raised on the petition for a certiorari, but we feel that it's clear on the record. 
    The defendant here was indicted for receiving $15,000 on February 24th. 
    He asked for particulars and the Government said it was -- it was received in the form of two checks, for $7500 each on February 21st. 
    At that point, the defendant fairly foresaw, I submit, the scope approved for the trial, February 21st, the collective bargaining agreement, February 24th. 
    Instead of the trial, he was met with evidence of these withdrawals of moneys from the bank accounts extending to April 14th, almost two months after the date specified in these particulars. 
    Even if this is not available to us as in the point on appeal, we say that this fact cuts to the invalidity on the Government's theory. 
    Because certainly, if evidence, two months after the date which Section 302 deals with, namely, the receiving or the paying by the employer, the receiving by the employee can be used, why could an evidence six months, eight months, a year, payments to welfare funds are made annually under such a scope of evidence, the entire dealings between the employer and the employee would be available to the Government and its proof in all trust funds, in all subsequent breaches of them could be brought within the ambit of 302, which should be clearly contrary to the obvious intent of Congress in now dealing with taking up grappling and attempting legislation to cover this whole subject of misuse for personal benefit of trust fund moneys. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Eugene S. Grimm

    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    May it please the Court. 
    This is a labor racketeering case in the very real sense. 
    I first would like to lay one ghost that has arisen with respect to this notation on page 20 of the record. 
    It indicates a summons for trial for embezzlement. 
    I made an inquiry regarding that and I've been informed by the United States attorney from Puerto Rico, that the prosecution of Arroyo in Superior Court Ponce Division involved two charges for embezzlement of funds belonging to the union of the Central Mercedita, Ponce local, committed April 14th and May 11th, 1953. 
    Jury trial was held and Arroyo was acquitted March 12th, 1957, which was after this prosecution. 
    In any event, it's clear that the substance of the charges -- a charge, in this case, was not the substance of the trial in Puerto Rico local court.

    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    I gather from the information which I have that they are not the same transactions. 
    They were committed on different dates. 
    Here, the allegation is that and a proof is that the offense occurred February 21st and in the local trial judging from this charge were based on a transaction occurring April 14th and a later one, May 11th which was well beyond the --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="298.048" stopTime="298.928">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Same year?
speaker="eugene_s_grimm" startTime="298.928" stopTime="411.465">
    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Same year, yes, Your Honor. 
    I'd like to turn to the statute now. 
    Much has been said, but I'd like to outline the exact language of the statute. 
    On page 2 and 3 and 4 of the Government's brief, 302 (b) is the basis of this prosecution. 
    And 302 (b) says, "It shall be unlawful for any representative of any employees who are employed in an industry affecting commerce to receive, or accept, or to agree to receive or accept from the employer of such employees any money or other thing of value." 
    Now, (c), "The provisions of this section shall not be applicable -- and skipping down to 5 at the bottom of the page, "With respect to money or other thing of value paid to a trust fund established by such representative for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of such employer and their families." 
    And then on page 4 at the top of the page, "Provided that such payments are held in trust for the purpose of paying medical benefits and other welfare benefits and (b) the detailed basis on which such payments are to be made is specified in a written agreement with the employer and employees and employers are equally represented in the administration of such fund." 
    In other words, the fact that petitioner deposited this money in a -- in a bank account labelled, "welfare fund" is not at all important. 
    This payment was illegal unless that fund was jointly administered. 
    There had to be employer participation and dispensation of that fund.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="411.465" stopTime="418.500">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, so far as the employer -- and there was a time he paid it, that was to be the situation.
speaker="eugene_s_grimm" startTime="418.500" stopTime="419.960">
    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    That's right, Your Honor.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="419.960" stopTime="423.032">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    So, you don't question the good faith of the employer?

    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Not at all, sir.

speaker="eugene_s_grimm" startTime="425.069" stopTime="446.350">
    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Not at all. 
    But our point is the fact that the bank account on which he deposited these checks was labelled, welfare fund, does not alter the case at all. 
    So long as he was the one who had sole control over that fund and sole authority to dispense the funds, the receipts of the money was illegal and --

    Sir?

speaker="eugene_s_grimm" startTime="456.912" stopTime="499.303">
    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Yes, sir. 
    On page 26 of the record, the collective bargaining agreement entered into by the parties contained Article 6. 
    Article 6 reads as follows that is impertinent part, "The employer shall -- shall establish a fund which shall be known as the welfare fund in the amount of $15,000." 
    And then it specifies the things for which this fund can be spent. 
    And then the last paragraph, "This welfare fund shall be administered by a committee that will be appointed by mutual agreement between the union and the employer. 
    The committee thus appointed shall furnish the employer monthly, with a written statement of the disbursements made from said fund."
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="499.303" stopTime="501.133">

    This is the agreement.

    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    This is the agreement which was signed on February 21st, 1953. 
    Now to -- to put --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="512.936" stopTime="526.690">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But the only thing that the deviation then from this is, as I gathered, that that the man put the money in a new deposit, calling it welfare fund is that it?
speaker="eugene_s_grimm" startTime="526.690" stopTime="535.412">
    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Well, from the facts which you've heard so far, Your Honor, you would gather that impression. 
    But that is not the fact that was proved at the trial and that's why I'd like to go on to the facts a little more.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="535.412" stopTime="539.991">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What is -- what is the deviation from this, specifically?
speaker="eugene_s_grimm" startTime="539.991" stopTime="677.555">
    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    The -- the deviation is simply this. 
    These parties have been negotiating together for -- well, ever since 1949. 
    And as a matter of fact petitioner as president of his union local has served as chief negotiator for the union and a Mr. Goyco has served as negotiator for the employers. 
    Now, there were two employers, but they were operated as one enterprise. 
    And they had been negotiating since 1949. 
    There had been a previous contract entered into for the year 1952. 
    That contract provided for the establishment of a welfare fund in the sum of $15,000. 
    The previous fund was to be dispensed under joint control by a committee. 
    It had been dispensed under joint control by a committee. 
    It had pending disbursement. 
    It had been deposited in a bank account established in the Bank of Ponce, Puerto Rico. 
    That bank account was still in existence and two signatures, one for the union and one for the employer were required to draw checks against that account. 
    Now, when they were negotiating this new contract, the question came up as to who was to serve on the disbursement committee for this welfare fund. 
    At that time, petitioner affirmatively stated that he wanted to be the union representative on this disbursing committee. 
    Now, he had been the representative on the previous committee as well. 
    And so, that was no novelty. 
    But this, we claim, as a false representation, because it, at least, it clearly indicated to the employer that he was willing to accept the principle of joint control over this fund. 
    And that was the only basis upon which the fund could be established and that was one of the things which the employer have in mind when returned the check over to him. 
    Now, there is a second item here. 
    At the time the contract was signed, the previous year, the welfare fund had been deposited by a representative of the employer. 
    However, petitioner stated that he wanted to show the checks to a meeting of the employees to be held that evening. 
    And he agreed to deposit those checks in the then existing welfare fund bank account in the Bank of Ponce, Puerto Rico.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="677.555" stopTime="679.417">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That was his duty under the contract?
speaker="eugene_s_grimm" startTime="679.417" stopTime="726.535">
    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    That -- that was his -- that was his duty under the verbal understanding with the employer at the time that the checks were turned over to him. 
    On that basis, because of his official position as president and chief negotiator, because he had previously served on the welfare fund committee, because he had nominated himself to be a member of the new committee, because he agreed to deposit the checks in the then existing bank account which required two signatures to -- to withdraw funds from that account, on that basis, the checks were turned over to him. 
    Now, instead of depositing those checks in the then existing bank account, he took those checks to a different bank, the National City Bank of Ponce, Puerto Rico, and he opened a new account. 
    And --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="726.535" stopTime="728.807">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And made them to his own use, is it?
speaker="eugene_s_grimm" startTime="728.807" stopTime="815.469">
    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, that new account was labeled, welfare fund, but he deposited the check in -- in the new bank account and a few days later, he turns up with the union resolution, but purports to be a resolution of the board of directors of the union and that resolution says, "That as a result of consideration by the union board of directors, we have authorized the petitioner to draw upon this welfare fund on his own signature." 
    Now, we showed, the Government proved that trial, presented evidence from which the jury could infer that that resolution was spurious, from beginning to last. 
    The meeting of the board of directors which purportedly had passed that resolution never took place. 
    There were two signatures appearing on that resolution at the time it was introduced in evidence, one was petitioners', one was -- belonged to a Silvagnoli, the union secretary. 
    Silvagnoli testified his signature was a forgery. 
    Petitioner presented testimony from witnesses, the union vice president for instance, testified -- well, he had signed this resolution originally, but it had been torn at the bottom and perhaps his -- his signature has been torn off that is at least -- that was the inference he wanted to convey. 
    But even that witness -- the defense witness conceded that Silvagnoli's signature, the signature of the union secretary appeared to be a forgery.

    Why wouldn't be embezzlement when he takes the money and supposed just go -- he had (Inaudible) collecting that money, but he just want to let the fund that he got it out and convert it to his own use? 
    Wouldn't that be embezzlement?
speaker="eugene_s_grimm" startTime="869.134" stopTime="881.012">
    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Well, we say no, Your Honor. 
    That is larceny by trick because from the very beginning, from the very moment that he received those checks and converted them into money, he had no intent except to convert them to his own use.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="881.012" stopTime="885.834">

    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    I do not know, Your Honor. 
    But it's certainly punishable by Section 302 (b) and this, we show, through the legislative history of the section. 
    Now, back to this question of forgery, since he presented this resolution to the bank and cause the bank to rely upon it, in -- in permitting -- in changing the signature card or permitting a signature to be cut -- card to be made out on his own signature, it might constitute forgery under Puerto Rican law, although, as I say, I'm not specific as to Puerto Rican law.

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But the difficulty is that arises only theoretically because as a practical matter when you put the question to a jury when you can -- when the petitioner could show that a valid deposit was made and perhaps some of the money spent for a welfare fund purpose under joint disbursement and then later a forged check -- he uses a forged check to draw funds from it, then it is almost certain that a jury will infer -- well the funds was validly established. 
    And there was once upon a time, at least, a valid welfare fund from which he later embezzled money. 
    But, of course, so long as we can assume as part of the question that he never intended to permit the establishment of the valid welfare fund, then we have larceny by trick punishable by Section 302 (b).

    Well, I suppose, strictly speaking, the check should've been made payable to the welfare fund instead of to the union. 
    However, since they had agreed that it was to be deposited in the then existing bank account and because they had agreed as to who their representatives were to be on the committee dispersing the fund, then the situation is just as though they had handed the checks to any other person whom they trusted and said, “Take these down to the bank and deposit them.”

    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Well, of -- of course, the embezzlement, if the fund had ever been established -- here, let me say that the chief reason why we're willing to say that embezzlement does not fall under Section 302 (b) is because the case was tried on that theory. 
    The judge expressly ruled, well, if this fund had been established and any embezzled that wouldn't be under the Act, but it is the way it -- the jury can find that it is under the Act this way. 
    And so the question -- there, the embezzlement would be from the fund. 
    Now, I would suppose that the legal title to that fund rests in the trustee, one of them being the employer's representative. 
    And that the beneficial interest in that fund rests in the employee.

    But even so, I think that the legislative history shows very clearly that Congress wanted to forbid all payments from the employers to employees except certain ones. 
    One of the certain ones they are willing to authorize were welfare fund payments. 
    But that was authorized only if it was made in a certain way for a specified purpose under dual control. 
    And so a welfare fund payment which went to a fund which was not under dual control, would be an illegal payment, an illegal payment under this section and that is provided with the employer, did it knowingly, and if he thought that there was to be dual control and the representative took it not intending dual control which is this case, it's an illegal payment, absolutely illegal.

    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Your Honor, I wanted -- I've been trying to get to the fact after the deposit for sometime here. 
    This is what happened. 
    He made this deposit and he presents this resolution and then a few days later, he begins writing checks. 
    Now the first thing he did was transfer $1300 to his personal checking account. 
    And then he drew a check against the fund for cash and he endorsed it and he gave it to a Pontiac dealer as a down payment on a new automobile. 
    And then a few days later, Goyco, the employer's representative, found out that the money hadn't been deposited in the welfare fund bank account and he protested. 
    And so petitioner went down -- petitioner stated, “Well, I'm going to control this fund by myself.” 
    And he went down and he withdrew the rest of the money or the bank asked him to withdraw it, but in any event, 10 days after he started to draw upon this account, there was -- he had spent over -- there were over $5000 was gone from the $15,000. 
    And so he took the balance now over into some $9800 and he put that in a general union account. 
    And then he continued to draw against it for personal purposes. 
    He paid off -- he paid for a refrigerator which he had purchased and he paid for a household furnishing and then he bought some furniture equipment for union officers and diverted -- diverted it in that way. 
    And then eventually, he comingled it with general union funds, so that became a loss, of course, forever. 
    Now -- well, shortly after he did that, he called it -- he expelled the union -- the union secretary from the union. 
    The union secretary was normally required to draw checks against general union funds, you see. 
    And so, he expelled the secretary from the union and called a meeting of the workers and announced that he wanted to write -- the right to draw checks against general union funds on his own signature, you see. 
    And thereafter, he did draw upon general union funds into which the -- the balance of the welfare fund had been forged. 
    Now, it's true that -- of course, I confess that Mr. Hally and I are a part on this so far as I can see the Government proved a specific diversion of over $3000 of this money. 
    But as to the balance, none of it went it to the proper welfare fund into the preexisting welfare fund bank account. 
    And petitioner never did account for it. 
    And steadfastly refused to account for it, even though as to time and time again and never had to this day.

speaker="eugene_s_grimm" startTime="1927.501" stopTime="2211.476">
    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Well that -- there -- that takes us directly to the legislative history of Section 302 (b) and it was well laid out there on the floor of the Senate to try and put it as briefly as I can. 
    Section 302 came in to the law. 
    Well, at first arose in 1946. 
    At that time we just had a steel strike, a General Motors strike and United Mine Workers were then on strike. 
    And one of the contentions of the United Mine Workers was this, they refused to negotiate further until the operators agreed to pay a royalty of 10 cents a ton, on every ton of coal mined. 
    Now, Mr. Lewis stated this money is to go into a fund. 
    That fund will be used to pay pensions, to pay welfare, medical benefits and to provide educational aid to minors. 
    Now, Mr. -- Senator Byrd offered an amendment to the case bill which was pending at that time. 
    And case bill was designed to amend the National Labor Relations Act and he said, “Well, we want to forbid this kind of payment unless there's some sort of control over it.” 
    And after much discussion, it was agreed that they should authorize welfare funds, but that some sort of control should be provided. 
    Senator Ball offered an amendment to Byrd's original amendment which cast Section 302 in almost exactly the form which it has today. 
    And he said at that time and we quote on page 21 of our brief, he said at that time, "That if they weren't very careful, these welfare funds might be used for organizational activities or something of that sort." 
    And as he said, after all, Mr. Lewis might regard that as educational aid to miner -- to mining industry or to miners. 
    Now, here's a clear case where he -- where he envision the giving of the money for a proper purpose, that is a welfare fund purpose, but accepted with a hidden intent to use it for something else, to use it for organizational activities. 
    And similarly, of course, Section 302 then passed as far as the case bill was vetoed by the President and in 1947, when the Taft-Hartley Act was passed, Senator Ball again offered, 302 from the floor of the Senate. 
    And at that time he stated that he wanted to ensure unless we -- on page 23 of our brief, this is a statement with which he introduced Section 302 (b). 
    Unless we make sure that such funds, welfare funds, when they are established, are really trust funds -- trust funds and are actually used for the benefit to employees specified in the agreement. 
    There is a very grave danger that the funds will be used for the personal gain of union leaders or for political purposes or other purposes not contemplated when they are -- when they are established. 
    Now, this -- clearly here, he envisioned the case where the money is given for a proper welfare purpose, but accepted with a secret intent to use it for another and improper purpose. 
    And Congress specifically intended to require that both parties must intend to establish a welfare fund before this payment would be lawful. 
    Now, Senator Ball's comments are not the isolated comments of simply one senator from the floor of the Senate. 
    And similarly, Senator Byrd and Senator Noland and Senator Taft, their remarks which we have set forth in considerable detail, which I've attempted to summarize very hurriedly here, are far more persuasive than you -- than in the usual case because these Senators proposed 302 as an amendment to the case bill in 1946. 
    They protested the omission of 302 from the committee bill of the Senate in 1947. 
    They offered 302 from the floor of Senate in 1947 and got it accepted. 
    They prevailed upon the House to receive in 1947 and - and accepted in the conference bill as they put across the whole Taft-Hartley Act toward the President's veto. 
    Now, these are not isolated comments. 
    These are the statements of the men who did the most to put 302 into the law. 
    They demanded mutual -- they demanded that both parties act honestly and with an honest purpose. 
    And the fact that the employer thought he was contributing to a bonafide trust fund is not controlling in this case.

    Congress, I think, showed very clearly -- remember here, one of the requirements of the section is that (a) on the top of page 4, "Such payments are held in trust for the purpose of paying -- either paying welfare benefits. 
    And (b), the detailed basis on which such payments are to be made is specified in a written agreement." 
    In other words, Congress wanted to make sure that welfare payments would be welfare payments. 
    And they even went so far as to specify that the fund out of which you pay pensions must be a separate fund from that out of which you pay medical benefits. 
    And I think this was to ensure that the pension fund could be set up on a sound financial basis and some of the -- and to ensure that some of the employees would not later find that the money had run out. 
    These funds are for the benefit of the -- of the worker, not for the benefit of the union and not for the benefit of the employer necessarily except in the sense that each will get better performance from the worker as a result of them.

    Mr. Eugene S. Grimm 
    Yes. 
    However, I should -- I should say here about the charge in this case as we've indicated on page 10 of the brief. 
    He gave a charge which submitted this issue to the jury saying that, "If the employer, in delivering money, deliver -- delivers it for the exclusive purpose of creating a fund, the representative receiving that money, must have the same objective in mind. 
    Now, if his objective is different and if he gets hold of the money and does not comply with the provisions of this section as to the fund, then he cannot claim of what the employer said must guide you, you must be guided simply by what happened. 
    What were the circumstances under which this money came in to the possession of the defendant? 
    If you believe that from the time the defendant received said sum of money from the employers, he had complete and sole control of said money in violation of the collective bargaining agreement -- agreement and the law and utilize such money or any part of it for his personal benefit, then I charge you that the defendant has violated the above mentioned section of the law. 
    Now, here, the entire context -- sometimes he uses the word, "control", sometimes he uses the word, "motives", sometimes he uses the word, "intent". 
    But so far as he uses motive and intent, he means the same thing. 
    And that, I think, is shown by the context of his remarks. 
    And he submitted to the jury the sole question that there is in this case and we contend that question is this. 
    We say that the evidence to show that from the negotiation of this contract onward from that very moment on, petitioner had no intention to do anything except get hold of that money for his personal use and that he never did anything except things that enabled him to get that personal control over the funds. 
    And that was a theory upon which this case went to the jury. 
    Did he accept the money for funds or for --

speaker="john_r_hally" startTime="2755.623" stopTime="2937.656">
    Mr. John R. Hally 
    Because the Government's theory of this case varied somewhat from the lower court toward appeal, my brief in all aspects doesn't need it, so I would like to take this time to point out the principal reasons why we feel this theory of this is not apt. 
    The first one, I renew my argument that the instructions do not support the Government's contention that the case was submitted to the jury on an intent basis. 
    I've said during my argument that the word was never used once, with reference to the defendant's conduct. 
    The word was read by Mr. Grimm as objective, intend as a word of art in the criminal law and if the judge had intended to submit it on that basis, he was -- he would've used that intent. 
    The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit did not consider that the case was submitted to the jury on that basis. 
    So, I don't think it's supported by the record below this theory. 
    In the lower court, the Government had a different theory, this theory of control, if the defendant had complete and sole control over the fund, then this crime was brought within the Act. 
    Here, we're told the intent -- the theory is intent. 
    It's not supported by the record. 
    The second point I'd like to make is that the Government's reading of the legislative history is -- is not supported by the statutory analysis. 
    One of the purposes Congress was obviously concerned with would be the union leader who took the money, pay to the welfare fund and then later decided to divert it without any contemporaneous intent decided to divert it to political purposes or the strike fund purposes. 
    Under the Government's theory, you couldn't reach that man even though Congress was obviously concerned with him because he didn't have the contemporaneous intent. 
    The Government's theory puts everything upon the man having the intent to use it for the unprescribed purpose at the time he received the money. 
    Surely, we should not attribute to Congress an intent in 302 which wouldn't begin to reach the bulk of the cases which the Congress obviously had in mind in enacting that statute. 
    That's why the position or the reading of the statute and its framework which we contend for, is the only one who accomplished it. 
    Namely, that these events which happened after the payment and receipt, are to be taken cared of by the equity powers and the federal jurors in the federal District Court. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan's question referred to a violation of say the arbitration agreement, provision for appointment of a neutral arbitrator, provision for the appointment of an annual audit. 
    Surely, all of these things which could only happen after the event could not retroactively make the payment and receipt illegal. 
    The Congress was looking there to the equity powers on the civil side of the federal court to cure the Act. 
    And they were not looking to these crimes of misuse for personal purposes even with intent at that time. 
    And they are now looking to that subject. 
    They have drafted the statute. 
    It seems with -- on the eve of passage in some form or another which would clearly cover the case, there was no reason to stretch this statute and this is certainly a stretching to cover the facts of this case.
