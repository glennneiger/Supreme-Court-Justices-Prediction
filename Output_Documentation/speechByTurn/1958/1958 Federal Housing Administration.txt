    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case arises out of the Veterans' Emergency Housing Program, which was established in 1946. 
    In that year, Congress was apprised that a national emergency existed because of a critical housing shortage. 
    In this connection, it was called specifically to the congressional attention, almost 3 million returning World War II veterans and their families would be in need of residential housing by the end of 1946 and that the majority of them would not have the means to purchase homes, and therefore, would require so-called "rental housing". 
    In an endeavor to meet this acute problem in the statutory words to accelerate the production of houses with preference for World War II veterans and at sales prices or rentals within their means, Congress amended Section 608 of the National Housing Act to authorize the Federal Housing Administration to ensure mortgages covering multifamily housing projects in which a preference would be given to veterans. 
    The particularly attractive feature of Section 608 was its provision that the principle obligation of the insured mortgage could be as much as 90% of the reasonable replacement cost of the project. 
    This meant that if the project sponsor served as architect and builder of the project, they could construct it with little, if any, outlay of cash and thus, with little, if any, risk of loss, that the other 10% would be represented by architect fees and the builder's profit. 
    Now, judged by any objective standard, this program established under Section 608 was an immense success. 
    Well over 7,000 apartment houses were constructed containing over 450,000 rental units. 
    These projects were backed by Government insurance in an amount in excess of $3 billion. 
    With extremely due exceptions, these projects were successful in their operation, as is evidenced by the fact that the rate of default has run only between 1% and 1.5% of the total mortgages outstanding. 
    At the same time however, in some instances, project owners having applied for and obtained the advantage of Government mortgage insurance which enabled them to build this residential housing at little or no cost to themselves. 
    Started to engage, endeavored to increase the profitableness of their operations in a practice outside what we deem at any rate to be the scope of the legislative aid, namely the practice of renting units for transient occupancy. 
    One of these instances was that of the appellee in this case.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    How general is that right?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="237.602" stopTime="529.089">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Your Honor, there are no specific statistics on it, insofar as the record and the congressional reports indicate that it could hardly be described as a widespread practice, but there were instances of it being done. 
    I don't think that there is any really -- really available figures on the -- the precise percentage of instances, but I think it is fair to characterize it as a -- as not a widespread practice, as a limited, relatively few of the 7000 plus units that were built. 
    Now, the issue in this case is the appellee's right to engage in this practice of transient rentals. 
    Now, on December 1949, the appellee was incorporated in the State of South Carolina for the purpose of obtaining Section 608 insurance of a mortgage covering a 12-storey apartment house to be constructed in Charleston. 
    Consistent with this purpose, it's charter which was prepared on a standard FHA form, specifically prohibited it from engaging in any business other than a construction and operation of a rental housing project so long as any of its property was subject to FHA insurance -- insured mortgage. 
    The appellee submitted an application to the FHA for a mortgage commitment on a -- this proposed project. 
    This application was disapproved by the local FHA officials, because the chief underwriter was dissatisfied with the location, which the apartment house was to have. 
    At the insistence of the appellee however, the rejection by the local officials was reversed by the FHA officials in Washington and the mortgage commitment was authorized not withstanding the local objection to the location at which the project was to be built. 
    Project was completed in July 1951 and in September 1951 as it was required to do under its charter and under the regulations, the appellee submitted and the Federal Housing Administration approved a proposed schedule of maximum monthly rentals. 
    And this schedule contained no indication that the appellee intended to furnish any of the partners. 
    One month later however, with the aid of a parent corporation which held all but three of the 1999 shares of common stock in a dollar form, the appellee engaged on a course of conduct concealed from the FHA which in the words of the Court below was a subterfuge. 
    First, without seeking FHA approval, the parent corporation furnished a number of appellees apartments and the tenants of those apartments were charged $15 to $20 a month in addition to the scheduled approved rentals. 
    This additional rental however was paid to the parent corporation so that it appeared that appellee was maintaining its schedule of rentals. 
    Four month later in February of 1952, again, without applying for permission or even advising the FHA that it intended to do so, the appellee started to rent his furnished efficiency apartment on a transient basis at the rate of $6 per day. 
    Now, the schedule rental on these apartments was $77.50 per month which broken down to a daily basis would have been less than $2.60. 
    In order again to maintain the appearance of complying with its schedule of rentals, the appellee divided the $6 into two parts, it retained the $2.60 approximately and the balance was paid over as a so-called "furniture rental" to the parent corporation. 
    Additionally, in April of 1952, the appellee submitted the required rental housing occupancy report to the Federal Housing Administration. 
    In that report it failed to disclose that some of the units had been furnished and were being rented on a daily basis, despite the fact that the instruction from the Court indicated that the report should reflect those units if any which were furnished. 
    In short, at no time from the inception of the project did the appellee make an extended endeavor to obtain a larger number of residential tenants at the schedule of rentals, nor if I'm able to obtain residential tenants at those rentals, did it make an endeavor to increase the occupancy of the project through lower rentals.

    Has anybody turned down who otherwise would have been eligible or have it or -- or if you had a little preference to --
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="537.853" stopTime="740.275">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Insofar as the record shows, no, Your Honor. 
    But the -- our point here is that the appellee at these rentals, the appellee apparently felt it was unable to build its buildings, it resorted to furnishing apartments rather than to lowering their rentals in an endeavor to acquire tenants that way. 
    And there's no showing in this record that their rents could not have been lowered. 
    Now, what it did here was almost immediately after the establishment of the project, it went into the -- first, into the furnish departments of rentals in excess of those approved in the schedule. 
    And then when that didn't prove a financial success, it embarked on the practice of running the transients. 
    Now, it is to be noted here that the rental only was a part but gain was $77.50 a month, that if potentially, these transient units could have obtained up to $180 a month, considerably in excess of that. 
    And of course, it has to be taken again against the congressional background as we'll see that Congress was endeavoring to provide for the veterans, moderate and low-cost rental housing. 
    Now in 1954, the attention of Congress was directed to the fact that some Section 608 projects, which it received as Government aid to provide residential housing for veterans were being used as the appellee's project for transit purposes. 
    It further came to the attention of the Congress that in a due isolated instances, the record indicates that this was between 12 and 15. 
    Where the FHA deemed a hardship to exist, it had granted permission for transient rentals and it had done so in the belief that the power inferred to qualify the statue to regulate the methods of operation, of the mortgagor, gave it discretion in what it deemed be to be a hardship case to -- to permit this, but it was done on these 12 to 15 cases only on a special -- special request. 
    Well, this came to the attention of Congress. 
    Both of the congressional committees concerned agreed that this practice clearly violated the legislative purpose underlying Section 608 and that the integrity of the multifamily housing project program required that the FHA take action to ensure that the practice stopped. 
    Now, the House Committee thought that no further legislation was needed to archive this end. 
    Senate Committee however decided that in order to ensure the enforcement of the legislative intent, a provision emphasizing that intent should be inserted in the National Housing Act, and the Conference Committee agreed with this view and accordingly, Section 513 was added to the statute. 
    And it, one, expressly declares the consistent congressional purpose that housing projects subject to FHA insured mortgages are not to be used for hotel or transient purposes while the insurance remains outstanding. 
    Secondly, provides subject to two exceptions, which do not pertain to this appellee, that no new existing or rehabilitated multifamily housing subject to an FHA insured mortgage maybe operated for such purposes. 
    And three, directs the Federal Housing Commissioner to enforce the prohibition with all appropriate means at his disposal and authorize the Attorney General in the event that voluntary compliance not obtained, to obtain injunctive relief. 
    Now, the Court below has enjoined --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="740.275" stopTime="751.532">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    (Voice Overlap) before you get to that, how about those instances where the FHA did permit them to do that. 
    Are they still operating in that manner, or were they enjoined?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="751.532" stopTime="765.256">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No, the -- if your Court pleases, the Congress recognized and the Congress felt that the FHA had misconstrued the statute a provision as to methods of operations, but the -- but the Congress recognized that there were these instances of expressed approval.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="765.256" stopTime="765.421">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="765.421" stopTime="781.435">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    So one of the two exceptions to the operation of this prohibition is that where the FHA gave approval, a mortgagor can continue to rent the number of units that it had been previously given permission to rent on a transient basis.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="781.435" stopTime="783.283">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is that specifically in the statute?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="783.283" stopTime="784.166">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    That's correct.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="784.166" stopTime="795.786">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And how could -- how could that logically follow if Congress had always intended that it should be -- should not be used for transient rooms.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="795.786" stopTime="805.724">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    It follows, we think, for this reason, the Congress -- in Congress' view, the FHA had made a mistake in authorizing these 12 to 15 projects, approval.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="805.724" stopTime="805.777">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="805.777" stopTime="824.345">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    In this 12 to 15 projects. 
    In the Congress' view however, that out of a sense of fairness, believe that it would be unfair to impose this restriction now in -- on -- in those cases where this specific approval erroneously had been given by the FHA.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="824.345" stopTime="836.579">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well now, if the statute -- if the statute prohibited the FHA from doing it in the first instance, how could a later statute say that they were all right?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="836.579" stopTime="884.502">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Later statute -- well, of course, it would be within the -- the congressional power of course to -- to authorize this practice. 
    But in the Congress' view, it at all times had been prohibited, that the FHA had misinterpreted the provision giving it control over methods of operation. 
    And what the Congress was saying is that this practice has always been contrary to the legislative purpose, we're now going to stop it, but we are going to make this one exception, that where, and this of course isn't the appellee's case at all. 
    But where the FHA did and erroneously, give this permission, we will let the -- the project continue, except of course only those units which the FHA had given permission to rent. 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="884.502" stopTime="896.816">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So it's your position that if -- if the FHA had given permission to Darlington before the 1954 statute, you could not enjoin them.

    -- this veteran's housing program. 
    All the way through it, is the -- the court below itself recognizes the dominant aim, the single aim indeed of providing long-term modest cost housing for the veterans. 
    Legislative history contains no indication of any kind of congressional concern with providing financing for hotels or for any other kind of transient accommodations. 
    The preamble to the statute to which I eluded before talks in terms of this statute, this program, acceleration of houses with preference for the veterans and their families at rentals and sales prices within their means. 
    And --

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    The -- there was a -- there is a limitation, a maximum limitation of three years. 
    Now, we suggest, if the Court please, however that that does not carry with it the implication that anything less including overnight rentals.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="999.599" stopTime="1003.433">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, what is it to indicate that what the minimum might be?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="1003.433" stopTime="1042.569">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Well the minimum -- of course the -- the minimum, we -- the transient occupancy is defined in terms of 30 days. 
    And again, that of course is a relatively arbitrary figure, but the notion is a long-term tenant is there for at least that period of time. 
    And again, this program, the reason why there would have been -- there would have been absolutely no necessity for the establishment of a -- of a minimum period, because Congress was dealing here, expressly with this problem of the veteran difficulty in finding accommodations for his families, residential units, that's the only thing that the Congress was addressing itself to.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1042.569" stopTime="1058.994">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, the thing that troubles me is this. 
    If Congress intended that there should be no transient tenancies, why wouldn't that have been on the contracts? 
    Why wouldn't the FHA have put that in some of these contrast.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="1058.994" stopTime="1141.922">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Your Honor, the -- the fact of the matter is again that the -- the whole program being setup in terms of a long-term residential project, the terms of the contract or the terms of rather the charter, there actually wasn't a contract as such, but the terms of the appellee's charter, the regulations of the FHA, were all geared in terms all of this long range operation. 
    Now, if you look at the regulations, they talk, for example, in terms of dwelling accommodations. 
    Dwelling accommodation shall be this and that and the other thing. 
    Now, dwelling accommodations as we indicate in our brief both in common and in legal parlance. 
    We first do something which is intended as a resident for a person on a more or less permanent basis. 
    It talks about leases in the -- in the charter. 
    And again, a lease is a document which normally connotes a occupancy over a period of time, and it talks again in terms of, for example, the deposit, there can't be -- the mortgagor can't require a deposit of more than one month's rent. 
    And in other places there is again as reference to one month's rent. 
    We think if the Court pleases, if you go through these documents, you will see that they are all addressed in the terms of really what Congress had in -- in mind, which was a long-term residential occupancy.

speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="1157.887" stopTime="1229.353">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Absolutely, and we think also that the rentals to transients is implicitly, if not expressly inconsistent with the statutory objective as stated in the statute of providing this -- this housing at lower or moderate cost. 
    Transient housing after all is usually as this case itself clearly indicates, not on a low-rate basis, I mean here, this -- on one month basis, one of these efficiency apartments would have come to $180 that per month. 
    And the Congress was thinking in terms again of the -- of the moderate cost, and we think that the charter and the regulations taken together give a little question that the contemplation all on the line, the obligation which was assumed by this appellee was that of renting its apartments for residential use. 
    Now, the appellee has harped on the -- the fact that the regulations referred to structures principally designed for residential use. 
    And if that says that word "principally" means the part of the property could be devoted to transient use.

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    It isn't residential use in the -- in the context in which the terms employ, that's right. 
    Now, I think the court below didn't dispute that. 
    The court below said -- it just says principally designed for residential use and it was thinking about the non-principle part of it, but as we just show in our brief, this term "principally designed for residential use", well, it isn't in Section 608, it wasn't some of the other statutes dealing with mortgage programs and it has been consistently interpreted as meaning simply that the -- the mortgagor can put in his building professional offices and such commercial facilities as would cater to the needs of the more or less permanent occupants. 
    And it has never been construed as conferring any kind of authority to rent to -- to transients.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    In conjunction with the questions or series of questions propounded to you by the Chief Justice, would you give us your view of the meaning of subsection (c) set forth at pages 48 and 49 in your brief, saying that "Notwithstanding any other provision of this act." 
    This is 1954 Act now, "No mortgage with respect to multifamily housing shall be insured under this Act, (except pursuant to a commitment to ensure issued prior to the effective date of the Housing Act of 1954)." 
    And skipping the parenthesis now, "No mortgage with respect to multifamily housing shall be issued for an additional term unless the mortgagee -- mortgagor certifies that while the insurance remains effective, he will not rent or permit the rental of the housing or any part thereof for a transient or hotel purpose, is that not inconsistent with (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="1354.086" stopTime="1458.362">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No, Your Honor. 
    That -- that's dealing of course with the necessity for the mortgagor's certification under oath and the -- the -- and of course the other provision, subsection 2. 
    Subsection -- if you look at 2 (b), that's the -- says flatly that notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, this is on page 48. 
    "No new existing or rehabilitated multifamily housing with respect to which a mortgage is insured shall be operated for transient or hotel purposes, and that covers the -- the gamut. 
    And then again in the enforcement section which is subsection (b), the -- 49, "The commissioner is hereby authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this section by all appropriate means at his disposal as to all existing multifamily housing with respect to which mortgage was insured under this Act prior to the effective date of the Housing Act of 1954." 
    The only thing that subsection (c) relates to is, what is going to be required in the future of my way of -- at the time that these mortgages were insured. 
    Now, they only can be insured if the -- the mortgagor certifies under oath that he will not engage in transient rentals, so this was merely an additional weapon that was being placed at the hands of the FHA Commissioner to ensure compliance, but we don't think that that is at all inconsistent with our position that -- that this statute is indeed clarified if clarification was necessary, the legislative intent from the very beginning that this program was set up for this particular purpose and that the individuals who obtained the benefits of this program were restricted to using the property for the purpose which Congress says that the program up for.

    The fact is, we submit, that even without the expressed prohibition that this is implicit, in the statute and we submit that these people are governed by that, that when the power -- if the program, anyway that you would look at it, the program was setup, as the legislative history indicates, for this single purpose.

    Well again, that if it -- if it didn't, it is only because there was not an expressed prohibition. 
    There's no question as even the lower court recognized that this was contrary to the intent of the Congress. 
    The primary intent of the Congress is to provide this veterans housing. 
    So that at most, this was a practice which was of questionable standing and there wasn't any again, any clear and unequivocally expressed right upon these people, either by the statute or by the regulation. 
    It had been a case of the statute saying, "You may rent a transient," so the regulation is saying you may rent a transient. 
    And subsequently, the Congress were to take that away, that would be an entirely different question, but here, there -- it's just that mere absence, there isn't anything here which could be construed as affirmatively giving a right upon these people to do something which the statute obviously was designed not to accomplish.

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Not necessarily, Your Honor. 
    It wasn't in any way the clear an expressed right, it was nothing which affirmatively created this right. 
    And all that at most it was, was a congressional oversight not setting forth not only what they wanted done, but all of the things that they didn't want done. 
    But again it was violating the spirit of the -- of the 1946 Act throughout.

    All right. 
    You follow your own course of argument, but I just wanted you to -- wanted to know whether you give up the construction problem.
speaker="j_c_long" startTime="2036.158" stopTime="2278.240">
    Mr. J. C. Long 
    Not in the least, I have been fighting that for four years, and I'm right here still continuing that when you read the Act itself, that if you read the Act itself you will find that's an ingeniously worded piece of legislature. 
    On its face, it would appear as if it did as the wording of the Act, to retroactively apply to the prior insured project. 
    But when you start analyzing the Act, where it states this Act and that Act, you will find that Congress has itself stated that this Act shall not apply to those projects that was insured prior to a State. 
    In the 1954 Act that even goes farther than that. 
    It says that shall not apply to projects upon which a mere commitment had been issued prior to the effective date of the Act. 
    And I will say, if the Court pleases, if you will refer to the decisions in the two lower courts, you will find that they didn't come out and just say the Act was unconstitutional, they simply state that we simply hold that the terms of the 1954 Act cannot retroactively be applied to the Darlington apartments, implying that the Act -- the terms of the Act did not apply to those projects prior thereto. 
    Now, I have at some length in the briefs here taken section by section of the 1954 Act and shown where the Act does not apply to projects insured prior to the date thereof. 
    You will find that in my brief, it's set forth starting at page 63. 
    We take section by section and show that the wording of the Act does not apply to projects insured prior to the dates thereof. 
    It has been however the contention of the Government throughout that the 1954 Act was constitutional and it could be retroactively applied to the prior situation. 
    It would be rather hard for me to take and go over this for the Court section by section, but I call your attention to this. 
    The enacting clause of the Housing Act states that this Act will be merely cited as the Housing Act of 1954. 
    Now, they distinguish it as I say, as separate act. 
    The second paragraph state, "It had been the intent of Congress since the enactment of National Housing Act that housing built with aid to mortgage and insured under that Act, be used possibly for residential use and that such intent excludes the use of such housing for transient or hotel purposes." 
    There was little interest in side like there that we mentioned in our brief but -- which Senator Capehart, who introduced this Act, that said it always would be the intent -- has always been the intent of Congress that it would be used for residential purposes. 
    When asked about this Act before the Committee Hearing, they -- he said, "I can't tell you Senators what was the intention back there, and I wasn't him." 
    So I respectfully submit that any approach of one Congress to declare what was the intent of another Congress literally goes into the use of (Inaudible) Board in my way of thinking, I don't see how they could tell what was the intent of another Congress. 
    Certainly, the gentleman who presented this Act admitted that he couldn't tell what was the intent of the prior struggle. 
    Now, and the third paragraph states --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2278.240" stopTime="2289.264">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It does -- it does shed some light on an earlier act, if Congress in the later act thinks it has to do something which would be needless if it hadn't been accomplished by the earlier act. 
    It shed --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2289.264" stopTime="2292.958">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That has nothing do with technical law, but it has to do with good commonsense.
speaker="j_c_long" startTime="2292.958" stopTime="2508.928">
    Mr. J. C. Long 
    It certainly does, Your Honor, and this Court has held that and specially in the Sioux Indian Tribe case, in an opinion of this Court. 
    They went back and said that what one of the committees I think on -- forget the committee, had stated that it had never been intended to give the Indians a grant and that all they had was a easement to use the land and this Court views what that committee said then and they reached a decision as to whether a grant had been given to the Indians or not, that's under Sioux Indian case here that's cited in the brief. 
    Now, the third paragraph states that no multifamily housing with respect to which a mortgage insure under this Act. 
    I take that to mean the 1954 Act, on page 68, shall be operated for transient or hotel purposes. 
    The two stated exceptions however where projects operated for transient or hotel purposes maybe insured under the 1954 Act, where the Commission had agreed to such operations prior to May 28th, that was the date of the Committee Report to Congress, and where the project is located in an area which the Commission determines to be a resort area. 
    To us, that is an unusual part of this Act, because in the discussion and on the Senate floor, Senator (Inaudible) who was taking care of the State of Florida said to Senator Capehart, said, "Does that exclude the whole State of Florida?" 
    There was no misunderstanding about this. 
    Senator Capehart said, "It excludes the whole State of Florida and the statistics we have from the Federal Housing Administration is that there's 10,400 apartments in the State of Florida." 
    That is excluded under this Act, had they been renting apartments prior to the effective date thereof. 
    Now, we go to this, we submit the term of this Act as used in paragraph B specifically refers to the 1954 Act. 
    Then if you go down to paragraph C, it says that no mortgage with respect to multifamily housing shall be insured under this Act. 
    The Housing Act of 1954 are insured for an additional term unless the mortgagor agree he will not rent any part of the project for hotel or transient purposes. 
    There is the significant thing. 
    They said that, "We won't increase it unless you agree that you won't do what you've been doing, but if you are willing for the same amount, you can keep on doing what you've been doing." 
    You read this throughout that it would take all of my argument if I attempted to digress the -- I mean analyze the Act, you will find that the wording of the Act itself does not apply to projects insured before it. 
    The first three-judge court, this case got before, held that. 
    The situation was this, we appeared before Judge Hoffman. 
    Judge Hoffman thought there was a constitutional question involved. 
    He asked for a three-judge court, our late and beloved judge Parker called the court. 
    And then when the matter -- he called for brief and when we set it in the brief by a per curiam decision by Judge Parker, Judge Timmerman and Judge Hoffman, they sent it back to the Judge Hoffman and said, "We don't need a three-judge court here, this is a matter of simple statutory construction, does not involve the constitutionality of the Act." 
    So then we went back and we had our day before Judge Hoffman and the matter was referred to this Court, and this Court thought there was a constitutional question and sent it back and we had our day before the three-judge court, and the three-judge court adopted the decision of Judge Hoffman and here we are now. 
    And before --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Long -- Mr. Long, if we -- if we decide in your favor, does this mean that every apartment house that was built under this program prior to the 1954 Act can now lease any or all of its apartments on a transient basis?
speaker="j_c_long" startTime="2530.663" stopTime="2764.977">
    Mr. J. C. Long 
    I would not think so for two reasons. 
    One, I would not think so because I feel that the corporate charter in this case is in a grave deal like a lease or a restrictive covenants on the land. 
    And it is true that the -- the rules and regulations of the Federal Housing Administration which was not incorporated in the charter itself, but as a matter of law, becomes a part of the charter. 
    It said that it shall be designed, not used, principally for residential use. 
    Second, it said that our corporation shall engage in the operation of a rental housing project, it's our contention. 
    And third, that preference must be given to veterans in the occupancy of the building. 
    It's our position that the courts below was correct when it simply held that we had a right to rent a reasonable number of apartments in the building and have them available for transient use if there was no demand otherwise, if there was no demand otherwise. 
    To me, this case involves, and we get away from the 1954 Act not applying to it, it involves this. 
    Congress when it passed Section 608 of the Act and has set forth in the appellant's brief, and it's very brief law, and I tell you why it's a brief law. 
    Congress was faced with a dilemma. 
    They needed housing, and the -- the boys were returning home, the -- the young fellows that had went out to war, come back as young men and they needed -- my friend here stated not hundreds or thousands of houses, but millions of houses. 
    Congress unlike in any other provision of the Housing Act, turned over to the Commissioner, said, "You go out and get these houses built, you use your emergency power and get these houses built." 
    We placed no restriction on them at all, Congress placed no restriction on them at all. 
    And in not placing any restriction on -- on them at all, Congress had to eliminate a prior provision of an Act which this Act amended that had required them to be designed for principles laid for residential use. 
    Now, having eliminated that, they said to the Commissioner, "You go out and get it." 
    And here is what the Act said, the mortgage on property shall be held by a mortgagor, approved by the Commission. 
    The Commissioner may, leaving it to his discretion, and his discretion requires such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales. 
    Charges, capital structure, rate of return, methods of operations, rate or returns or methods of operations. 
    In that regard, I would like to say to the Court that he could have -- the Commissioner could have restricted the use of these apartments in any way he seen fit, Congress give him that right. 
    Congress further said, "If you are going to use that right, Mr. Commissioner, this is a manner in which you must use that right." 
    The Commissioner may make such contract with and acquire but not exceeding $100 stock, or interest of any such mortgagor, as the Commissioner may deem necessary to render effective such restrictions and regulations. 
    Now, he did do that. 
    He said to -- to the Darlington and my friend said to 7000 others, in a charter that they prepared as my friend admits, their wordings, their charter considered perhaps 7000 times. 
    They said, "We are going to put this provisions in the charter. 
    First we are going to say the purpose for which your -- your corporation shall organize," and I'm reading from the charter itself.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Where is the charter?
speaker="j_c_long" startTime="2765.712" stopTime="2948.693">
    Mr. J. C. Long 
    On page 184 of the transcript of record. 
    Here is the purpose as is stated. 
    The purpose for which the corporation is formed and the business objects to be carried on and promoted by it are as follows. 
    To create a private corporation to provide housing for rent or sale and to acquire any real estate or interest of right therein or pertinence thereto, in any and all personal property in connection therewith. 
    To improve and operate, to sella and assign mortgagors. 
    To borrow money, and issue evidence of indebtedness in further of and all of the objects of his business, to secure the same for mortgage, deed of trust, pledge or lien. 
    Now, this is the two provisions I call your particular attention to is D and E, because I say this is our lease, this is the written contract that controls our methods of operation. 
    To apply for and obtained to be caused to be obtained from the Federal Housing Administration a contract, a contract to mortgage insurance. 
    Pursuant to the provisions of the National Housing Act as amended, covering bonds, notes, other evidence of indebtedness issued by this corporation and any indent to a mortgage or deed of trust securing the same. 
    So long as any property of this corporation is encumbered by a mortgage or deed of trust, insured by the Federal Housing Commission, it shall engage in no business other than the construction and the operation of rental housing projects of such. 
    Now E, to enter into, perform and carry out contracts of any kind necessary to or in connection with the incidental accomplishment or any one or more purposes of this corporation. 
    Then if you go further into this charter, you will find that the Commissioner gave consideration to the term of rentals, stated first, "You shall not rent any apartment for more than three years, nor can you rent all of the apartments in the building." 
    But the Commissioner did not put any limitation expressly or impliedly anyway whatsoever on renting apartments for less than 30 days and there was good reasons why, because Senator Alben Barkley when he introduced this legislation, he stated in the Senate. 
    He says, "An emergency is upon us, the emergency begets the need. 
    This Act, we will not introduce it as a part of the permit of Housing Act, but deals with permit or housing, we need temporary housing to serve the temporary needs of the veterans, many of them in schools," Senator Barkley said." 
    Many of them is out seeking jobs, many of them don't know where the home would be, they need temporary housing now and I instruct the Federal Housing Commissioner to go out and use its emergency power to produce those houses." 
    I submit that a project owner had one of these apartments, had a vacant apartment and a veteran who gets priority under the Act, knocked on his door and said, "I want to rent this apartment for two nights," how could the project owner under the law say to the veteran, "I won't let you have it for two nights, I am limiting this for 30- day rental."

    Well now, does that phrase cover that kind of occupancy?

    Mr. J. C. Long 
    The part that we state in reference to that, that particular phrase does not, rental housing implies something more than renting by overnight occupancy. 
    But by the same token, if the Court pleases, in subdivision (e), it says, "To enter into, perform and carry out contracts of any kind necessary to or in connection with or incidental to the accomplishment of any one or more in the preference of the corporation. 
    I think it would be practical enough when an apartment building the size of The Darlington, the 156 apartments. 
    From time to time, the people who lived in that apartment may have a relative come to visit them, there is not room for them.Would the apartment owner be prohibited from renting that, a relative of the regular owner for two or three days, that's an incidental use. 
    And in this case, if the Court please, the rental -- the transient is an incidental use. 
    It's undisputed, conceded, they sent the order to Charleston that no time in the history of this project has much as 10% of the apartments been rented for transient purpose.

    Did I understand you to say earlier that they could set apart, set apart not for the kind a mother-in-law visiting a young couple, but set apart a fraction, a reasonable fraction of the total available apartment for transient.

    Mr. J. C. Long 
    I don't -- we don't content that could set apart, no sir. 
    We contend that those apartments available then, and if those entitled to priority comes in and wants one, they are entitled to it, but we contend that as an incidental purpose of the operation of this corporation, that they shall have a right from time to time when there is no demand otherwise, to rent available vacant units for less than 30 days when they don't go out and advertise as a hotel. 
    They don't give any bellboy service, there is no room service attendant to it at all. 
    The only way the record shows that any man gets a room in this building for less than 30 days is to come there and ask for it.

    I can understand if this were the letting overnight or for two nights of a transient couple or a transient person, one apartment or two. 
    For myself, I would dismiss that as de minimis. 
    That's really not to be taken into account. 
    But this was a practice, wasn't it? 
    This was a systematic letting of available apartments to transients of the part of the carrying on of the business.So, am I wrong about that?

    Mr. J. C. Long 
    I -- as a matter of fact, the record would not show that but I think it is in so many words, but I think the record discloses this, that here sits a man with his apartment building. 
    It must be remembered that this record shows that at all times when he was renting for less than 30 days, there was other apartments available for rent for more than 30 days, there was always vacant apartment, the record shows in this. 
    The situation is, that a man has entered into a mortgage, the Government has insured. 
    He's got to pay that mortgage, and it comes, vacancies in his building. 
    He sits there and someone wants to rent a vacant apartment for a night, a week for which there is no demand, he does the intelligent thing, he rents the apartment and we respectfully submit that that apartment maybe rented overnight tonight. 
    Tomorrow it maybe rented for six months or a year, there is no given apartment set aside for a transient guest and there's no (Voice Overlap) --

    No, Your Honor. 
    Under FHA regulations, you are allowed to rent apartments and I'm glad Your Honor called that point to my attention because I wanted to correct something. 
    Under FHA regulations, you are allowed to rent apartments but you cannot charge the tenant over one forty-eighth of the cost of the furniture per month. 
    In other words, the -- they was trying to protect the veterans. 
    And now, you can rent this furnished apartment but you can't charge them over one forty-eighth of the cost to the apartment per month. 
    In this record, it shows that many of these -- many furnished apartments, maybe ten times as many was ever used for transient purpose was rented on a monthly basis upon which the tenant only paid $14 a month for the rent, for the furniture that went in that apartment. 
    Now, there were some mentions made about a corporation other than the Darlington, buying that furniture. 
    Under this charter, the Darlington cannot go out and mortgage any property and it was a question of those that was interested in the apartment putting the furniture in there which the FHA allowed, and so much until now, they have passed in such a case, they passed a regulation that you can put furniture in the apartment, you don't have to -- and it's in the record what I say. 
    And you don't have to charge one forty-eighth, you can charge what you please but you must sign that you won't rent it for less than 30 days. 
    In other words, if you don't rent it for less than 30 days, now you charge what you please for as many apartments as you want, that's in this record in this case.

    How?

    Mr. J. C. Long 
    Because the Government said the building would cost so much money, and I'd say the Government said the building costs that because under FHA regulation, they set the contract price. 
    My client went out and built this building and the cost to the building ran $300,000 more than what the cost was supposed to be. 
    The FHA insured only 90% of what they estimated would be the cost, what they estimate would be the cost.

    Mr. J. C. Long 
    Well, this Your Honor, was a suit where my client brought against the Government because they said this. 
    This case started when they wrote down to my client and said, "You can't rent for less than 30 days." 
    My client wrote back and said, "Listen, we'd like to find out why we can't rent for less than 30 days, we don't see any charter provision prohibiting it, we want to cooperate but what stops us from renting for less than 30 days?" 
    And the Deputy Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration, he wrote back and said, "Have you heard of a new law, the 1954 law?" 
    Says, "That stops you from renting for less than 30 days." 
    We at Charleston not too big a place and it is a nice thing to have someone bring a suit against you to say you're violating something.

    235. 
    There are the four which the Darlington used in connection with their transient rentals which has on it, "Have you left your key, and rent, security deposits, telephone, furniture rental." 
    And I suggest that this at least is one indication that this was not a merely ad hoc occasional relationship.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4184.671" stopTime="4189.544">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that doesn't -- that doesn't tell us -- that doesn't give you the quantitative light.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4189.544" stopTime="4220.403">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No, but if the Court pleases, these people, right from the very outset started to rent -- furnish apartments and rent furnished apartments. 
    They didn't wait to -- and to see whether on a furnished basis, they could attract veterans. 
    They went right into the furnishing business, they charged, I think the record indicates, $15 to $20 per month more. 
    So instead of this being $77.50 apartments, they were $92 or $97 apartments.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    The practice (Inaudible).
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4228.042" stopTime="4229.209">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible) I think it is still going on.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4229.209" stopTime="4249.886">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    This building was built in -- finished in July of 1951. 
    They started to furnish in October 1951, they started to rent to transients in February 1 and the FHA didn't know it because when they filed their occupancy report, they disclosed the fact that they were even renting to -- even renting furnished apartments. 
    Now, insofar as --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4249.886" stopTime="4265.126">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I thought the record showed that the Darlington people had gone to the FHA, had disclosed they were renting the -- wanted to rent these things on a -- on a basis, and asked for their approval of a rent schedule.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4265.126" stopTime="4266.425">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Absolutely not.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4266.425" stopTime="4266.948">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Isn't -- am I wrong about that?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4266.948" stopTime="4316.730">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No, the record in -- the record does not indicate that, what the record indicates is that the FHA sometime around to December of 1952 discovers they are renting furnished. 
    They didn't -- FHA didn't know transient, but they knew that they had furniture in some of these apartments. 
    So the FHA then says to the Darlington, "You can't do this unless, one, that you get a furniture rental schedule approved, and second, you agree not to rent to transients. 
    Now, the record doesn't express -- the -- the printed record at any rate does not expressly indicate when the practice of renting to transients was discovered by the FHA, but it's at least an implication from this later correspondence, it wasn't until very late in the game, but they never came and asked for permission. 
    They were doing this and they were concealing the fact and --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4316.730" stopTime="4350.684">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But is there nothing in the record which fairs on the determination of this fact? 
    That was my question to you in the light of what this -- the Long said, namely that rentals to transients was not a device to make extra money, although they could have rented for -- beyond 30 months, but that was a necessity as a matter of experience. 
    Some of these apartments would have stood empty and this was a way of utilizing the excess available apartment.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4350.684" stopTime="4350.987">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    The Court --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4350.987" stopTime="4352.213">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's what Mr. Long said if I understood it.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4352.213" stopTime="4368.501">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    If the Court -- if the Court pleases, we -- we don't think that the record indicates one way or the other on that. 
    We would suggest this that before experience could tell them anything in this instance, right -- beginning with February, they -- they furnished 60 of their units. 
    Secondly, we would submit that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4368.501" stopTime="4376.345">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, how do you know that -- how long -- when -- how soon after apartments were available, did they rent it to the -- the transients?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4376.345" stopTime="4381.250">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    They rented to transients. 
    Well, it was the period from the very end of July to the following February. 
    Now, on that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4381.250" stopTime="4382.039">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    July to February.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4382.039" stopTime="4382.640">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4382.640" stopTime="4390.636">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But on the other side, I know little about these things, but very often before an apartment house is under way, inquiries are made about future rentals.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4390.636" stopTime="4440.015">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    That's -- that's -- that may well be true. 
    But of course in the interim here, they had taken out 60 apartments without the FHA's knowledge from the -- from the range of unfurnished apartments. 
    Secondly, and this is we think is the very important point. 
    And this again, and you view it in terms of the purpose for which this -- this program was established. 
    These people hit upon the device of furnished apartments and then transients is the way out of their difficulty. 
    They made no endeavor here to try to and reduce their rents. 
    The record indicates they were in a poor location. 
    This isn't the FHA's fault, it was their fault, they insisted upon it. 
    Before it -- but first, this is being a error of judgment on their part, instead of trying to encourage veterans to come in. 
    That's the purpose of the program.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4442.874" stopTime="4451.842">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let me ask you a question, Mr. Rosenthal. 
    So far as I am concerned, if this was an isolated case, this just as Darlington Company --
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4451.842" stopTime="4452.136">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    I have some information on that.

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Oh, excuse me.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4455.643" stopTime="4499.779">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I wouldn't think this was -- the case was fit to be here. 
    And therefore, the only problem as far as I am concerned is the construction of a statute or the implied powers of the FHA. 
    What I want to know is this. 
    Does the FHA, insofar as you are able to speak for it and you ought to be able to speak for it, contend that if as a matter of honest business judgment, an apartment house is practically not rentable and that there is some excess apartment that the owners or the mortgagor may rent that excess, shown by past business experience or allowable judgment, to transients.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4499.779" stopTime="4499.935">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    I think --

    As a matter of policy.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4501.188" stopTime="4524.202">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No, the FHA's position today is that even in the so-called hardship cases to which Your Honor has alluded, the congressional prohibition operates that they may not do it. 
    This that -- and there was one time they took a -- this is right through before 1954, they thought that in the --

    Our -- the effect of this would be simply, that in the future, they would be prohibited from renting these units to transients. 
    They could furnish them, they can rent them on a furnished basis, but not for periods of time less than 30 days.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What have you got to say as to this comment of Judge Hoffman in his opinion? 
    The unusual situation created by reason of the FHA's insistence to cease the practice of renting apartments for periods of less than 30 days will admittedly necessitate, will admittedly necessitate the financial downfall of the Darlington with the result in the loss of an initial investment together with the monthly payments of $6000 each beginning January or June 1. 
    It certainly would not justify the continued existence of Darlington, and bankruptcy would be the ultimate answer, the foreclosure of the mortgage would follow with the Commissioner of the FHA requiring title, as it is a bear assumption, no purchase or sale or there's an amount equal to or in excess of the unpaid balance due on the mortgage.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4806.437" stopTime="4813.942">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    I don't -- my recollection is that the Government certainly made no admission. 
    It -- I think --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4813.942" stopTime="4817.378">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    That finding was adopted by the three-judge court afterwards, wasn't it?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4817.378" stopTime="4895.331">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    It what is -- that was true on this record or at least appears to be true, is that if the Darlington continues its operation in the manner in which it has been continuing it, leaving off simply the practice of renting the transients that they will be in financial difficulties. 
    Again, I come back to the -- the point that there's no indication in this record that I can see, that on a lower rental basis or by adopting certain other practices which are within the scope of the -- the statute and the regulations, the Darlington could not make a goal. 
    But again we would emphasize that if -- even if that so, we say that -- that that isn't a critical consideration here, because these people, I misspoke myself for this purpose, and we think that whether they are -- were unable to make a financial success of the -- the project for the purpose for which it was established. 
    We think that that's regrettable, but we don't think it is warrant for going into some other completely different line of endeavor and competing with hotels in this case and other transient accommodations which didn't have this type of alien construction, and which Congress clearly, by the 1946 Act, was not intending to setup competition for.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4895.331" stopTime="4926.903">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, in that connect, Mr. Rosenthal, what -- what do you have to say to the -- the point Mr. Long raised about this second exception in the 1954 Act where the project is located in an area which the Commissioner determines to be a resort area plus the response of the sponsor of the -- the bill that that would include the entire State of Florida with about 11,000 projects of it.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="4926.903" stopTime="4970.836">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    The answer is here that -- to that is this, that the Congress as determined by the 1954 Act that it wasn't incumbent upon the FHA, they have been doing before to determine what was hardship cases and what weren't. 
    The FHA was given no discretion in that regard. 
    What the Congress decided was that they were going to carve out an exception for the State of Florida, where as a overall basis, it's very difficult during seasons of those years for -- to -- to rent, except on a -- on a transient basis. 
    Now, that determination, we submit, is hard, works an unconstitutional discrimination against the appellee and we don't think actually the appellee is affected by it and has an -- works then as a challenge.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4970.836" stopTime="5008.821">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, but my point is this, when you -- you use this, 1954 Act to establish legislative intent to apply this original act, only to long-term tenancies. 
    Now, how does this establish any such thing if they eliminate an entire State that has 1100 projects in it. 
    How does that establish the fact ten years before they intended for the entire nation to be under it?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="5008.821" stopTime="5022.296">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Well, of course this intent continued all along, as is seen by the -- the express -- expressed statement of intent in the 1954 Act, which has this -- this provision for resort areas.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5022.296" stopTime="5024.773">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And was there any such thing in the prior Act?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="5024.773" stopTime="5066.477">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No, no, no. 
    There could be -- the prior Act did not have any provision for resort areas. 
    The prior Act wasn't dealing with the -- the transient rental problem directly because the prior Act again was in terms of providing residential housing for veterans. 
    The Congress then when it was called to their attention that there were these activities beyond the scope of the program as intended, got into the matter of transient rentals, and 513 of course has these particular provisions. 
    But 513 itself, well it has the -- the resort area exception, again contained the expressed declaration of the congressional intent on the inception of the Housing Act right up to the -- the present time.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5066.477" stopTime="5072.900">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="5072.900" stopTime="5094.156">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Resort areas were exempted, Your Honor, because it was -- they were deemed by Congress to present a special and sui generis situation. 
    In the resort areas, people in those areas do not -- or -- or very small numbers actually established long-term residence. 
    In that case, it (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5094.156" stopTime="5099.416">

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    I don't know -- I don't -- I don't know where the projects were -- were established in Florida. 
    But Congress in its wisdom chose to -- to setup this -- this resort area exception, but that -- at the same time that they again came down with the reaffirmation of a -- of the legislative intent, we don't think of course --

speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="5138.401" stopTime="5164.269">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Well, if they -- as they viewed it, the Committee Reports viewed it, this was merely a restatement of an intent which they thought had -- was clear enough from the -- the 1946 Act itself when it's preamble. 
    They weren't thinking of the 1954 Act, Section 513 in terms of a change in the existing law.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5164.269" stopTime="5169.307">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No, no, no.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5173.320" stopTime="5193.242">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you said that this doesn't make a change, in -- in answer to the Chief Justice's question that if this was the purpose of the Housing Act, why should the Housing Act go in for supporting resort -- resort communities instead of communities by which -- which reference common law's housing.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="5193.242" stopTime="5216.594">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    The initial -- no it made a change in the existing law to that extent, but they didn't view the prohibition, the general prohibition of transient rentals as constituting a departure from existing law. 
    And we think that the -- the Committee Reports on that indicate that quite clearly, thus, I indicated earlier, the House Committee for its part, it didn't think that there was any --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5216.594" stopTime="5219.394">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did it or didn't it make a change as to resorts?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="5219.394" stopTime="5243.773">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    It made a change as to resort. 
    And what Congress was doing in effect was saying that we are going to take over the job which the FHA had been in our -- in the Congress' view was proper in exercising before, under take before. 
    That of determining what are the -- the hardship cases. 
    And I said the FHA does not have discretion under the methods of operation, we're going to carve out the two exceptions.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5243.773" stopTime="5264.313">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But my question is, why should an inapplicable situation with reference to the purpose of the Housing Act to which resorts, the taking out of the statute or had been in the statute to begin with.Congress wasn't concerned with fly-by-night Florida visitors, was it?

    No. 
    Congress -- Congress --

    And yet it took them out. 
    And since before that, and you said that, that implied that it was always in there as to every other place.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="5273.055" stopTime="5303.579">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No, I don't say that they -- because they took it out from -- took -- included a expressed exception for Florida; as that -- in those that -- it was in as to everybody else before. 
    I would -- all that I said was that Congress, when they were viewing the problem in 1954, they deemed Section 513 as making no change in its broad scope of an existing law. 
    They then decided in their wisdom and this is we submit is an appropriate subject of legislative resolution whether we might agree with it or not, then decided to --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5303.579" stopTime="5307.878">

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    But they then decided to carve out the -- the Florida exception and we think there's no question from the enforcement provisions of this Act as well as from subsection (b), that contrary what Mr. Long has suggested, the Act in terms applies to existing projects as well as projects built subsequent to 1954. 
    Of course, Section 608 itself, there have been no mortgages insured under that section since 1950, the program expired, even though they still are permanent mortgage programs.
