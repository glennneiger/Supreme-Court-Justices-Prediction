    Mr. William B. Mahoney 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    As I stated, Your Honor, the Boubaris case had reached the Circuit Court during the pendency of the appeal in this particular matter. 
    And in that particular case, Judges Lumbard and Waterman reversed the lower court that had held and held at that particular time that the provision in Section 1440a relative to lawful entry and the physical presence in the United States for a period of a year before induction into the armed services must be consecutive. 
    In other words, no breach could occur within the lawful entry and the physical presence of a year in the United States.

    -- dissenting.
speaker="william_b_mahoney" startTime="59.152" stopTime="466.424">
    Mr. William B. Mahoney 
    And Judge Hincks dissented. 
    And then when, as I said, that case was decided while this one was coming up on appeal and when it came up on appeal, again Justices Lumbard and Waterman sat, but Justice Moore sat in place of Justice Hincks on the Tak Shan Fong case. 
    And this, of course, Judge Murphy was unanimously reversed on the opinion or rather the decision in U.S. against Boubaris. 
    Now, in order to come to some analyzation of this particular statute, it would seem to me as though with the Government conceding practically everything in the case, namely, that Fong was physically present in the United States for a period of year prior to his induction into the service of the United States, that he served in the United States Army for a period of two years, that he was honorably discharged, and that he had made a lawful entry into the United States in August of 1951. 
    We come right down to the one question that the Government seems to base everything on and that is that the lawful entry and the physical presence was not continuous. 
    That's the only claim that they seem to make. 
    And may I say to the Court here that the statute doesn't say that the lawful entry and the physical presence for a year must be consecutive. 
    It -- it would seem to me as though that circuit court just wrote that particular provision into Section 1440a. 
    Now, resort to the -- the legislative history of this particular situation reveals this that when it was before the House Committee, Congressman Graham on the Committee on the Judiciary was asked as to who was excluded under the bill. 
    And his statement was, and this is taken from the first session of the House of Representatives for the 83rd Congress, subversives are excluded, a conscientious objector who performs no military duties or refuses to wear the uniform are excluded or a person discharged from service under oath other than honorable conditions are excluded or pursuant to an application for discharge made by him on the ground that he is an alien. 
    Now, that seemed to be the thinking of the members of the house as to who were excluded under this particular bill, although there was phraseology that its application was limited to those who were lawfully entered into the United States without designating any time element whatsoever. 
    However, when this bill was pending before the House, the Attorney General Rogers sent a letter to the House in which he tried to have incorporated the provisions of Section 1429 of 8 United States Code into the bill itself. 
    And it's under 1429, you'll recall, that the burden rests upon the applicant to show at the time that he applies for naturalization that he was lawfully admitted to the United States. 
    And the letters, just a short part of it, was to the effect since the bill would require the lawful admission of a person as a prerequisite to eligibility thereunder. 
    There would appear to be no reason why such a person should not be required to bear the burden of proving such lawful admission to the same extent as is required of petitioners for naturalization generally. 
    Now, that was definitely ignored by the House. 
    And in addition to it, it was definitely ignored by the Senate who had the same letter before it and that provision or anything bearing any comparability to it was enacted into the statute itself. 
    And it would seem that in view of the fact that he -- the Attorney General tried to continue the burden upon an applicant to show that his lawful entry or rather that his entry into the United States was lawful. 
    And when you find the House reacting to the suggestion of an Attorney General in this particular nature while lawful admission as an immigrant or a non-immigrant is held to be a prerequisite to naturalization, the Committee is of the opinion that the technicalities involved in connection with the continuance of such status at the time of entering the Armed Forces would place an unwarranted burden on servicemen and practically nullify the purpose of the legislation. 
    And as to the Senate itself, they merely stated that the proposal that the serviceman be required to have a lawful status at the time of entering the Armed Forces was not included in the bill, so much for whatever assistance that we might get from the legislative history behind this particular bill. 
    But I could point out to the Court at this particular time that if Congress were of the mind that the Government attempts at the present time to state what the thought of Congress was at the time, it would seem to me as though they could have legislated as they did relative to Section 392 (b) of the same Title 8 of the United States Code. 
    And you'll recall, this is found on page 9 of the petitioner's brief, that under those circumstances where they were endeavoring to confer citizenship on alien veterans relative to World War I, the Court will find that an alien in this particular Section 392 (b), an alien veteran is entitled at any time to naturalization upon the same terms and conditions except one that such alien shall be required to prove that immediately preceding the date of his petition, he has resided continuously within United States for at least two years in pursuance of a legal admission for permanent residence. 
    Now, I would point out to the Court that the word "immediately" in there is significant and "legal admission" is significant and if Congress were of the trend of thinking that the Government attempts to suggest at the present time, it would seem to me as though they could have readily enacted some specific provision in here showing that such was their intention, namely, that lawful entry and physical presence for a year had to be consecutive.

    I certainly do, Your Honor, because you can appreciate that there are a number of individuals who are in the United States and have been lawfully admitted but not for permanent residence. 
    They put those people of permanent residence in one category. 
    And I think in this order that they had mind that any of those individuals who were in the United States and had been in lawfully at any time as long as they did what was necessary to be done under Section 1440a, namely, that they lent their services whether it was mental, moral, physical to the Armed Forces of the United States during the Korean conflict.We held this out to those people that there would be a reward attached to the services that they render.

    I can't see that under the circumstances that are contained in this statute and I am not just limiting it to the phraseology that you've pointed out to me but to the statute in toto that I can't see under those circumstances where there would be any difference, as long as he came into the country legally at some time prior to the physical presence in the United States for a period of a year and that he had served beyond 90 days which is the minimum requirement of the statute and that he was honorable discharged. 
    I just don't go for and I can't conceive that a court would accept a solution of a situation of this kind where we hold out these rewards or anticipated rewards to aliens with some subtle variations to them that spring up after we've taken from the individual that which they were capable of giving under the Selective Service Act. 
    That just doesn't seem to savvy with the policy of the United States.And that's why I say that the time element would make no difference in this particular matter.

    Mr. William B. Mahoney 
    Not one bit. 
    Now, in addition to what I've just stated to the Court here, relative to the legislative history, I would merely call to the Court's attention that in cases of this kind where there is an ambiguity and certainty, there is an ambiguity in Section 1440a, and I think quite a substantial one, it would seem to me that the trend of thinking of this particular Court has been to resolve that ambiguity in favor of lenity. 
    And the Court will recall that in Bell against the United States that that was a principle who has stated and also it was recently reiterated in the matter of Bonetti against Rogers in this particular Court. 
    But another factor that I think should be taken into consideration in this particular matter is this factor. 
    You will recall what I said that in September 1953, the exclusion section of the Immigration Department knew of the fact that this man was in the military service of the United States. 
    In January of 1954 with the order of deportation when they suspended the delivery bond, they knew that he was in the Armed Forces of the United States. 
    They continued to allow him to serve for 19 months after the verification of September 1953, they allowed him to serve 16 months after the deportation order was served and then they allowed him to continue in the United States from May of 1955 until December of 1955 when he filed his petition under Section 1448 of Title 8 of the United States Code. 
    In the -- in the interim they just allowed everything to abate.

    May I suggest to you that if none of these facts are true, that we -- we may have cases where not one of those facts that you've just recited happened or took place, and yet, the problem would be exactly the same. 
    You -- you -- these facts indicate hardship and -- are appealing. 
    But they seem to me just as irrelevant as the -- to the issue as Mr. Justice Whittaker's hard case put to you of a child coming here -- firstly, coming here as a child and then leaving and then smuggling himself in and then serving, isn't that true? 
    You said quite correctly. 
    From my point of view, it makes no difference from yours.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, but Justice Whittaker's case also points up the -- the [Laughs] non-appeal in the other case.
speaker="william_b_mahoney" startTime="872.801" stopTime="964.437">
    Mr. William B. Mahoney 
    That's very true, I merely like to say this, Your Honors, and just cite this last factor to you, and this is on the proposition that when an ambiguity is existent under those circumstances that ambiguity is always resolved in favor of lenity. 
    We had a similar -- somewhat of a similar situation in Fong Haw Tan against Phelan in 333 U.S. 6. 
    And in that particular situation with an opinion by Justice Douglas, he said that we resolve the doubts in favor of that construction because deportation is a drastic measure and at times, the equivalent of banishment or exile. 
    It is the forfeiture for misconduct of a residence in this country, that was somewhat dissimilar from our factual background but such forfeiture is a penalty. 
    And I say that what was read into this particular Boubaris case in the first instance and carried over into Tak Shan Fong was strictly an infliction of a penalty upon Tak Shan Fong in writing into Section 1440 (a), the fact that lawful entry and physical presence in the United States must be immediately consecutive. 
    And I ask the Court, for those reasons, to reverse the circuit court and reinstate judge Murphy's order.

    I think we'd have a much more difficult case under this statute, then there would have been a legal entry and a physical presence in the term of the statute which would have been connected.

    No, that -- that would be an entry into the United States under the statute. 
    There isn't really, I think, any dispute between Mr. Mahoney and myself, any dispute which has any legal significance as to the terms of his landing at Newport News. 
    Mr. Mahoney claims that the alien had permission from an official, and this is based on his testimony in the immigration proceeding, he had permission from an officer on the ship to land, and that taking this as permission he came ashore and went to New York. 
    This would not make his entry legal. 
    He had no landing permit from the immigration people. 
    He had no other permit from the immigration people. 
    And if we accept what Mr. Mahoney says in full, his entry was still without -- outside of the law. 
    It may have to do with his -- based whether or not he was trying to stay here, but it had nothing to do with whether or not he legally came into the country.

    He has no right to leave the ship. 
    Now, this landing permit is given by the immigration authorities to bona fide seaman. 
    It's part of the part -- it is considered part of the policy of the immigration law that -- that these people should be permitted to get ashore and stretch their legs if they are bona fide seaman and if you believe that they are going to get back on the vessel and sail when it sails. 
    Actually, they imposed quite a penalty on the ship when they don't return to it, so they try to get the -- the owners of the ship to help enforce the law. 
    But if the man is a bona fide seaman and they have no reason to believe that he is going to do damage in the United States, this little -- the man at the dock will give the seaman this landing permit.

    Now, historically, Congress has, for a long time, given special privileges with respect to naturalization to aliens who have served in the -- in the Armed Forces. 
    And how much benefit they have given has differed from time to time. 
    During the civil war, they -- in -- I think in 1862, the first of these statutes was passed which cut down the period of required residence from five years to one year. 
    That was the only -- the benefit that was given. 
    They gave privileges for expediting naturalization in World War I and again in World War II. 
    And there are several reasons, and I think it's important to -- to understand these reasons for giving this right which is largely a right to expedite naturalization. 
    One of the reasons is that, and this is particularly applicable when -- when soldiers are going overseas, that if a -- American member of the Armed Forces is captured overseas, it's particularly important that that man be a citizen of the United States so that he will be entitled to all of the -- the rights and the protections of being a citizen, so -- so to speak, of the United States. 
    A second reason that they expedite naturalization is in order to make available to the Armed Forces in -- as officers as well as anything else, people who would otherwise be aliens. 
    You sometimes get a situation where you have, and we had it in World War II, where you have people who had military training and could be useful to the Government in -- in -- as officers, but in order to be an officer, one must be a citizen of the United States. 
    This is a second reason referred to by Congress for expediting naturalization. 
    And the third reason is, of course, to add another incentive to people being -- joining the Armed Force. 
    It's a -- it's an advantage which they get and it -- it aids in recruitment, it gives them a benefit for -- for service which they have performed for the United States. 
    And that is the -- that is the background which Congress considered this Act in 1953. 
    They had tried to pass an act in 1952 but there was a difference between the House and the Senate as to the terms of the Act. 
    The House had wanted to grant the -- the privilege of naturalization to those who had come in temporarily and had joined the Armed Forces, while the Senate, largely on the -- on the pressure from Senator McCarran felt that the man would have had to have been admitted for permanent residence before he should be given the privilege of the expeditious naturalization. 
    Because of this difference, the legislation failed in 1952. 
    This was a serious thing because at this time, the conflict in Korea was going on. 
    We had soldiers there. 
    And in 1953, it became apparent that it was necessary for the two houses to get together and they did pass this bill, which we have before us and which is set forth at page 2 of our brief. 
    And it does grant the right of expeditious naturalization not only to those who have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence but it also granted the right to those who had been lawfully admitted under any circumstances, provided they spent -- were physically present for one year at the time that they entered the Armed Forces. 
    This relaxed the existing immigration law which required one that there'd be admission for permanent residence and two that there'd be a five-year resident -- five-year residence. 
    In both of these respects, it was relaxed by this new law. 
    Now, we believe that a reasonable construction of this statute means that there must be a relationship, that there was intended to be a relationship between the lawful admission and the physical presence. 
    We base this on two -- on three -- on three factors, one, the natural reading of the -- of the statute and the structure of -- of the entire Naturalization Act and two, on the legislative history and three, on the decision of this Court in the Bonetti case. 
    If we look at the words of the statute alone, we find that there are stated in conjunction, the two conditions having been lawfully admitted to the United States and having been physically present within the United States for a single period of at least one year. 
    It seems to us that those two terms are reasonably read conjunctively. 
    And this is particularly so when it appears that Congress could have had no -- there is no apparent purpose in giving any recognition to a lawful admission for temporary -- temporary admission only which has been passed. 
    At no place in the present immigration law, not so far as I have been able to find in any of the past immigration laws, is any status given because of the fact that a person has been lawfully admitted for temporary period and then left. 
    I mean if he leaves, he gives up whatever privileges he has. 
    And I find no place anywhere in the law where Congress has said that this gives him any advantage and indeed, there is no reason why it should.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    I think that is right, although I think that the Armed -- that the Selective Service Act doesn't say a single period and it's possible that under the Selective -- this don't exactly match. 
    Under the Selective Service Act, it may be that it could be interrupted by a trip back home, whereas this is a single period.But that's -- the Senate -- the Senate which put this one year physical presence into the bill said they did this in order to have this Act working with the Selective Service Act. 
    And it seems to me that means that it should be year at the time of induction. 
    Otherwise, you don't get this interest which the alien has in here. 
    He is -- he is only a visitor. 
    He hasn't got -- there isn't any reason to call upon him, no relationship to the country which would lead you to call upon him to -- to go into the armed services.

    With respect Senator Lehman's position, which is set forth at page 16 of our brief, Senator Lehman was not urging that those who were here unlawfully should be given the privilege of expeditious naturalization. 
    He was trying to get the same treatment given in the Senate that was given in the House to give those who were not admitted for permanent residence. 
    The -- the law at that time required permanent residence. 
    The House was going to relax this to permit those who were admitted for temporary residences as well as permanent residence. 
    Senator McCarran wouldn't go along with it. 
    Senator Lehman wasn't talking about those who were here illegally, but he was talking about those who had been admitted only temporarily. 
    And so that, we don't find any -- any senator who was urging that those who were here illegally should be granted naturalization in either House. 
    There is no word of debate in either House that those were here illegally -- who have entered illegally should be granted this thing. 
    Then when the Department of Justice made its recommendation to both Houses, it was dealing with a bill which did not have the provision for one year's physical presence in it. 
    They were dealing with a separate -- with a different bill, and I believe that there, the judgment must be read in the light of that different bill since I think they have -- would -- would not have been made, wouldn't have the same connotation if they had had this one year's physical presence which we are now concerned with.

    So that his -- the -- the Attorney General's suggestions really have no reference. 
    As a matter of fact in his own suggestion he said this bill is supposed to grant naturalization to those who are legally in the United States. 
    That term is -- is included in this letter. 
    But he was dealing with a situation where there was no period for one year's physical presence. 
    And he said that the -- they didn't need to exempt these aliens from their requirement of proving a continuation of their legal -- of their legal entry. 
    Then the Senate changed the bill to put in a provision for physical presence for one year and that -- that makes the change which, I think, cuts -- cuts the ground out from any -- any reason for -- for putting in what the Attorney General had suggested.

    Was there any agreement or any -- any way that he could just notify that he wanted to get out in the Army?

    -- I believe that the Army took the men only through the Selective Service System and the way he would come in, would come in and register with the Selective Service. 
    I don't think that -- I think that the Army did not accept enlistments from aliens. 
    I may be wrong on that, but I think that's it.

    That -- there is at present. 
    It was -- this is a little complicated. 
    During World War II, there was a provision in order to take care of aliens who were serving abroad and that provision gave them a right to be naturalized and also naturalized in the field whether or not they came in legally at all. 
    This was specific in the statute. 
    It wasn't in -- I think enacted in 1944. 
    The 1942 Act wasn't -- they didn't feel -- gave enough protection. 
    In 1944, they amended it so that he could be naturalized from the field. 
    Now, present --

    No, he had to be in this country.

    No, I mean under this provision, there was no other provision.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    No, he -- they couldn't. 
    Although if they thereafter were legally admitted to the United States, then that service would give them -- would take the place of -- of residence here. 
    But in order to complete the -- that -- that question, I call Your Honors' attention to the present provision of 8 U.S.C. 1440 which provide for those who didn't actually get naturalized during World War I or World War II. 
    And for some reason, and I don't know why this is, in about 1948, Congress passed the provision saying that they too could be naturalized whether or not they entered legally. 
    So, presently, on our books, we have a provision for naturalization of aliens who came in, actually came in illegally. 
    This is -- this is specific by -- by the specific provision.

speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="2830.851" stopTime="2847.482">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    1440. 
    It's the section in -- in the U.S. Code which immediately precedes this one dealing with the Korean War. 
    This was not the term -- these were not the terms of the statutes during the war, these were something that was passed later on, and as I say, I think, in 1948.

    Now, as you will know, this -- a number of Americans went to Canada, in 1915 and 1916 and enlisted in Canadian Army (Inaudible) went to Canada from this country to enlist in Canadian units. 
    I don't what the legal machinery there was. 
    We have had nothing like that as you say.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    I believe -- I -- I checked with the Selective Service on this and I was told by the Selective Service that they -- the only way they took aliens into the Army --

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    -- and I didn't check on the Navy, but the only way they took it into the Army was through the Selective Service System itself. 
    Just one more word and that is I wanted to say that -- that this Court shouldn't get the impression that this particular petitioner was dragged into the Army against his will and made to serve in the Army. 
    He had an exemption from service, all he had to do is to claim his exemption as an alien and he could have been accepted immediately from service, and he didn't go in there with any -- under any contract implied or any otherwise that he could get citizenship. 
    This particular statute was not on the books at the time he was inducted into the service. 
    So, there is no -- he went in then. 
    There's no misconception. 
    There wasn't any law which gave him any right at the time he was inducted.

    He came from Tianjin originally.
