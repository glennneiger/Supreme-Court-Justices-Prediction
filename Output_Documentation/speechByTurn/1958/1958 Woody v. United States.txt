    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    On the issue beyond procedure which was in this case, as we see it, the question is whether the one who transports a stolen vehicle in interstate commerce in violation of what is now 2312 can ever be guilty of receiving and concealing, specifically, we rest on concealing, that same automobile which he had transported. 
    In other words, a violation of 2313, and it comes down to the question of whether the transporter is covered by the word "whoever" in 2313. 
    And on that, we think the answer must be yes in a proper case where acts of concealment are proved. 
    He can, the transporter can properly be found guilty of a violation of 2313 because 2313 punishes not only receives, conceals and stores but sells and disposes of an automobile. 
    And on its face and in the legislative history, it seems evident that whoever sells an automobile may very well be the transporter. 
    And by the same token, there is no reason we -- whoever concealed as not covering the transporter.

    Receives -- if "receive" is part of the transportation, then it was being to me that that would be so much a part of that transaction, that receipt alone, unless it were a discreet act in some fashion. 
    I suppose it is possible to imagine a situation where someone transport and then subsequently in some other transaction, receive that same automobile.

    Well, I am saying that not that particular set, the act of taking involves taking into possession. 
    But I -- I can imagine a situation where while it was still in interstate commerce, the transporter of the vehicle gave it to a confederate who concealed the change and now, they painted it and then he took it back. 
    Now, on petitioner's scenery that a transporter of a stolen motor vehicle can never be guilty of 2313 even on that set of facts, he wouldn't be guilty of receiving it.

    Can -- can you conceive of any set of circumstances wherein a person would knowingly transport a car in interstate commerce in violation of this section, and at the same time, not have the intention to conceal that theft from the authorities or from the true owner or from whomever you might choose?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    All right. 
    Now, may I ask you this, and if that is true, where are you going to start by saying that at a certain point, concealment becomes a crime separate from that of stealing the car and transporting it across state lines?
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="597.204" stopTime="608.885">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    I think when the acts of concealment are beyond the type of concealment that's involved merely in the taking of the car. 
    And --

    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    I think not.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="623.933" stopTime="629.875">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Or any concealment separate from -- from the transporting?
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="629.875" stopTime="719.135">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    Well, it becomes a question to be in effect. 
    I think that -- I think that -- let me say this, that if the act of concealment is simply throwing a car in a garage that is part of the transportation, that -- that -- to me, that isn't a question of multiple sentence, that's a question of what is meant by concealment as used in the statute. 
    That is -- I think, and I think there is a support in some of the older common law cases which -- that concealment means some active -- reducing to your own possession, beyond that. 
    And so I think that if you just -- just throwing in a public garage may well not be storage either under this, but that if you have a special hiding place and you store it in that special kind of a hiding place and certainly, when you perform the kinds of act of concealment which normally seem to be the basis of prosecution, which is changing the motor number that's on the motor and repainting the car as was done here or getting fictitious bills of sale, that type of concealment is involved in merely changing the character, but that's so separate and apart from the transportation.

    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg

    And I think there is -- there is room for interpretation. 
    And I think what's interesting, Your Honor, I don't know whether one can draw conclusions from this or not, but the cases on page 36 of our brief in which the Court have said, even if it's part of one transaction, all except two, I have done there, all except New York but that's a mistake, I am sorry, it's also Madsen up above in 165 F. 2d 507.

    And what's interesting, as I say, I don't know how much of a conclusion one can drew up on it, but what's interesting is that whenever you get the facts of these concealment cases as you do in Madsen and as you do in the cases that are cited on page -- on Footnote 9 as to the crime of concealment, Footnote 9 on page 30, whenever you actually have the facts, you find that the charge of concealment is supported by acts that are other than simply transporting it, that they are somewhat similar in character of the acts here of trading four, five -- it's like changing motor numbers which is a common one.

    But in construing what Congress did and trying to find whether there was ambiguity, we just plead up in the (Inaudible) etcetera, what it is that Congress intended by this concealment and you are arguing concealment doesn't mean something that's inherent part but of course, he doesn't want to be caught but if he takes extra steps to make it difficult even for the FBI to discover him, that may make another offense.
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="980.297" stopTime="1022.827">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    Well, insofar as we have any in the case, and it's set forth in our brief, I don't think I can to get it, it seems to me quite clear that Congress intended to reach separately, the man who stole a car and sold it whether he was a transporter himself or not. 
    And so to the extent that 2313 covers, whoever receives, conceals, sells and so on, and sells, I think it's clear they intended to cover situations which might be either that is there were -- some of the things they prohibit that would be normally be done by the offense.There is some that might be done by either.

speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="1088.408" stopTime="1194.898">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    Well, this is -- I think I never completed what I started to say about the case on page 36, that where we have the facts, which is in Madsen, the only one way where the facts are really spelled out and integrate, it is clearly a situation like this where they were changing motor numbers and all sorts of that. 
    Now, what happens in the other cases though is that they come up on collateral attack. 
    There are either pleas of guilty or somebody later on has made this allegation. 
    And the Court, for that reason, the courts have said in line with the principles of Blockburger and so on as they understood them, well, even accepting your allegation that there is one transaction, it would still be two separate offenses under Blockburger and so on. 
    But we don't have the facts in those cases.I can't tell. 
    But what's interesting to me is that going through it insofar -- in preparing this argument and reading as many cases as I could, the cases that -- that involved concealment where even some that -- where there were concurrent sentences and -- so that the issue wasn't raised, but it seemed to me that in general, this whole line of cases may well be academic, of course, insofar as you can tell from the reported cases. 
    Charges of concealment have usually been supported with proofs of acts of -- separate acts of concealment like this case here. 
    Now, I don't know how much -- I don't know what -- when one can get to that because there is no question that a tremendous number of Dyer Act convictions are disposed of by pleas of guilty that 9%, I think, figure show.

    I do not dispute. 
    If I may, I'd like to return to the question Mr. Justice Harlan asked me in connection with the persons who transports and sells. 
    I believe that in reply, I indicated that there were two separate punishable offenses. 
    I now believe I'm inaccurate in that. 
    The answer is this. 
    I think that under the legislative history of this Act which says nothing about the type of punishment the Government insists upon in this case, that the prosecutor is given a choice as to which section he should proceed under in the case of one person, transporting and selling the automobile, the same with one person transporting and storing.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1290.358" stopTime="1297.637">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    In other words, you limit the application of Section 4 to non-transporters.

    Mr. Clarence O. Woolsey 
    No, sir, I -- I wouldn't say that. 
    I think they have two avenues to proceed upon. 
    If one man transported and sold this automobile --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Yes.
speaker="clarence_o_woolsey" startTime="1306.300" stopTime="1388.194">
    Mr. Clarence O. Woolsey 
    -- then, I think, from the legislative history, all they intended to give this prosecutor was the choice, let him take his choice as to which avenue he should proceed in rather than bundle him together or put him in two counts and give this man multiple punishment for one transaction. 
    As far as this transcript is concerned, I -- as I understand, I am justified in the position that it should be limited to the first 52 pages. 
    There is no dispute as to the facts in the first 52 pages. 
    If I am sustained in that position, I understand this Court can decide this on the question raised by the petitioner. 
    If, however, the balance of this record, which was supplied by the Government, can be considered, I am still in no position and I cannot dispute the truth of the facts which are stated therein. 
    Consequently, I think that takes us away from the Ladner case. 
    In the absence of such a dispute, it would seem to me that this Court can, if it decides to consider this additional record, dispose of this case on the question raised.
