    There were requirements for correction of the drawings. 
    There were certain other procedural matters which had to be attended to and those matters were taken care of and finally a notice of allowance was issued in the case. 
    The first notice of allowance which was issued was defective. 
    We called that properly to the attention of the patent office, and in response to that in due course they issued the corrected notice of allowance under which the final fee is due as I have reported to Mr. Justice Douglas.

    Mr. Joseph Y. Houghton 
    Not so far as the US Patent Office is concerned, Your Honor. 
    We have a peculiar situation which is that one foreign country in which we have filed has issued a secrecy order. 
    We are strenuously endeavoring to have this secrecy order rescinded and that there is a problem as to whether the payment of the fee in the US case by the inventor which under the law would require that the patent issue within three months, whether that could be a violation of this secrecy order in the other country. 
    Now I should mention that the statute also does provide that if the final fee is not paid within the six months period, which expires May 25th, then the Commissioner of Patents in his discretion on a showing of good reason why, may accept it anytime within the next year after the expiration of that period. 
    We know of no precedent as to whether the existence of a secrecy order aboard would be recognized as a good reason under this Act. 
    However, we have asked the Commissioner of Patents to, if possible, give us some sort of a ruling on that with the understanding of course that he certainly would not take any longer to May 29th then we absolutely had to, if the secrecy order could not be disposed off before that time.

    It will not affect the US patent, that is correct Your Honor. 
    What we are worried about there is that we have applied for patents in certain foreign countries. 
    Now in some of those foreign countries the issuance, I mean, the occurrence of a publication anywhere in the world before you file your application would constitute a bar to obtain you a valid patent. 
    In others of the foreign countries the issuance of patent would only be a bar, I mean, the issuance of a publication, would only be a bar to the grant of a valid patent if the publication occurred in the country concerned.

    As I thought -- as I was trying to make clear Your Honor, the claims of the application were initially allowed before the formal notice of allowance was issued in the application. 
    This formal notice of allowance is a printed paper which calls for the payment of the final fee within the six months period provided, and says that on the payment of the fee the patent will issue approximately six weeks to two months thereafter. 
    Now, the claims had been allowed by the examiner, but in the action which allowed them, if you called attention to the fact that there were requirements for correction of the drawings which had been made early in the prosecution of the case, that had been differed until claims should be allowed and also that there were other requirements for illustration of certain subject matter which had been described, but had not been illustrated in the drawings. 
    Now those were formal matters, the claims were allowed but these formal matters had to be corrected before the examiner would issue the formal notice of allowance which calls for the payment of the final fee.

    Mr. Joseph Y. Houghton 
    That is correct Your Honors. 
    Now we feel that the issues which are presented, can be stated more -- which are -- I will tend to state more fully following the brief statement of the facts, because the primary issues comprised these, that's whether the Atomic Energy Act authorizes the respondents to destroy the petitioner's trade secret by publishing his invention which forms the subject matter of a pending patent application. 
    Now that is a matter of destroying the trade secret. 
    Second is whether if the Act is construed to so authorize, it should be held to that extent to be unconstitutional. 
    Now the facts briefly are as follows. 
    In 1942, the plaintiff made a basic or a prior invention and this dual temperature process which is covered by an issued patent and that earlier invention, the respondents have perfect liberty to publish and that's not involved in this case at all. 
    It was after June 1946, while he was self employed that the petitioner made the invention, which is involved in the present controversy and in referring to it I will try to refer to it as the new invention so as to distinguish it from the earlier one. 
    This new invention, the petitioner offered to disclose to the Atomic Energy Commission in confidence in 1948 and the letter by which that offer was made is attached as appendix I to the brief -- to the reply brief for the petitioner which was just filed yesterday. 
    This confidential disclosure was of course made I should say pursuant to this offer in 1948, the confidential disclosure was made in 1949 and of course the purpose of it was to enable the Atomic Energy Commission to determine whether it wished to use the process for the production of heavy water. 
    No rights in the invention being transferred as part of this submission. 
    The Atomic Energy Commission then did decide to use the new invention for the production of heavy water. 
    And from 1950 to 1953, the petitioner rendered services to the Atomic Energy Commission under special contracts which reserved his rights to the invention in controversy, and which provided that he would file a patent application for the invention, which he did. 
    Now that application was put under a secrecy order by the patent office at the instance of the Atomic Energy Commission. 
    And the Atomic Energy Commission also refused to allow the secrecy order to be modified, so that the inventor could file corresponding applications abroad. 
    That situation adhered until February 1, 1957. 
    On February 1, 1957 the secrecy order was rescinded and at the same time the Atomic Energy Commission threatened to publish the subject matter. 
    We maintain that this subject matter is petitioner's trade secret up until the time that patent issues. 
    The petitioner at once sought assurances that the publication would not be made, but he could not obtain such assurances. 
    He filed this suit to prevent the respondents from destroying his property by publishing his trade secret. 
    The District Court in proceedings on the motion for preliminary injunction overruled respondent's contention that this was an unconsented suit against the government. 
    However, based on affidavits of certain alleged disseminations which are produced by the respondents, the District Court did deny the motion for preliminary injunction on the ground of mootness. 
    On appeal, the Court of Appeals did not reach the point of mootness. 
    It ruled that the Atomic Energy Act authorized the respondents to make this publication and that therefore the contract did not -- and it also mentioned that the complaint had not set out in its opinion the statutory limitations which denied such authority and on that basis it ordered the case to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
    The petitioner moved to amend the complaint to specify statutory limitations and also to specify the presence of a constitutional issue. 
    Now this motion was denied and we came up for the first time to this Court. 
    In the per curiam in December 1957 this Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment and orders below and remanded the case with instructions to enter the amendments and decide the issues raised by the petitioners appeal. 
    On remand, the Court of Appeals again held that the Atomic Energy Act authorized the publication and further held that the Constitution didn't forbid this, and then directed that the amended complaint be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action on which relief could be granted. 
    Now we maintain that the instant certiorari was granted to review these rulings and also the ruling of the District Court which was not reached by the Court below. 
    The petitioner's first contention, which I will discuss after I mention the others, is that the respondents do not have the statutory authority to publish the plaintiff's trade secret without his consent. 
    There are three points on that which I will not enumerate until I get to that part of the discussion. 
    Our second contention, which Mr. Edwards will discuss, is that the District Court ruling of mootness was improper and was not established by the evidence. 
    These above issues of course are raised by the questions presented in the petition as granted and hence are in our opinion properly before the Court. 
    It appears to us from the respondents' brief that the respondents have abandoned the position that they have statutory authority to publish this subject matter with or without the petitioner's consent, which they urged always previously heretofore and now are attempting to rely or attempting to raise a new issue on the proposition that somehow they are trying to find an implied consent to this publication. 
    Of course they have tried to rely on an implied contract, of course there was an implied contract, that they could use this matter, subject to compensation as far as the use was concerned, but that's a different thing from destroying the trade secret which is the subject of the contract up to the time when a patent they issue.

speaker="joseph_y_houghton" startTime="1415.926" stopTime="1649.547">
    Mr. Joseph Y. Houghton 
    Well, the situation seems to me, I don't want to infringe on what Mr. Edwards is prepared to discuss in more detail from a legalistic standpoint, but the situation seems to me to be this. 
    There are three ways in which the government or government official can get information in confidence. 
    One way is from the inspection of a patent application under the Secrecy Act. 
    When that's done, the respondents now come along here and they say we don't claim now and they pretend that they never claimed before, that they would have any right to publish it if they got it that way. 
    Another way is if the Act, the Atomic Energy Act or other appropriate act called for a report to be made of the invention. 
    The respondents in their brief now come along and they say, we don't say that we have any right to publish under those circumstances, yes we would get it under confidence then and then they pretend that they never heard to the contrary below, well we contend that they did urge to the contrary below and even up before this Court, that is pretty fully set forth in our reply brief. 
    Now the third way they can get the subject matter and it will be noted that also in connection with getting it from inspection of a patent application, but that law sort of -- that secrecy law rather adds to the old patent infringement so called jurisdiction or patent eminent may license jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, which adhered only when one the subject matter was used by or for the government after the patent issued. 
    Now under the Secrecy Act it carries the time when the government may look upon the -- and then it may look to the government for compensation for use, back to the time when the government got access to this application and got it that way as a trade secret. 
    And I believe there are cases, one of them is the Smith case cited in our reply brief, which have held that a patent -- that an invention remains a trade secret throughout the pendency of the application for patent on it. 
    Now the third way that it can be gotten is for the inventor who or owner of the trade secret to disclose it under some sort of a contract to the recipient of the disclosure. 
    In this case the disclosure was to be made for the purpose of enabling the trade secret to be used by the Atomic Energy Commission for the prevention of heavy water. 
    And certainly didn't contemplate destruction of the trade secret, because if you destroy -- it wouldn't be any point to making a contract with respect to subject matter which was convey immediately the right to destroy the subject matter under which the contract was made. 
    Recall that until a pattern issues to take the place of your trade secret the only rights that an inventor has are his rights of secrecy, in this country. 
    And it seems to us that whether those -- whether the right to use this as obtained under the Patent Act Secrecy Provisions, or whether it's obtained under a reporting provision of the Atomic Energy Act, or whether its obtained through a patriotic presentation of the subject matter with a reservation of full patent or full rights in the subject matter by a citizen is completely immaterial so far as any right to publish and destroy the race of the contract is concerned, do I make that point clear?

    You offered him on dependency during this (Inaudible), but I do know really of having read opinions over the years, that the relationship between an employee of the government maybe contributed to the government while an attempt for his employment. 
    Those relationships now of course are subtle and difficult legal questions, what rights he has if any et cetera, et cetera. 
    There's a good deal of litigation over the years in this Court and what you're asking is an injunction, an injunction on the assumption that the contract in this case barred the Atomic Energy Commission, which has usually not been accused of accepting dissemination of his (Inaudible), barring it from making public within its power, everything pertaining to it, to conduct it's affairs, which the public interest authorizes, by the public interest, I mean the national interest.

    This inventor in the early contracts was an independent contractor and was so identified and his things he was supposed to do were very carefully identified and the early contracts and particularly the res gestae surrounding them showed that he had reserved all of his rights in his invention. 
    Now the right to preserve his foreign rights by not having a premature publication is one of those rights. 
    The right to preserve his freedom to negotiate for the use or for the commercial use of his trade secret is another one of the important and valuable assets that attach to making this intellectual property contribution. 
    So that was the first thing. 
    Now secondly the idea was that this would be used subject to a reservation of all his rights, and then this contract was entered into which called him a contractor not an employee, and similarly the later contracts after the government had decided that they did wish to use the subject matter of this application, this trade secret, in the production of heavy water, the later ones each carefully reserved all the rights, had the usual clause that if the inventor makes new inventions during the course of this contract as a part of his assigned duties, those along to the government, but that as to all of the earlier inventions which he has made any rights that he had with respect to them and that's any rights with respect to them are reserved.

    Is the commission purporting or is not restrained from publishing specifically that which would be contained in the specifications of the patent or are they publishing things which impliedly would make public in that they don't want to publish Mr. Spevack's potential patent?
speaker="joseph_y_houghton" startTime="1849.243" stopTime="1986.753">
    Mr. Joseph Y. Houghton 
    They wish to publish certain manuals as to the system used in the class. 
    Now this system embodies the invention of the present, that's now in controversy here. 
    This original -- the original, what I call the earlier invention, wasn't economically too attractive. 
    It was operable. 
    It showed how to apply principals in a different way to obtain a different result, but it wasn't economically very attractive and it was not enough, not attractive enough to awake any very great interest by the Atomic Energy Commission, although it was assigned to the Office Scientific Research and Development. 
    Now, after 1946, when Mr. Spevack was no longer employed by the government, he got thinking about this problem and he had, had some faith in this thing and he made -- he finally figured out how to make this thing really economically attractive. 
    And at that time he came back to the AEC as shown by the letter printed in our -- at the end of our reply brief, he came back to the Atomic Energy Commission and he says look, this thing is going to be much better than any of the other ways you have available to make heavy water. 
    Now I would like to be compensated some for my time in preparing full analysis of this thing for you, but it seems to -- but I will do it, I'll do it on my time if you don't feel like compensating me for my time, but it's understood that nothing is -- nothing that I disclose to you, I'm not giving up any rights, you know. 
    And on the basis of that sort of arrangement, he did demonstrate to the government that this system, this new system, did make this economically very much superior to any other way of doing the job, and on the basis of that it was adopted for the government plans. 
    And as long as the trade secret is maintained, as long as it was used in confidence in those plans we have no objection because we have reserved rights to compensation for that.

    Well that's the substantially, yes Your Honor. 
    Now I think the Court has seemed to be so very familiar with the whole circumstances here and the question seemed to be going more toward this or seem to have gone toward this point of new issue and I believe in order to allow time for my other counsel here to treat that I should close at this point.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2104.354" stopTime="2120.754">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The point that the Court of Appeals discussed as denying the injunction, because they (Inaudible) remedy of this man's property (Inaudible).
speaker="joseph_y_houghton" startTime="2120.754" stopTime="2265.856">
    Mr. Joseph Y. Houghton 
    The question of this adequate remedy at law as I see it comes down to two things. 
    If you have a contract and there is a breach of that contract or if you have a contract and there is a provision for a promise to pay in that contract, on the part of the government agent who is authorized by the statute to do the act in question, then or if he is authorized by an eminent domain statute, then you of course have a cause of action in the Court of Claims as long as the act done does not sound in tort. 
    Now if the act done is not authorized by statute or an eminent, that is an eminent to main statute or by a contract consent then of course it would sound in tort, and it wouldn't be actionable. 
    Now it comes of the other fact that we have the Tort Claims Act in which for certain times in torts the government says yes it will be liable and consent to be sued, but that isn't this sort of a situation. 
    Now also here we have the further fact that an invention like a copyright, like a writing, this is an intellectual property, you have rights as long as you keep it secret to get patents, in various places for it. 
    It's unique, once it's disclosed the trade secret is gone. 
    Once it's disclosed your right to get patents in certain countries is gone, once it's disclosed in certain countries your right -- certain other countries your right to get patents there is gone. 
    So this is a very unique thing, this trade secret and none of the cases which have been cited, we haven't found a single case where there has ever been a ruling that the -- that there is any statutory -- any eminent domain -- contemplation of any eminent domain taking for example of the right to destroy the very thing taken, the trade secret.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2265.856" stopTime="2268.661">

    Mr. Joseph Y. Houghton 
    But that's the prerogative of the inventor. 
    He at that time has negotiated you might say with the patent office on behalf of the government, on this basis that if you will give up your trade secret by issuing your patent, we will then give you 17 years exclusive monopoly in exchange for it.

    Mr. Joseph Y. Houghton 
    That is one of the results. 
    The other result would be this, that as long as the US application remains pending, as long as we haven't published this subject matter, the inventor has trade secret property which he can sell to somebody, which he can negotiate for the promotion of. 
    Now as soon as he issues --

    Mr. Joseph Y. Houghton 
    Well now the agreements between the parties never said anything about foreign rights whatsoever. 
    The agreements merely said that Mr. Spevack reserved all of his rights which were the right of secrecy until his patent should issue at his own volition. 
    He pays the final fee which causes it to issue it, as I think was brought out earlier in the argument.

    Mr. Joseph Y. Houghton 
    Well it will do damage abroad, but it will also do damage with respect to Mr. Spevack's ability to negotiate for the promotion of his trade secret and the trade secret remember maybe broader. 
    The trade secret maybe broader, the things that people would like to learn about this, maybe broader than what is determined or covered by the claims of the first issued patent.

    Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II 
    If it please the Court, I would just propose to discuss the question of the new issue which the respondents have sought to raise in this case. 
    They have always previously relied on statutory authority to do the act which we seek to enjoin. 
    I can cite instances in their previous briefs on many occasions. 
    As Mr. Houghton has indicated they have now abandoned this and they now seek to find a consent which they content they obtained from the petitioner by way of some agreements which are not even before this Court. 
    They were forwarded to the clerk by counsel with the suggestion that they were available to the Court, if the Court desired to consider them.

    Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II 
    The contracts Your Honor, prefer not to call them employment, they were strictly a contractor basis and a consultant basis. 
    They are in the possession of the clerk. 
    We contend first of all that those contracts in this issue are not even before this Court. 
    Secondly, that even if they are before this Court, they do not convey the rights which the respondents content they convey. 
    The initial contracts, the first three or four merely said that in substance that the petitioner was going to tell them what this process was. 
    Then as Mr. Houghton has indicated, after they had revealed the process to them and they had decided to use it, he was hired to advise them on how it could be handled. 
    In those contracts, there is a specific reservation in each of the four, either right in there or by reference, there is a reservation of the right, all rights that he has under the Atomic Energy Act or otherwise. 
    Now as regards whether this issue which they now seek to raise, in other words if they have the consent to make this publication, is before this Court. 
    I direct the Court's attention to Rules 41 d2 and 40.3. 
    Those rules specify what issues are before this Court. 
    This case has been in litigation for sometime now and this on the petitioner's brief filed about a month ago was the very first time they ever raised this issue of consent. 
    It maybe that under 18 of the US Code it is a crime for a government officer to reveal a secret process revealed to him in confidence and now they have to find some other means as they have apparently conceded that they do not have the statutory authority.

    If they don't have the authority then there is no adequate remedy of law.

    Just this one case sir. 
    As I've indicated in the rules, I think this action is prohibited by the rules and also in the case of Wiener against United States decided last June 30th, the facts briefly were President Truman had point the plaintiff as a -- to the War Claims Commission, after President Eisenhower came to office, he asked the man to resign, he didn't do so and he was discharged. 
    The man then filed a suit in the Court of Claims for his compensation that he lost. 
    The Court of Claims dismissed the case and this Court granted certiorari and the issue raised in the briefs in the petition for certiorari was whether or not the President in this discretion may remove a member of the War Claims Commission. 
    As they are after the respondents in their brief, as they have done in this case, sought to raise a brand new issue of -- they raised the issue of defense of res judicata which had never previously been raised in a case and Mr. Justice Frankfurter in a footnote said that this contention was not properly before the Court, was not raised in the brief in opposition and it was not considered. 
    So in summarizing on this new issue and on these contracts we say the issue is not before the Court both under the rules of this Court and under the decisions of this Court, and that also the contracts which they have sought to present to this Court are not properly before the Court but that the --

    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    The government has learned for the first time in the past hour when it is that the date -- when it is that the petitioner must pay his patent fee. 
    The dates of allowance are confidential as between the patent office and the applicant. 
    And so we have not known the precise date until this time, although we did know that at the time the petition for certiorari was filed there was a statement that all the claims had been allowed. 
    It's perfectly clear that once the patent is issued this case becomes moot. 
    The compliant sought an injunction only until such time as a patent would issue. 
    The petitioner is seeking injunctive relief. 
    He must therefore show that he has a need for that extraordinary remedy. 
    Yet far from showing such need, he has -- it has been stated to this Court that the patent fee is not being paid for the very purpose of preserving this litigation.

    Well I think that it's true, that under the Atomic Energy Act there is an obligation imposed upon the commission to declassify data, to disseminate it to the world. 
    I think that it is clear, it has in fact happened as a result of temporary restraining orders issued in this case that the United States has not been able to participate fully with other countries, pursuant to President Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program, pursuant to the OEC program, because of the restraint which has been imposed as a result of this litigation.

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    I had intended to devout the major portion of my argument to just that point and because I think a chronology will indicate what in fact are the issues of this case? 
    As counsel for petitioner has stated, the basic process which he invented is owned by the commission, there is not question as to that. 
    In December 1956, the Atomic Energy Commission announced that it wanted to declassify information with respect to heavy water, so that all persons interested in this field knew from that time on, that the opportunity to apply for foreign patents would soon be on hand. 
    On February 1, 1957, the secrecy orders which theretofore had applied to these patent applications were rescinded and so petitioner has had over two years since February 1, 1957, to apply for his foreign patent rights. 
    Indeed shortly after the lifting of the secrecy order on March 30, 1957, counsel for petitioner wrote to the Atomic Energy Commission and asked that there be a delay in the dissemination, and that letter is attached to the complaint. 
    The basic complaint that was made, the basic plea that was made to the Atomic Energy Commission was, that had there never been any secrecy restrictions, petitioner would have had one year after he filed his domestic patent application, within which he could apply in foreign countries and be subject to certain priorities and protections under the International Convention. 
    We don't hear, and this was the basic theory of the complaint, I'm entitled to one year after I file my patent application, under the treaties you have prevented me from availing myself that right.

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    That patent application was filed on September 29, 1950. 
    On October 30, 1950 the secrecy order went into effect and the secrecy order precluded the filing of foreign patent applications. 
    February 1, 1957 the secrecy order was lifted, from that time on petitioner has been free to file in the foreign countries. 
    We hear no more or we hear little about the one year period under the convention now for simple reason that petitioner has had over two years, which I submit is also a fact of which in and of itself is dispositive of this case. 
    In this letter which is attached to complaint, counsel for petitioner stated to the Atomic Energy Commission that the patent would issue within the next few months. 
    This is in March 1957.

    Had there been no secrecy order, and I file my domestic patent application, under the convention for the protection of industrial property which is in the appendix to the government's brief, there is a period of one year in which he may file in foreign countries and not be subject to the objection of a prior publication.

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Well, in that letter he said, it's only a matter of a few months. 
    In June 1957 when petitioner was before the Court of Appeals, and the case was submitted to the Court of Appeals but there was some colloquy prior to that time, Judge Berger asked the counsel for petitioner how long do you want and counsel stated one year would be preferred or required.

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Would be preferred or required. 
    This was what was said to the Court. 
    Well, it's now March of 1959. 
    In response to this request for a delay, in which it was said that the patent would issue in a few months, the Atomic Energy Commission grant – they said that they would grant perhaps 30 days, they said, it appears at page 74 of the record that we assume that you will immediately take steps to obtain the foreign patents and that an additional delay of perhaps 30 days would be adequate to protect Mr. Spevack's interest. 
    This was in response to the representation that was made in the letter to the Atomic Energy Commission, that it was just a matter of a few months before the patent would issue. 
    On April 10, 1957 the complaint for injunctive relief was filed and as I say the basic theory was that he had been deprived of the one year. 
    And in that compliant, petitioner alleges that since February 1, 1957, plaintiff has taken definite steps as rapidly as he is able to do so towards making applications for foreign patents, and the injunction that was sought was until such time as their patent would issue, which brings us to March of 1959 and before this Court. 
    The information has been declassified for a period of 27 months.

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    I have to bring some additional facts into the case because the answer is no Mr. Justice Black, but not because of anything that the respondents have done. 
    Under the Invention Secrecy Act, which is in 35 U.S.C., an inventor is entitled to compensation, if he is precluded from filing foreign patent applications as a result of the secrecy order. 
    That cause of action accrues as of the time his patent is allowed, as of the time the patent office says to him you have an allowable patent. 
    Even though the secrecy order was imposed, the patent office continues to process the patent application. 
    Well now what happens in this case and this case is the sport in this respect, when petitioner filed his patent application in September 1950, the patent office denied it. 
    They did not allow it and in fact it was not allowed by the patent office until sometime subsequent to the lifting of the secrecy order. 
    And so we did not prevent him from -- the secrecy order did not prevent him from getting his patent up until the time the patent office allowed it. 
    That's something peculiar to this case. 
    It does not affect the general rights of inventors. 
    The fact is that Congress has recognized in the Secrecy Act that inventors may lose certain rights as a result of the imposition of a secrecy, of the secrecy order and Congress has provided a mechanism for providing just compensation.

    Now there is tremendous public interest in this case as evidenced by the brief filed by the amici in this case. 
    The Engineers Joint Council has amongst its membership and membership and the associations which it -- which composes 250,000 scientists and engineers, the American Chemical Society has 80,000 chemists. 
    The American Chemical Society in their brief said the importance of these questions of the members of the American Chemical Society cannot be overstated in their brief. 
    And they are talking about the authority whether or not the respondents have the authority to do what they are trying to do, something they have gotten confidence and now they propose to give it away and destroying his rights. 
    The Engineers Joint Council said in their brief since the Engineers Joint Council represents such a vast number of our nations' engineers and the case at bar present a serious threat to the fundamental rights of our country's engineers and scientist. 
    Consent was obtained to file this brief. 
    This case involves a very important issue. 
    Our government agents and particular the respondents here are going to be able to get something from somebody incompetent such as has done here and then over his objection destroy it. 
    Now Mr. Sand's contends that they had a statutory duty to make this public. 
    That statute says encourage, permit and encourage publication. 
    That statute is talking about information that they own, not information owned by someone else such as in this case. 
    Mr. Sands contends that they paid him to tell them how to incorporate this process into his plan. 
    They paid him what in amounts was to time for -- I mean payment for the time that he devoted to this or informing them of what this was. 
    And he didn't pay them -- I mean, he wasn't paid for the destruction of this right, this trade secret which is a valuable trade secret. 
    Mr. Sands contends that all he reserved was his right to compensation. 
    They, the respondents themselves in their brief, in opposition to the petition, admitted, it says petitioner reserve, however any invention rights in his alleged new process. 
    In the brief that they filed, the latest brief they said it is agreed that in the course of his employment petitioner reserved any invention rights which he may have in the improvement. 
    Now when he, he reserved any rights, one of the principal rights in a trade secret is the right to secrecy and it is not their right and they cannot show anywhere, where they contracted, negotiated and obtained the right to make this publication. 
    Mr. Sand speaks of serious public consequences. 
    Actually there's very little evidence in the record as to all these claims of what, how terribly they have been affected. 
    Their own pleadings show they don't, in forty out of a thousand documents is this process involved. 
    And I would like to also point out the Court in this case had -- no answer has been filed. 
    There has been a verified compliant filed in this case and a verified amended complaint and for the purposes of this action I think all of those contentions have to be taken as admitted. 
    And further in connection with the reservation of rights in all of the four contracts as I said Mr. Spevack had with the respondent, it stated, “it is understood and agreed that neither this agreement nor any compensation paid here under, nor any other provision of Article 5 above shall apply with respect to or affect any rights under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 as amended or otherwise and that the contractor may now or hereafter have in and to such improvement made between aforesaid dates. 
    He reserved all rights. 
    All he did was to tell them how this thing worked and then help them to incorporate it.

    And all the time they, they weren't making saying yes or no and then we get into court and they come in and say, show that they've been doing all these things, ignoring it. 
    Now if that's the way inventors and scientists are going to be treated, then I think it is a sorry commentary and I don't think it is going to promote our scientific development, that's what the interest of these amici are.

    Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II 
    No, he could apply for patents, he still has a right to apply for patents in certain foreign countries and he could continue to do that until it definitely becomes moot, but we frankly feel that this case involves a tremendous question as to whether or not these government agents have a right to override as we feel they have done in this case.

speaker="carleton_u_edwards_ii" startTime="6396.030" stopTime="6419.733">
    Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II 
    I think that's correct. 
    I just like to say this, there are certain affidavits and things in the District Court which if made generally public might be very detrimental to his rights in foreign countries involving whether or not he can get his foreign tax, he applied for patents after some of the instance which related therein occurred and they could be very damaging and it could be raised.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6419.733" stopTime="6429.210">

    Well, I suppose the government wouldn't want to prejudice you in that respect would it, it wouldn't be any advantage to them to do that?

    Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II 
    No, I don't think they would. 
    I would be very happy if they would agree not to. 
    I would just like to say this one further thing if I might, I realize my time is up, but Mr. Sand's contents that the basic theory of the complaint was that he wanted -- the petitioner wanted one year, that is not true. 
    I mean that's not correct. 
    Our paragraph 12 of the complaint states that the defendants have no right to publish the same or any reports dealing with such confidentially disclosed subject matter and we sought an injunction. 
    The only point on this one-year period is that among this group of countries which are members of this convention, if you file a patent in one of those countries, well I'll give an example, for instance say England and the United States are members, if Mr. Spevack filed a patent in the United States, he would have a right to file a patent in England anytime during the following year and the date of the patent would relate back to the date he filed in the United States. 
    He was prevented for six years. 
    Mr. Sand may have erroneously given the impression that he wasn't prevented, but he was prevented for six years or whatever the period was from applying for patents anywhere. 
    In fact as I admit -- noted, he sought a waiver so he could apply in one country, but that was denied and --

    Now does Mr. Spevack want the results of this lawsuit because he wanted principles for the future established, quickly what are you arguing for now?
speaker="carleton_u_edwards_ii" startTime="6756.881" stopTime="6761.898">
    Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II 
    Well I think we are fighting for a principle.

    And I think I understand that, I wonder if -- I might ask without calling for any argument from counsel for the American Chemical Society because he represents so many sides, if any, if the vacation of this, of this suit as being -- the vacation of the decision below is being moot would it adversely affect the interest of the scientists?

    Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of court, let me answer that by calling your attention to the language of the first opinion of the court of September 1957 where the Court of Appeals made it clear that that in its view, and we think its view was extremely erroneous, that the act authorized the commission to act as it did. 
    We think that it had no such authority and we think that principal should be eradicated from the books.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    As conceded that now, has it not?

    Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II 
    Well I didn't hear Mr. Sand's concede that they were acting erroneously but –

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    When you issue – we should, in order to move this, we vacate -- so that it would be the same as if the opinions that they have been written.

    Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II 
    Well in response to the Chief Justice's question as to whether this was a battle about principle or about results the chemical society is not participially interested in the results of this particular litigation except insofar as principle as concerned. 
    We don't know anything about the record below, we have not seen it. 
    But from what we do see in the briefs and in the opinions of the court below, we are extremely dissatisfied with the decision of that court.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But I suppose if those decisions were wiped out by being vacated, you would have no --

    Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II 
    Naturally we would prefer to see them wiped out by being told they were wrong rather than to be wiped out for mootness.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6879.431" stopTime="6880.178">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.

    Thank you, Your Honor.
