    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.

    Mr. Hynning has made available his copy of the transcript. 
    This copy contains certain marginal comments that we will, as soon as practicable, delete and file with the Court at the earliest practicable movement.

    Mr. John G. Laughlin, Jr. 
    On the subject of the hearing of July -- or June 22 and July 1, I would in fact advise the Court that the encyclopedia Britannica devotes a full page to transcendentalism without any reference to Black Mountain transcendentalism. 
    Black Mountain is a range in the tribal area of West Pakistan. 
    I hope the Court won't press me as to what is meant by transcendentalism but it will accept my word that it insofar as I am concerned it does not add a semblance or relevancy to the inquiry that was directed to Mr. Vitarelli.

    Mr. Justice Frankfurter I endeavor to enquire -- conform myself as to how many individuals were affected by the Court's decision in Cole versus Young, and with a very rough approximation was some 300 employees.

    Mr. John G. Laughlin, Jr. 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="157.147" stopTime="164.234">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well my question was a little broader than that, namely how many were potentially affected and that was turned into hundred or thousand.
speaker="john_g_laughlin_jr" startTime="164.234" stopTime="284.452">
    Mr. John G. Laughlin, Jr. 
    Well certainly, I would agree that that would be quite -- quite true. 
    By way of summation of my remarks yesterday, I would like to say that unlike the situation in Service v. Dulles and in Cole v. Young, additional removal from federal employment did not violate any procedural right conferred upon him by statute, or in our view, by regulation. 
    If however, the regulations promulgated by the Department of Interior are deemed applicable to a removal of an at-will employee, then of course our position is that these -- these procedural requirements were strictly complied with. 
    The only inquiry we feel that might be opened as to the sufficiency of this hearing is to the fairness. 
    And of course the Court will have available if it deems that this is a necessary inquiry in the case to have available the full hearing and we trust and hope that it isn't all as bad as the excerpts of petitioner's counsel have made it out to be. 
    If we are correct in our position that there was no invalidity as distinguished from a lack of authority, a statutory authority here, in petitioner's removal, then as I said yesterday we think it follows that there is no right to reinstatement in his former position. 
    Or another reason we think that there is no present right to that -- to reinstatement because of the personal action which was taken in 1956. 
    I should say that that notification of petitioner's termination bears the same date as the original notification and purports to affect his termination as of September 10, 1954.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="john_g_laughlin_jr" startTime="305.873" stopTime="467.192">
    Mr. John G. Laughlin, Jr. 
    I think that that if the 1954 termination be deemed invalid, that the 1956 notification would not validate that removal. 
    Petitioner's reference to the fact that the position formerly occupied by petitioner was converted to the competitive service on April 1st of 1956, in our view and as I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter made clear yesterday, becomes a relevance only in the event that there is a reinstatement of the petitioner. 
    That would be an emolument of his office which presumably he would be entitled to, that is to have the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory exercise his discretion and either recommending or not recommending the petitioner for conversion from accepted to competitive status. 
    Only in that event, even though that condition has been satisfied, would he be within the classified service so-called and eligible for the procedural protections of the Lloyd-La Follette Act. 
    Well petitioner's main contention in this Court is that he is entailed to reinstatement and in pursuance of that position, he insists that only by reinstating him in his position can the badge of infamy which has been fastened upon him by the 1954 removal be rectified. 
    We question whether that is a necessary element of relief and we point to the case of Peters v. Hobby which, as the court knows, was a loyalty case and where a reinstatement could not in the Court's judgment be granted to the petitioner there. 
    There of course there was fixed 10 year of employment that had expired at the time of decision. 
    But we think here that because of the status of this particular employee that we have an analogous problem, in the sense that he is and was at all times subject to removal at will and that to reinstate him in these circumstances would not add anything in the way of substantive relief that which is already been administratively accorded to him.

    Mr. John G. Laughlin, Jr. 
    If the Court please, the conversion is of the position from --accepted status to competitive status. 
    As is clear, I think the occupant of that position does not automatically convert from an accepted status to a competitive status. 
    He must first qualify, second he must have the recommendation of the High Commissioner. 
    Now until that -- those two conditions are satisfied, the occupant of that position, under civil service regulation, this is what they call a status quo employee, as such he is subject to summary removal in the same fashion that he remains an employee at will. 
    So that -- and even -- even though he is permitted to remain in that position, a position in the competitive service, he is nevertheless subject to a summary termination.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="723.635" stopTime="759.484">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let's see if I understand that. 
    Assume a man, who was a training specialist that Vitarelli was, assume a man was in that condition at the time that the position was covered in and therefore subject to civil service benefits. 
    Would such a person automatically -- would such a person automatically be now under civil service protection in that position or would he have to be appointed as such under the new covering in civil service faith?

   Argument of Clifford J. Hynning
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="904.828" stopTime="911.805">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Hynning, you may proceed.
speaker="clifford_j_hynning" startTime="911.805" stopTime="1110.180">
    Mr. Clifford J. Hynning 
    If the Court please, I would like to spend a few moments on the 56 personnel document. 
    As I -- as the record show, there were three documents filed. 
    There was an affidavit -- this appears on the record starting on Page 32. 
    There was an affidavit by the personnel officer of the Office of Territories of the Department of the Interior. 
    And it stated that this affidavit accompanied the defendant's opposition to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. 
    And the posture there taken by the Department of Justice was that this was a expunging of the record. 
    Now the affidavit states that the attached form 50, which is the document on Page 33, is a true copy of the official document reflecting the termination of Vitarelli from a position under the jurisdiction of the Office of Trust Territories, and that is all the affidavit states. 
    Now the notification of personnel action that's on Page 33 is exactly the same as the documents entitled Notification of Personnel Action on Page 31 except for two particulars. 
    It omits a sentence and it adds a sentence. 
    The sentence that it omits is the sentence that appears at the top of Page 32, the 5th line, “This action is being taken in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 10450.” 
    That sentence does not appear in the new 56 form 50. 
    The second change is the addition of a sentence appearing on the top of page 34, “This form 50 is a revision of and replaces the original bearing the same date.” 
    In all other respects the two documents are identical. 
    Now that means that there are two dates on each document, a date appearing after line number four, which in normal personnel practice reflects the date on which the document is prepared. 
    In both instances that date is 9/21/54. 
    The effective date is line number six, and that's date 9/10/54. 
    Now I submit that at the time, this document was prepared under the Department of the Interior, sometime in October 1956, it was -- it purported to be an expunging of the reference to the fact that the earlier document had been taken in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 10450 and was nothing else. 
    It was not in my opinion a re-firing of the individual.

    Whether he could take this long a time, that is from April 1 to let us say October 15 or October 1, to make up his mind.

    Mr. Clifford J. Hynning 
    I believe the Department of Justice is relying on a statute. 
    They are relying on the inherent power of the executive to dismiss an executive employee unless that employee has some rights either under a statute or under the constitution. 
    And of course the rights under the constitution are deemed to be limited to matters of things that are clearly irrational or that involve matters of partisan politics.

    -- (Inaudible) but I should think that they have a summary right to dismiss. 
    And we assume that the Secretary of Interior has a summary right to dismiss and that's what they're basing it on. 
    There will be no other reason for them to put in something about the civil service supervision.

    I want to be fair here to the Departments of Justice. 
    I suppose they would say -- it's stating that it is subject to the applicable law, its weasel language. 
    If the law isn't applicable, it isn't subject to that.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well it would be very easy to determine whether this is a regular form, the generality -- but there are no instances where they -- of dismissals or of suspension under the competitive classification, and therefore they used this form when it is not in the competitive class. 
    I mean that would not surprise me it is a public document that's printed or censored, but easy enough to find out I suppose.

    As I understand your point about the document on 33, which is the 1956 Notification of Personnel Action, you say that has no greater effect than there had been a letter stuck in the file saying that there was typographical error on the original personnel action and that's hereby corrected.
speaker="clifford_j_hynning" startTime="1476.506" stopTime="1575.446">
    Mr. Clifford J. Hynning 
    Well, I -- I don't like to ask a question -- which answers a question which speaks in terms of labeling or an error or error in citation. 
    This -- this was a very substantive wrong done to Vitarelli. 
    I think this is one of the things in this -- in the brief I have criticized the Court of Appeals very strongly on, saying this is an error in labeling. 
    I don't think it has any -- in my view the 1956 document means nothing more than they have endeavored partially to comply with our request for an expunging of the record and that alone, and I believe it was on that basis this document was submitted to the district court and used by respondents there. 
    Now I think this perhaps is further supported by the third document that was submitted in 1956 and that's the document on Page 34, which is an affidavit from the Civil Service Commission, which says that all records of the Commission have been expunged of all adverse findings made with respect to Vitarelli under Executive Order 10450. 
    Now Mr. Hall (ph) could not make that statement if he did not have a new form 50, which had deleted from it the reference to the Executive Order 10450. 
    And it would appear to me that this third document clinches my arguments that all that was attempted, intended, or actually done in the 1956 document was an expunging and nothing more and that could not be taken to have the effects of a 1956 firing.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1575.446" stopTime="1580.776">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    In another words what you say is that if the 1954 firing is no good, the man has never been fired.
speaker="clifford_j_hynning" startTime="1580.776" stopTime="1696.040">
    Mr. Clifford J. Hynning 
    That is our position. 
    Now I would like to make one other technical observation on the statute there has been a suggestion here that the 1950 Act or the Act of August 26, 1950 does not apply to persons outside the competitive civil service. 
    I think that is easily answered by the text of the Act itself, which is printed in the government's brief, Page 28. 
    And if you look there, after the first italicized proviso, that any employee having a permanent or indefinite appointment, now an indefinite appointment means the person who has an appointment outside the competitive civil service. 
    And while there may have ben some legislative history to suggest that they wanted additional powers, nonetheless the face of the statute shows that it had application to people in the -- who were not in the competitive civil service so long as their position had some rational relationship with the national security. 
    I have just apparently one or two minutes left and I would like to urge this Court to overrule Bailey against Richardson. 
    I believe the premisses under which that case was affirmed without an opinion by this Court have been completely rejected in subsequent decisions in Peters, in Service, in Cole. 
    And I believe that much of a difficultly in lower courts comes from the facts that the lengthy opinion of the Court of Appeals in the Bailey case still has a certain degree of standing which I believe it should not have and does not have under Peters, Cole, and Service and -- but that is a --

    Mr. Clifford J. Hynning 
    I -- I say -- I think the principle of Bailey is wrong and the fact that it is wrong I think is demonstrated by the decisions of this Court in Peters, Cole and Service. 
    Now Bailey essentially held that the a governmental employees has no constitutional right. 
    He is a policeman -- he has the privilege no one has the constitutional right to be policeman kind of argument. 
    I believe that has been rejected by this Court, but the language appears to have --
