    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The principal issue in this case which is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is whether the prohibitions in the Fur Product Labeling Act against false and deceptive invoicing are applicable to invoicing at the retail level, that is when a retail courier sells a fur product to the ultimate consumer. 
    There's a second issue in the case which I'll discuss subsequently dealing with the scope of the cease-and-desist order entered by the Federal Trade Commission in this case. 
    At the outset, I would just like to sketch briefly for the Court, since this is the first time this statute is before the Court, what in broad terms it purports to do and why we believe that the court below has misconstrued it. 
    The Fur Product Labeling Act was passed in 1951 after extensive congressional consideration by three different congresses. 
    One thing we think that stands out in connection with the history of this Act is that there was a clear congressional purpose to protect the ultimate consumer of fur products. 
    The statute basically sets up in Section 3 a general prohibition against the sale or distribution of fur or fur products which are falsely or deceptively invoiced, falsely or deceptively advertised or misbranded. 
    And then the section of the statute goes on in the next two sections and specifies the conditions under which that event would occur. 
    It states to them basically the provisions are substantially the same. 
    It states that a fur product is misbranded if there is not attached to it a label which sets forth a certain specified items of information, particularly the name of the animal in accordance with a certain standard, the country of origin of imported furs. 
    And if in fact there was any used fur, any inferior part of the animal or any dyed fur, that information must be set forth on the label. 
    Similarly, the statute goes on and requires substantially the same information to be attached to an invoice.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="159.674" stopTime="168.093">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is there any difference between the courier in the information that goes on the label and require you to go on the label on that statute, or require your to go in the invoice?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="168.093" stopTime="313.601">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Only in one minor particular. 
    The label requires the name of the manufacturer, the invoice requires the name and address of the seller. 
    Other than that, they are substantially the same. 
    I want to emphasize at the outset that when we speak of labels in this field, we do not refer to the traditional kind of label of a piece of cloth that is sown on the lining of the garment. 
    The label that are used in this business are really called, really tags. 
    They set forth two examples on the page 64(a) of the record and 66(b) of the record, that these little tags that are attached either to the arm of the garment or to the button, and they just hang there. 
    And we think this is very crucial because as I shall develop in a moment, we think that the temporary character of the label or the tag means that merely giving this information to the purchaser by this means does not give the purchaser the full measure of protection which we think Congress intended. 
    We think that Congress intended to go beyond this, and also to give her as a permanent record, the information contained on the invoice. 
    The respondent in this case operates a large department store in the City of Chicago, and after proper administrative proceedings, the Federal Trade Commission entered a cease-and-desist order finding that respondent had violated all three of these provisions, misbranding, false and deceptive invoicing and false and deceptive advertising. 
    The Court of Appeals modified the order with respect to misbranding, finding it was too broad in scope. 
    And in addition, completely struck the provision relating to false invoicing. 
    The Court reached this conclusion solely by looking to the statutory definition of invoice and it ruled that this definition was so clear on its face that there was no need to have resort to legislative history. 
    And we think that this construction is erroneous because first, we believe that the definition of invoice when viewed in light of the other provisions of the Act, does apply to retail invoicing and particularly when the legislative history in the purpose of Congress in passing the statute be considered. 
    And I would now like to turn to the specific statutory provisions involved in this case, which is set forth through pages 36 and 37 of our brief.

    No, Mr. Justice. 
    We think that the statute does require an invoice because in Section 5 (b) it states at page 39 of our brief that a fur product shall be considered to be falsely or deceptively invoiced if such fur product or fur is not invoiced to show. 
    We believe this is a mandatory requirement of invoicing.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But before you do that, let me clear up one more doubt in my mind. 
    If furs were shipped from Chicago to Washington with tags or label, whatever label may require, and sold to a local buyer in Washington, to the district, I suppose it's certainly arguable that that sale of that piece of fur sent without tags in Chicago to a -- I withdraw to the district (Inaudible) from Chicago to New York and take away the problem of the district. 
    Furs were shipped from Chicago to New York for sale by retail merchant in New York, and that fur is bought by a woman in New York. 
    I suppose it's certainly arguable, I'm not clear about it that the -- assuming there's a violation of the statute in that misbrand of tag, the sale in New York would still subject the -- the shipper from Chicago to the prohibitions of the Act, and -- and if their commerce would not have been exhausted in that point, is that right?

    All right. 
    Suppose the pelt -- as the woman buys a pelt in order to have it made by some other maker or tailor, whatever it is, whatever you call it.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    There's a prohibition on false invoicing of fur products shipped in interstate commerce. 
    But there is only a further prohibition on false invoicing of fur products shipped in intrastate commerce. 
    There is no prohibition in other words upon false invoicing. 
    It's not applicable to false invoicing of furs, which are shipped in intrastate commerce.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, mine is -- my -- my hypothesis of the shipment in -- in interstate commerce, no doubt about that.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Not insofar as the ultimate sale is made within the City of New York. 
    The previous transmission of the fur from Chicago to New York would be the ultimate sale by which the merchant in New York gives the fur pelt over to the woman. 
    That is not covered.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Yes, because the Act thwarts the distinction between invoicing of furs and -- no, I -- I have to -- sorry, I have to retract that answer, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, because the fur product is not required to be labeled when sold in intrastate commerce. 
    I'm sorry, the fur is not permitted to be labeled in intrastate commerce.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="762.536" stopTime="765.479">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The other way around.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="765.479" stopTime="1038.192">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Now, the Court of Appeals picked up the definition of invoice in Section 2 (f) of the Act, at page 36 of our brief. 
    I'd like to read to the Court. 
    It says, “The term “invoice” means a written account, a memorandum, list or catalog, which is issued in connection with any commercial dealing in fur products or furs and described the particulars of any fur products or furs transported or delivered to a purchaser, consignee, factor, bailee, correspondent, or agent, or any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or furs.” 
    The Court of Appeals stated that under this definition, an invoice at the retail level is not covered because the Court said first, “The invoice which is given by the retail dealer to the consumer is not issued in connection with any commercial dealing in fur products or furs. 
    Secondly,” the Court said, “that the last clause of this definition or any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or furs must be read back as modifying not only any other person but also agent, bailee, or purchaser and therefore, it reasons that since the retail purchaser is not engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or furs, the sales slip given to that purchaser is not an invoice within the meaning of the statute.” 
    We believe that this reading of the statute is too narrow. 
    We think that a fair reading of the statute is that Congress state that the term “invoice” means a written account or memorandum issued in connection with any commercial dealing in fur products or furs. 
    And we think clearly, the sale by the retail store to the customer is a commercial dealing in fur product, which is -- delivered to a purchaser, consignee, etcetera. 
    In other words, Congress specified a number of particular individuals to whom an invoice must be given, and then added a catch-all phrase covering any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur product or furs. 
    We believe that this result follows not only from the language of this statute itself but further from the basic congressional policy reflected in the history of this Act. 
    The Act in the committee report states its purpose is being to protect consumers and others against false and deceptive advertising, false and deceptive invoicing and misbranding. 
    We have set forth in our brief some of the legislative history of this statute which shows that when the Act first came before the committees for consideration, witnesses of the fur industry testified as to the importance to the retail consumer of a good invoice. 
    It's true. 
    They stated in this connection that they thought an invoice was better than a label and they made this contention as my adversary emphasizes because they didn't want any legislation. 
    They said, “Don't require us to label, but if we have to do anything, an invoice is preferable to a label.” 
    Now, Congress didn't accept that view. 
    Congress included a ban in Section 3 (b) upon the manufacture for sale of any fur product made in whole or in part of fur shipped in interstate commerce, which is misbranded or falsely or deceptively advertised or falsely or deceptively imports. 
    The testimony before the Congress also emphasize the importance of invoicing because of the transitory character of the label which hangs on the coat. 
    As one of the witnesses representing the fur industry stated to the Court, purchases “are more likely to throw away a tag than a proper invoice.” 
    Now, the construction adopted by the Court of Appeals would have this effect, all the way along the chain of transactions by which a fur coat is manufactured and gets to the hand of the ultimate consumer, there is both the label and an invoice. 
    However, at the time the ultimate consumer gets the coat, at this point, it's cut short. 
    All she gets is the tag, this little thing hanging there, which I think it's a fair inference, people will have to throw away. 
    The invoice which would be --

    In our brief, we have set forth in one of the footnotes a rather dramatic example of what happened with respect to an invoice. 
    The story is told of a woman who came to the Hollander Company and said she'd purchased a -- what have been told to her was a Hollanderized fur, and it just didn't look very well. 
    When the man took a look at it and said, “This isn't a Hollanderized fur.” 
    He said, “Where did you buy it?” 
    And she said, “I bought it in a neighbor store.” 
    He said, “Well, do you have your invoice?” 
    And she said, “Yes.” 
    He said, “Fine, you go back and tell him this is not a Hollanderized fur.” 
    She went back and was able to have some adjustment to get her money back. 
    I -- I think that this kind of a invoice which contains this information is a vital link to the consumer in getting the measure of protection which Congress intend.

    The -- the record speaks in terms of tags and the legislative history speaks in terms of losing tag. 
    I think there's a sound practical reason why not, which is the average woman I don't think would like to show her friend a fur coat and when the fur coat -- friend opens it and sees the label, it says on it, “Contains used fur” or contains paws, bellies, and -- paws, bellies and tails, I think as a practical matter, this is not the kind of information that the consumer would want to have made a permanent part.

    That's right, but the statue as -- that it came out of Congress, provided poor labeling and we think in the circumstances, it would have been anomalous that Congress gave them the greater protection, apparently, what they seem to think of the label and at the same time, denied in the protection of the invoice.

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No, they didn't. 
    That -- and that comes to the scope of the second part of the case. 
    The order against misbranding, the statute requires that to be -- avoid being misbranded, the label must contain six categories of information specified. 
    The Commission in this case found that the label failed to include three categories of information and further found there was no evidence that the label failed to include the other categories of information. 
    The Commission entered an order directing them to cease-and-desist from misbranding by failing to include on their label, the six categories of information specifying these six categories. 
    The Court of Appeal struck from the order against mislabeling, the provisions covering the three categories of information with respect to which the Commission found there was no evidence or violation. 
    Now, at the outset, I may say that the principal complaint of Mandel against this phase of the order is its fear that the public will get the misapprehension that by virtue of having been told to cease-and-desist from this other violations that somehow violated them. 
    And in their brief at page 40, they have suggested -- perhaps suggested that an alternative form of order, which will not specify the particular subcategories but will merely state to cease-and-desist from failing to include all the information required by the statute. 
    And in a brief -- reply brief, we have stated that we construe that as having the same effect as the Commission's order. 
    We therefore do not object to the form.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    The legislative history does show that they referred to the need for an invoice to a retail consumer, at least the fur representatives at that time were using the term “invoice” as applicable to retail sale, the retail sales slip.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1874.369" stopTime="1894.748">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, is there anything in the record that would indicate whether the term “commercial transaction” is used by Congress in connection with retail transactions as well as wholesale transactions?

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Again, Mr. Chief Justice, nothing in the record. 
    But in the legislative history, there is repeated reference to the need to protect consumers among other things against -- to set what we think deceptive invoice. 
    And then we therefore draw from the legislative history the inference that Congress used “commercial transaction” to include the sale by the commercial retailer to the individual customer.

    Mr. Samuel H. Horne 
    If Your Honor please, in the early -- early in briefing stages, as I recall, we raised the point and went on. 
    But an invoice in the common concept of the term isn't the sort of thing that you get when you brought to the counter and buy something and get a sales slip. 
    That is used at different stages of a commercial process. 
    But in this prosecution, if you turn the -- generally, we -- we were faced with the contention that that sales slip is the invoice that Congress talked about and that it didn't comply so we had to make the issue on that point. 
    I still adhere to my basic feeling that an invoice happens at a different stage in the commercial process.

    Now, that's a big mouthful. 
    I think it might help get that picture if we say transported or delivered to a purchaser and so on, or any other commercially dealing person. 
    To shorten the -- the -- who is dealing? 
    That clearly, it seems to us, requires that the transferee in the process, the recipient of the statutory invoice, be a person who is dealing commercially, the Court of Appeals took both clauses, one as reinforcing the other. 
    But it seems to us that either clause would exclude from the purview of invoice as defined in the Act and that fall from the invoice in the requirements, the retail sale to the consumer.

    Mr. Horne, If I -- I apologize for asking so many questions, but I would like to ask you the same question I asked Mr. Friedman about the term "commercial transaction" or as you say, “commercially.” 
    I'd like to know if there's anything in the record or in the cases that indicate that that term is limited to -- to the wholesale trade or -- or whether it's applied equally to or at times to -- to the retail trade.

    Mr. Samuel H. Horne 
    No, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    There isn't a word in the reports or in the legislative history. 
    There is nothing in the record in this case. 
    There is one sidelight in which -- which maybe at some interest to you in the legislative history and neither is this. 
    The -- the term "dealing commercially" was used at another point, in an earlier stage of the -- the bill to designate -- it -- they said in Section 3 (d) of H.R. 3734 as reported in the 80th Congress. 
    That a person dealing commercially, if he has reason to believe that the label has come to him as wrong, may substitute another label. 
    That's the only other place in the history that I found dealing commercially is used. 
    Obviously there, it has to mean the wholesaler, the jobber, the retailer, because they're the only ones that are interested in looking at the label and substituting or correcting it. 
    The consumer certainly is not interested in substituting --

    Under the Act now, construe this, you would have -- you'll have to furnish a label to the retailer, the same -- the same information with the invoice as the Government says.

    What practical difference does it make, well if you'll have to furnish two pieces of label?

    Mr. Samuel H. Horne 
    From a practical standpoint and I'm speculating now, I must admit this isn't in the record. 
    Was -- it wasn't raised. 
    From the practical standpoint, the fur buyer, the head of the department can, before they open the door, go down to the line of garments and police the tags, and make certain that all of the tags or labels of -- are in proper order. 
    When the door is opened and the sale starts, and they have two or three dozen salesclerks to -- selling the products, it becomes a different matter watching every say -- it's just -- it's physically impossible to watch every sales slip that each clerk makes out to make certain that it touches on each of the six statutory elements.

    He could say, “Well, the saleslady is telling me it was a tissue and it turns out to be red.

    Mr. Samuel H. Horne 
    Well, if Your Honor please, we are objecting at this point because if there's a cease-and-desist order on us, we are exposed to future contempt or penalty proceedings if somebody makes another mistake. 
    And the lesser of that exposure we have, the happier the store will be. 
    That isn't to say that there hasn't been -- there -- I'm told that there has been a radical revision of all their procedures, I mentioned we made at the advertising. 
    That's all been changed. 
    That's in the cease-and-desist order, and their other procedures have been radically changed to try to bring them in the line, but there are limits to how far you can go with personnel and how much you can get out off them. 
    Now, you -- someone asked me a question a moment ago whether we'd be prosecuted for typographical error.

    Mr. Samuel H. Horne 
    Oh no, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Here's what happened. 
    The investigator from the Federal Trade Commission came in, in September of 1952, one month after the Act became effective to look over what they were doing. 
    Mandel Brothers was there as it had been, previously, giving these sales slips, such as are set forth in the record here. 
    There are fifteen or twenty of those things in -- in the record below. 
    The investigator went through the books and took samples of the sales slips, which they had been given -- giving and checked them to see if they were in conformity with the requirements of that new act. 
    He looked at the labels on the fur garments, checked them to see if they were in conformity with the new requirements. 
    He found some mistakes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3350.585" stopTime="3354.292">

    Mr. Samuel H. Horne 
    The Act gone into effect in -- in August of 1952 and if I remember correctly, the investigator was there in September of 1952. 
    He came back in October of 1954 --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    1954.

    And furthermore, for whatever it's worth, he -- it's in the record. 
    He says nothing -- there was no communication after the first inspection as to what -- whether they were doing anything wrong or what they were doing wrong.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3383.949" stopTime="3415.160">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I'm afraid Mr. Horne, I -- I totally misconceived what's your position is. 
    I thought your position in this case was that you are not obliged to have any -- any of this material on the invoice or sales tags or whatever we choose to call it. 
    And that you therefore -- therefore, you could not be ordered to cease-and-desist because the statute didn't require you to put it on.

    Mr. Samuel H. Horne 
    That that isn't -- the question here -- the question -- our position is that whether they did or didn't, it was gratuitous so far as the Act is concerned, the giving of this. 
    It has nothing to do with the Act. 
    The Act doesn't say that the retailer has to give the invoice. 
    The Act requires invoicing of furs from the raw pelt down to manufacturer. 
    The Act requires the labeling of fur products from the time they are manufactured until they reach the end to the consumer. 
    In addition, there is this further requirement, which is the issue before us. 
    It says "invoice fur product." 
    Now, the extent of that requirement, of invoicing fur product, whether or not these invoices we gave were good or bad. 
    The extent of that requirement of invoicing fur products is -- is the question here and that depends on what the definition means.

speaker="samuel_h_horne" startTime="3767.467" stopTime="4031.261">
    Mr. Samuel H. Horne 
    Well, for one thing on the -- the invoicing question, it depends altogether on the interpretation of this term "invoice". 
    I -- short -- I used a shorthand reference to it a moment ago or -- or other commercially dealing person, purchaser, consignee, factor, bailee or other commercially dealing person. 
    And I would like to point out just briefly the parallel between the language, that language and the language that the Court had before it in United States versus Standard Brewery, that's cited in our brief. 
    The statute prohibited use of food products in the manufacture or production of beer, wine, or other intoxicating liquor. 
    And the Court held that -- or other intoxicating liquor referred back and modified beer and wine and it had to be intoxicating beer before it was in that prohibition. 
    Similarly, we say that this clause, commercially dealing person, goes back and modifies that -- enumeration of the persons who are concerned with the handling of furs. 
    Now, you'll want to know, I think, why we say that it's reasonable that Congress should have required the invoicing of fur products from the manufacturer to the retailer and not require it from the retailer to the -- to the consumer. 
    The reason for that, it seems to us, is found in the fact that you're intervening persons, your wholesaler, your jobber or your retailer. 
    Each one is responsible for seeing that the garment has a proper label on it before it goes forward from him. 
    If the wholesaler, the jobber, the retailer has a statutory invoice, a statutorily detailed invoice, he has something against which he can check the correctness of the invoice, of the label for which he is responsible. 
    But the consumer doesn't have any responsibility to pass -- pass it on to anybody. 
    And the consumer had -- does have the full protection of the required statutory label. 
    There was a mention of the testimony in the hearings in the 80th Congress, where this whole legislation originated, the fur dealers and processors and manufacturers were about the only witnesses that were in there, except to -- to irrelevant groups that were barred. 
    They were opposing the legislation. 
    They were opposing any legislation. 
    They were opposing labeling. 
    When they advocated invoicing to be observed, they didn't advocate invoicing but we touched them. 
    They advocated invoicing by somebody else. 
    The -- at the outset of those hearings, I have been testimony by a representative from the Federal Trade Commission who had recommended labeling as the remedy for the bills of the business. 
    At the close of those hearings and how it's in the 80th, the sponsor of the bill, Congressman O'Hara, called as if -- he's the representative, if I could stand and ask if he could add anything to testimony. 
    He reaffirmed his previous advocacy of labeling then he turned to the suggestion of invoicing as being -- as against labeling. 
    And he said, “Labeling would be a more effective remedy than invoicing because the label gives the customer facts before the -- before she makes her choice. 
    The invoice comes after." 
    Then he said it would be like locking the barn door after the horse is stolen. 
    He also went on the comment, "There is no burden on the manufacturer's invoice, but there is a burden on the retailer to give an invoice at the time to every sale."

    Well, what they suggest would be an improvement on what the Commission did, but it would still leave us in the position where we're subject to a cease-and-desist order, and if we do violate, it will be a penalty the first time and not the second time until your cease-and-desist order put you -- says that you will --
