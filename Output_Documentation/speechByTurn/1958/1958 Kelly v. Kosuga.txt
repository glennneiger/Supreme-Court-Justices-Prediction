Kelly v. Kosuga

    Mr. Joseph W. Louisell 
    The (Inaudible) and the District Court and the respondent would have us test the legality or the illegality of this underlying agreement by reference solely to the non-delivery aspect in this -- as it related to this particular undertaking between Kosuga and Kelly. 
    It is our feeling and we respectfully urge that that is unwarrantably narrow and restricted and incomplete view of the entire undertaking because it is the petitioner's position that the entire undertaking had, as its essential and inherent ingredient, an illegal purpose, namely, the manipulation of prices. 
    And just like the purchase by Kelly of the 50 carloads and the purchase by any of the others similarly situated with Kelly of a portion of these 287 carloads and just as the withholding from the market of each and every one of those was but one of the overt acts agreed upon by these parties as alleged by the defendant below and the petitioner here to affect and manipulate the price of onions on the cash and the futures market.

    Mr. Joseph W. Louisell 
    No. 
    It is agreed that both parties -- both sides of the transaction agreed with themselves and with all of the others concerned that none of them would deliver any portion of these 1000 cars of onions on either of the cash or the futures market. 
    That was -- that's agreed that they would all withhold of the 1000. 
    These people associated or similarly situated with Kelly agreed to purchase 287 and to withhold those.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Your -- you allege in these briefs then, do you, that you were a voluntary coconspirator?
speaker="joseph_w_louisell" startTime="221.198" stopTime="378.720">
    Mr. Joseph W. Louisell 
    We were a voluntary coconspirator in pari delicto and each of them was similarly so situated. 
    Now, that brings us, we believe, squarely to the proposition as to whether or not it is the -- the rule of law as pronounced by this Court that one who is a voluntary participant in pari delicto with others can repudiate a contract and successfully defend against a suit for the purchase price of the article where the very contract or the undertaking which is sought to be enforced is simultaneously the undertaking which had, for its subjective, the accomplishment of an illegal purpose, namely, the fixing of prices. 
    We have not labored in the brief, submitted except by reference in a footnote to a number of the decisions of this Court, the proposition that price fixing agreements are per se illegal. 
    Very recently, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, in speaking for the Court in United States against McKesson &amp; Robbins, very clearly spelled out that the illegality of any price fixing arrangement does not depend upon whether the arrangement was unreasonable or reasonable. 
    It does not depend on the motive of the parties whether good or evil. 
    It doesn't depend on whether the price fixed is accomplished by contract or as in this instance, by some more subtle device, namely, the withholding of this large quantity of onions from the market or whether the participants possess market control or the extent of control effected by the price fixing arrangement or whether the agreement is effective or not. 
    I think it too well settled and too late in the day for anyone seriously to challenge the proposition announced by this Court on enumerable occasions that price fixing agreements are illegal per se. 
    And that any undertaking calculated to affect a price fix is per se illegal. 
    And that stems from the inherent policy underlying Sections 1 to 7 of the Sherman Act. 
    Now --

    Was this issue decided in the context to the motion for summary judgment?

    Mr. Joseph W. Louisell 
    It was decided on the motion to strike this affirmative answer that this contract was per se an illegal contract because it constituted an entire undertaking by the parties to attempt to fix and manipulate prices.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do your opponents admit it was an illegal contract?
speaker="joseph_w_louisell" startTime="399.995" stopTime="898.095">
    Mr. Joseph W. Louisell 
    No, they do not. 
    And that that we respectfully submit brought into focus an issue of fact which should properly have been tried because the opponents did file an answer in addition to the motion to strike. 
    But we never got to the answer because the motion to strike was granted. 
    Now, it is our belief that we are not here concerned primarily with the character of the litigants whether the litigants are good, bad or indifferent. 
    Now, we respectfully submit, it's beside the point. 
    What we are concerned with here is whether or not the character of the contract -- of the entire contract, not just the portion taken out of context by the plaintiff but whether or not the character of the entire contract which the defendant by his pleading offered to show was or was not illegal. 
    And perhaps, our consideration with that -- of that proposition begins with a reference first to the Connolly-Sewer Pipe case decided in 1902 by this Court. 
    The Connolly case was an action in one instance commenced on promissory notes given by the purchaser of Sewer Pipe as consideration for that purchase. 
    And in the consolidated action, a second suit brought by the pipe manufacturer against a man by the name of Dee in Illinois. 
    It was on an open account for pipe sold to Mr. Dee. 
    And there, Connolly and Dee defended or sought to defend the suit on the claim that the seller itself was engaged in a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act. 
    The summon substance of the decision of this Court was that in as much as there was no claim that the contract of purchase between Connolly and the Sewer Pipe Company and between Dee and the Sewer Pipe Company was a contract in restraint of trade that the defense of violation of the Sherman Act was not available to them. 
    The Court very carefully pointing out that there was no claim, that there was anything in the contract of sale between the Sewer Pipe Company and its two customers that was in anyway suggestive of a violation of the Sherman Act, that what those defendants there relied upon was the antecedent claimed illegality of the manufacturer of the sewer pipe entering into a combination with other manufacturers but in no way related to these customers. 
    And the Court said that under those circumstances because the illegality alleged by the customers was not inherent in the contract upon which suit was bought, the defense could not be sustained. 
    Two months later, this Court in 1902, in May of 1902, decided the Beeman case. 
    Now, without making any reference to its decision in the Connolly case, in the Beeman case, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Peckham, I believe, said, “We are of the opinion that anyone sued upon a contract may set up a defense that it is in violation of the Sherman Act,” and it found to be so that fact will constitute a good defense to the action. 
    And further in the opinion, the Court's in but that that does not prevent a private individual when sued upon a contract which is void as in violation of the Act from setting it up as a defense. 
    And we think when proved, it is a valid defense to any claim made under a contract thus denounced as illegal. 
    Some seven years later, in 1909, this Court met with and dealt with the question, but for the first time in 1909, it was presented on a proposition that the contract sued upon in and of itself was illegal in that that contract, and I refer to the Continental Wall Paper case decided in 1909, in that contract itself, between the seller and the buyer, there were restrictive conditions, which on their face, constituted a violation of the Sherman Act. 
    That too, as in this instant case, was a suit for the recovery of the purchase price of wall paper sold to the defendant. 
    And the defendant there defended upon the proposition that the contract upon which the suit was brought on its face was violative of the Sherman Act and hence, this Court reasoned, since -- in maintaining the suit, the plaintiff had to bring into issue and had to rely upon a contract which was illegal. 
    The plaintiff could not maintain its action and the defense asserted that their contract was illegal, was a good, adequate and sufficient defense. 
    Now, just as the respondent here relies a great length upon the rule of the Connolly case, the petitioner here relies a great length upon the rule, as initially stated in the Beeman case and then as approved in Continental Wall Paper case where the exact same result for which the petitioner here contends was achieved by virtue of the decision in the Continental Wall Paper case. 
    But the Seventh Circuit in the District Court were of the opinion that the DM Wilder case decided in 1915 either abrogated or modified the rule in the Continental Wall Paper case. 
    In analysis of the Wilder case, however, discloses that thereto as in the Connolly case, the customer, the purchaser who sought to avoid the obligation to pay by reliance upon the Sherman Act was not himself a party to an agreement that was inherently illegal. 
    He was a stranger to any illegality. 
    And it was frankly conceded apparently at the oral argument because a careful reading of the case discloses that it is pointed out that the customer in that situation made no claim that the contract upon which the suit was brought was in itself illegal except when viewed through the eyes of the seller whom it was claimed, was together with other manufacturers of glucose associated in a combination of restraint of trade. 
    But there, as in the Connolly case, the illegality of the -- of the plaintiff was no part of the illegality of the contract upon which the suit was brought.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="898.095" stopTime="929.409">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But would the fact that in the Continental case, the complaint alleged that he was compelled to buy at these high fixed prices that they were excessive but if he hadn't -- hadn't paid this price, he wouldn't have received any wall paper at all, is that -- on the fact that those elements are not here, is that any reason to distinguish the two cases?
speaker="joseph_w_louisell" startTime="929.409" stopTime="1240.116">
    Mr. Joseph W. Louisell 
    I don't think that that is the true rationale or the basis of the decision in the Continental case. 
    I think that the true basis while that is referred to and that was a factor there present in the Continental case, it appears to us that the true rationale of the Continental case is really but a restatement of the old proposition that the courts will not enforce a contract as to which the parties are in pari delicto and the contract is illegal. 
    And that the Court will leave the parties where they found them and will not enforce it. 
    I think that that is the true rationale of the Continental case. 
    And I -- I think that we find support for that proposition by reference to the next pronouncement of this Court in 1925 in the Small against Lamborn decision where the Court there expressly approved the tryst proposition stated in the -- restating the Connolly case that the courts will not enforce a contract that is illegal as violative of the Sherman Act where the suit is brought upon that contract but held in the -- in Small against Lamborn that the -- the rule of the Continental case was inapplicable for the reason that there again, as in Wilder and as in Connolly, the illegality did not inhere in the contract upon which the suit was brought but was antecedent to and wholly unrelated to the contract of purchase upon which the suit was brought. 
    And in 1942, this Court again had occasion to review the question, and that was in Sola Electric against Jefferson. 
    That case, like this one, arose from the Seventh Circuit. 
    And Mr. Chief Justice Stone speaking for the unanimous court ruled in this situation that the defense of illegality inherent in the contract by virtue of it being violative of the Sherman Act was a perfectly proper defense. 
    And it arose in this way, the petitioner in the Sola Electric Company case there asserted that by reason of the price control provisions of its licensing arrangement with the Jefferson Manufacturing Company, that the Jefferson Manufacturing Company was not entitled to royalties. 
    It being there, the Sola Electric Company's further claim that this arrangement, this contract was without the immunity from the Sherman Act supported -- available otherwise by a valid patent. 
    In other words, had there been a valid patent, the immunity from the application of the Sherman Act would have been enforced and this question could not have arisen. 
    But the Sola Electric Company took the position that the patent was not a valid patent and hence a price fixing arrangement contained in the licensing contract was illegal as violative of the Sherman Act and that they should have been allowed to show as they asked by their affirmative pleadings in the suit to -- in the suit to recover royalties that the contract upon which the suit was brought was as to that aspect of it, violative of the Sherman Act. 
    And in reversing the Seventh Circuit and speaking for the unanimous court, Mr. Chief Justice Stone said, “Similarly, this Court has declared that anyone sued upon a contract may set up as a defense that it is in violation of the Sherman Act. 
    And it has proceeded on the assumption that whether the parties to an agreement in violation of the Act are in pari delicto as a question of federal not state law.” 
    It decided the Continental Wall Paper Company -- it decided in Continental Wall Paper Company that a vendee of goods purchased from an illegal combination in pursuance of an illegal agreement both in violation of the Sherman Act can cleave the illegality in defense to a suit for the recovery of the purchase price. 
    This decision went much farther than is necessary to go here to conclude that petitioner may assert the illegality of the price fixing agreement and may offer any competent evidence to establish its illegality including proof of the invalidity of the patent. 
    Now, that was in 1942.

    -- score, I respectfully direct your -- your attention to the allegations in the answer contained on page 11 and then again under the caption “affirmative defense” on pages 13, 14 and 15 and perhaps most specifically, I would respectfully direct your attention, Mr. Justice Stewart, to paragraph 5 of page 15 where after reciting now what had transpired between these parties, we allege that the avowed in the express object of the agreement was to manipulate the market prices of onions and to stabilize said prices and if possible increase that prices. 
    Now, it is true that the Seventh Circuit considered that in -- a conclusory allegation but that taken in connection with that which we -- which precedes where we spell out the agreement in what was done without pleading the facts and pleading the conversations between the parties, we respectfully submit, is an allegation of fact which we had a right to prove. 
    In 1942 or perhaps it was a few years later than that, 1947 it must have been, there was another case before this Court and another case upon which the Seventh Circuit in the District Court as well as the respondent extensively rely and that's the Bruce's Juices case. 
    And I must say a word about that case. 
    There, a suit was brought by the manufacturer of cans sold to Bruce's Juices, a -- an organization engaged in the -- apparently, the canning of the fruit juices of some kind. 
    The suit was actually upon notes given by Bruce's Juices which represented the balances owing upon an open account to the manufacturer of the cans. 
    And the -- the customer, the purchaser there sought to avoid liability on those notes by asserting that the sales to it had been made in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act in that there had been price discriminations by the vendor denounced by the Robinson-Patman Act.

    Mr. Joseph W. Louisell 
    Against the defendant that the discounts that had been made available to competitors of the defendant's had exceeded those which had been made available to the defendant, Bruce's Juices. 
    By 5-to-4 decision, this Court held, speaking through Mr. Justice Jackson, that you would not read into the Robinson-Patman Act the non-collectibility right of a defendant's sued for the purchase price of a commodity sold even though it were sold in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. 
    But Mr. Justice Jackson was very careful to point out in that decision that the rule with respect to the right of a purchaser to defend in an action to recover the purchase price is wholly different under the Robinson-Patman Act than it is under the Sherman Act. 
    And Mr. Justice Jackson very carefully pointed that out. 
    Four of the then Justices of the Court wanted to read into the Robinson-Patman Act the non-collectibility as an aspect of the -- implied by the Robinson-Patman Act. 
    But the majority of the Court decided otherwise. 
    But in any event, it was there clearly distinguished that Bruce's Juices stood strictly on a question of interpretation of the Robinson-Patman Act and not upon a construction or an interpretation of Sections 1 to 7 of the Sherman Act.

    Mr. Joseph W. Louisell 
    But whether they were a victim in the Bruce's Juices case, I don't know if it was entirely clear from that -- from the opinion of the Court in any event that they did buy them. 
    There were other factors in the situation. 
    The Court, I recall, pointed out that it would be extremely difficult if not mechanically impossible to associate with which sales there had been a price differential and that the mechanics of it were such that it would work a very great difficulty in effecting and understanding. 
    And in any event, they also pointed out as Your Honor will recall that there were remedies available that the -- that the Congress had enacted remedies available to Bruce's Juices under the Robinson-Patman Act whereby they could recover whatever loss they might have sustained by virtue of their having done business with the vendor. 
    And by that, of course, is not an analogous situation here because here, all of these parties were in pari delicto. 
    One of the aspects of the case that has been argued extensively in the briefs and relied upon by the Seventh Circuit and by the District Court is the so-called “severability” of the obligation here alleged by the plaintiff for the defendant to pay for these onions. 
    That obligation being severable from the entire undertaking and understanding between the parties and I think that we can -- we can go back to the pronouncement of this Court in McMullen against Hoffman for a very early and exhaustive discussion of what is severable and what is not severable in a contract of this kind. 
    Reading the McMullen against Hoffman case stands for two propositions. 
    It stands for the -- the common law proposition now applicable in a situation of this kind, we feel, by virtue of the enactment of the Sherman Act that the courts will not enforce as between wrongdoers and we frankly stand before you and say we were wrongdoers, all of them were wrongdoers.

    And as was stated in that -- in that case, a plaintiff can't pick and choose the portions of the contract upon which you will die in seeking to recover where the defendant has it within his power and he alleges what the entire overall transaction was then the right of the plaintiff to recover is to be determined what all of the contract was and not by some facet, some integral but nonetheless a facet of the overall undertaking. 
    With the Court's permission, I would reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    -- what certain factual matters clearly in the Court's mind. 
    Counsel -- at first I thought by inadvertence but after repeated reference finds -- I find (Inaudible) favor of this record. 
    One of the important points here is that a sale of onions was made, 50 cars, to this particular defendant and a condition was imposed of non-delivery but counsel recites that condition as an agreement by both sides not to deliver those onions on the futures market or on the cash market. 
    He seeks to create the impression here that these onions, all of them, were to be completely withheld from the market. 
    Actually, if I were to be spared a -- what does he -- what has to do with them? 
    Should the onions rot or should we eat them? 
    But actually that isn't, that isn't the issue as he has presented it in his answer.

speaker="lee_a_freeman_jr" startTime="1923.171" stopTime="2304.553">
    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    -- the record of the contract contains no reference to this non-delivery condition but in his affirmative defense and in his answer. 
    And I read for any -- there is no doubt about it that the only condition that was imposed. 
    And he says so on page 11 that the plaintiff and his associate, and I read from the third paragraph, bottom of it, would not make any deliveries on the futures market for the balance of the trading season. 
    And so he goes on page 14 on the bottom of the page, the last two lines that the plaintiff would not deliver any onions on the futures market for the balance of the trading season. 
    Let me see if I can give some enlightenment to that particular condition. 
    The futures market is distinct from the cash onion market. 
    This transaction, in our opinion, was entirely a transaction for the purchase and sale of cash onions. 
    People trade on the futures market in Chicago and elsewhere and they buy and sell futures contracts which contain the requirement on the part of the purchaser to accept delivery if its made to them in the futures market and on the part of the seller to make delivery on the contract month. 
    Actually, deliveries are very rare. 
    The transactions wring themselves out. 
    And we had cited a study made by the Commodities Exchange Authority that over the last 10 years, there was a very small percentage of the total contracts that were settled by delivery. 
    That's the only condition that we concede existed as a part of this sale -- purchased and sale transaction. 
    Secondly, this was not a price fixing agreement and there is no basis upon which counsel can so say. 
    The allegations in his -- in his affirmative answer -- as -- answer an affirmative defense conflict with the fact that a price fixing agreement was here. 
    There is no per se violation here. 
    The motion to strike that was heard by the District Court was heard on the basis of the facts conceded as they were alleged. 
    And the District Court held not only that this defense was not available in a -- in a suit on a contract but also that the claim of illegality was erroneous, that the condition of non-delivery was a reasonable restraint imposed by a purchaser of goods in order to protect his purchasers. 
    And there are many examples that we can cite. 
    You buy a business and agreed not to compete for five years. 
    Of course, it's a restraint. 
    But it's considered a reasonable part of doing business. 
    And this is what the District Court held. 
    And mind you, while I am now arguing the question of whether or not this condition was illegal, I intended to say to this Court that I would not argue it that it isn't before the Court that counsel asks you to assume that it's illegal. 
    And on that basis, determine that the defense was available. 
    But the District Court has already said that it was not illegal. 
    The Court of Appeals infers, they say, “We will not pass upon it but we have our doubts,” the Court of Appeals infers that it was not illegal and counsel has not briefed or argued that point in this Court. 
    Let me make another correction of the record. 
    You were -- one of the Justices asked counsel whether or not all the buyers were notified and all of them repudiated. 
    This is not in the record but it's not important that it is not. 
    Actually, many of the buyers did fulfill their contract. 
    And possibly, this is beyond counsel's knowledge because all of the people who repudiated this contract were counsel's clients. 
    And the repudiation came on March 9th as the pleadings established. 
    And Mr. Kelly's partner and co-owner of a business filed an affidavit in this proceeding which was considered by the District Court in support of the motions that were presented. 
    And in that affidavit, Mr. Kelly's partner says in March 1956, the time of the repudiation, in March 1956, the prices for cash onions stored in Chicago dropped substantially and difficulties were encountered in the merchandising of such onions due to the arrival in Chicago of fresh Texas onions. 
    This is a market phenomenon. 
    And if you will read counsel's answer, you will find that on March 9th when they repudiated the contract, they, for the first time, raised the question not only a violation of the antitrust laws but violation of a multitude of other statutes which they have now abandoned. 
    Some reference was made by Justice Stewart to the counterclaim, and I think that Justice Douglas took it up, on the misconception that the counterclaim was in effect, damages arising out of this illegal condition that it was in the nature of a travel damage counterclaim, not so. 
    The counterclaim was based on the allegation that we've reached this non-delivery condition that the plaintiff's had agreed not to deliver in the futures market during the futures trading season and that we've reached this agreement and therefore, they suffered damages. 
    This counterclaim was not doubt by the District Court and sustained by the Court of Appeals, and they have abandoned it here. 
    But they have never asked for damages on a travel damage basis or by reason of having been violated of -- injured because of a violation of the antitrust laws. 
    They can't show any such damages, and they haven't.

    They claimed that they were part of the withholding of onions from the cash market when it isn't so. 
    Incidentally, and I should have mentioned this and emphasized it, this record shows that the parties agreed that they would merchandise their onions all of them purchased, sold or held in normal and regulatory channels. 
    Chicago market was to be -- was to be used as well as other markets for the -- for the disposition of these onions. 
    This is here in this record.

    But surely, people can reach agreements to manipulate futures market as well as the cash market. 
    But in this instance, we have a business transaction, a sale of cash onions and coupled with it a condition that we will not deliver in the futures market and there is a reason, and I must frankly say that when there is a substantial delivery in the futures market, it might have temporarily -- it might temporarily disrupt prices and so the sellers were seeking to protect against the disruption of such prices during their normal merchandise.

    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    Yes. 
    That's right, many, many years ago. 
    Assuming that this condition is illegal and we respectfully submitted to the Court in our first point the -- the fact that possibly, this case isn't properly here because there is an abstract and hypothetical question involved. 
    But assuming that it is illegal, we contend that the -- this type of defense is not available in a contract action. 
    And we say first, and I think I would like to emphasize this that here, there is no doubt that the attempt that is being made by the petitioners is an attempt at unjust enrichment. 
    They got the goods and they don't want to pay for it to the extent of $37,000. 
    There is no case, no case that this Court has decided where unjust enrichment resulted from either the grant or a denial of an antitrust violation in the contract action where the Court has denied the defense in Connelly, Wilder, Small versus Lamborn and Bruce's Juices, of course, there was no unjust enrichment to the defendant. 
    Where the Court has granted the defense such as they did in Continental Wall Paper, still no unjust enrichment because the Court itself points out that the allegations in the complaint were and weren't -- and they were admitted that the amount sued for, the amount sued for exceeded the value -- exceeded -- well, it's the -- that the amount for which suit was bought was greatly an excess of the excess in value over market value. 
    I haven't made that clear. 
    But in Connelly, the amount involved in that suit was excessive over the fair market value. 
    And so in -- in -- I mean in Continental, so that by granting the defense and denying a remedy, there was still no unjust enrichment because the defendant had already paid more than the fair value of the goods that he had bought in for. 
    In this instance, it is admitted that the price was the fair market price.

    The price is fixed by such combination -- combination and the price is therein sought to be recovered for said merchandise are unreasonable, excessive and above the fair market price of such merchandise by more than the amounts so sought to be recovered. 
    Let me proceed on with my statement that in no instance was unjust enrichment granted. 
    In the Bruce's Juices cases, this Court was divided 5-to-4. 
    The majority held that the defense of antitrust violation, Robinson-Patman in that instance, was not available. 
    The statute didn't provide for it. 
    There were reasons of equity and policy for not permitting it. 
    And so, there was no unjust enrichment. 
    The minority, however, a minority of four agreed that if the defense of illegality were to be permitted, still, the plaintiff should be entitled to a recover on a quantum meruit or quantum valebant for the value of the goods that was sold. 
    And so we find in Bruce's Juices, which is the latest case that this Court has decided in this field, that all nine justices agreed that there should be no unjust enrichment and that the plaintiff should recover the fair value of his goods. 
    And here, it is conceded that the price at which we sold these onions was the fair value of those onions at the time of the sale. 
    We suggest that this doctrine of distinguishing the cases on the ground that in -- that an innocent participant or a guilty -- an innocent stranger or a guilty participant is involved is not a valid distinction. 
    As a matter of fact, it -- it sounds peculiar. 
    How can you say that if a man is a guilty participant and certainly Mr. Louisell has tried to bring himself in as strongly as possible, he should be relieved from paying the balance, but if he was an innocent stranger, oh, then we've got to make him pay. 
    This is -- apparently some courts have indicated that this is the distinction between Connelly versus Continental, and it doesn't sit right. 
    Neither can we say that -- saying that a contract is inherently invalid or has a collateral invalidity answers anything. 
    It's still a label. 
    And if you'll look at all of the cases that the Court has decided in this field, I think you are impressed with the fact that the true standard and the one that we ask that this Court announced in this instance is that if the judgment of the Court will aid or further the illegal purpose, if the judgment of the Court will assist the plaintiff in accomplishing an unlawful end, then the defense should be made available, then the remedy should be denied.

    Excuse me for not having mentioned that -- that the majority in Bruce's Juices felt that quantum meruit was not to be had, the minority did. 
    But the majority agreed that the defense of illegality did not lie and therefore, the remedy was permitted for the full amount of the contract. 
    And mind you, in Bruce's Juices, the claim was made that the amount sued for, represented the discriminatory component. 
    In other words, represented the excess over what was reasonable for these cans, represented an amount that was excessive and therefore to the extent to which the Court granted a judgment there or permitted the remedy, it really furthered the conspiracy or the illegality to that extent.

    According to the majority footnote, according to the majority footnote, yes. 
    But of course, we accept the majority ruling in Bruce's Juices because the result of it is that the defense is not made available. 
    That we -- we may have our remedy on the contract and the claim of illegality under the Antitrust Act does not lie. 
    And this Court has reiterated that in recent -- in -- in last year that the sanctions provided under the antitrust laws are exclusive, and if Congress wanted to add to the sanctions, the right of a defendant to claim illegality in a contract action, Congress could do so. 
    Congress had that opportunity over the years, bills were introduced and we set forth some of this legislative history indicating that Congress did not conceive that it was appropriate to the enforcement of the antitrust laws that on a simple contract or debt action, the defendant should be permitted to complicate the action or to raise the problem of an antitrust violation. 
    If he has an antitrust violation, let him bring an action and show his damages.

    I think the opinion is ambiguous in that respect. 
    I -- I believe -- I mean, at least it's my interpretation of that opinion that the two conditions that were included in that contract of purchase of glucose which the Court commented on, one was that the purchaser must exclusively buy all of his glucose from these people in order to receive a rebate and the other that he -- that he could not resell such commodities, such glucose. 
    I -- I believe that the Court was in effect saying that these two conditions would not suffer a defeat of the remedy rather than to hold that it was not an illegality.

    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    It wasn't in and of itself price fixing. 
    And in answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the example would be that if we sought, by action, to enforce the non-delivery condition and we have assumed for the purpose of this argument that it is illegal and is price fixing and so on that if we had a -- if we sought by action to enforce the non-delivery condition, then a judgment of the Court enforcing that non-delivery condition would be directly aiding the illegal purpose. 
    But here, we aren't. 
    Here, our one guide in determining whether or not we are proceeding on the basis of legal right with an illegal practice is -- is our pleadings. 
    Maybe it's not an exact guide but we have made a simple -- we -- we presented a simple complaint for goods and services rendered, for prices that are agreed upon. 
    There's no problem about all of the terms and conditions of that purchase and sale. 
    And as they said in -- in Wilder, the -- the sale of the goods was matched by consideration to pay for the goods. 
    These outside conditions were supplementary to it. 
    There was also the -- the condition that both sides said they would not --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes. 
    But the contract may negative your pleading.
speaker="lee_a_freeman_jr" startTime="3740.888" stopTime="3948.951">
    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    Or look at the contract. 
    I'm willing to concede this much that even though our complaint is not referred to the illegal factors as the defense properly raises these -- these illegal factors and the Court's judgment would necessarily and directly advance the purpose, the defense is available. 
    I would also say, and possibly I shouldn't go this far, but I would also say if the written instrument does not contain the illegal agreement but there was some oral understanding that could be properly established, then that too might be available but we don't have that yet. 
    We say that only -- I would like to make some reference to the patent cases and I mean, I'm -- I'm rather disturbed by the fact that counsel has cited three or four cases that he regards as principal in his advocacy that are not cited in the brief and we have not had an opportunity to reason but actually there, the old cases of Beeman and McMullen. 
    But he also cites the Sola Electric case which is a patent case and this I would like to comment upon and not only in connection with the Sola case but with the Court's permission with the Keplinger case which followed that in which I think is an even stronger authority for him if we were to cite it. 
    In these patent cases, these patent cases, we contend, have no relevancy here. 
    They're not in the briefs, and they shouldn't be in the briefs, and they should not been mentioned in the argument. 
    The patent cases -- the patent cases involved the field of estoppel of patentees. 
    Actually, the question was the validity of the patent and by raising the validity of the patent, you actually were -- were determining whether or not there was a failure of consideration. 
    The illegality of the price fixing agreement which might have accompanied the patent agreement was a secondary consideration by this Court. 
    Furthermore, in all of those patent cases, there is no unjust enrichment. 
    And we contend strongly that this Court should give voice to an important public policy of fairness and honesty in dealings that defendants shouldn't have the opportunity of welching and receiving unjust enrichment. 
    In the patent cases, we contend that there could be no unjust enrichment because the royalties that were denied in the Kiplinger case, not in the Sola, but the royalties that were denied in the Kiplinger case were denied because the patent was invalid. 
    There was no consideration for which to pay royalties. 
    There was an absence of privilege that was being realized by the licensing agreement. 
    Also, I might add that in the patent cases, it was recognized by this Court that there was great difficulty in securing determination of the validity of patents. 
    And we were dealing here in -- in an area where the public policy surrounding the restraints of trade that the Antitrust Act sought to eliminate had to be given voice to and -- and as Justice Black said in -- in the Kiplinger case, “We are seeking by allowing this estoppel to be brushed aside when an antitrust violation is urged upon us. 
    We are seeking to free our economy from the destructive restraints that are sometimes practiced by narrow and invalid patents.” 
    But we don't have that here. 
    Thank you very much.

    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    Oh, I don't know but onions went down possibly as much as 50 cents by then, a bag. 
    And of course, then we do have this affidavit that in March 1956, which is shortly thereafter, this exchange of communication between Mr. Kelly and Mr. Kosuga in which the agreement is acknowledged, in March 1956, the onion market collapsed very substantially because Texas onions were being brought in and they were a fresh crop and they were an excessive crop and they had difficulties merchandising. 
    So on March 9th, Mr. Louisell sent a letter to my client in which he said, “I represent these people and we're repudiating our contract because it's a violation of the antitrust law.”

    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    -- other thing which I think possibly bears. 
    The only excuse that can be or the only reason that can be stated for allowing this type of a defense to be raised in a contract action is that it would give effectiveness to the antitrust laws. 
    We respectfully feel that it would not, that all it would do would be to discourage credit. 
    It would be an unreasonable and discriminatory type of relief because the -- the penalty imposed here would be completely out of line with -- with the -- whatever offense was involved. 
    And for several of the reasons that are set forth in Bruce's Juices in which we seek to analyze in our complaint, we feel, in our brief, we feel that no advantage could be realized as far as effectuating the purpose of the Act and as a matter of fact, it would not deter violations. 
    Indeed, the buyers on credit would encourage transactions which might shade legality in order to lay or to be able to repudiate. 
    There is no sure way of knowing where you don't have a per se violation, whether you're in violation of the antitrust laws. 
    And in this particular instance, the facts prove themselves, they didn't even know about it until March 1956 that there might be a violation of the antitrust laws and then I think they only knew because the price failed them.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4160.482" stopTime="4180.968">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, Mr. Freeman, if as alleged in the affirmative defense, the purpose of this very agreement was to fix prices, why would it not encourage a violation of the Antitrust Acts by enforcing this very agreement?
speaker="lee_a_freeman_jr" startTime="4180.968" stopTime="4186.747">
    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    Well, number one, I can't agree that the purpose was to fix prices.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4186.747" stopTime="4186.809">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I understand that.
speaker="lee_a_freeman_jr" startTime="4186.809" stopTime="4256.426">
    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    You would -- you would ask Mr. Louisell about the pleadings and I -- I would have something to say about that. 
    Actually, the pleadings can't be read as he does. 
    You can either read that expression he avowed the expressed purpose as meaning that there was an agreement to fix -- to a non-delivery agreement which had a purpose. 
    Now, that would be a conclusion. 
    All you can read it to mean that there was an agreement and they also agreed that they would fix prices. 
    But if that was the case, he could have pleaded a lot better. 
    It was a conclusion in the Court so held. 
    But assuming that this was a price fixing agreement, you do not effectuate the purpose of the antitrust laws by denying remedies which are discriminatory and irrational. 
    You effectuate it by -- Congress has by broadening the enforcement machinery, the troubled damage action which is -- which was made available, as a matter of fact, subsequent to some of the decisions of this Court, subsequent to the Wilder case. 
    Private trouble damage actions were made available. 
    This then has a relationship -- I mean, the troubled damage actions has a relationship to the injury, it has a reason. 
    It doesn't merely discourage credit but it discourages the transaction.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4256.426" stopTime="4257.914">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, if I may interrupt a minute --
speaker="lee_a_freeman_jr" startTime="4257.914" stopTime="4257.970">
    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4257.970" stopTime="4288.471">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- of course the troubled damage action is available to somebody who's been victimized by an antitrust violation, somebody who has been damaged by the violation of the antitrust laws. 
    Here, the theory is quite different. 
    The plaintiff and the defendant here are coconspirators, conspiring together to damage the public by fixing prices. 
    Now, why would not a court called upon to enforce that very agreement be encouraging a violation, directly encouraging a violation of the antitrust laws?
speaker="lee_a_freeman_jr" startTime="4288.471" stopTime="4362.643">
    Mr. Lee A. Freeman 
    If the Court were being called upon to directly enforce an agreement which had -- which furthered in a legal purpose, I would agree. 
    But all the Court is being asked here is to affirm a judgment for goods delivered. 
    We -- this judgment would have no relationship. 
    It does not do anything toward furthering the -- the non-delivery condition. 
    In the Bruce's Juices case, for example, the Court permitted a judgment to stand which it was conceded, contained a discriminatory amount, an excessive amount over and above a fair value. 
    So that to that extent, there was a furthering of the illegal purposes but it was considered too remote. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter was right. 
    I think the -- the -- before this defense is permitted, and this is a shocking thing in -- in commercial channels, I mean, this could be very disruptive of business because every business transaction, it would seem to me, has some terms and conditions which might be distorted and later resurrected to say, “Oh, this is a restraint of trade.” 
    You've got to have something more positive, more definite, more direct than you have here.

    The penalty has no relationship to the damage that's incurred. 
    The -- the small buyer, the small buyer who needs credit in order to live will be discriminated against. 
    He will not be able to realize this credit if this is true because if there is somebody -- some seller who wants to perpetrate a restraint, some -- some form of business that restrictive, he will do it on a cash basis. 
    So it discriminates to that extent. 
    It discriminates from the standpoint of not making credit available to those who really need it and it discriminates because the penalty itself is far out of reason in some instances and could be nothing.

    And the fact of the matter is that the futures onion market largely, as a matter of economics, controls the cash market price of onions. 
    And hence, a disposition to withdraw and an agreement when a combination in a conspiracy to withdraw and not to deliver a thousand carloads on the futures market would have, as is alleged by the defendant, a ruinous and catastrophic effect on the cash market. 
    And that was alleged by the defendant as shown on the record in page 14.

    Mr. Joseph W. Louisell 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    And as a matter of economics, it necessarily follows that such is a fact that -- that to take 100 carloads or not a hundred, a thousand -- a hundred would even do it, but to take a thousand carloads of onions and deliver those on the futures market in satisfaction of outstanding contracts at that time would immediately reverberate into the cash market instantaneously. 
    And the price of onions on both the futures and on the cash market would, of course, go down that trajectory.

    The agreement was that they would do what was necessary to manipulate, stabilize the price of onions on the cash and futures market. 
    One of the instruments, the instrumentalities by which they sought, they chose and agreed upon to exercise to accomplish that illegal purpose was to withhold from the futures market the delivery of some 1000 carloads of onions.

    Mr. Joseph W. Louisell 
    We come to Grips -- the security with that, and may I say this in answer to a question which has been post here. 
    Would you be (Inaudible), were you to reverse this and send it back where the issue would be tried on its merits as to whether this contract was, as the petitioner here claims it was, an illegal combination in restraint of trade? 
    Would you, by so doing, be enhancing or approving or adapting the policy which is always been the policy of the courts not to enforce an illegal contract? 
    And I answer that by referring to the language in the Continental Wall Paper Company case wherein it is there pointed out that if the plaintiff had been allowed to recover in the Continental Wall Paper case, the Court would have been giving a judgment for a sum which was made up in execution of the agreement out of which came the illegal combination. 
    And if this judgment stands, the same result follows. 
    This Court then would be allowing a judgment to stand for a sum of money which is made up in execution of the agreement out of which came the allegedly illegal combination. 
    Now, the nexus of the entire problem, I think as it -- it was briefed and as it was intended to be presented to this Court is simply this, whether or not the purchaser of a commodity may rely upon the illegality of the contract, illegal because of the Sherman Act as the defense. 
    And for that proposition, we say this Court has never deviated from the rule that such is permissible as stated in the Continental Wall Paper Company case that that is the rule and that it should have been applied here and that the Seventh Circuit and the District Court were in error when they said that this Court had washed down, if I may use that expression, or weakened the policy as stated by this Court in the Continental case. 
    We respectfully submit that that is not the fact.
