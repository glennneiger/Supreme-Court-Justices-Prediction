TIME Incorporated v. United States

    Mr. Bryce Rea, Jr. 
    -- are substantively identical in their treatment of the problem of rate regulation. 
    They adopted what was then and is now, the vogue in rate regulation. 
    That is the filed rate theory. 
    The seller of the service fixes a rate, files it with the Commission, it becomes effective, the Commission's control is a legislative control to alter it for the future, either on complaint or on its own motion, that's all spelled out by this Court very recently in the Mobile case and again to some extent in the Memphis case.

    In this respect Part II differs in Part I of these (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="bryce_rea_jr" startTime="43.388" stopTime="666.494">
    Mr. Bryce Rea, Jr. 
    In this respect, Part II differs from Part I and that brings me, Mr. Justice Harlan, to the root of the holding of the court below. 
    The court first said Montana-Dakota doesn't apply here, because all the Montana-Dakota case held was that a complaint to a federal District Court that a rate charged by a regulated power company was unreasonable in the past, states no cause of action under the Federal Power Act, therefore, said the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court dismissed the complaint there being no diversity of citizenship between the parties. 
    We submit that the Court's holding is far broader than that. 
    It did not, we submit, take this case to determine whether or not, or to delimit rather, federal jurisdiction in the sense of delimiting the jurisdiction of District Courts, since your course -- or courts have limited jurisdiction. 
    The holding is squarely this, as we see it. 
    The right to a reasonable rate is the right to the rate that's filed and effective with the Commission. 
    No court can authorize any other rate, so no court can entertain a cause of action claiming a right to another rate. 
    The Commission cannot authorize any other rate as a judicial matter respecting any period in the past. 
    The Commission's authority is the legislative authority to fix rates for the future. 
    Therefore, to hold that a cause of action existed, would be to say that the Court can entertain a cause of action in which it can decide no issue, then the Commission can entertain a complaint which the statute does not permit it to entertain namely, a complaint directed to the past rates, then the Commission can make a finding and then the Court can go ahead and render a judgment. 
    In other words, it would be saying, we submit, to read the Montana case as the court below read it that the absence of power in the courts, coupled with the absence of power in the Commission, can somehow create power in both of them together. 
    The Government's argument and shippers arguments generally, they go into the Court, they file their suit and the Court said, "We can't determine what's an unreasonable rate." 
    The shipper then runs over to the Interstate Commerce Commission and files a complaint alleging that this rate was unreasonable in the past. 
    Of course, there's no authority in the Commission's act authorizing it to make adjudications as to the past, but the shipper says, "Oh, the Court has a cause of action pending." 
    You therefore, as a collaborative instrument of justice, to use Justice Frankfurter's phrase in the Montana-Dakota case, can rend, make a finding. 
    Well, as the majority held and as Justice Frankfurter speaking for the majority -- speaking for the minority agreed, where you have properly filed rates, no allegation of fraudulent filing, such as was present in Montana-Dakota and is not present here, the whole theory of rate regulation is premised on the proposition that errors in rates, unreasonable rates, will be corrected by prospective action by the Commission in the proscription of other rates for the future. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals and respondent here, then go over and argue after all, there is a cause of action against a rail carrier which codifies the rail --- the shipper's common-law right to a reasonable rate. 
    There must be also such a right against the common carrier by motor and they make two arguments. 
    They say first, the declaration in the Act, that rates shall be just and reasonable, creates a right, creates a cause of action in a shipper. 
    They admit that the Act provides no method for its enforcement, but they say we can improvise the method namely, suit by the shipper in a common-law court or in a -- in a common-law court followed by reference of the issue of reasonableness to the Commission. 
    But we submit that Part I, regulating rail carriers and its specific provisions go far toward negativing any intention on the part of the Congress to create similar rights under Part II in regulating motor carriers. 
    Part I, to begin with, Section 8, specifically says that "Anybody damaged by anything done by a rail carrier in violation of the Act, shall have redress in damages." 
    Section 9 provides that the shipper may either complain to the Commission pursuant to the complaint section which is 13 (1) or may sue in a federal District Court. 
    Section 13 provides for the filing of complaints. 
    Section 16 provides for the issuance of orders by the Commission determining the amount of damages any person has suffered by a railroad's violation of the Act and the issuance of an order to compel payment. 
    Section 16 (2), provides that if the railroad fails to obey the Commission's order and make payment within the time specified in the order, the shipper may file suit in the District Court and plead the order of the Commission as the gravamen of his complaint. 
    Section 16 (4), provides a statute of limitations within which the shipper must bring his complaint for damages for the exaction of an unreasonable rate in the past. 
    None of those provisions are found in Part II of the Act relating to motor carriers, not a single comparable provision. 
    The only reference to any private redress for alleged violations of the Act in Part II, is the provision that suits for overcharges to recover overcharges, which are defined to exclude charges based on applicable rates and properly computed. 
    It must be brought within two years. 
    There is no provision, whatever, for any private redress. 
    The redress for violations of the Act is carefully limited to actions by the Commission to compel enforcement. 
    That is Section 222 (b). 
    And interestingly enough, the Supreme Court of Oregon, which considered this question of the right of private redress for alleged violations of the Act very recently, the case is discussed at length in our reply brief, which was filed today. 
    That's Consolidated Freightways versus United Truck Lines cited by the Supreme Court of Oregon this past October and recorded in 330 P.2d 522. 
    In that case, the Supreme Court of Oregon examined the legislative history of the Act at great length. 
    And it pointed out that the original proposed act did provide that in the event of a violation of any of the provisions, any person injured or the Commission had a cause of action to enforce the Act. 
    When the Act was enacted in the following year, that provision for private redress by individuals, persons injured was stricken and the Supreme Court of Oregon goes on to discuss the thinking of the Congress that they were taking under regulation, some 10,000 motor carriers in a completely chaotic state in 1935, when the whole problem, as the Government says in its brief, was to raise their rates from the -- on economic levels at which they've understood. 
    That facing for the first time as Mr. Eastman who was then Coordinator of Transportation, testified about the bill. 
    The Commission was faced with some terrific regulatory problems. 
    So that it was quite logical and sensible that they confined redress for alleged violations of the Act to the Commission, so that the development of the regulation of motor carriers, which was being taken over then for the first time, would proceed in an orderly way. 
    Certainly, the Congress as the Government said had the background of Part I, dealing with rail carriers before it, at the time it enacted Part II in 1935. 
    If it had intended to give shippers by motor carriers, the same rights to damages that it had earlier given shippers by railroad, it's inconceivable that it would have conferred that cause of action by the simple declaration that unjust rates are unlawful, unjust and unreasonable rates are unlawful, when it had before it and at the very time it amend, it past the Motor Carrier Act, amended Part I, it had before it all of those elaborate provisions for damages against rail carriers.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do outline in Part I correspond in all its essential respects with the provision of the Federal Power Act?
speaker="bryce_rea_jr" startTime="673.441" stopTime="1173.168">
    Mr. Bryce Rea, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The scheme in Part I corresponds with the scheme in Part III. 
    Part I, of course, is the early act beginning in 1887, dealing with railroads. 
    In 1935, the Congress passed the Federal Power Act and it passed the Motor Carrier Act. 
    Those two are identical in their substantive provisions. 
    The scheme is the same that provisions are, in many respects, so far as it's possible for them to be word for word. 
    In 1940, the Commission brought -- I beg your pardon, the Congress brought under regulation the water carriers, common carriers by water, and interestingly enough, 18 -- the old act of Part I begun in 1887, makes elaborate provisions for reparations by shippers charged unreasonable rates. 
    1935, the Congress passes the Federal Power Act and the Motor Carrier Act neither contain any provisions for reparations both limit the Commission to this legislative function of fixing rates for the future. 
    In 1940, five years later, the Congress enacted Part III of the Act bringing common carriers by water, certain of them, within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    It went back to the scheme of Part I and Part III, enacted in 1940, contains precisely the elaborate provisions for reparations that are contained in Part I. 
    I'd like to make this point to the Court of Appeals, spoke in terms of the right they thought existed from the declaration that rates be -- must --- must be just and reasonable, which as this Court held in the Montana cases, a criterion for administrative action. 
    It's a standard by which rates are regulated. 
    It is not the creation of a justiciable right. 
    But they also went on to say that after all, at common-law, there was a right to a reasonable rate enforceable as to the past in a common-law court. 
    We submit, and we think we demonstrated in our brief, that there could not have been a common-law right to a reasonable rate for the interstate movement of goods because there is no federal common-law. 
    The recognition of such a right would mean that a state court, under state law, would determine the reasonableness of rates for interstate transportation. 
    And certainly, it's been held as from the Wabash case, forward that there is no state authority who'll regulate rates and the existence of a common-law right which requires state action for the implementation -- for the determination of the reasonable rate, in our view, would be to give the states power that they don't have under the Constitution, namely, the right to fix rates for interstate commerce. 
    The Government's principal reliance, in its brief, is on this Court's recent decision in Western Pacific, the Western Pacific case -- Western Pacific versus the United States. 
    And I just like to make this distinction which we think is patent. 
    In the Western Pacific case, the General Accounting Office deducted alleging that particular rates on what the carriers classified as aerial bombs were not proper because the items transported were not bombs at all, they were napalm gel. 
    The carrier brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amounts deducted by the General Accounting Office. 
    The Government alleged that the rates were inapplicable and if in -- if applicable, unreasonable. 
    The Court of Claims disallowed the defense on the ground that it could not determine whether the rates were reasonable and that the statute of limitations in Section 16 of the Act which provides for the filing of complaints for damages with the Commission, had run, was applicable to the Government and barred the Commission from considering the matter of the reasonableness of the rates. 
    This Court reversed and remanded the case to the Court of Claims with directions to refer the issue to the Commission, but this Court's position was that in that case, there was no distinction in practicality between the allegation that the rates were inapplicable and the allegation that the rates were unreasonable. 
    It took the view that the Government's position was that the rates were inapplicable and that one reason the Government maintain that they were inapplicable is that --- that because their use would produce an unreasonable result. 
    Now, we think that all that case holds is that where a tariff is ambiguous, you can resort to parole evidence namely, you can examine the result of one construction as opposed to the result of another to ascertain its applicability. 
    But in any event, that case proceeded on the perfectly proper premise that a shipper did have, under Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act, a right to a reasonable rate even though different than the file and effective rate. 
    So there was no question whatever raised at any point, but that the Interstate Commerce Commission had fundamental jurisdiction bestowed on it by Part I to ascertain whether or not, that rate charged in that past period was reasonable and that the shipper had bestowed upon him by Part I, a right to recover damages if he had been charged an unreasonable rate, but to cite or to rely as the Government does on that case here, is to beg the question. 
    It is to assume the answer to the very question. 
    It is to assume that there is a justiciable legal right to some rate other than the filed and effective rate. 
    And that's the question before Your Honors. 
    Is there such a right? 
    We submit that there is not that the Interstate Commerce Act, Part II or the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, makes it perfectly clear that the Congress was adopting the scheme of the Federal Power Act, enacted in the same time and the Natural Gas Act, enacted three years later in 1938, which calls for the filing of rates and limits the rate regulatory authority of the Commission to the fixing of rates for the future on the assumption as Justice Frankfurter pointed out in the Montana case that if rates filed initially by the carrier in the exercise of his discretion turn are found to be unreasonable or are unreasonable, they will be quickly corrected by the proscription of new rates for the future. 
    I'd like to reserve what's time we have. 
   
   
   
   Argument of W. D. Benson, Jr.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1173.168" stopTime="1174.547">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Benson.
speaker="w_d_benson_jr" startTime="1174.547" stopTime="1362.078">
    Mr. W. D. Benson, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices, in the beginning let me say that our position with counsel for Davidson Transfer &amp; Storage is identical. 
    The facts are slightly different in the T. I. M. E. case with the Davidson case. 
    The T. I. M. E. case arose out of some shipments from Oklahoma City Tinker Air Force Base near in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to another air force base at Planehaven, California. 
    The tariff which prescribed rates for that movement was the Rocky Mountain Motor Freight Tariff. 
    And it named the rate from Planehaven or from Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma to Planehaven, California, at so many cents per hundred. 
    T. I. M. E. was a party to another tariff. 
    And maybe, I should explain to the Court, perhaps the Court knows more about the way these tariffs are made up than I do. 
    But in the early growth of the trucking industry, almost all carriers were small localized carriers. 
    And when it became necessary under the Motor Carrier Act for them to file tariffs, they joined together and formed these local associations. 
    It happens that my client now, operates from Los Angeles, California to Atlanta, Georgia and Cincinnati, Ohio. 
    In order to comply with all of those different local situations, it is now the member of 28 different tariff bureaus. 
    Among the other tariff bureaus that it was a member of, it was a member of the Southwestern Motor Freight Bureau, which names rates generally between Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, El Paso, Texas and some small part of Colorado. 
    It was also the member of another tariff bureau which is the Interstate Tariff Bureau which names right between California on the one hand, El Paso, Texas and certain other territories. 
    The Government's position in this case is not that this rate is too high because it calls for too much money, but the Government's contention is that this rate is too high because there is a rate from Tinker Air Force Base to El Paso, plus another rate on another tariff from El Paso, Texas to Planehaven, California. 
    And that the sum total of those two rates is less than this through rate named in the Rocky Mountain Tariff. 
    The position of the court below was that first, that they were entitled to the aggregate of intermediates. 
    And secondly, if the through rate was the applicable rate, then because it had exceeded the aggregate of intermediates that it was too high and unreasonable.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1362.078" stopTime="1367.969">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I'm just curious. 
    Is there some explanation why the through rate should be higher than the aggregate of the intermediate?
speaker="w_d_benson_jr" startTime="1367.969" stopTime="1556.177">
    Mr. W. D. Benson, Jr. 
    Judge, I have none except the southwest territory generally has depressed rates. 
    El Paso, Texas is a gateway to Mexico. 
    And freight has predominantly moved from the West through El Paso. 
    So carriers going into El Paso needed tonnage. 
    Carriers going from El Paso to California needed tonnage. 
    And that is the only explanation that I know, I've seen no factual figures on it. 
    But any event, they asked the court then to hold this judgment in abeyance, in other words, the local -- the District Judge have said. 
    Well, there is only one tariff, it's the Rocky Mountain Tariff and I must apply. 
    So then the Government said, "Well, if the Court please, will you hold this in abeyance now, that want to file a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission which is not provided for by law at all. 
    And we want to ascertain whether or not this rate is reasonable or unreasonable." 
    The District Court refused that idea and went to the Fifth Circuit and of course, the court below, following Western Pacific said that the case should be referred through the Interstate Commerce Commission for their decisions. 
    Now, the point I should like to make to this Court, if I may. 
    This case involves reparations. 
    Whether the Government -- in the T. I. M. E. case, they -- they'd simply paid the aggregate of intermediates and never get paid the through rate at all, and thus, to suit against the Government for the difference. 
    And that is what the lawsuit is about. 
    But the point I'd like to make to this Court is that this is a suit for reparation. 
    And what the Government is asking this Court to do is to say to a hundred thousand shippers that views our freight limits. 
    That in spite of the fact that you follow the administrative procedure and filed your tariff as prescribed below and in spite of the fact that there hasn't been any complaint filed, and in spite of the fact that the Commission itself has done nothing about it, that even after you have followed the administrative process that you as a shipper may ship within the period of limitations, accepting this -- the -- the existing rate, the applicable rate and then somewhere down the line, if you decide that that rate is too high, that you refuse to pay and then you require the carrier to sue you. 
    And then when the carriers sued upon the only rate that exists on earth, the shippers says your rate is too high. 
    And while we want this question adjudicated by the Interstate Commerce Commission because it involves money, well, it's simply a straight-out proposition for reparations.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1556.177" stopTime="1561.459">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    There's no dispute here that the combination tariff, or is the applicable tariff.

    Mr. W. D. Benson, Jr. 
    That would not appeal from that, Your Honor, and there could be no dispute about it. 
    In other words, the Southwestern Tariff didn't mainly reach beyond El Paso. 
    The Interstate Freight Tariff didn't name any rates eastward of El Paso. 
    So the only tariff in existence is the Rocky Mountain Freight Bureau Tariff. 
    And we say to this Court that if shippers can ignore the applicable rate and ignore the administrative process provided for by Congress and still get an adjudication upon the question of unreasonableness of rate, and number one, that is bad law.

    If you say the question no from here, then it's settled by the record and by agreement that that was the applicable rate, the question is what you could recover. 
    I can understand that, but I have a little difficulty in saying that if in fact there are two combination locals, which on the peculiar circumstances, the law within a joint rate, the shipper can't take advantage of those combination locals.

    They brought it to Oklahoma City and gave it to T. I. M. E., T. I. M. E. transport it from Oklahoma City to Los Angeles and gave it to a connecting carrier in Los Angeles who carried it up to Planehaven, California.

    And that any other improvised manner whereby a shipper can set a rate, well as an example, if 10,000 of our shippers tomorrow decided that our rates were too high, under the referral procedure suggested here by the Government, we'd be through -- we couldn't even defend them and we are (Inaudible) for such a thing can take place, if this Court says to a shipper that you -- you can disregard this rate that's published.

    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    May it please the Court. 
    I wouldn't -- the outset -- I tried to straighten out this question of, through rate versus the aggregate of intermediate rates. 
    Mr. Benson is absolutely correct in suggesting that the so-called applicable rate in this controversy is the through rate, even though it exceeds by almost 100%, the combination of intermediate rates. 
    This is, by virtue, of an I.C.C. regulation which Mr. Justice Douglas adverted to as appearing at the top of page 11 of the record. 
    That doesn't mean, however -- and this is -- this is the -- I think a very important distinction to -- to bear in mind simply because a rate is called, applicable in I.C.C. parlance, it doesn't necessarily follow that that's the reasonable rate or the just rate or the one which is allowed by law. 
    In fact, the I.C.C. in a consistent series of decisions dating back to the very enactment of the Motor Carriers Act, Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act with which we are here concerned, has always held -- has always held that wherever a shipper can show that an aggregate of intermediates is less than the through rate, the through rate is prima facie unreasonable. 
    And of course, that's the question we want to get over to the Commission in this case. 
    We want to give the carrier an opportunity in this case to rebut that prima facie unreasonableness.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let me -- let me straighten out your mind, but I think you've one is in danger of confronting two things.

    That's all we asked for in the court below. 
    And that's -- and that's all the court below gave us, and that's the only reason we're here defending this lawsuit. 
    Now, we want the same permission accorded by this Court, namely, to have the opportunity to challenge the through rate, in this case, on the ground that it's unreasonable. 
    It seems to me that in both cases --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2669.835" stopTime="2679.920">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    In this particular case, although the record is ambiguous, the original payment in T. I. M. E. was based on the lower rate. 
    That is the combination of the intermediates which comes up to about $6 per a hundredweight as opposed to the $10 per hundredweight, prescribed by the through rate.

    Because it's the Government's position which has not as yet been sustained by the Interstate Commerce Commission, but we think we will be able to sustain our position before the Commission, if allowed to go there, that the true rate is unreasonable in the situation of this sort to the extent that it exceeds the combination of the intermediates.

    -- but at least that I -- I think that points up what is really and necessarily petitioners -- both petitioners' underlying assumption in this case. 
    They necessarily contend that our federal District Court at the behest of a carrier like T. I. M. E. or Davidson, must -- they -- they contend that the District Court must enforce the exaction from any shipper of any filed rate irrespective of how wild that file rate is. 
    Irrespective of how unjust it is, irrespective of how unreasonable it is and irrespective of the extent to which it is specifically condemned by Congress in the Motor Carriers Act as being unlawful and prohibited.

    To the extent that it was possible, administratively for us, to file a protest, we did. 
    And this -- this actually is highlighted by the first of the 2 cases argued here today. 
    In the Davidson case, the carrier did impose a surcharge, filed a surcharge rate. 
    We thought it was unreasonable. 
    Within 7 days, after the surcharge was filed, we protested and as Mr. Reyes pointed out, the Interstate Commerce Commission at that point, placed our complaint and not about the shippers on their investigation and suspension docket. 
    We did follow and we did exhort --

    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    I think so, Your Honor. 
    I think it came into existence with the Motor Carrier Act of -- of 1935.

    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    I -- I think, Your Honor, that it probably still is and the number of instances possible for the Commission to make such a determination prior to the elapse of the suspension period, the important question I think before this Court in the Davidson case however, is whether or not during the period of time between the suspension -- between the lifting of the suspension, that is May 1952 and the effective date of the Commission's order invalidating the surcharge about a year and a quarter later, is unjust and unreasonable, the question before this Court is whether or not, similar surcharge is collected by the carrier during that period of time maybe retained by the carrier even though we're ready to go to the Commission and show that the very reasons which motivated the Commission to find the rate unjust and unreasonable in October 1953 applied with full force to the period preceding that invalidation.

    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    No, Your Honor.

    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I assume it always has been, but the time situation raises a different problem in this sense that a rate -- a filed rate, unlike the through rate filed by T. I. M. E., maybe fully effective and perhaps even lawful and reasonable in certain situations. 
    However, in its application, it may turn out to be unreasonable as --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3097.814" stopTime="3099.541">

    And, of course, there would've been no reason for the Government to come in at the time, T. I. M.

    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    That's right. 
    However, I should like to point out, Your Honor, that the Interstate Commerce Commission at the same time that it had been disclaiming jurisdiction to award monetary reparations in favor of a shipper who claims that unreasonable charges have been exacted from him by the motor carrier, at the same time the Interstate Commerce Commission and this again is their settled view for over 20 years, the Interstate Commerce Commission has steadfastly adhered to the proposition that if such a shipper goes into court and files his action for reparations in court and the court stays the action so filed, in order to afford the Interstate Commerce Commission an opportunity to pass on the question of whether or not the rate so charged were in fact unreasonable, the Commission as I say has consistently ruled that it will on reference of such a case from a court make the determination in aid of the court and pass on the question as to whether or not, there was any unreasonable -- any unreasonable exaction involved. 
    So as a practical matter, even though the Commission disclaims jurisdiction itself to award monetary reparations, it paves the way for the court to make such an award.

    There's the same gap, yes, Your Honor.

    It's this sacrosanct published filed legal effective rate, you have to pay it or otherwise you're violating the Interstate Commerce Act.

    I think every -- every concept of fairness and litigation will allow the shipper an opportunity to try to -- at least, to try to establish his defense.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Hollander, it might have been better done having the part of your (Inaudible) but wouldn't you say that those considerations of fairness and justice -- unjust enrichment, all the rest, were at least adverted to dissent which did not find favorable to court.
speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="4051.966" stopTime="4059.441">
    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    It did not certainly with respect to the part of the case I'm interested in -- in Montana-Dakota. 
    I think it did -- I think it did find --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4059.441" stopTime="4061.414">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And was -- and was rejected.
speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="4061.414" stopTime="4275.160">
    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    It was rejected and yet -- and yet just two years ago in the Western Pacific case, I think all of these considerations were really at the nub of that decision. 
    Because the Western Pacific case involved precisely the situation I've tried to point that is now before the Court, thereto, carriers claimed certain funds from the Government. 
    The Government resisted on the ground that the charges the carriers were demanding where excessive and unreasonable. 
    The Court of Claims before whom the litigation had been instituted by the rail carriers in that case, threw up its hands, it said, "Well, Government defends on unreasonableness, unreasonableness is a problem we can't cope with. 
    That ever since the Interstate Commerce Act is a problem which necessarily must be adjudicated by the central body, by the great agency having the expertise, by the Interstate Commerce Commission." 
    So the Court of Claims said, “We can't pass on that problem of unreasonableness.” 
    Well, then, we said, “Well if you can't pass on it, will you please refer the matter over to the Interstate Commerce Commission so that we will be able to have an opportunity over there to establish our defensive unreasonableness.” 
    The Court of Claims felt too, that that request had to be denied. 
    And the reason for it is precisely the reason. 
    The referral was denied in -- in Montana-Dakota, by the majority. 
    And is precisely the reason that the carriers here insist that referral is improvident, namely, in the Court of Claims, it was ruled that there could be no referral by the Court of Claims of this question of this defensive unreasonableness in Interstate Commerce Commission, because of the fact that the United States Government was precluded from filing an independent reparation proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    In that case, the reason that the Government was precluded, the Court said, was because the statute of limitations had run and destroyed the Government's right to go before the Interstate Commerce Commission in the independent reparation proceeding. 
    Well, when this Court took the case, this Court, in reversing the Court of Claims, went to pains to point out that the fact that the Government could not file independent reparation proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission was completely immaterial. 
    Here, the Government was asking for -- of opportunity for adjudication of the defensive unreasonableness, a defense which ever since the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act with respect to rail carriers in 1887 with respect to Motor Carries since 1935, necessarily, must be aired before the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    And this Court directed, in reversing, it directed the Court of Claims to afford us an opportunity to air that defense before the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    I don't see that that's really any different, Your Honors, from a situation where a plaintiff and a (Inaudible) comes into court and he says, “Well look, the defendant has been negligent and I want damages.” 
    And the court saying, "Well -- the defendant saying at that point, “Well, but look, you've been contributory negligent. 
    You're not on top of any recovery under the law.” 
    And the plaintiff to put him in a position comparable to the petitioner in this case, a hypothetical situation I'm giving, would say well, the Court has no power to pass on this question of contributory negligence. 
    It must enter judgment forthwith in favor of the plaintiff on the basis of the plaintiff's assertions that defendant was negligent. 
    That's precisely what they're asking you to do here, Your Honors.

    The General Accounting Office, since August of 1958, has in effect, been stripped of its power to effect a unilateral adjustment or recruitment of a charge with respect to a charge which the General Accounting Office says is excessively unreasonable and unjust. 
    The power to effect the deductions is limited under this new statute to those situations where the Government can establish that there was in fact an overcharge that is a charge in excess of the applicable filed legal rate.

    I do not know the subsequent history of each of these Interstate Commerce Commission cases, but I -- I feel safe in -- in assuming that the shipper filed these proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission for the expressed purpose of getting an adjudication of past unreasonableness not as an empty ritual, not to get some certification from the Commission that he was in fact overcharged, but to use it as a basis for presenting it to the carrier and tell the carrier, “Well now look, the Commission has already decided this question.

    And the District Court -- I'm sorry, under the Tucker Act, there had been a Tucker Act too filed in the District Court by Davidson in that case for other transportation services. 
    The Government contended that the charges sought were unreasonable. 
    The matter was referred over to the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    The Interstate Commerce Commission, as the opinion shows, agreed with the Government's contention that the charges were in fact unreasonable.

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4942.666" stopTime="4961.445">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I ask you whether the Commission relies on that as I read it what they said was the intention of preserving that right and therefore they took the file under the old common-law act statute 217 (b) and 22. 
    What do you say about that?
speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="4961.445" stopTime="5043.402">
    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    I think that that's unquestionably correct. 
    There's -- there's no other way which would make sense of reading the expressed provision in the Act which saves the -- the common-law remedy. 
    What -- what happened -- what happened actually was this. 
    There -- there certainly was this traditional sanction common-law remedy, a shipper always could resort to when he claimed that a carrier was trying to exact an unreasonable rate. 
    Now, in the Motor Carrier Act certainly, Congress decided that any determination of unreasonableness could not be made by the courts spread throughout the country. 
    In the interest of achieving uniformity of regulation, it was absolutely essential for the Interstate Commerce Commission to be vested exclusively with the primary jurisdiction to determine whether or not in the (Inaudible) there's an unreasonable rate. 
    Well, obviously, the fact that it's now the Interstate Commerce Commission rather than a court, which makes that determination of unreasonableness doesn't mean that the court itself is deprived of its power to enforce. 
    The very plain mandate of the Motor Carrier Act that every carrier shall charge just enough unreasonable rates --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5043.402" stopTime="5049.714">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So not through the Federal Power Act? 
    Every -- after charge us to reasonable rate.
speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="5049.714" stopTime="5112.469">
    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    I think it is, Your Honor, and I feel that if some of the considerations we're stressing here necessarily apply to the Montana-Dakota situation, it perhaps maybe right for the Court to reconsider Montana-Dakota. 
    Actually -- it -- actually, the only reason this litigation is before this Court -- the only litigation -- the only reason this litigation is before this Court is because of that outstanding 5 to 4 decision of Montana-Dakota. 
    Carriers would have absolutely nothing to rest on in this case if they did not have Montana-Dakota to argue from. 
    They're not interested in the mandate of the statute which says that unjust and unreasonable rates are prohibited or condemned by an act of Congress. 
    They're not interested in the procedures set up in the statute with respect to recruitment of any of these unjust and unreasonable rates, their sole argument in their brief and as I understood their argument today and orally before this Court, it started out with Montana-Dakota and it wound up with Montana-Dakota.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5112.469" stopTime="5169.020">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that isn't the, you know, my feeling about the -- I expressed my views about that case. 
    But that isn't the only case in which this Court in connection with the Interstate Commerce Act particularly, reached decisions which considering the case in isolation of the question of unjust enrichment, judged only by common-law standards would've reached one conclusion which is the case where Justice Cardozo wrote I forget the moment, but was in the (Inaudible) dissent, et cetera. 
    If another rigorous so-called, rigorous decision in which we're taking into account not the individual right between the shipper and carrier or utility operator and consumer, but a system such in it is when of how you, yourself, point out Congress has consistently refused to give me proactive reparation powers to the Commission.

speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="5216.323" stopTime="5274.792">
    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    There may -- there maybe situations in which in Montana-Dakota result is perhaps inescapable. 
    There may be situations where Congress makes it absolutely plain that deregulatory body shall not be empowered to either award monetary reparations and Congress may also make it very explicit that the regulatory body shall also be stripped of its power to act in aid of a court in simply making a determination of past unreasonableness without making the reparations award itself. 
    But our petitioners are unable to and, of course, it's impossible to point to any such explicit language within the framework of the Interstate Commerce Act. 
    All of the language goes the other way. 
    All of the language in the Interstate Commerce Act reveals a consistent and insistent congressional pattern to have the carrier charge, a rate which is only just and reasonable and no more.

    This suit by the carriers is a suit filed under the same statute in the District Court.

    Well that of course was Western Pacific's contention before this Court based on Montana-Dakota.

    Mr. Morton Hollander 
    I think we distinguished it on -- on the basis of the same -- the same grounds we suggest in our brief in this case. 
    Namely that in -- in this case, there's abundant federal jurisdiction is a full-fledged federal cause of action the Court can take cognizance of and namely a suite by a carrier against the United States to recover monetary damages under the Tucker Act. 
    That's true in this case. 
    It has to be true in this case. 
    The petitioners have to argue that it's true in this case because otherwise they're out of court. 
    They have to come into court, but have to invoke the court's jurisdiction. 
    They have to say that they have a cause of action against the United States. 
    Now in Montana-Dakota, the Court found as one of the chief prospered decision that there was a complete absence of any federally cognizable cause of action in the District Court. 
    And it linked that absence of jurisdiction of over -- over any federal cause of action with the Commission absence of jurisdiction over the question of reasonable of some past rates as a basis for its opinion. 
    But both of those factors coexisted in Montana-Dakota. 
    There was no federal cause of action. 
    The Court was ready to recognize and there was no power in the Commission. 
    In this case, very plainly, we do have a -- a federal cause of action.

    I think the Court can distinguish it on that ground. 
    I think it can distinguish it on another very important ground and namely, that is this. 
    That in Montana-Dakota, the Federal Power Act did not purport in any way to say that any existing common-law rights, now here our statute does, no -- no problem at all. 
    Congress employed terminology, I think, regardless of what maybe said of the rest of the Act, this particular section uses language which is not capable of misconstruction or misinterpretation. 
    It says very plainly that the existing right shall be preserved. 
    Now, we have that in this Act, so we have an expressed preservation of whatever common-law right the shipper had against the exaction of unreasonable rates. 
    There was no such expressed savings clause in the Electric Power Act. 
    In addition, the legislative history of the Federal Power Act which I think convinced this Court in Montana-Dakota was the legislative history which supported the Commission's view that Congress never intended to afford reparations authority to the Federal Power Commission.

    Well, no, Your Honor. 
    Here the problem is eliminated by virtue of the fact that even though you rely on the common-law right, you necessarily have to have the extent of that common-law right defined by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    The Court itself, we recognize as a result of the passage of the Motor Carriers Act is not allowed doing -- embark into or to engage in any interpretation of reasonableness of rates, the Court must stay its hand and refer the question to the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    And by virtue of such a referral, you achieve the very uniformity in regulation which I'm certain Congress intended when it passed the Motor Carriers Act.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Hollander, the Abilene Oil case way back in 204 had before it a similar provision in the Interstate Commerce Act preserving all common-law rights and you said practically, the scheme which the Act established nullifies that provision because of the inconsistencies between them. 
    And now that I have read your case in 302, as you'd like to point out that the Commission says that if there's a cause of action allowable in the Court, then the Court may ask the Commission for a ruling on a tariff. 
    But you don't get a cause of action by having the Commission pass on the tariff ab initio to begin with.

    I would like to take just a minute to suggest that Mr. Justice Frankfurter and his colleagues in their dissent in the Montana-Dakota case do not dissent from the proposition which we urge. 
    I would like to quote Mr. Justice Frankfurter's language at page 258 of 341 U.S., “Despite the unqualified statutory declaration that unreasonable rates are unlawful, which is the precise declaration upon which the respondent relied here, we think it clear that Congress did not intend either court or Commission to have the power to award reparations on the ground that a properly filed rate or charge has in fact been unreasonably high or low. 
    If that were all the complaint before us, showed, and if I may interpolate, that is all the proceedings here shows. 
    There is no allegation, but that the rates of Davidson and the rates of T. I. M. E. were properly established. 
    If that were all the complaint before us showed, we would agree that recovery of damages in a civil action would not be an appropriate remedy and that the complaint should have been dismissed.

    Mr. Bryce Rea, Jr. 
    -- yes, as a matter of law -- as a matter of law, Davidson could file a rate tomorrow, $100 per hundred for transportation from Baltimore to Washington. 
    And it's possible that the Commission would not take any action on until 45 days have passed, in which event --

    It's possible that a shipper might move some traffic under that rate and pay that $100 rate. 
    If that happens, he would have, under the law, no refund. 
    But as a practical matter, the Commission would not let that rate stay on in and there's a --

    As a practical matter, the Davidson Transfer &amp; Storage Company, faced with the vicious competition of other motor carriers between Washington and Baltimore was never violated.

    But suppose instead of that, they just made the combined rate, if you shipped it all the way through four times what the rate would be if he divided up into parts, but to be in a refund there, if the Court -- if the Commission should later find that to be unreasonable.
speaker="bryce_rea_jr" startTime="6592.580" stopTime="6599.810">
    Mr. Bryce Rea, Jr. 
    Are you referring, Justice Black, to the situation where you have a rate from Washington to Baltimore, and rate from Baltimore to Philadelphia and then another rate Washington to Philadelphia?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6599.810" stopTime="6605.723">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Voice Overlap) Philadelphia to Harrisburg is another -- from Harrisburg to [Laughs] New York.
speaker="bryce_rea_jr" startTime="6605.723" stopTime="6645.650">
    Mr. Bryce Rea, Jr. 
    In the event you would have a series of rates, a shipper can get the benefit of those rates if he wants to ship his goods from Washington to Baltimore and then reship them from Washington to Philadelphia and then reship them from Philadelphia to Trenton and then reship them from Trenton to New York. 
    In that situation, he paid that combination of local rates. 
    If however, he tenders his shipment to Davidson Transfer &amp; Storage Company in its Washington terminal, under a bill of lading calling for delivery in New York through shipments, he must pay the through rate published and applicable to that through movement.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6645.650" stopTime="6651.666">

    He must pay it and however unreasonable, it might later be found to be, his money is gone.

    His remedy, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in the Montana-Dakota case, is to go to the Commission and say this rate is unreasonable. 
    We want you to find it unreasonable and we want you to order the carrier to put in a new one.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6679.925" stopTime="6696.078">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If suppose -- suppose -- suppose the exacted today, he goes to the Commission today. 
    He has to pay it and not get his goods shipped. 
    The Commission takes it up and decides a year later that it was all together unreasonable.Can he get anything back?
speaker="bryce_rea_jr" startTime="6696.078" stopTime="6772.580">
    Mr. Bryce Rea, Jr. 
    He cannot get anything back for that movement that moved today. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The Commission will issue an order which is the only power the Commission has to make the rates change prospective. 
    I would say this, if I can just in one further answer, Mr. Justice Black, as a practical matter, there are very few cases in which rates are suspended in which the finding of the Commission and is not made within the suspension period. 
    And the Commission has developed a practical matter -- method of expediting those cases. 
    They are very rigorous in postponements of time or extensions of times for pleadings and that sort of thing so that it's a practical matter in almost every instance in which a rate is protested and suspended. 
    The determination as to its reasonableness is made before the seven-month period of the suspension expires. 
    Now, that is not true in some agencies. 
    It's not true, for example, in the Federal Power Commission where it's unheard of to reach a decision within the five-month suspension period, but fortunately, motor carrier rate cases are much less complex than natural gas rate cases so that you do get.

    Mr. Bryce Rea, Jr. 
    I don't know, Your Honor. 
    I think it was postponed for some time because the question of the constitutionality of the ton-mile tax was being litigated in New York. 
    Furthermore, the propriety of the surcharge on intrastate movements was before the New York Public Service Commission. 
    And the three proceedings, the proceeding on the surcharge for Intrastate Commerce before the New York Public Service Commission and the proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission and the court litigation with respect to the constitutionality of the ton-mile tax, all were more or less, rolling along together. 
    And as Your Honors all know, when you get several cases rolling together, it usually takes a longer time. 
    Thank you.
