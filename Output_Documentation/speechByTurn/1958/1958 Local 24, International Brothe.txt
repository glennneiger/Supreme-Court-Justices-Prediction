    Uelmen, you may proceed with the case which you have before us.
speaker="david_previant" startTime="7.155" stopTime="298.583">
    Mr. David Previant 
    If the Court please. 
    I think that I have some five minutes left of my time. 
    I was so advised and I should like to devote that very brief time to making more definitive answer to a question which was put by Mr. Justice Whittaker at the beginning of the argument yesterday. 
    The question as I recall it was whether or not there was any significance to the fact or should be attached to the fact that these leases or contracts of transportation or at least the one which appears in the record was executed prior to the execution of the 1955 contract which was the subject of litigation. 
    I feel that the findings of the Ohio Courts and the judgment of the Ohio Courts make it clear that this case was not litigated on the idea of any malicious interference with an existing contract right, but that it was litigated on the idea that this contract was per se in violation of the particular statute of the State of Ohio which is here involved. 
    At Page 256 of the record, it appears the findings of fact in the judgment of the Court. 
    And I would call to this Court's attention, finding 2 (d) that Article 32 squarely is in conflict with the public policy of the State of Ohio as reflected on Section 1331.01 Revised Code. 
    And it is void and unenforceable. 
    The Court goes on in its judgment and it's the first paragraph of its judgment to say that the defendants are hereby perpetually restrained and enjoined from entering into any agreements one with the other or carrying out the effects, requirements or terms of any such agreement which will require the alteration, cancellation, or violation of plaintiff-appellee's existing lease or leasing agreement or any such agreement hereafter renewed or renegotiated and entered into. 
    The Court then goes on in subsequent paragraphs to restrain these defendants from any such contracts in the future and perpetually enjoins and restrains us from it anytime enforcing Section 30 -- Article 32 of the contract. 
    I think throughout the litigation, the opinions of the Court, the findings of the courts below, the judgment of the courts below, the question presented was whether or not, this article of this contract was per se void not whether or not it happened to interfere with any particular existing lease arrangement of Revel Oliver or anybody else is. 
    I might say in that regard that if that were all that were involved in this case, that matter could have and probably would have been settled in the collective bargaining table. 
    And I would assume that we do not have any right to enter into a contract at this time which would completely destroy existing contracts which a carrier may have with someone else. 
    That's a matter for bargaining and I supposed it's a matter for exclusion of existing contracts during the course of bargaining. 
    But that isn't this case. 
    This is not the case of where the plaintiff comes in and asked only that we refrained from maliciously interfering with an existing agreement. 
    He comes in and says that our collective bargaining contract is completely void contrary to the public policy of the State of Ohio as expressed in the Antitrust Act of the State of Ohio and therefore we are perpetually restrained from enforcing that contract as to him and as to anybody else. 
    Not only as to existing contracts but as to contracts he made, enter into with carriers in the future. 
    So we believe that that particular point was not an issue. 
    I would further point out as I indicated yesterday that the 1952 contract containing the identical provision, Article 32 was restrained upon its execution and while it was under the cover of that restraint, that the 1953 lease was entered into. 
    And then that restraint was again imposed upon the 1955 contract subsequently litigated all the way through to completion. 
    So, as I said yesterday, if these restraints have not been imposed, the carrier as he testified would have been in compliance with the contract and many of the issues which were adjudicated in Ohio under -- under those facts would not have been subject to adjudication in our opinion.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Mr. Previant, what if preemptions were held here, what could the Labor Board do about it?
speaker="david_previant" startTime="337.587" stopTime="527.836">
    Mr. David Previant 
    Well, if the -- I think there are number of ways in which it can be submitted to the Labor Board. 
    It can be submitted in the posture of whether or not when we ask for this kind of an agreement whether we are bargaining collectively and in good faith. 
    In other words, is this within the area of either compulsory or permissive bargaining which this Court refer to in the Borg-Warner case. 
    Now if we are insisting that an employer signed this agreement with this article in it and if the Labor Board is satisfied that it so unrelated to wages, hours, and working conditions, it could find us guilty, so to speak, of an unfair labor practice under the Taft-Hartley Act. 
    And do an order restraining us from seeking to negotiate this particular article. 
    That is one way in which it could have been presented to the board. 
    It could have been presented to the board by Mr. Oliver in one or two postures. 
    He might have gone to the board and said that we were committing an unfair labor practice because we were insisting that he, as an independent contractor, become a member of our labor union. 
    That is a specific unfair labor practice under the Act. 
    Labor union has no right to force an independent contractor to become a member of a labor union. 
    He could have complained about that. 
    He might have filed a petition for representation claiming that he and his employees or rather that his employees were a separate unit for the purposes of collective bargaining. 
    And the board in that proceeding could have determined whether or not he was an employer, whether or not his employees -- were employees of his and whether or not, we could make them employees of someone else. 
    As a matter of fact, there's a proceeding now pending in the Court of Appeals, growing out of these very same circumstances although the parties are not identical, in which as a result of this restraining order, the union did make a request upon the so-called fleet owners to bargain with the union pending the resolution of this problem in the courts. 
    And when the fleet owners refused to bargain with the Union, the Union struck the fleet owners and picketed at the premises of A.C.E. 
    Now the board, contrary to the finding of what I should I say this. 
    The trial examiner found that A.C.E. and the fleet owners were co-employers. 
    And therefore, this was not a secondary boycott situation. 
    The Board reversed that finding of the trial examiner. 
    The Board found that the fleet owner was the sole employer and therefore when we picketed at the A.C.E. premises. 
    We were engaging in a secondary boycott. 
    We have taken that matter on appeal, but I would like to emphasize two things, number one, this is a fine example of how productive of strike the interference of the state court and the state agencies has been in this case because were it not for the restraining order entered in this case which is now before this Court saying that we could not enforce the provisions of this contract, there would have been no question but that these people would have been employees of A.C.E. and that we would have been in the legitimate labor dispute. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Stanley Denlinger
speaker="stanley_denlinger" startTime="529.739" stopTime="795.299">
    Mr. Stanley Denlinger 
    May it please this Honorable Court. 
    I will devote the time allotted Your Honors to the position of Revel Oliver, the owner operator and plaintiff below in the trial courts of Ohio. 
    And Mr. Iden will devote his time to the position of the carriers, Interstate and A.C.E. and we will try to keep our arguments and positions as to those respective parties are separate as we can. 
    Throughout the briefs of the Teamsters Union and their position in this Court, they have studiously and methodically ignored the keystone of foundation contract on which this litigation began. 
    Justice Whittaker has saved me some time in ascertaining that the contracts on which the plaintiff relied in the trial courts and the contract which was given interpretation on the question of relationship and status was the contract existing and in full force and effect for more than three years prior to the execution of the collective bargaining contract known as the “Over the Road Agreement” attached as an exhibit to this record. 
    This contract between Revel Oliver and the carriers with A.C.E. was dated December 28th 1953 as appears on Pages 145 and 149 of the record. 
    For a period of many years before that, identical contracts were in existence varying only in description and license number of the tractor and trailer leased. 
    Oliver's lease dated June the 20, 1955 for the Mac Truck in Ohio Body Trailer with Interstate, was a replacement of equipment that he had leased at this company's business since 1952. 
    And so we reached the conclusion that the contracts between Oliver and the carriers where all existing prior to the collective bargaining agreement. 
    Now the A.C.E. contract with Oliver provides among other things on Page 147 of the record the relationship created is that of independent contractor and not that of employer and employee, the operator is a contractor only and not the employee of the carrier and that is the quote from that contract. 
    Secondly, the Interstate calls Oliver the leasor and provides an addition to the lease of the equipment that Oliver and I quote, “Will also furnish one or more competent drivers as maybe the case,” from page 150 of the record. 
    We conclude that the independent contractor relationship was established by the wording of these contracts themselves existing at the time that the collective bargaining arrangement was entered in to between the carriers and the union.

speaker="stanley_denlinger" startTime="892.857" stopTime="953.959">
    Mr. Stanley Denlinger 
    Yes, I say that, if Your Honor please, for the reason that the trial judge who I might say off the records, spent an entire summer in looking up this question and writing his opinion after careful study found in his opinion, it was not absolutely necessary to determine either the question of independent contractor of the violation of the antitrust laws of Ohio because Oliver was being damaged by an interference with his existing contract. 
    Now that is the basis of our claim and the angle of the voidness or illegality of Article 32 is something on which the carriers themselves I think rely more than we as an owner-operator felt was necessary to establish the remedy which the Courts of Ohio purported.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="953.959" stopTime="964.623">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I gather then that under your Ohio law, interference with the contract of this kind entitles due to a remedy by way of restraint and not limited to damages.

    Mr. Stanley Denlinger 
    It ran against both the certificated carriers, apparently the union and that was based on two reasons, that Article 32 itself required a modification, cancellation, or obliteration of the existing agreements within 30 days after the collective bargaining agreement went into effect. 
    In addition to that, these characters particularly notifying Mr. Oliver and all other owner-operators at A.C.E and interstate that they were advised that the leases would have to be canceled because of the agreement.

    Mr. Stanley Denlinger 
    Oh, I think the Courts tied the two together.

    Mr. Stanley Denlinger 
    I don't think it shows any alternate grounds at all, Your Honor, I think they're tied together as I understand it from reading the opinions and findings of both Courts. 
    Now, if I can go back to the point of discussion of independent contractors neither the trial court nor the appellate court trying this case de novo. 
    And I say that Your Honors because this matter was not carelessly litigated in either courts but quite fully and carefully and the Teamsters brought new testimony into the appellate court by way of Mr. James Hopper of Detroit testifying in the Court of Appeals. 
    But from the evidence and not standing alone on the name or designation given to the relationship in the contracts of the carriers and the owner-operator, the Court found that Oliver purchased his equipment in his own name, this was of his own choice, make, type, and horsepower. 
    That he paid the drivers the union scale, that he withheld the withholding tax and accounted to his -- the Revenue Department for it. 
    He paid the Social Security and unemployment benefits under the federal and state firms.Oliver alone discharged or fired employees, the carriers never did. 
    And Oliver pays the Ohio Drivers Insurance. 
    He pays for the fuel permits for all oil, gas, tires, and repair, collision, fire, and prep insurance. 
    He pays his driver's health and welfare benefits. 
    He pays all the bridge tolls. 
    He takes his equipment to service station of his own choice for service. 
    His trucks are dispatched at the terminals of the company on the basis of first in, first out along with company equipment. 
    His drivers comply with all of the rules and regulations of the ICC and Oliver pays for all fines or charges or any violation of any kind. 
    The trial court had complete authority to determine the status and relationship of the parties under the lease contract without going into the collective bargaining agreement in anyways, shape, or form. 
    And, this was a contract entered into or wholly beyond the authority, jurisdiction, or direction, or enforcement of any kind for the National Labor Relations Board because it was a contract dealing not with wages, hours or working conditions of employees.

    It -- it didn't have to be a union who brought about a breach of this contract.

    That's our position on that, but it doesn't answer Your Honors question, but it's the best answer I have.

    If the Norris-LaGuardia Act did take application here and the Court or the Government sought to find the carriers and the union in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, that all of the procedures furnished either by the Sherman Antitrust Act or by the application of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to federal labor disputes would not here furnish a basis of ouster of our state courts and the preemption of the federal jurisdiction for the reason that the remedy under either the Norris-LaGuardia Act or the Sherman Antitrust would not furnish the remedy to which we are entitled under a set of facts of the nature here presented.

    I had thought you said that negotiating over with independent, whatever you call them, buys -- buy their own goods and have their own wagon.

    In negotiation was in connection with the system that was conducted.

    We -- we say to Your Honor that the destruction of an existing contract terminated by the terms of an agreement of third parties is not a negotiable subject for a collective bargaining agreement. 
    We say that a clause in a collective bargaining contract that requires an owner-operator are independent contractor to vary the terms and conditions of his existing agreement at the peril of having his contract cancelled is not a negotiable subject for unions and management.

    Supposed it's a proper subject to negotiation for them to say, to make a contract, to try to make a contract to the effect that they've got to amend in that system entirely or else they've got to pay a certain amounts.

    Mr. Stanley Denlinger

    Mr. Stanley Denlinger 
    In other words, we have meticulously tried since your decision on the (Inaudible) case in Ohio to follow the admonitions that you have on preemption on jurisdiction and I am guessing of course, but I do not think that our courts of Ohio would run crosswise to a declaration of this Court or of the board as to a contract that we might otherwise feel interfere with our operations in Ohio.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I'm asking you this question frankly because I don't know, but I'm wondering. 
    I had supposed that this was a very common type of contract and the people negotiated quite all the time. 
    I haven't written or given also which is quite a different case but I had suppose it were rather come as -- say at least since the Milk Wagon Drivers' case that there were negotiations about people, where they call them independent contractors or anything else but it was interfering with the wage system claimed to be that the parties would negotiate that. 
    And sometimes it might result in saying if these contracts -- where you're not going to make these contracts, not going to -- you -- you're not -- we'll negotiate with you on whether you will bar this kind of -- or whether you can do business this way.

    Mr. Stanley Denlinger 
    No. 
    We think that is not the heart of it. 
    We think the heart of this case is, may the union enter into a contract with the carrier who already has an existing contract with which requires by its very terms a complete elimination or modification of an existing bona fide enforceable contract that would result in the complete elimination of that legal agreement. 
    We think that that is our plaintiff's case here. 
    Now this -- this arrangement of leasing, if Your Honor please, is just as common a business as this so-called collective bargaining of the Teamsters over the various states. 
    And this very Court in the MC-43 case held that it's perfectly proper for a carrier to operate on the basis of owning his own equipment or leasing equipment. 
    And there, the majority of this Court found that the regulation of the ICC with reference to trip leases was the perfectly validly regulation which the Commission was authorized to make and which this Court would approve. 
    Two of the members of this Court took the position that even that interfered with the legal right of the carrier to choose, whether or not he should use leased or company-owned equipment. 
    Now, in that very case, this Court approved the leasing of equipment in accordance with ICC regulations. 
    And if there is any question here on the part of the union as to inroads into wages or other conditions because of the lack of proper regulation with the ICC, then the task lies not in making contracts which compel the elimination of existing agreements, but lies in the Teamsters' approach to the ICC for such a regulation as will correct the evils that they may charge is being perpetrated.

    I think the question that you have asked was probably more important to you than the subject that I might discuss and I would like to continue on if nothing to answer the question which you have raised.

    The supposition would be that the carriers, let's say, did not sign the contract, so that the question could have been presented to the board.

speaker="charles_r_iden" startTime="2474.620" stopTime="2565.135">
    Mr. Charles R. Iden 
    I -- this could have gone to the board if we would have refused to sign the contract. 
    And then there would have been a complaint made that here that there was a demand that the negotiated contract which is made by our agent should be put in writing. 
    That could have gone to the board that way if we had refused to sign. 
    The union could have taken it there. 
    And under the law and the board would had only one duty to perform.Had the contract been negotiated? 
    Was it made on our behalf? 
    Had our agents agreed to it? 
    They would have ordered us to sign it. 
    Now bear in mind that the board, the National Labor Relations Board is a statutory board, it does not have the jurisdiction that any court has. 
    It has that narrow jurisdiction of looking at one statute, interpreting that statute and enforcing that statute with blinders on the side of its heads as to the other laws affecting the relations of the parties. 
    That Board has no antitrust jurisdiction. 
    It has no duties or responsibilities to enforce the antitrust laws. 
    So that when this question would come up as to the narrow issue then we either had refused to bargain on this Article 32 or we refused to sign a contract with that in it, all the board would have said, it was a -- they probably would have said that it was a subject to bargain. 
    That one was requiring subjects but a permissible subject to bargaining. 
    It would have told us to bargain on it.

    Well, I'll go along with your assumption that they would have ordered us to bargain on it because that won't change my result. 
    The Board still would have been looking at the narrow issue of A.C.E. in the one case, Interstate in the other case versus the board and the employees and it still would not have had at any jurisdiction under the antitrust. 
    The question wouldn't even been presented to them. 
    Now, I wanted to discuss just a little bit the ICC Section, the question in which it was raised in brief and wasn't argued here and I'm only saying that now because a decision of this Court germane to that subject, I believe will answer the question we're on. 
    In the southern rate case, the State of Georgia versus The Pennsylvania Railroad, that's not cited in my brief, 324 U.S.439. 
    In that case, the State of Georgia was accusing the northern railroads of preferring northern industry and northern states above the interest of the southern States particularly State of Georgia and their industry. 
    And so they made a request to file an original action in this case, in this Court under the constitution. 
    And this case was a discussion of that -- of the right of the State of Georgia to bring that action in this Court under that constitutional provision. 
    There was no question in this -- in the decision to what the ICC was the only body that could remove the rates or could control the rates. 
    This Court had no authority on that subject. 
    But the Court recognized this and said this. 
    That these subordinate congressional boards do not have antitrust jurisdiction. 
    And so while the ICC would look at an isolated rate by a particular railroad and would say the rate was good or bad, the ICC would not look at the whole picture to see -- say whether or not, there was a conspiracy which affected the filing of these rates. 
    So that this Court said that this Court sitting here is the only Court that can look at the whole picture to inquire as to whether or not there is a conspiracy behind these moving the railroads in filing their rates tothe Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    And so this Court said this, “This action will free the rate making function of the influences of a conspiracy over which the Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission has no authority, but which he had proven to exist can only hinder the Commission in the tasks with which it is confronted.” 
    And the Court said, further if -- this Court, it will eliminate from ratemaking the collusive, the practices which the antitrust laws condemn and which are not sanctioned by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    So I say here, assuming that the board had said that this was a proper subject to bargain and assuming the board said, “Sign the contract,” in the case it would been negotiated when we refused to sign it. 
    Still, the National Labor Relations Board would not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the broad subject to determine that this identical clause affecting the lease of equipment was being enforced and put as against every carrier in the State of Ohio. 
    That's the jurisdiction of Board wouldn't have. 
    So that under your decision in the southern rate making case, the antitrust laws are still enforceable by the Court because we can't make the assumption that Oliver is not an independent contractor. 
    That fact has been found by the trial court. 
    It's been found by a three-judge appellate trial court. 
    It's been confirmed by the decision of the Supreme Court. 
    This identical lease was at issue in the National Labor Relations Board at about the same time. 
    In the 120 NLRB, 150, identical lease, after the decision --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Were the parts are the same?
speaker="charles_r_iden" startTime="2894.408" stopTime="2899.304">
    Mr. Charles R. Iden 
    Oliver for some reason that I do recall now was not a party to it. 
    But as a result of this decision --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2899.304" stopTime="2902.129">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Were the other respondents parties to that?
speaker="charles_r_iden" startTime="2902.129" stopTime="2972.015">
    Mr. Charles R. Iden 
    A.C.E was. 
    The identical lease that's in effect between Oliver and A.C.E was at issue in the NLRB case. 
    You see after this injunction, the union then decided to exercise the rights which it had under the law and organized and seek a contract with these employers. 
    And in their zeal, instead of -- they say we should -- that Oliver and the owner-operators should have petitioned for an election. 
    Well, that right is -- they have that right to petition with the election, too. 
    They chose to strike the owner-operators and A.C.E and they also chose to strike A.C.E. 
    And so the owner-operators, a large group of them and big companies filed charges for the secondary boycott with the board. 
    And that the identical leases were in effect and the trial examiner found that these leases made the lessees independent contractors, the one that was appealed to the board, the board confirmed that position. 
    So we have -- we've had four people that have examined the relationship between these lessors and A.C.E, four courts, four tribunals and everyone of them just said that they're independent contractors that we can't beat them.

    I don't go that far but certainly the forum would apply its own procedure and its own rule. 
    And the reason that they took out and the state courts is for the very reason that in -- I think 35 of the States, the debate determined that -- you could bring the action in a state court. 
    Some of the debate would -- well, what the federal court didn't act at all because you can sue it in a state court to get plenty of jurisdiction historically there, bringing that action there, and it's up to those remaining states if they want to get in line so that the action should -- can be brought there. 
    That's their problem. 
    Well, they -- the debates still went on. 
    That -- and they quote it from Truman's report and that all is in there that there should be a remedy. 
    If you're going to have a contract, it should be enforceable. 
    And so that we are going to -- the Congress is going to put some jurisdiction in the federal courts so that even in those states where you can't sue in the state courts, you're going to be able to go the federal court without worrying about the jurisdictional amount or citizenship.

    I see that I've mentioned the Act, I had it in my mind, and I went on to cite Allen Bradley where a union contract was held to violate the federal antitrust laws. 
    Certainly a tribunal not the board interpreted that contract and this Court said they have the authority. 
    Then in the Gibbony case, the state courts of Missouri interpreted the State -- a union contract that held what was contrary to Missouri antitrust laws and this Court affirmed it. 
    I like to refer this Court to one case that I think says -- gives my argument better than I can and that's the Massachusetts case of Commonwealth versus McCue. 
    The decision obviously is not binding upon this Court. 
    It wasn't binding upon the courts of Ohio. 
    But that was the basis where the decision in the Court of Ohio is in the McCue case. 
    In that case, the state court told that certain activities violated the Massachusetts antitrust laws and then they arrested the union leaders and tried them under the federal antitrust laws and found them guilty. 
    That -- it -- if this Court would read Common Law versus the McCue cited in my brief and if they can find that that Court was right, then it will have to find that the courts in the State of Ohio were right. 
    Every issue was in there. 
    Every argument made and fought bitterly. 
    In that case they even removed it to the federal courts, and the federal court remanded it back. 
    They used every device in that case to test jurisdiction. 
    I would entirely rely in my case on that Massachusetts' decision to Commonwealth versus McCue. 
    That was -- in that case the State was the plaintiff. 
    There was the common pleas decision in Ohio in which the same statute was enforced that the -- an action of the prosecuting attorney so that the State can bring antitrust actions against unions. 
    But in my section on page 31 on the antitrust statute this is a question that the courts had the jurisdiction to interpret the statutes. 
    Now, where are we going to get if that isn't the law? 
    Last week, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the union contracts providing for supplemental unemployment benefits was contrary to the statutes of Ohio with respect to unemployment compensation. 
    Well, certainly are we going to close every contract that the union makes with a complete immunity from scrutiny? 
    Could the -- the antitrust divisions of the Government is always looking down their nose if the rubber companies enacting for their pricing method. 
    Now, if we're taking the argument that only the National Labor Relations Board could even view and review a union contract, all we have to do to get around any law is to have the union sign the contract fixing the price of tires with the company. 
    Certainly the price of tires affects the ability to cut, I mean, to pay wages to their employees. 
    And so if the rubber workers can make a contract with Goodyear fixing the price of their tires and then go to the Goodrich and fix with identical price with Goodrich tires and for Firestone, and if this Court or any other court would say, “Well, you can't inquire in, I'll bring your prosecution on the antitrust laws nor can you easily inquire into it because the union is a part of that contract,” where are we going? 
    Once the contract is negotiated, the functions of the board has ceased. 
    There's no way to go there. 
    There is no provision in which the board can review the provisions of the contract.

 Now, if we're taking the argument that only the National Labor Relations Board could even view and review a union contract, all we have to do to get around any law is to have the union sign the contract fixing the price of tires with the company. 
 Certainly the price of tires affects the ability to cut, I mean, to pay wages to their employees. 
 And so if the rubber workers can make a contract with Goodyear fixing the price of their tires and then go to the Goodrich and fix with identical price with Goodrich tires and for Firestone, and if this Court or any other court would say, “Well, you can't inquire in, I'll bring your prosecution on the antitrust laws nor can you easily inquire into it because the union is a part of that contract,” where are we going? 
 Once the contract is negotiated, the functions of the board has ceased. 
 There's no way to go there. 
 There is no provision in which the board can review the provisions of the contract. 
 It's only left to the courts --

    Mr. Charles R. Iden 
    Yes, it's saved -- it's saved Article 32. 
    So that the labor contract portion of it which have affected our employees was in effect. 
    The -- the federal court in C.L. Mead versus Teamsters, 230 F.2d 576 was not in my brief. 
    There was a strike contrary to this union contract in effect between the Teamsters and the C.L. Mead and they had a strike and the carriers sued the Teamsters for breach of contract and that case in the federal court. 
    And the -- in that case it was held that the action would lie. 
    Well, certainly whatever you're suing for damages under any contract, union or otherwise there's certainly a requirement that the Court look at the contract and interpret it to see whether there's a -- the plaintiff show this to the defendant. 
    This certainly -- implicit in all these cases is the fact that courts can interpret these contracts. 
    But I say Allen Bradley is the leading case, you got Gibbony which is the reverse that the state antitrust laws can be enforced. 
    We got the Plasterers case.

    Mr. Charles R. Iden 
    By the -- no, it was not a picketing case. 
    If you start getting strike, then you get an unfair labor practice.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4035.212" stopTime="4038.105">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Charles R. Iden 
    Oh, the Allen Bradley knows the combination between the electrical contractors and electrical unions and New York provided that the contractors wouldn't purchase any electrical equipment by what was manufactured by the unions in New York then effectively cut everybody else out of the electrical field in New York City and the -- this Court held that was contrary to antitrust laws and certainly you permitted some court to interpret and interfere with the union contract and it wasn't the board. 
    And the same thing happened in Gibbony. 
    There's no strike there. 
    They thought about a strike here. 
    No question about it. 
    It's been an unfair labor practice but there was no strike. 
    The Plasterers case was a similar combination between the plastering contractors and the unions in Chicago. 
    These are antitrust cases. 
    The Massachusetts Fisheries case was an antitrust case which arose -- the facts are identical other than in the case, when we're talking about boats and fish, in this case we're talking about trucks and freight. 
    It was the same combination.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker

    It's a part from the question (Inaudible) 
    I understood that all of Mr. Oliver's (Inaudible) was outside the provisions of the Article 32, saved such of it, and he asked he might drive (Inaudible) with himself. 
    Is that not correct?

    Mr. Charles R. Iden

    Well, he was driving it that it gets within the contract and he did drive it.

    Well --

    And that he -- that was the theory it was tried on.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4146.821" stopTime="4233.447">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    If I may (Inaudible) -- do you notice from the note in -- on page 239 of the record that (Inaudible), it means owner, driver-owner and nothing in this article argued here, shall apply to any equipment you leased, it's not fair upon these (Inaudible) employed as driver. 
    There's no doubt about it, specifically as possible to take out of the provisions of Article 32, all of the lease except that which have been provided (Inaudible) 
    And it precludes as found by (Inaudible) that as respects the interstate carrier -- company before (Inaudible) and that respects the A.C.E Company (Inaudible) 
    Now, what trucks would he drive about those times when there's some -- get the truck -- how would you know whether one truck that he might be driving -- which truck Oliver's would be driving?
speaker="charles_r_iden" startTime="4233.447" stopTime="4263.972">
    Mr. Charles R. Iden 
    He assumed the right and did drive any truck indiscriminately. 
    So that certainly the -- this contract would -- and the union's view would have been effective while he was driving this -- this -- the little truck he was driving. 
    So, that I would say that while he is driving a truck and as long he assumes that right then as to those trucks that those days then this contract that the union attempted to put in would have been effective had it been signed in but for the injunction.
