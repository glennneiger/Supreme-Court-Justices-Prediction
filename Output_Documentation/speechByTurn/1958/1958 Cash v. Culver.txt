    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    May it please the Court. 
    This is a criminal habeas corpus case. 
    He comes here on certiorari from the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    The record below is very short, 20 pages long, consists of the petition for habeas corpus and a three-line order in which the Supreme Court of Florida denied the petition without opinion. 
    The petitioner is a young man of 24. 
    He is an inmate of the Florida State Penitentiary. 
    He is serving a 15-year term out of a possible maximum 20 for burglary. 
    He contends that his imprisonment is unlawful because his trial took place over his objection without the benefit of the presence of counsel. 
    That was some four years ago. 
    He did not appeal, instead some three years later, about a year ago, he brought the instant proceeding originally in the Supreme Court of Florida which has original jurisdiction in these matters and then here. 
    He had no counsel at any stage until after the grant of certiorari here, when I was appointed to represent him. 
    His petition alleges that at the time of his trial, he was only 20 years old that he was an uneducated farm boy and that he had never so much has been inside a criminal trial court for him to trial except some 10 weeks before when he had listened to his own previous trial on the same charge. 
    Then he had been represented by experienced and paid criminal counsel. 
    That trial resulted in a mistrial, hung jury. 
    He was then sent to solitary confinement where he remained for the 10 weeks intervening between that trial and the present trial of which he is now complaining.

    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    Sir, I wish someone would explain it to me. 
    I'm reporting the allegations of the petitioner, if it -- I'm ashamed to say that it happened sometime in Florida. 
    This is not the first case that I think House against Mayo have that feature in it, too. 
    Perhaps there are reasons why, but I don't know them. 
    After he'd been there for a period which isn't entirely certain, either a week before the trial or four days before the trial, there are conflicting allegations in his petition. 
    He received notice that his first counsel had withdrawn from the case or was going to withdraw from the case either one. 
    He could do nothing about it, of course, but his mother knew about it and she then immediately set about trying to get him some counsel.The petition recites that she saw, "a number," unspecified of lawyers, but that they all refused to take the case because the amount of money she could offer as a fee, the amount is unspecified, was insufficient and because the time for preparation was insufficient. 
    That time was either four days or a week, we don't know.On trial day, or retrial day, the petitioner explain these facts to the trial judge and asked for a continuance to find, go out and hire a counsel.

    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    The same trial judge. 
    That appears in the record in a rather shadowy way and I know counsel won't mind by going outside the record because I detect some flavor of suspicion of -- of the -- the actions of this attorney, who is a rather eminent fellow at our criminal bar. 
    He did notify the court that he intended to withdraw. 
    I think you can detect from the record as I develop the facts later, a very good reason why he should withdraw, although I have not consulted with him. 
    He happens to be in Asia at that time and I -- I don't know precisely why he withdrew, but he did withdraw a week or five or four days before the trial. 
    The petitioner reported to the court. 
    His efforts to obtain or his mother's efforts to obtain counsel in this very short period, asked for a continuance, the court said no. 
    There are a lot of witnesses there. 
    The State had gone to a great expense to get him. 
    He had to go to trial that day. 
    Then he asked for appointment of counsel, three counsels refused. 
    The reason doesn't appear, but of -- of course, we -- we know what it was. 
    It's perfectly standard in Florida. 
    No, I won't say it's perfectly standard in Florida. 
    Florida does authorize as this Court had seen a number of cases, Wade against Mayo is the leading one, that there'll be paid counsel, free only in a capital case and this isn't a capital case, 20-year maximum sentence to which the boy got 15. 
    The trial then proceeded. 
    The petitioner defendant himself, the pattern of the trial was primarily that of an accomplice case. 
    A fellow named, Allen, Lawrence Allen, who was a codefendant with him, pleaded guilty, turned State's evidence and testified against him. 
    And there was corroboration in the form of evidence, that loot from the burglary had turned up in Allen's possession, so that it was clear from the corroboration that Allen had -- had a part in the crime, but in this, I stress, there was nothing in the evidence except the uncorroborated word of Allen that the petitioner had, along with Allen, taken part in the trial, taken in -- in the crime. 
    Let me -- let me quote what I think is the crucial sentence from the record page 4." 
    There was nothing that would connect Allen and the petitioner except Allen's word." 
    The testimony of Allen was that he and the petitioners and some people had committed the burglary charged.

speaker="irwin_l_langbein" startTime="584.385" stopTime="780.823">
    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    His reward was 10 years suspended sentence. 
    A factor which in the terms of Townsend, Burke, I guess it is, suggests that the absence of counsel may have had something to do with the severity of the sentence because this boy was a first defendant and 15 years appears to one without knowledge of the record as -- as a rather brutal sentence under those circumstances on one that's whether counsel might not have done him some good in pointing out the factors that would ordinarily, I would say, prevent such a very severe sentence. 
    However, that is not the gravamen of the petition. 
    I think it's claim from what I've said so far and indeed, it must have been plain some months ago when certiorari was granted that what we're doing here is appealing to the body of doctrine that's grown up in this Court's since Betts against Brady to the effect that in a non-capital case, in a state court, where a man has been deprived of counsel over his objections, over that opportunity to object, here, you object strenuously. 
    This Court will grant habeas corpus relief if it falls into certain patterns. 
    One of them is the pattern of inadequate time to obtain counsel. 
    I don't propose to review the cases here in terms of how long is long, how high is up, that -- that isn't going to help. 
    I think most of the cases are -- might not concede this shorter times as a more sudden need for a counsel. 
    I feel here that this particular period of time is, itself, not important, but what is important is the report of the attorneys whom the petitioner's mother consulted which is in the record that the reason they turned her down was twofold, (1) insufficiency, (2) not enough time to prepare for a trial. 
    It seems to me that at this stage of the case they petitioned, where the petitioner hasn't had an opportunity to go into the facts and demonstrate what happened here that where the attorneys, themselves, are reported as saying that they don't think that this period of a week or four days, whichever it is, is enough, but that's conclusive, that's binding. 
    If that report is made and that is substantiated by the evidence when we come to trial on this, that's the case, because this is one of the rather rare situations in which the right to counsel, the right to go out and hire your own counsel has been held by this Court to be absolute.

    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    These are not affidavits. 
    This record is -- this -- this record is in a peculiar form. 
    What I'm reciting is a newspaper account of the trial. 
    The petitioner didn't have the money to go out and print out his record, here. 
    And what I'm reciting here comes from a newspaper reporter's account of the trial which is put into the trial record. 
    I'm sorry, which is put under the habeas corpus record, most of it in the argumentative portion, rather than in the statement of facts. 
    The petition, itself, has sworn to, of course. 
    I should add that I think this is a novel procedure. 
    I'm not a habeas corpus expert. 
    This is my first and I hope my last habeas corpus case. 
    I have never run across a case, at least, among the reported cases in which the petitioner relied for part of the support of his petition, upon on newspaper account on what happened. 
    And I thought the point's efficiently novel that I made it a third distinct point or question in the brief. 
    Counsel accommodated me by not contesting the validity of that procedure, that's not one of the issues as counsel view them.

    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    I'm -- I'm going to go on to another point, Mr. Justice, which -- which I had intended to take up a little bit later, but which I think I should take up now, in response to that suggestion which is that this boy was such a bad lawyer that he didn't know how badly he had been treated in this -- in this trial, even after three years and even after the expert advise of the jailhouse faculty of law. 
    Because you will notice that he makes a statement of facts which is only two pages long and that's substantially what I've recited so far. 
    And the rest is this -- this elaborate legal argument, citing cases and so on, but stuck away in the corners of this legal argument were its ammunition for dud arguments.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1416.678" stopTime="1417.657">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Ammunition for what?
speaker="irwin_l_langbein" startTime="1417.657" stopTime="1617.918">
    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    Dud arguments, useless arguments, arguments that just sputter and don't explode is what I think is the most devastating thing in this case. 
    In the cause of an argument which relates to what I think a foolish contention about the wealth of the accomplice witness and his own property, the petitioner says that in the course of the trial the accomplice witness, Allen, testified to other crimes committed not by petitioner, but by petitioner's brothers -- Ray Cash is this petitioner. 
    He is the baby brother of the family. 
    And this petition alleges that the family is a notorious criminal gang. 
    Thus by indirection, not at all in -- in the course of what facts he thought was important, occurs this situation. 
    The witness testifies that members of the petitioner's family take part in a $180,000 robbery in New Orleans. 
    And that petitioner wasn't there. 
    Certainly, that has nothing to do with this case. 
    That is a sort of thing that any lawyer of the minimum three years experience that Mr. Justice Frankfurter just mentioned, would have sense enough to get up and howl about to a trial court or get up to an appellate court and have it reversed. 
    That is, to my mind, the most outrageous thing in this case. 
    The petitioner alleges in his garbled and backwards way that his brothers are members, indeed ring leaders, of this notorious criminal gang known as the Cash gang. 
    A matter of common knowledge in Florida, at least, that there is such a gang and yet testimony as to a completely other crime which this man is not suppose to have any part at all is lugged into this case. 
    To cap it all, the real relevance of that -- that what makes it worst than usual is that there is testimony by the same accomplice that one of the people who is alone when they robbed or burglarized rather, the particular store involved in the information, in little college town of Gainesville, Florida was Fred Cash, one of the same is same Cash brothers. 
    So that, call it what you will (Inaudible) guilt by association that had no business in this trial and that is the prime example --

    Not shown, not shown whether he took the stand. 
    None of these things are shown, but as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has pointed out, we're dealing here with allegations. 
    They -- all we want is an opportunity to have them, answer them if it should turn out that there are circumstances such as -- that he put on elaborate bunch of witnesses, that he did a brilliant cross-examination, you know one of these Walter Mitty stunts, whereby he looked like these lawyers you see on Saturday night on TV, every layman's dream. 
    I don't think it happened here. 
    Let me -- let me quote a bit more on that point from the -- from the record. 
    This is the Gainesville Sun reporter's impression of this again. 
    This -- it gets back to Justice Harlan's question. 
    He says, "While making objections --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1981.480" stopTime="1983.010">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Where is this?
speaker="irwin_l_langbein" startTime="1983.010" stopTime="1984.012">
    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    Page 14 of the record.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1984.012" stopTime="1985.333">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    All right.
speaker="irwin_l_langbein" startTime="1985.333" stopTime="2199.641">
    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    "While making objections and inquiring of the judge and witnesses, Cash appeared unsure of himself. 
    On several occasions he would start a sentence then stop to rephrase it or start on another subject. 
    Before making objections, Cash raised his hand to attract the attention of the judge and then in a halting manner would make his statement. 
    Or again -- on -- on page 14 you find a passage in which the boy was foolish enough to object to the introduction of a revolver which was taken from the store and identified as turning up in -- in the possession of -- of his accomplice witness. 
    The most obviously admissible corroborative evidence is that there'd be no excuse for a sensible lawyer to get up and -- and object to anything like it -- that. 
    And yet it's perfectly elementary that the -- the best way to prejudice a jury against you is to make silly objections. 
    Now, this was a complicated trial. 
    This -- as -- as his evidence by the fact that this very able, experienced criminal lawyer from Miami, the record doesn't show that he's able, that this man of experience had been able to get the boy, at best, a hung jury. 
    When you couple all of these factors together, together with one more which is perhaps anticlimax, a violation of the State rules of evidence in an important respect, I think we're -- we're getting a sort of cumulative picture of a -- of a rump of, a frolic, rather than of a fair trial. 
    That episode which I haven't yet mentioned because I wanted to talk particularly in response to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question about this other episode of a completely unfair trial resulting from the introduction of the testimony of find in which the petitioner had no part at all. 
    That other episode is this, Allen, the coconspirator was permitted to testify that he and the petitioner and these other boys, including his brother, committed not alone this burglary, but one other burglary that they stole a truck and that they had a running gun battle with the police, presumably all in part of the same raid although the timing isn't -- isn't -- doesn't appear. 
    Now, there are three other crimes there, one more burglary, a larceny of the truck, resisting arrest. 
    Now, it's elementary that other crime testimony is admissible under certain various specific limitations, identity impeachment, planned purpose and so on, but that unless, it is excused because of some particular exceptional rule of law, it is highly dangerous. 
    It's hard to -- to meet. 
    It causes confusion of issues as even a little constitutional flavor under the Sixth Amendment, there about knowing the charge against you.

    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    -- to be -- to be brought up when we get the full record here that we're trying to get and find out about. 
    Now, there was this testimony of three, four -- of the three other crimes. 
    There is a rule of law in Florida, in the area of accomplice testimony, Florida, of course, is afraid of accomplice testimony just -- just like most states are. 
    It's hedged about with various restrictions because it's -- it's so dangerous. 
    And one of the rules of law that we have in Florida, although we allow conviction on the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices, which about half the States don't, one of our restrictive rules of law in this area is that we impose a special restriction on the use of other crime testimony in an accomplice case. 
    That is to say, you take these two dangerous elements, other crime testimony which is permissible under certain circumstances. 
    You take this other dangerous element of accomplice testimony which is permissible under certain circumstances, put them together they explode, you have error. 
    The Supreme Court of Florida held in a case just about three years before this case came to trial. 
    A parallel case of a burglary and testimony by the accomplice as to a -- a general raid, other burglaries, in fact even a car theft, the Supreme Court of Florida held that that testimony, although it might be admissible in an ordinary case within these exceptions of the other crime rule was not admissible in this accomplice case because it was nothing but the testimony of the accomplice that connected the petitioner with this crime. 
    There is that special limitation of Florida law and -- and a very wise one. 
    Now, I -- I don't take the position that -- that every violation of a state court rule of evidence is -- is an unfair trial. 
    But I do take the position that this is a significant violation of a state court rule of evidence designed to obtain a fair trial. 
    And that this is the sort of thing that a lawyer could have stopped or they couldn't have stopped it there, he could have stopped it in the Supreme Court of Florida on appeal, because there is this case peculiarly, opposite which says that. 
    Now, one of the issues that we have in this case is the issue of whether this Supreme Court of Florida case says just that.

    And in that -- in that passage in the brief, the stand that adequate state ground cases were cited and it -- it looked as though we're going to have an adequate state ground dispute here. 
    For that reason, by anticipation, I address myself to that in the main brief on that for the petitioner and so far I haven't stirred up any response.

    I think it is not only our right, I think it's our duty to find out whether there wasn't a state ground on which such action was taken particularly, if the petition on its face seems to show a federal claim. 
    I think it would be our duty if this would be -- I feel that my -- not to attribute, disregard or settle constitutional -- federal constitutional principles by a State Supreme Court rather look to see whether there isn't a decent state ground.

   Argument of Edward S. Jaffry

    (Voice Overlap) you may, Mr. -- Mr. Jaffry, you may proceed with your argument.

    Mr. Edward S. Jaffry 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices, may it please the Court. 
    The way the respondent sees this case, there was basically only one question to be decided by this Court. 
    Whether or not, based on the facts presented to the Supreme Court of Florida in petition -- as petition for writ of habeas corpus, the Supreme Court of Florida erred by denying him the relief he sought. 
    Under the long array of decisions of this Court, in terms of the failure of the -- the trial court in Florida to appoint counsel to represent this defendant, the rule is clear. 
    There must exist, particular circumstances in a particular case to reflect of that degree of unfairness that actively operated in the process that resulted in his confinement. 
    Now, the petitioner early in his petition for writ of habeas corpus, and the record as counsel for petitioner stated, this Court constitutes the petition for writ of habeas corpus, the only the matter the Supreme Court of Florida had before. 
    The petitioner alleges that he was unable to adequately defend himself in the trial below. 
    And for that reason, it was imperative that the lower court appoint counsel. 
    Now --

    Mr. Edward S. Jaffry 
    No, Your Honor. 
    If I may explain procedure to the Court, which seemed to be concerned about that, these prisoners or other persons filed petitions for writ of habeas corpus. 
    The Attorney General's office represents the respondents, Mr. Culver. 
    At that time, we are notified that the petition will be placed on a motion calendar to be opposed by the Attorney General's office, if they care to oppose it, in a 10-minute argument. 
    Our position is if we feel it justified, that even if true, the facts as presented by the petitioner failed to establish a prima facie case. 
    Failed to establish probable cause. 
    The Supreme Court of Florida then, if they had discretion, either denies the writ in a three-line order. 
    And in fairness I must admit there are occasions where they issue an opinion. 
    Where the prisoners obviously, attempting to harass the court by a multitude of the petitions, alleging the same thing. 
    Where he filed a petition in our court and then come up to this Court on certiorari, have it denied and start in our state courts again. 
    The Court will issue the written order in that case admonishing the prisoner. 
    However, if the normal procedure is to issue just as three or four line order, considering it and denying it, if that be their -- their will. 
    And in this case, we explained to the Supreme Court of Florida, as we explained to this Court, that what happened on the morning of February 21st when this petitioner was presented to the trial court. 
    The first thing he asks not, where is my lawyer or what happened? 
    But he wants to know if his lawyer made a formal withdrawal. 
    Filed a motion and then the Court grants his motion. 
    There, we say, there's an indication of some experience in trial procedures. 
    Two, excuse me, the record shows clearly that he did object. 
    He knew he had a right to object. 
    He was not prevented from objecting and we admit that he could not handle his case probably in a way a counsel long experience before the criminal bar could.

    There are some on the bottom -- had withdrawn and asked the Court if Mr. Carr had filed a motion to withdraw as his attorney. 
    Judge Patton, the trial judge, informed petitioner he had granted Mr. Carr's motion to withdraw. 
    We have no idea why Mr. Carr withdrew. 
    The next we find in his argument and questions presented that he did object to evidence.

    Mr. Edward S. Jaffry 
    Well, Your Honor, the general rule in Florida is to this effect, that prior acts and circumstances are admissible to prove intent or guilty knowledge in a particular crime charged. 
    And when do these acts or circumstances constitute the commission of other crimes, they are admissible on the question of intent, guilty knowledge, to show a plan, scheme or general criminal operation. 
    Now, an issue has been joined here in terms of whether or not -- whether testimony comes solely from the accomplice witness connecting the defendant or the petitioner with the principal crime charged, this other crime testimony is admissible. 
    The rule though is, however, that other crime testimony is admissible for that specific purpose and of course --

    Mr. Edward S. Jaffry 
    The Supreme Court of Florida did not take it necessary to order a hearing, which here, they would normal -- would -- could do, if they thought the case warranted such. 
    We have just this statement, Your -- on page 12 of the record, where petitioner quotes from Gainesville Sun again. 
    Yesterday, and this is in the second paragraph of that quote -- or shall I start from the first? 
    State Attorney Ted Duncan of the prosecutor, "Today began the laborious process of corroborating testimony that Ray Cash participated in a burglary here last year. 
    Yesterday, Lawrence Allen, a friend of Cash for over four years, took the stand for an hour and a half and related how he and Cash in company of two others, burglarized stores, stole a truck and become engaged in a running gun battle. 
    Evidently, the Supreme Court of Florida felt that this prior -- that -- that this testimony of other criminal activity was a part of a general plan, a general crime wave, perpetrated or -- or exacted in the same manner. 
    Now on this point, I wish to point out to the Court that even if petitioner's construction of -- of the Padgett case, as he quotes in his brief, and as we quote in our brief, is that where the testimony connecting the principal -- the -- the petitioner with the principal crime charged, comes only from the accomplice, that is not sufficient evidence to connect him with the crime for the purposes of letting this other testimony or this other evidence in. 
    We have these statements throughout this brief that the testimony of the accomplice was corroborated. 
    And so we find that it may be very well not have been inadmissible, that it was corroborated and thus was -- not withstanding the Padgett rule, if -- even if petitioner's construction of the case be proper, that it was corroborated and that the petitioner's case was further connected with the principal crime charged by evidence other than the accomplice testimony.

    Mr. Edward S. Jaffry 
    You might have had a different case, Your Honor. 
    And the Supreme Court of Florida may have had a different case. 
    But when petitioner then explains exactly what he did, he bears to the Supreme Court of Florida and we feel to this Court what many petitioners tried to do and some successful bear allegations of error, gets him a free trip out of Raiford. 
    We handle this -- start of the record, we handle this very often. 
    Bear allegations or error, coercion to a plea of guilty, a beating to obtain a confession, bear allegations. 
    We have no way of denying or admitting it and so we join issue and the records fail to reflect, if there were trial records, usually on a plea of guilty, there is not that extent of trial record. 
    We have nothing in the record to reflect whether or not, his allegations are true. 
    And so a hearing is held and the prisoner gets a free trip to the county jail out of Raiford, the State Prison and spends a day out in the open free air. 
    Now, we don't say that's what happened here, but the beginning -- the early portion of this petition is what we are normally confronted with. 
    We would have gone to a trial, so to speak, on those allegations, but he completely destroys those allegations when he discusses exactly what he did and he shows to my mind that the only incapacity he suffered from was an inability to defend himself with the same degree of proficiency that a legal counsel with some degree of skill and experience before the bar could have. 
    But that, of itself, does not, in my mind --

    We feel that that was done in this case. 
    That he has not presented and I remind the Court that we're here on habeas corpus. 
    We are not here on an appeal. 
    There is no full record. 
    The burden was on petitioner to show well, by -- clumsily or not, but to show affirmatively to the Supreme Court of Florida that his federal constitutional and or state constitutional rights were violated and because of that, he is now being held in lawful custody and we feel that he has not done that in this case. 
    We feel that whatever my personal feelings maybe or whatever -- he has not established that and that the Supreme Court of Florida was justified on the basis of the record before them at that time in denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus.

    -- that the Supreme Court of Florida was justified in doing what they did for the reasons I have set forth here. 
    And if I may move on to this ancillary or question that is presented, which of course somehow meshed into the general question the right to a continuance. 
    The rule in Florida as it prevails today is to the effect that the motions -- motions for continuances, the denial of the granting thereof, are matters vested in the discretion of the trial court. 
    We have a situation in this case and the Court is familiar with the facts that this man was held in close custody. 
    Now an answer to Justice Whittaker's question to -- on Mr. Langbein earlier this morning, I point out that Florida has a statute that provides in effect of I -- I do regret that I do not have the statutory authority in front of me this moment. 
    That where a county jail -- where a person confined in a county jail or for reasons that the county jail cannot adequately hold them or he is a dangerous prisoner and he would not be safe or could not be confined in that county jail.He maybe transferred to another county jail with the facilities for holding that man, are -- are stronger or better.

    Now, that's the point, Your Honor. 
    I don't know why he was taken there. 
    I must presume and he doesn't -- I must presume that he was taken there for a proper reason and the only reason I can think of and again this is outside the record that they could not hold them in Alachua County, which is the county where he was tried. 
    That there wasn't a jail in the vicinity and Alachua County is a small county in the central part of the State quite possible and then again, I say, I do not know. 
    Raiford is a short, 30, maybe 50 miles and Raiford is the farthest state prison from Alachua County. 
    The prison officials -- I'm confident were reluctant to take him. 
    They've got enough trouble and I don't say that in terms of whether he was a dangerous person, but they had another mouth to feed and another cell to clean and they were probably reluctant to take it. 
    They held him there for -- the only reason I can think of. 
    He was a -- I hate to use the word dangerous. 
    I don't know.

    As I gather from his petition. 
    His family has a very dangerous reputation.
speaker="edward_s_jaffry" startTime="5143.709" stopTime="5313.303">
    Mr. Edward S. Jaffry 
    That's very true, Your Honor, very true. 
    His family has a dangerous reputation in some parts of the State now that I -- I'm from the part of the State where this family lived for a while, I know of them. 
    I don't know of their history and if travels have reached the northern part of Florida or the central part where this trial was commenced. 
    But they do in some portions of the State of Florida enjoy a dangerous or infamous reputation. 
    Now, if I may, he was brought before the trial court. 
    He moved for a continuance in order to secure counsel. 
    He alleges in his petition that the only reason the trial court denied his motion for a continuance was because the State had gone to great expense to bring witnesses. 
    We take the position from the record that that could not have been the only reason. 
    The record shows that he had somebody attempting to procure counsel to represent him. 
    That he was held for whatever purposes and must we not assume at this point that they were for a lawful purpose in closed custody. 
    He could not have, under any circumstances, easily conferred with a counsel. 
    There would have been a procedure. 
    They would -- counsel would have gone to Raiford, and which I understand can -- of course, can be done, but there was no telephone that he could reach. 
    He would have to be taken to the warden's office. 
    So the only person who could logically talk to counsel attempt to procure counsel on his behalf was his mother. 
    Now, the record shows, not very clear, but it does establish that during the week preceding the second trial, both Mr. Cash and his mother were aware of counsel's withdrawal. 
    Now, we admit that he could not go out and solicit counsel. 
    He may have been permitted, if he had asked, and we have no allegation that he did ask to use the telephone in the warden's office. 
    From my personal experience, I know that has been done, but he would not have been permitted unconfident to make repeated trips to the warden's office. 
    So the only person that's able -- the only person who he would -- imagine would want to or could, would be his mother and his mother made the -- these efforts. 
    And nowhere in the petition do we have any allegation that shows that she had procured counsel, that she thought she had counsel except her statement to Mr. Duncan, the prosecutor, during the week preceding that -- that she had gotten counsel that day, but evidently did not because no counsel appeared. 
    And so, we submit that the trial court had no cause to delay any further. 
    We had no indication of how long they wanted. 
    Was it a day, a week, a month, a year to find counsel to search the Florida Bar, to find somebody to represent this man at the fee they could afford to pay.

    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    Yes, but the precise nature of his hearing is one that --

    Yes.

    Mr. Irwin L. Langbein 
    -- the state law can determine. 
    There maybe no issue of fact here. 
    It maybe that this is determined --

    They might admit the facts.

    That this -- that this is determined precisely on -- on the basis of a record which supports me, if so, there's -- there's nothing, but a question of law as to whether on those facts, the -- the -- there was a good cause of action.

    In other words, the State in effect has made a talking demurrer to this -- to the petition and if we say that that demurrer was ill-founded, you don't say that the state procedures under (Inaudible) the -- it wouldn't go back for an opportunity on the part of the State to make a return.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, no. 
    I'm -- I'm assuming the opposite. 
    That you agree with Mr. Jaffry that what the Court has here, the Court threw this out, Supreme Court of Florida, on its face, on the basis of what -- they're saying there's nothing to it. 
    Now, what a reversal would mean is that there is something to it and therefore the State has a right to make its return to show on the fact, perhaps by the trial minute that there's nothing to it.

    And, Mr. Jaffry, may I -- may I thank you, sir, for the very fair and -- manner in which you presented the issue on behalf of State of -- of Florida and also for your frankness, entire frankness with this Court.
