    Mr. Royal W. France 
    On page 99 of the record, the opinion of the Supreme Court of State of New Hampshire, they state -- it appears that the witness, while he does not claim contention here, has pleaded the Fifth Amendment when questioned about Communist matters at Congressional Committee and he was a supporter of numerous organizations on the subversive list prepared by the House Committee and so forth. 
    The -- when we pointed out to the Court that there was no evidence in the record that the appellant had ever taken the Fifth Amendment anywhere and that if he had taken it, it was improper to draw any such inferences from it. 
    The matter was deleted from the opinion of the state court on motion for rehearing. 
    However, I think it's significant that the Attorney General here again relies upon it as a basis for some implication about Willard Uphaus as an indication of how thin the case is upon which he is seeking to rely on and indicating a dangerous tendency to waterdown a recognized constitutional right. 
    The -- in the matter of the sheriff's list, the right of the sheriff to get names of guests is perfectly obvious that that has no application here. 
    A sheriff would not go to get the names of guests for the purpose of publicizing name in an invidious manner in relation to subversive activities or alleged subversive activities. 
    It's inconceivable that he can use them for such purpose and I'm trying to think he could be restrained if he tried to do it for any such purposes. 
    They're being used here in connection with territory involving First Amendment rights. 
    The -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter yesterday was interested in the reference on page 42 of appellee's brief to a name of Julio Curry. 
    This list, which the Attorney General presents to this Court, some of the known off-sided guests and speakers at World Fellowship is a curious list. 
    So far as I know, Julio Curry was never in this country. 
    And if he was, he certainly was never at World Fellowship camp. 
    Neither was the liberal journalist I.F. Stone who is disrespectfully referred to here as Busy Stone. 
    And if there is anything -- he is a severe critic of the Soviet Union and Louie Strong was never there nor wasn't at Nathaniel Mills and some of the other people on here I'm sure.

    I have no doubt that if Julio Curry had come to the World Fellowship to have him and asked to be registered, he would have been tediously received and that nobody had feared that the foundations of Government in the State of New Hampshire were endangered by his presence.

speaker="royal_w_france" startTime="305.681" stopTime="542.560">
    Mr. Royal W. France 
    -- the Attorney General seems to me to have misread the opinions in the Sweezy case, while it is true that the opinion of the Chief Justice must based upon the vagueness of the mandate. 
    There was also discussion of the First Amendment rights which seem to me to indicate that those three members or four members of the Court were not in disagreement with the fact that First Amendment rights here might have been violated. 
    And certainly, the -- the Chief Justice in his statement, which is quoted on page 18 of our brief, where he says “We cannot -- we do not now conceived of any circumstances where any state interest would justify infringements of rights in this field,” indicates to me clearly that the Attorney General is trying to put too narrow in interpretation upon that opinion. 
    I think also that he's trying to put too narrow in interpretation upon the opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in which Mr. Justice Harlan concurred. 
    I do not conceive that in discussing academic freedom, Mr. Justice Frankfurter was limiting the teaching process to the laws of a chartered university. 
    Now, that in discussing political association, he was limiting it to the progressive part. 
    I think the issue is much broader here with a camp of adult people. 
    It's quite obvious that competent people came there as lecturers on various subjects and that this was an adult educational process that was going on. 
    And I just can't imagine what danger there could have been to the State of New Hampshire. 
    I may say that the Attorney General had a standing invitation to come there and lecture himself, but he is not yet honored that he had complete opportunity, have a representative of his office, attend the meetings there. 
    There was nothing secret about it. 
    It was an open discussion by adult people of questions of common interest. 
    And I think that it's perfectly clear, as Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People versus Alabama pointed out that this appellant had a right to protect not only his own constitutional rights, but the rights of other persons. 
    Now, the -- the opinion of the court below expresses the thought that not only the correspondence of guest speakers, but the correspondence concerning guest speakers was the subject of this subpoena. 
    In other words, here, not only where letters which couldn't conceivably, as I think the Attorney General admitted yesterday, couldn't conceivably deal with the overthrow of Government by a force and violence and nobody would write such things in a letter, not only those letters but the correspondence that might be in the files by third or fourth persons concerning these people. 
    It seems clear that this goes far beyond any --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="542.560" stopTime="545.402">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Where do we find that record, Mr. France? 
    Can you tell me please?
speaker="royal_w_france" startTime="545.402" stopTime="584.218">
    Mr. Royal W. France 
    It is on page -- page 94 of the record. 
    Third line from the bottom. 
    Opinion says, “Produce all correspondence with or concerning persons who presented speeches, addresses panel discussions or panel.” 
    This is a very wide case indeed and certainly, it would seem that the appellant was quite justified in protecting their right to leave.

    And it seems to me that the First Amendment territory is invaded by this kind of a request which brings people into an invidious association in a report made on the subject of subversive activities in the State of New Hampshire.
