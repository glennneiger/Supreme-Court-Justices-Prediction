Lee v. Madigan

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 42, John Lee, Petitioner, versus Paul J. Madigan. 
    Mr. Davis, you may continue.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="14.062" stopTime="277.441">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    I shall turn my attention now to the issue with respect to the jurisdiction of courts-martial. 
    All the soldiers who have been adjudged guilty by previous court-martials dishonorably discharged and imprisoned and who commit offenses while they are in the custody of the Army in the disciplinary barracks. 
    Now, this issue is purely constitutional. 
    No argument has been advanced that the Article of War, which is presently involved, number -- Article 2 (e) of the 1920 articles does not specifically and intentionally apply to this petitioner. 
    There is no -- there is no doubt the Congress intended to give the military the power to exercise court-martial jurisdiction of this type of prisoner. 
    The only question is whether or not it constitutionally could give the Army this power. 
    Not only does the present article clearly attempt to give jurisdiction to the court-martials but this has been so for a good many years. 
    The first provision providing for this type of jurisdiction was in 1863 when the first military prisons were established. 
    It's present in the Uniform Code, the present Uniform Code which is in effect today with respect to all of the armed forces. 
    The same type of jurisdiction is -- is given to courts-martial if it can be given. 
    When the -- when the Army discontinued, and I don't know why, but when they discontinued their -- their prisons and began to send the men who are under the court-martials sentence back to the guardhouses back in 1898, the Secretary of War wrote a letter to Congress saying that this terminated the jurisdiction which the Army had previously had which was particularized with respect to army prisons and that he felt the Congress should enact legislation to give the Army general jurisdiction of discharged soldiers while they were still in custody whether in prisons or in guardhouses or anywhere else within the Army's jurisdiction. 
    He said that it was difficult to maintain discipline unless the Army had authority to enlarge the sentences through court-martial of prisoners who were subject to their control, and it was then that the Congress enacted the Code of 1898 which provided that, and I quote, it's on page 30 of our brief, the first general provision in the court -- in the Articles of War dealing with this question of jurisdiction and it said, "Soldiers sentenced by court-martial to dishonorable discharged and confinement shall, until discharged from such confinement, remain subject to the Articles of War and other laws relating to the administration of military justice." 
    And this law remained on the books in this form and go, I think it was 1916 when the Congress enacted the same provision in its present form which provide simply that it shall extend to -- the military jurisdiction shall extend to "all persons under sentence adjudged by courts-martial".

    The -- there is an attempt to rehabilitate prisoners and make them fit for the Army again with some military training. 
    Actually, some of the prisoners are organized as infantry would be and they have their own non-commission officers in the prison.

    But whether it would receive a construction because of the law that went before that said clearly dealt with situations while they were under military control and that is clearly the intent of the statute whether there will be a limitation that into it, I do not know.

    If they are going to give the Army that authority, as they did and as they still do, why, then, it would seem appropriate to give the -- the authorities who are going to maintain -- who are going to be responsible for maintaining the order in response to the powers to maintain it, and the Army doesn't need that power with respect to prisoners who are in the federal prison.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    I don't think it does so much with -- with -- it may be that it was more dangerous but it dealt more with the nature of their crime.

    Could he that as a prisoner or as a soldier?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1622.086" stopTime="1931.488">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, he is -- he is not -- he'd do it as a prisoner or as -- he'd do it in this capacity which he is in, in this -- in this disciplinary barrack. 
    I don't -- I don't want to make a conclusion one way or the other. 
    That is my -- my argument is that he is a member of the armed forces. 
    Now, this Court has had this very question, this precise question under this precise Article of War before it before in Kahn against Anderson after the First World War. 
    And the facts in that case are almost precisely the same as -- as the facts in this case with respect to the question of jurisdiction. 
    And in that case, the same arguments as to lack of -- of constitutional power will presented to this Court, and the Court found that this did fall within the powers of Congress with respect to the -- to the government of the land and naval forces. 
    And that finding of the Court was buttressed by Court of Appeals' decisions which preceded it, dicta of the Supreme Court itself which preceded it and it has been followed thereafter in the Courts of Appeals. 
    The only authority to the contrary so far as I know on this question of jurisdiction is Colonel Winthrop. 
    Colonel Winthrop, in his -- in his book, definitely says that there is no jurisdiction in this type of case. 
    Now, undoubtedly, undoubtedly, the reason that we have troubled with this case today is because of the decisions of this Court in the Toth case and in Reid against Covert. 
    And I don't have to tell the Court that these -- on the facts, those cases are -- are clearly distinguishable from this.Our question is whether in theory, they cover it. 
    The -- the Reid against Covert case, of course, dealt with the wife -- the wife of an officer -- of an -- of an officer who had never -- the wife had never been in the army services and the question was whether because she was -- along with the army services whether she was closely enough connected to be within the military power. 
    And the Toth case on the other hand dealt with a -- with a soldier who had been retuned to civilian life. 
    The -- the Army had -- not only discharged him but had released any authority over in McCulloch and they attempted to regain their authority. 
    In the Toth case, as a matter of fact, there is a footnote which refers to the type of jurisdiction which is involved in this case. 
    It refers to the case of Kahn against Anderson, which I mentioned a minute ago, and without, in any way, testing any question upon its authority, recognizes that that is a decision of -- of this Court. 
    I think that it really advances our argument very little for the petitioner to rely on Colonel Winthrop's assertion that a dishonorable -- dishonorably discharged prisoner is a civilian and therefore not subject to jurisdiction. 
    I think that this is really only a -- a way of stating a conclusion. 
    There's no question that a dishonorable discharge terminates military benefits generally but whether it ends the power to impose discipline as such is the very question which is before this Court, and we could turn this argument around and say that since one of the -- one of the vital test of membership might well be whether a person is subject to discipline at the very fact that there is an imposition of discipline over these prisoners makes them members of the armed forces. 
    The -- the Army as -- has, as a matter of fact, has coupled dishonorable discharges with the discipline of imprisonment for -- for many years. 
    And this Court is specifically recognized that the coupling of a dishonorable discharge and an imprisonment is -- is not an inconsistent act and that the military forces have authority to do this. 
    So that I think it is clear beyond any question that there is no intent. 
    There is no intent on the part of the armed forces to sever the disciplinary relationship between the soldier and the armed forces when they sentenced him to dishonorable discharge and imprisonment for a period of years. 
    They specifically wished to maintain the -- the disciplinary relationship over him.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    From the army -- from the barrack officers (Inaudible) of the Secretary of the Army. 
    I may say that in one side of these cases is -- as -- as I analyze the basis, it's very different from the Reid case, Reid against Covert case or Toth in that here, we have, I believe, no attempt by Congress to expand -- expand the area of its jurisdiction. 
    It's -- it's rather a matter of carrying through jurisdiction which is specifically and -- and concededly granted to it with -- with respect to armed members of the armed forces to carry this thing -- to carry that very jurisdiction through until determination of their imprisonment. 
    Now, I think when I was talking about whether Congress intended to -- I'm turning now to the point I was discussing last night about Article 92 which limits the military jurisdiction of a murder to -- so that it excludes “in time of peace”, and I think I neglected to mention one thing which I think is -- is rather important and that is that when Congress amended the Articles of War in 1948, it specifically recognized that with respect to the Articles of War, the war was still in progress, and it did this in connection with Article 53 providing for applications for new trials. 
    And there was a thought that maybe during hostilities, many court-martials have been hurriedly conducted and that it was appropriate to give soldiers who had gone through those court-martials a chance to have them looked at in more calm -- in a -- in a more calm atmosphere. 
    And so in Article 53, they gave soldiers opportunity to petition for new trials under Article 53, and they limited the time there. 
    And they limited it to -- within one year after the termination of the war sometime in the future. 
    They recognize the war was still in existence and they were giving this right in the future until one year after determination of the war. 
    And again in 1950, when the Uniform Code of Military Justice was -- was adopted, again, Congress, in dealing with applications for new trials, specifically recognized that with respect to the Articles of War, peace had not been achieved.

    I think that you have to look to the -- the intent behind the statute. 
    The reason for the statute that Congress had in mind as it just is said in such cases we are called upon -- in such cases, we are called on to interpret the statute as best as we can so as to carry out the purpose of Congress in connection with particular right the statute was intended to protect.

    Mr. Robert Edward Hannon 
    Well, in this -- I think in any event, that that is now the law or appears to be the law that you must look at the particular purpose Congress had in mind in enacting the statute or the right that they sought to protect. 
    Well, under this 92nd Article of War, we can look at it and has -- well, what did -- what right was Congress trying to protect by saying that the military could not try a person for murder in time of peace but right where they're trying to protect. 
    Well, they were obviously saying if it's a murder case, a very important capital offense turn him over to the civilians to try where he'll have his constitutional rights. 
    I think that's the obvious purpose that Congress had in this statute. 
    So that boils down to the question -- well, of course, conversely, by stating that, the Congress had in mind that there would be certain times when it wouldn't be expedient to turn murder cases over to the civilian courts where the constitutional guarantees prevail. 
    Certain times, when it wouldn't work, those certain times are mentioned in the Article, number one, if it's outside the continental United States. 
    Well, if it's outside the continental United States, your alternatives there are either try him by court-martial or turn him over to the foreign jurisdiction. 
    Now, the other occasion is in time of war. 
    We won't turn a murder case over to civilians. 
    Well, obviously in time of war, they mean, I think, like this Court is held, when the courts are closed, the idea of the Milligan case and the Hawaiian cases, it's -- when the courts are closed, there is no civilian court where the man could be tried for murder so therefore, try him by court-martial. 
    Now, taking one step further from that, what was the condition in California in 1949 that precluded him from having his constitutional guarantees by a trial in civilian court? 
    It would -- could it be said that Congress, in setting up this statute, contemplated that a situation like 1949 would be time of war or would you say that Congress in enacting Article of War 92 thought that it was a technical state of war that would control? 
    I don't think so. 
    I think that Congress was dealing with actualities when they talked the time of peace and time of war. 
    And the actualities in California in 1949 certainly were a time of peace. 
    That has been the decision of the Court of Military Appeals in the Shell and Bussmann cases. 
    The lower court -- the Bussmann case which is a recent Court of Military Appeals' decision says that in Korea, we arrived at a time of war in purposes of the Articles of the Code when they stop shooting, when the armies -- this was signed. 
    The lower court attempts to distinguish this by saying, “Well, in Korea, there was no declaration of war. 
    Therefore, there does not have to be a treaty to terminate this war.” 
    But -- and the answer for that, “For one thing, you could say there was no treaty after World War II for six years. 
    What's to say, there won't be a treaty after Korea within six years.” 
    And secondarily, I don't think from reading the Bussmann case, you can get such a narrow meaning from it. 
    I'm quoting from page 37 of the brief where the Court of Military Appeals says, “And that Congress, when it used the phrase ‘in time of war' in the Military Code intended that phrase to apply to that state regardless of whether or not it was initiated or continued or -- with or without formal declaration.” 
    I think the Court of Military Appeals is squarely held that incidentally, there is a further case from the Court of Military Appeals which just came down and it's not cited in our brief, it's United States versus Carr, and it's 23 CMR 273. 
    In that case, the Court of Military --

    Mr. Robert Edward Hannon 
    That case, the Court of Military Appeals says, “In those cases, this Court concluded that upon the cessation of hostilities in Korea on July 27, 1953, pursuant to the armistice a state of war no longer exists for purposes of military law. 
    Thus, it is crystal clear that the inception of the accused absence occurred in time of peace.” 
    The accused went on unauthorized absence on August 3rd, 1953 less than a month after the armistice. 
    They said that he went on unauthorized absence in time of peace. 
    Quickly carrying over to the second portion of the argument, that is as to the constitutionality of Article 2 (e). 
    Here, we are speaking of 2 (e) under the 1920 Code.We are not speaking under the present Uniform Code of Military Justice but the 2 (e) under the existing code. 
    Number one, it should be pointed out that the first enactment of that 2 (e) in 1898, the bill was entitled an amendment to the Summary Court Act. 
    A summary court is a court that can give up to three months jurisdiction. 
    Obviously, what they intended was to give to the military prison warden jurisdiction similar to what a -- any prison warden has. 
    Now, I think that this --

    I think that the argument boils at to two parts.Number one, and this was the same problem I had problems with yesterday, on reflection, I think it because to the constitutionality, it boils it to two parts.

speaker="robert_edward_hannon" startTime="3377.647" stopTime="3488.696">
    Mr. Robert Edward Hannon 
    Right. 
    I think first of all, we can determine was he in the armed forces or was he a member of the armed forces? 
    Now, if -- on that particular argument, if he -- the -- he has no contract, he wears no uniform, he receives no pay, he performs no services, he can't be sent to war, he has none of the incidence of a member in the status or a person of the status of a member of the military. 
    The Army itself, as I pointed out yesterday, has said he is not a soldier, and Winthrop said he is not a soldier. 
    But there is some indication or perhaps there is a third class, a class that is not entirely in the service yet. 
    He is subject to jurisdiction. 
    I think then that even if there is such a class, if the Court is not prepared to say that you're either in or out, if there is a third class, this man wouldn't fall on that third class because that third class apparently is predicated on the idea that his control over him is absolutely essential to the maintenance of military discipline. 
    Now, what is the -- what is the absolute necessity for having court-martial jurisdiction for a capital offense over a man confined in California in 1949? 
    The need isn't there. 
    This third class, if it exists, is a class that is based on need apparently. 
    That's the only reason for it in any event. 
    And if there is no -- in this case, there is no need nor in the case of a dishonorably discharged prisoner confined in the United States. 
    There is no need to set up a third class which is part military and part civil. 
    But I think, in my opinion, there is no such third class that the person is either in the status of a member of the armed services or he is in the status of a civilian.

    I thank you, Your Honor.
