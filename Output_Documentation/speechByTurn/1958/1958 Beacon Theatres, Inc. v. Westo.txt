Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover

    Mr. Johnston, you may proceed.

    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    If it please the Court. 
    At the recess I was in the middle of reading from the complaint in trying to demonstrate that there is an equitable issue posed by the complaint which could not, under the allegations of the complaint, be determined if in an action of law. 
    And if the Court will bear with me, I'll resume reading at the first of the sentence, I have started thusly. 
    And I'm reading from page 18 again of the record. 
    “That said threats and the duress in coercion upon the distributors arising out of and resulting from said threats of litigation, threaten to and have, in fact, deprived plaintiff and its said California Theatre of the right to negotiate for motion pictures upon their first-run in the San Bernardino area, and to negotiate for clearance over theatres in competition with plaintiff's said theatre upon said first-run, including defendant's Bel-Air Drive-In Theatre. 
    That plaintiff is without any speedy or adequate remedy at law and will be irreparably harmed unless defendant and its officers, agents, and employees are restrained and enjoined from instituting any action under the antitrust laws against plaintiff and said distributors, or any of them, based upon the facts hereinabove alleged during the pendency of this action. 
    And until -- and until such time as the Court shall determine whether or not the plaintiff and defendant have equal and correlative rights to license a prior run with clearance on behalf of their respective theatres.” 
    I should say also that the traditional hallmark of a suit in equity, that is the absence of a prayer from monetary damages, is apparent here in our prayer.N

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    I suppose -- I suppose counsel that if the issue of competition was resolved against you, that is, that there is -- there was a finding of competition that was settled in the lawsuit, wouldn't it, on the Paramount case? 
    Or if there's a finding that there was no competition, it would settle it the other way, wouldn't it?
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="164.873" stopTime="169.501">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    Not necessarily, Your Honor. 
    I believe that regardless --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="169.501" stopTime="194.329">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    What I'm getting at and perhaps you don't want to answer it at this time, but sometime I'd like to have your views on it. 
    Suppose that the -- just a general denial had been entered here, to this complaint, would or would not be, the parties, they would go to trial on -- before a jury in the declaratory judgment action?
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="194.329" stopTime="212.329">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    I would think not, Your Honor. 
    For the reason that the gravamen of the complaint constitutes or is constituted by the threats of duress, which we say were unlawfully exercised or wrongfully exercised.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="212.329" stopTime="214.058">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Because there was competition.
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="214.058" stopTime="396.555">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    Because there was competition. 
    Now, there is a collateral aspect to that, too, to answer your question fully, Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    I can conceive of the situation in which a party has the right to negotiate for a prior run without clearance. 
    That is, I can see that a supplier of motion pictures has, absent a conspiracy, the right to pick his costumers as he sees fit. 
    And that, I think also could be the subject of adjudication under this complaint heard as an equity action. 
    Now, as I say, the gravamen of this action is the allegation of threats and the effect those threats have had. 
    That is a fact to be determined by the Court sitting in equity. 
    As is the question of competition may very well be a fact to be determined by the Court sitting in equity. 
    Now, I must pause there and say that if an equity action is properly alleged, it's of course within the power of the Chancellor to decide questions of fact. 
    We can only turn to the -- or need only turn to the familiar examples of a specific damage or a specific performance, action based of the -- an action for damages on contract or an action to quiet title versus an action in ejectment. 
    Those two sets of examples present, and I could modify them, present situations in which the Chancellor and the Court or the law side of the Court have equivalent duties and equivalent powers. 
    So, I say here, simply because there are factual issues for the resolution of the judge sitting as an equity judge does not ipso facto deprive him of equity jurisdiction. 
    I'm of course stating obvious law but you cannot dismiss this complaint or characterize it as an action of law simply by saying there are various factual issues which under other circumstances might well be tried by a jury. 
    We've asked for a very narrow relief here. 
    This is not a substitute for an antitrust action in the traditional sense. 
    We've asked for only one thing. 
    That we be allowed to negotiate equally with the other party, with the defendant for a first-run with clearance. 
    Now, the fact this is --

    Except I must qualify that in the example that I, perhaps, put in perfectly to Mr. Justice Douglas, that I can conceive of situations in which either party might have the right to negotiate for a first-run without respect to clearance, simply on the proposition that a supplier and a purchaser can deal together outside of the Public Utility Law or some comparable field.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What -- what is your answer to -- to the argument of counsel that you did not follow the rules concerning injunction that you neither -- neither verified your complaint nor filed an affidavit?
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="472.865" stopTime="489.931">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    We did not pursue the summary remedies that are available such as getting a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction which we would have to do by affidavit or verify a complaint. 
    And I must go outside the record to answer your question fully, if I may.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="489.931" stopTime="490.814">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Good.
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="490.814" stopTime="741.531">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    The Court had set our case down for trial after these motions and so forth, as I recall it in July of 1957. 
    So that -- and we had constantly urged upon the Court, and this does appear in the record, that it set our case down for an early trial. 
    We -- we followed all the provisions of the rules, so far as I am aware of them, with respect to our getting an injunction on a full hearing. 
    We would have had to do additional things to secure a preliminary injunction or restraining order, I conceive that. 
    Now, going back to the matter, of whether or not this is in fact a substitute for the provisional treble damage action, I would say that the proof that it is not is found in the type of action that ultimately, the defendant filed by way of counterclaim. 
    In that, and the specifications of conspiracy that are there alleged are found starting at page 39 of the record. 
    Preliminarily, I should like to call attention. 
    This is in the counterclaim, to make it intelligible, of the defendant. 
    Preliminarily, I should like to mention that on page 39, in paragraph (e), it is alleged that for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a monopoly of exclusive, and I emphasize the word “exclusive”, first-run exhibition, and for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a monopoly of first-run patronage, three exhibitors entered into a combination conspiracy attempt to monopolize and so forth, as herein after alleged. 
    Now, that is much broader than the narrow thing we seek in the complaint. 
    We acknowledge that the defendant here has an equivalent right with us to first-run. 
    So, the adjudication of the issue put or posed in our complaint would be neither the defense to the charge that is made here in (e), or would it be necessarily adjudicated by a jury finding on (e). 
    We certainly, according to our complaint, have not sought and do not seek an exclusive first-run. 
    We simply seek, as I have repeated, perhaps ad nauseam, the right to negotiate equally with the defendant. 
    Now, following along with the various specifications, I shall try to paraphrase them and they're found at pages 39, 40, and 41 of the record, that the specifications are seven in number. 
    One, six, and seven charge a conspiracy among the three exhibitors there mentioned, to arrogate to themselves a monopoly of first-run exhibition in San Bernardino. 
    And in one of those specifications, there is broader language that says in other areas, I believe. 
    Specifications 2 and 3 deal with an allocation of product among the three exhibitors, sometimes called in the parlance of the industry as split of product.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="741.531" stopTime="742.519">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    A split of what?
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="742.519" stopTime="744.044">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    A split of product.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="744.044" stopTime="746.388">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh, yes, yes.
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="746.388" stopTime="903.594">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    That's an industry not a legal phrase. 
    Specifications 4 and 5 deal with imposing clearance in favor of the three exhibitors for the purpose of protecting the monopoly of first-run exhibition in those three exhibitors. 
    Again I say, and I answer that as I answered Specifications 1 and 2. 
    We do not seek an exclusive right to first-run exhibition, simply a correlative one and the right to negotiate for it. 
    Now, counsel has made some reference to so-called anticipatory suits citing the Di Giovanni case and perhaps others. 
    I think, fairly read, our complaint does not indicate the anticipation of a suit. 
    In the Di Giovanni case, the facts of the complaint or the allegations, I should say the complaint was that the defendant has threatened and is about to sue. 
    In other words, the eminence of a suit at law, which was to be brought, was apparent from the pleading of the plaintiff there. 
    There is no comparable allegation in our complaint. 
    We couldn't allege, of course, that the plaintiff did not intend to sue because that would render the allegations of the threat being harmful to us that are rather empty thing. 
    It is a question and a problem of -- and the anxiety or doubt as to whether the defendant would sue that gives rise to our cause of action. 
    As long as this club was held over our heads and was working, there was really no haste. 
    There was no real purpose in the defendant filing a suit. 
    The defendant was achieving its purpose by keeping us from the mark.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="903.594" stopTime="904.697">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Johnston, one of the thing --
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="904.697" stopTime="905.307">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="905.307" stopTime="934.203">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- that crosses my mind is this. 
    If your -- if your complaint did not have in mind that the threat included the possibility of them filing an antitrust case, why -- why did you ask in number 4 the pending final decision of the Court maybe restrained and enjoined from commencing an action under the antitrust laws?
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="934.203" stopTime="1032.920">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    I may answer that this way, Your Honor. 
    The possibility of their filing a suit was always present in our minds. 
    The certainty of it was not present. 
    In other words, we did not know whether or not a suit would be filed. 
    It was that doubt, that anxiety that permeated our thinking in the drafting of this. 
    But if -- if -- should eventuate that suit should be filed, which ultimately it was, then the prayer might have some force and effect. 
    Now, we perhaps may have conceived -- misconceived our remedy here, perhaps as Judge Pope pointed out. 
    What we should have done was to seek in our prayer not an injunction against a suit. 
    And I question, quite candidly, whether such an injunction would lie. 
    What we perhaps should have done in drafting the prayer was to seek an injunction against the continuation of the threats of suit. 
    But again, I can only say, Mr. Chief Justice, in answer to your question that there was a doubt as to whether a suit would be brought. 
    Had we been certain that suit was to be brought, we would have alleged as the plaintiff did in Di Giovanni that the defendant was about to institute suit. 
    And you will find no such allegation in our complaint.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1032.920" stopTime="1048.812">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Suppose there had been no threat but merely the filing of a suit, would you sought to restrain them from proceeding with that suit until -- until you could do that in adjudication on this matter?
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="1048.812" stopTime="1060.211">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    If in that suit we felt that we could not have adjudicated the right that we seek to have adjudicated in this complaint, we may have sought that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1060.211" stopTime="1070.768">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    We'll let's take the very -- the very pleading that we have here the custom of the counterclaim.
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="1070.768" stopTime="1085.654">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    I would say we would perhaps have sought a restraining order or an injunction pendente lite with respect to that suit. 
    We would have -- in other words, we would have sought the same order of trial that we now seek.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1085.654" stopTime="1091.251">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, wouldn't they then be deprived to the -- to have a right to a jury trial?
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="1091.251" stopTime="1091.983">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    No, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1091.983" stopTime="1094.394">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If you determine these issues first?
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="1094.394" stopTime="1121.647">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    No, Your Honor, because I say that the issues in the two suits that have actually been filed are so disparate that the jury trial of the counterclaim is not going to serve as an adjudication of our rights under the complaint nor of what -- what is found as a complaint served as a defense to the charges contained in the counterclaim.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1121.647" stopTime="1139.506">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, but if you're -- if you prevailed on your -- your number 4, paragraph 4 in your -- in your complaint and they had been restrained from filing such a damage suit, you -- you would've effectively blocked them from having such cause of action, wouldn't you?
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="1139.506" stopTime="1153.575">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    It's just pendente lite during the pendency of this suit. 
    After that, they could've filed a suit if they did file and have a full determination by the jury of the issues that are -- there presented in their counterclaim.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1153.575" stopTime="1153.834">

    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    Oh, no, we couldn't and didn't intend to ask for a permanent injunction against a filing of the suit perpetually by the defendant. 
    And as I say, it would be an abuse, I think of any court's discretion to or power to grant such an injunction.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1203.425" stopTime="1223.543">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But I think where I'm confused is if you had been granted all the relief that you sought in your complaint, would these people have been -- had available to them a legal action for -- for damages for the things they claimed in their counterclaim?
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="1223.543" stopTime="1254.306">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    They would. 
    Without equivocation, I'd say they would. 
    There would be no estoppel, adjudication, res adjudication -- res judicata of their rights. 
    They would be entitled to go forward with their complaint or I should say their counterclaim or if they filed it independently a complaint alleging the same things that they have alleged.

    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    It -- speaking in general terms, yes, Your Honor. 
    But I'm speaking in terms of competition between two specific theatres. 
    Every antitrust action, of course, is based upon a restraint of competition. 
    But we asked the Court to as an incident of our right for relief from its duress to determine whether there was competition in the technical sense, whether two theatres were drawing from the same pool of patronage. 
    That's the sense in which I use competition. 
    In that limited sense, not in the broad general sense, restraint of competition as it's commonly used in -- in private -- treble damage suits.

    Well, if -- if I answer the last question first, at least we might've been able to have purchased product from the distributors rather than having the door shut in our face because I assumed that the defendant would respect the order of the Court to desist from the threats that they would sue or -- or it would sue the distributors if they talk to us about getting first-run pictures.

    “And that plaintiff will be subjected to an action by said defendant for treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.” 
    Now, what that action might be, what it might specify as a conspiracy is -- was unknown at the time of the complaint, but as I have just tried to indicate, the counterclaim goes beyond and is broader than the issues, we have sought to have determined in our complaint. 
    The counterclaim, as I have tried to point out, has as -- it's not the arrogation to Fox West Coast, specific drive-in theatres in Stanley-Warner of the monopoly of first-run exhibition in the San Bernardino area, plus allegations of allocation of product among those three exhibitors.

    Yes.

    That would be determined by our complaint. 
    Did they draw from the same pool of patronage? 
    Now, whether a conspiracy existed to give clearance, either whether competition is found to exist, or is not found to exist, would still have to be determined under number 1 here. 
    That is the distinction I make.

    If the judge in the equity suit finds the existence of competition and instructs the jury that he has so found or it was brought to the attention of the jury in some way, that competition exists and they are not to pass upon that single point. 
    Now, if the defendant -- the counterclaim adherent, can show a conspiracy in the grant of clearance with competition, let me take one example which had been frequently urged. 
    Suppose every distributor granted a -- I'll pick a figure out of the air, 7-day or 14-day clearance. 
    Now, that would be a fact that would go to the jury as to whether or not there had been an agreement among the distributors and the exhibitor to grant a uniform clearance, whether there had been a conspiracy. 
    That element, that item is not determined under the allegations of our complaint. 
    We do not ask in our complaint at all to have it determined whether how much clearance should be granted. 
    We simply say, “Can we negotiate equally with the other theatre for a clearance?”

    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    For the reason I mentioned a moment ago, that equity, if it can assume jurisdiction properly, can decide on certain questions of fact. 
    And the chance that a suit may later be brought, which could litigate those same questions of fact, doesn't deprive equity of jurisdiction.

    Mr. Johnston, if the trial judge had accepted all the allegations in paragraph 12 of your complaint and had granted the injunction pendente lite at the outset of the proceeding, is there any reason why the remainder of the fact should not be tried to a jury?

    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    There are no other facts. 
    The facts that we alleged are so interwoven that once the judge had decided those facts, he had decided all the issues posed by our complaint because those issues are very narrow and very limited. 
    Were there threats?

    And that is the question of competition, whether the two theatres drew from the same pool of patronage. 
    That might or might not be an issue in the counterclaim depending upon -- and this I think is a significant thing -- depending upon which tact or how the defendant wished to present its case. 
    Now, that is one reason that I feel that this equitable action is a problem here. 
    The defendant can direct his order of proof. 
    Let us assume for the sake of argument that the defendant decides to prove a conspiracy simply to allocate product. 
    Then there are -- there are no common issues. 
    There is nothing that is in this complaint that we can have adjudicated in the counterclaim. 
    There is nothing that is decided in this compliant that would have served as a defense to that particular specification of conspiracy.

    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    Precisely, Your Honor. 
    Now, going back, Mr. Justice Harlan, to the question of mandamus here in this general sense, I don't know whether I'm foreclosed from arguing by the La Buy case, whether or not the Court should issue mandamus. 
    I will -- I -- I must say that there are some points of distinction which I do not wish to and I do not have the time to label. 
    I say only this that let us assume the power. 
    And I do not wish to concede it, but let us assume the power of the Court to issue mandamus rather than reviewing this by appeal which seems to me the orderly way to review this that I might digress for a moment to say why. 
    Because after this case is tried, we're simply in a pleading stage here. 
    After this case is tried or even partially tried, under the new appeal statute, there'll be a remedy available to the defendant, to come to this Court. 
    But now, talking again about mandamus, conceding the power, I simply say as it's well known to this Court, it's sparingly used and in only exceptional circumstances. 
    I do not think it should be used here to review the discretion of a trial judge who was simply following the mandate of Rule 42 (b) and arranging its calendar in a way that he deems appropriate. 
    I do not feel that the promulgation of the rules of procedure have abolished the traditional differences between law and equity. 
    Equity jurisdiction can still be invoked in the federal courts. 
    Now, I -- I cannot say more about the power of the Court. 
    I simply question it. 
    I say that mandamus here was not a remedy that should have been invoked.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2982.586" stopTime="2992.991">

    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    I think it should be the end of it for the purposes of this hearing, Mr. Justice Black. 
    It might not be on some further appeal. 
    This is not necessarily the end of this case. 
    If there is error committed now, which I do not concede, in fact, I think the Court has acted with entire propriety. 
    But it's if it should and I assume that you are thinking, Mr. Justice Black, of an amendment to the complaint to make it more nearly impinged upon the allegations or fit in the allegations.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3099.880" stopTime="3159.722">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, what I think about it frankly was this. 
    You have a situation where you have a constitutional requirement of a trial by a jury in certain cases, you have -- do you raise the question that some of these as -- issues can be put before it comes to the Court, that they wouldn't get a trial. 
    And if -- if the action is split up into two parts, one which they -- be tried by equity and the one to be tried by court of law, then you have a situation where you don't get a trial by jury on order. 
    It's capable of being amended. 
    It's part of a -- of a general controversial opinion. 
    What reason is that why in a declaratory judgment action aside from all of the other questions that have raised? 
    The Court shouldn't refrain from exercising its jurisdiction to split up a cause of action which may now and may come for it later and give a trial by jury or the facts of (Inaudible).
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="3159.722" stopTime="3170.091">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    Because, Mr. Justice Black, the alleged harm by reason of the fact we were not able to get motion pictures. 
    The judge said that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3170.091" stopTime="3180.641">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But that's because you can't -- you say that if it's left up in the air, the question must be decided. 
    Well, you are -- you -- you can get it decided, this question of whether you get it decided by a jury or the judge.

    All I see now.
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="3182.397" stopTime="3242.941">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    And the question of when, Mr. Justice Black. 
    For this reason, I think the Court can take judicial notice of the length of the ordinary treble damage action. 
    In our district, I think it is averaged around, in a motion picture industry, around six weeks or thereabouts. 
    Now, the issues framed by our complaint as I informed the Court were separately filed in July of 1957. 
    We asked persistently for an early trial date. 
    That is a reason, I think a sufficient reason why the Court can say you can have this matter tried in which you are alleging irreparable injury which -- which trial will consume a matter of two or three days before we can arrange the calendar so that there can be a full-blown hearing in a trial that may last six weeks or more.

    In other words --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3243.695" stopTime="3275.839">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You're right about the fact of the complaint. 
    I -- I had rather thought it covered here, both of it. 
    But if you are right about the fact they hadn't raised that issue and you only have it in that, what's wrong with the Court giving a trial by -- a jury trial in connection with the facts you allege in six weeks? 
    Or what is there about the rules or anything else that bars the Court? 
    It says that the statute, anything else, it says when you have a action for declaratory judgment, if you alleged some equitable grounds, you never can get a trial by jury.
speaker="frank_r_johnston" startTime="3275.839" stopTime="3288.845">
    Mr. Frank R. Johnston 
    Well, I -- I say that the Court -- the complaints should be construed as a -- a complaint in equity.

    Whether or not a jury can be -- had in a declaratory relief action depends upon the allegations of that particular declaratory relief suit.

    The Enelow case as I recall it, there was no such clause or at least it wasn't the subject of discussion by the Court. 
    Now, I -- I do not agree with the -- your position that in any case, a jury trial can be defeated by the device, if we choose to call it such, of -- of filing a suit in equity.

    If he has a true case in equity and if that case will not dispose of all of the issues which might later be brought or which might later be posed in a legal suit, certainly, then he has the right to have that equity case heard and heard when? 
    In the discretion of the Court, it's proper to hear it. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Jack Corinblit
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3467.208" stopTime="3474.232">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you Mr. -- 
    Mr. Corinblit, you may --
speaker="jack_corinblit" startTime="3474.232" stopTime="3578.582">
    Mr. Jack Corinblit 
    Your Honors, just briefly, I want to address myself to two questions, briefly. 
    First, I think on the question of our right to jury trial on the complaint standing alone. 
    It's clear that the counsel stands on the right in a court trial of all of the issues upon only upon the grounds that they pray for a injunction pendente lite against the filing of antitrust case. 
    And I submit that the tail cannot wag the dog in that way. 
    You cannot characterize a -- a complaint entirely as an equitable manner by an allegation of pendente lite relief or pendente lite relief. 
    Secondly, on the question of the relationship of the allegations of the complaint to the counterclaim, we allege that there was a -- one of the elements of the conspiracy was a conspiracy to grant clearance between these theatres. 
    If there were no substantial competition between those two theatres, that would be an unreasonable restraint of trade. 
    And on that fact, a prior decision by the Court will be res judicata on the counterclaim and will be vital to the allegation and the proof of the counterclaim. 
    It is not the only issue and we can see it, it isn't the only issue. 
    There are other grounds for relief or the basis of this -- and other acts in furtherance of the conspiracy which were alleged. 
    But it is an important one and an essential one with respect to the proof in this case. 
    And finally, with -- with respect to the question raised about, as to mandamus, I agree with Mr. Justice Harlan so that this matter can only considered by you in a mandamus question with respect to the matter of power.

    Mr. Jack Corinblit 
    I -- I realize that. 
    And I think that on the question of power, that the Court has in the past on the formula adopted, agreed that mandamus of -- there was a power of mandamus with the matter of jury trial -- is involved.
