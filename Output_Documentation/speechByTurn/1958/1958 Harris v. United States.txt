Harris v. United States

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 11, Nathaniel Harris, Petitioner, versus United States of America. 
    Mr. Glazer, you may continue.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="10.367" stopTime="182.387">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Before sitting down, I want to answer an argument of Mr. Murphy which he made in the Greene case. 
    Mr. Murphy stated that one reason why cumulative punishment might be imposed is because these two presumptions are different. 
    Now, this is an argument which he didn't make in his brief, and his argument, as I understood it, was that the import presumption applies whether or not the drug is stamped, whereas the Stamp Act presumption only applies when the drug is stamped. 
    It is our position in this regard that -- that in dealing with the import presumption, there is only one valid presumption which can be drawn. 
    In other words, if the narcotic drugs are stamped, even under the import presumption, you cannot presume that the person in whose possession the drugs are found knows that the drugs were imported contrary to law. 
    In other words, anybody who has a package of stamped drugs and if that's the only evidence, you couldn't sustain a conviction even -- even though this -- the -- the presumption statute is -- is broad enough to -- on its face to either apply to stamped or unstamped narcotics. 
    But anytime, anybody would have stamped narcotics in their possession, you couldn't sustain a conviction based on the presumption because they -- you -- the evidence would not show that they knew the -- the drugs were imported contrary to law. 
    The presumption wouldn't -- such a presumption wouldn't be rational, there wouldn't be a -- a rational connection between the presumption and the fact proved. 
    And in that regard, I refer to the Tot case where this Court said, it is not permissible to shift the burden by arbitrarily making one fact which has no relevance of guilt to the offense, the occasion of casting on the defendant the obligation of exculpation.In other words, the -- both presumptions are only applicable if the package is unstamped. 
    Now, under these circumstances, since the presumptions are alike, since the evidence is the same to permit double punishment, is to permit punishing the same thing by placing different labels on the same act.

    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court. 
    In this case, the petitioner was convicted of two offenses under the narcotics laws. 
    The offenses grew out of a single transaction which occurred on the morning of February 8th, 1956. 
    On that morning, the petitioner and two other people, another man and a woman, were in a room in St. Louis, Missouri and two officers of the St. Louis Police Department observed them through the window doing what is known in the trade as capping narcotics. 
    The petitioner was clearly observed by at least one of these officers.

    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    The officers not immediately being able to gain entrance to the room after announcing their identity broke into the room, but by that time the occupants had departed via the window. 
    Subsequently, the petitioner was arrested or at least he -- fighting out that he -- he was identified and -- and could be easily apprehended, he gave himself up. 
    Now, he was charged in an indictment containing two counts. 
    The first count was laid under Section 4704 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code which is set forth in our brief, of course, and that section provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense or distribute, narcotic drugs except in the original stamp package or from the original stamp package and the absence of appropriate tax paid stamps from narcotic drugs shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the person in whose possession the same may be found. 
    The second count was laid upon a violation of Section 174 of Title 21, which is a part of the Narcotic Drugs Export Import Act and that prohibits or provides that whoever fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings any narcotic drug into the United States, or any territory under its control or jurisdiction contrary to law or receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment or sale of any such narcotic drug after being imported or brought in knowing the same to have been imported contrary to law, or conspires to commit any such acts in violation of the laws of the United States, shall be fined and so forth. 
    For a second offense, which is not relevant here, Section 174 contains a presumption which is set forth on Page 4 of our brief whenever on trial for a violation of this subsection, the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of the narcotic drug, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury. 
    Now the defendant in this case was sentenced under the first count to a term of five years imprisonment.

    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    That is only fact which differentiates this case from Gore.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="698.634" stopTime="731.487">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In the Government's position -- this -- I'm not now saying it should be sustained, but is this the Government's position that the statute practically draws, once possession is proved, the burden of -- of explaining away any of the alternative condemnations of the statute upon the defendant? 
    The statute does so and this Court in several cases has sustained that presumption. 
    Is that the Government's position?
speaker="john_l_murphy" startTime="731.487" stopTime="731.802">
    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    That is exactly the Government's --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    To show --

    -- position.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="732.446" stopTime="734.161">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- that's all there's in this case?
speaker="john_l_murphy" startTime="734.161" stopTime="786.876">
    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    Yes and -- and, of course, in the Casey case this following language was stated. 
    “In dealing with a poison not commonly used except upon a doctor's prescription easily proved, or for a debauch only possible by a breach of law, it seems reasonable to call on a person possessing it in a form that warrants suspicion to show that he obtained it in a mode permitted by the law.” 
    So the -- the burden is upon the defendant once the Government proves that he had possession of the drug under Section 174 and under 4704 that he had possession of the drug and that they did not contain appropriate tax paid stamps. 
    The Government may call upon the defendant to explain his possession. 
    This is a -- a presumption which has been declared to be reasonably related to the elements of the offense.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="786.876" stopTime="804.876">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would your case be any different if you had, had counts for -- had convicted him for purchasing on the presumption, selling on the presumption, dispensing on the presumption and distributing on the presumption under Section 4704?
speaker="john_l_murphy" startTime="804.876" stopTime="805.991">
    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    Yes, it would Mr. Justice Black.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="805.991" stopTime="806.881">

    What would be the --

    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    We would not, we would not there contend solely upon proof arising out of the presumption that he had committed several different offenses. 
    The -- we could in an appropriate case charge a person with purchasing and with selling and with distributing, if we had separate evidence to prove each of those offenses, because we say that Congress defined several different offenses in each of these statutes. 
    But when it comes to relying upon the presumption if we must do that then it's only reasonable to say that the presumption can only be prima facie evidence of a violation of the statute, not of each element of the statute.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="856.317" stopTime="859.544">

speaker="john_l_murphy" startTime="859.544" stopTime="872.252">
    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    Well I think it's due to the language used in these presumptions, “Shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction.” 
    They must mean conviction of the statute.

    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    Well, we base it on the logic that the presumption is prima facie evidence of the violation of these statutes, not of each element. 
    And I -- I have no doubt that this Court would in such a case apply the rule of lenity to construe that presumption is authorizing only one conviction in that circumstance. 
    Now in the -- the Yancey case we have the situation where the defendant was convicted of two crimes under the single statute. 
    But there we relied upon the presumption for proof of the purchase and we relied upon explicit testimony for proof of the sale. 
    So we had two distinct violations proved by distinct evidence.

    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    That is correct. 
    Now, this case, we think, is indistinguishable from Gore. 
    In Gore, the issue was whether one transaction, there a sale, could support three consecutive sentences. 
    Here the transaction involved is possession. 
    But there is no difference in principle between those two transactions.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1544.259" stopTime="1553.717">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible) however, you didn't have to rely on the presumption, as I understand (Inaudible) affirmative evidence of a sale.
speaker="john_l_murphy" startTime="1553.717" stopTime="1554.451">
    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    That is correct.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1554.451" stopTime="1561.882">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Here, you have affirmative evidence which is nothing but confession and you rely on the presumption of the same conviction, is that right?
speaker="john_l_murphy" startTime="1561.882" stopTime="1739.049">
    Mr. John L. Murphy 
    Well, in -- in Gore, I -- I hesitate to get back into the refinements of that case. 
    But we did charge under the Stamp Tax Act and I do believe that we relied in part upon the presumption in that case. 
    But there was a distinct evidence of sale. 
    There can be no question about that. 
    Now, petitioner's contention is that he can't be convicted under these two statutes because he is, in effect, being convicted under the same evidence. 
    And, of course, this was an issue which was raised in the Gore case. 
    And I would like, first of all, to set at rest a question which came up yesterday as to whether there is a distinction between the Gore case and this one, because the Gore case came up on a 2255 motion. 
    Gore did come up in that way but it is a fact that Gore was decided on the merits and the record was before this Court. 
    In the Gore brief, I think it's at page 5. 
    There is a footnote which says, “The testimony appears in the certified record of the official court reporter lodged with the clerk of this Court.” 
    And certainly it's incontrovertible that the Gore opinion was bottomed on the fact that a single transaction was involved. 
    And it tells, of course, that Congress could make a single transaction violative of three different offenses. 
    Now, petitioner misconstrues the same evidence rule, which is used to determine the identity or differentiation between offenses, read quickly the same evidence rule, would we want to conclude that if you use the same evidence you can convict of different offenses. 
    But that, in fact, is not really what the rule means. 
    The rule in -- it is our contention, has to do with the elements of the effects. 
    The confusion results, of course, because the elements of the -- of an -- of any offense are defined usually in terms of facts. 
    And the cases speak about whether there is this proof of the same fact required or different facts. 
    And the primary evidence to prove those ultimate facts are usually very closely related, if need -- indeed identical with the facts necessitating a conviction under the -- the statute. 
    Here, of course, we are somewhat removed from the close relationship between the primary evidentiary facts and the ultimate fact which you usually find in a case, because of the application of the presumption. 
    But never --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1739.049" stopTime="1743.012">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    That's all you had to prove and you could have a conviction on that proof under both 4704 (a) and 174.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That was the whole argument in Devine is otherwise, even though it didn't say it, the usual presumption of mens rea applied, and all those cases go the other way, so that the real issue is this big issue which I try to say, isn't that true?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2223.810" stopTime="2246.849">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    I would think so. 
    Referring to the Gore case on page 4 of the Government's brief, the Government themselves pointed out that the evidence showed that Gore -- Gore, after selling to a narcotics agent, delivered the -- the narcotics to an agent in an unstamped package without use of any order form, so there is a big factual distinction between Gore --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2246.849" stopTime="2249.443">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In -- in other words, the affirmative evidence of all those elements of the case.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2249.443" stopTime="2315.313">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, in reference to the Section 174, although it says possession of drugs, stamped or unstamped, it makes no difference. 
    If, for example, by mistake, the Government stamped a package of heroin instead of some other drugs and somebody buy -- in -- I don't know about -- how but theoretically, obtained possession of them, they couldn't be convicted of -- of violating 174 even though that presumption applies to possession of both stamped and unstamped drugs because if there were valid stamps on the drugs, a man could not knowingly know if the drugs were illegally imported. 
    In other words, the presumption would be contrary to the evidence and therefore that part of the preemption is meaningless. 
    The only part of that 174 presumption to have any meaning is the -- that has to mean unstamped drugs.

    I've wondered if you didn't answer one question in the little paragraph.
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2318.876" stopTime="2321.561">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    Maybe I did, Your Honor.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2321.561" stopTime="2344.211">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Am I to understand from you that you think the only question here is whether under due process, this presumption can exist? 
    I thought you had the question that as to whether Congress, number (1) had or number (2) could prosecute one man twice for having possession of a drug?
speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="2344.211" stopTime="2475.807">
    Mr. Sidney M. Glazer 
    That was -- maybe I did answer the question too fast. 
    That was another issue in the case. 
    In other words, initially, in 1909, Congress imposed this import tax and then there came a decision. 
    Then the Harrison Act which dealt with the order form and -- and registration of narcotics drugs was enacted in 1914. 
    Then, subsequently, the Harrison Act, an individual was found in possession of drugs and the Court held that because he was a person who could not register under any circumstances, he could not be found guilty of having possession of the drugs. 
    As a result, Congress enacted the Stamp Act. 
    So, there is a -- a -- some question of congressional intent whether Congress meant for a conviction for -- for double punishment to be applicable if the conviction rests on both presumptions. 
    I think both -- both things are in the case. 
    There's a question of -- of due process, whether or not it's -- it's fair for this presumption to apply to both situations, I think it like it may be reasonable to shift the burden to the defendant for one situation, whereas, it may not be reasonable to do it for both. 
    In other words, there is a certain -- I think there is a certain inconsistency perhaps, in many of these situations where a -- they shift the burden on both counts. 
    It's one thing to say that the defendant should have to explain his possession.It's another thing to -- to punish him twice for situations which may be inconsistent. 
    And -- and it seems to me that it may be that while Congress meant the shift of burden to him once, they really didn't mean to shift the burden to him twice. 
    In other words, they sort of meant that if he can't explain, he should face punishment, but that doesn't mean that they intended that he should be punished twice. 
    It's a situation where I think the rule of lenity should apply.
