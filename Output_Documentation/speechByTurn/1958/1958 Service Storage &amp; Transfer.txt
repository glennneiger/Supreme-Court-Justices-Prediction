    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 92, Service Storage &amp; Transfer Company, Petitioner versus Commonwealth of Virginia. 
    Mr. McInerny, you may proceed.

    Mr. Francis W. McInerny 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case was on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. 
    Petitioner is a motor carrier holding operating authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    It conducts operations of principally between defined areas in the States of Virginia and West Virginia. 
    The State Corporation Commission instituted proceedings against petitioner which led to fines totalling of $5000 for transporting shipments between two points in Virginia through Bluefield, West Virginia in accordance with its interstate certificate as construed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    There were a total of 17 counts specified in the rule to show cause before the State Corporation Commission. 
    And at the hearing, in the submission of briefs there, they convicted on a total of the seven counts omitting three that the Government later confessed thereon. 
    So to summarize on that points -- on that point, Your Honors, there were 10 counts involving shipments moving from one point in Virginia to a second point in Virginia where the State authority has conceded that the operations were interstate in character. 
    Now, I believe that if I can make reference to a map that I have here behind me. 
    I may more quickly inform the Court on the facts and circumstances surrounding the growth or development of these interstate certificates and I earnestly state that an understanding of these facts, I believe, will make it easy for the Court to decide the question of law that's involved. 
    Here is Southwestern Virginia.Above the black line is the State of West Virginia and over here to the west or left is a portion of Kentucky. 
    Soon after the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act, a petitioner qualified as a grandfather operator and was issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity which generally describe and as is depicted here, permits operations between Bluefield, West Virginia and points within five miles thereof, on the one hand, and on the other points in Southwestern Virginia and described by this blue line and points in West Virginia. 
    Now, the Interstate Commerce Commission's --

    Mr. Francis W. McInerny 
    No, Your Honor, from Old Bluefield to Roanoke is about 54 miles. 
    This -- this would be about 54 miles, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="286.470" stopTime="290.412">

    The one inch to five miles that's the -- one is to five miles.
speaker="francis_w_mcinerny" startTime="290.412" stopTime="334.373">
    Mr. Francis W. McInerny 
    That's correct, sir. 
    Now, with respect to this first certificate of petitioner, the Interstate Commerce Commission has consistently held that a -- the radial authority of this truck authorizes the whole of thereof to conduct operations between the radial base which would be the Bluefield area here on the one hand and on the other any or all points described in the outlying territory. 
    That is, that it could pick up a shipment at Roanoke and deliver it in Bluefield or pick up a shipment in Bluefield West Virginia and deliver it in Bristol or Whitfield or Charleston, West Virginia. 
    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="334.373" stopTime="337.398">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    They pick up the shipment at Bristol and deliver it to Roanoke?
speaker="francis_w_mcinerny" startTime="337.398" stopTime="734.819">
    Mr. Francis W. McInerny 
    It could not, sir. 
    Later, I believe in 1943 Service Storage through a Section 5 application asking Interstate Commerce Commission to be permitted to acquire the authority previously issued to a gentleman by the name of (Inaudible) and he was the holder of authority described here in yellow that is between Bluefield, West Virginia enforced within five miles thereof and on -- on the one hand and on the other points in within 75 miles of this base area in Virginia and West Virginia. 
    Now, pursuant to the provisions of Section 216 (a) of the Motor Carrier Act, prior to the time that these two individual carriers were merged in one carrier, they were permitted to interchange or interline the track just as railroads and for the regulated carriers are permitted. 
    For example, a shipment could be picked up at Roanoke on the yellow certificate brought to the radial base which is the point in common to both certificates and then delimit, so to speak, on the blue certificate or pick up at Roanoke brought to Bluefield, West Virginia and deliver it at Charleston, West Virginia. 
    Now, getting to the actual operations that were involved in this controversy, I have drawn in an attempt at simplification of the whole problem, some of the halving of operations that have been conducted historically since the certificates were merged but certainly as the record discloses for a period of more than four years. 
    They had the -- a collection of LTL shipments as they say in the trade, less-truckloads, small shipments averaging, in my case I believe, approximately 400 pounds. 
    They would be consolidated at a terminal location at Roanoke, Virginia and move in line haul service or over the road service to the base territory Bluefield, West Virginia where the carrier has its principal terminal and some 74 odd units of equipment. 
    They also had operations coming down from Charleston, West Virginia into this area. 
    Coming up from Bristol, Virginia into this area moving through the same terminal so the result of it would be, you'd probably have 20 shipments on a vehicle, moving from Roanoke to Bluefield, 17 of them going on to destinations in West Virginia, and the remaining three going on to various points down on Southwestern Virginia. 
    It was stipulated on the record, there's no dispute about this fact. 
    And that is that all operations. 
    All questioned shipments physically moved from a point in Virginia out-of-state through the Bluefield, West Virginia terminal. 
    So, we have no problem of them -- in some cases where a carrier short -- shortcut its radial base or its so-called gateway point. 
    Now, the State of Virginia's evidence in this case consist almost exclusively apart from the conceded facts that we were doing this, of a map, an official map of Virginia. 
    And they take the position that operations conducted between Roanoke and Whitfield, since they have a percentage of security greater than the most direct highway through were illogical, none direct and the abnormal routes of movement. 
    Unfortunately, by using a map and picturing oneself as driving a car instead of working at -- worked through the transportation experts (Inaudible) 
    It is -- we are easily mislead by the security problem raised by the State of Virginia. 
    They contend that since there is certain securities in certain of these operations that the operations are a subterfuge to evade the State regulatory process. 
    We introduce evidence in this proceeding demonstrating that the operations conducted again, I take my example as Roanoke because it's the only large city in the area and it generates the most traffic. 
    From Roanoke to White Sulphur, from Roanoke to Bacliff, from Roanoke to Charleston all of these operations, Your Honors, are securities. 
    So also is the one that -- one of those seven to Whitfield. 
    It is securities for mileage and some cases is but twice as great as great as the direct route. 
    The reason why there was twice as great as the direct route in transportation handling is that in order to effectively transport a lot of traffic and conducting operations profitably, you must have a flow of freight as the only qualified express transportation witness stated in this proceeding. 
    He stated that because the flow of freight -- freight was moving towards Bluefield he could handle shipments down in Whitfield economically by moving them first into Bluefield and then later consolidating with shipments coming in from the north out-of-state points such as Charleston, West Virginia.

    In some cases yes, Your Honor, in another cases no. 
    Now, for example on Whitfield, Whitfield is either on U.S. Highway 11 or very close to it. 
    If U.S. Highway 11 extends down at Shenandoah Valley through Roanoke towards Bristol and it either passes directly through Whitfield or close to it. 
    So if the most direct highway route would be U.S. Highway 11, but if you only have 400 pounds shipment sent you don't have to go that way I'm not talking of this.

    Mr. Francis W. McInerny 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now, the State relies on Eichholz versus Missouri, a position in 306 U.S. 268. 
    That case involved that on operated transporting traffic by Motor Carrier Act from St. Louis, Missouri to Kansas City, Missouri through Kansas City, Kansas. 
    He was not at the time that apprehended by the state officials of Missouri, he was not the holder of an Interstate Commerce Commission certificate. 
    And all the -- although the Court recognized that the Commission under the Federal Motor Carrier Act which had just here before them passed, might authorize such a movement in this particular case that it had not yet been authorized and no jurisdiction had yet vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission to control the operations. 
    And accordingly this Court held or sustained the holding of the Missouri authorities to the effect that this was a subterfuge to avoid or evade state regulation. 
    Now, the -- the difference in Eichholz are on the facts wholly beyond the -- the question of Eichholz not being (Inaudible) holder are this. 
    Eichholz was handling the traffic at two-thirds of the rate that was prevailing generally within the State of Missouri at that time. 
    He converted the traffic to interstate traffic only for the purpose of making available two shippers a low -- a rate of 66 cents a hundred with a prevailing rate was something like 98 cents a hundred. 
    He consistently handled what we call volume traffic or truckload traffic, contrary to the type of traffic that we're handling here LGL distribution traffic to a -- rural area. 
    He heavily solicit this traffic whereas here there was no showing of any vigorous solicitation for this traffic only that it was in interstate commerce pursuant to interstate rates, pursuant to interstate insurance and all the tariffs were filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    We distributed those generally through the terminals in the area and it makes the case different on the facts as well as on the law from Eichholz. 
    We rely wholly on Atlantic Freight Lines petition for declaratory order and our own declaratory order.

    Yes.
speaker="francis_w_mcinerny" startTime="1523.335" stopTime="1953.424">
    Mr. Francis W. McInerny 
    -- the -- of the game, but there was no record evidence on it but the holding of was, I don't know, what the service facts is what I don't know either. 
    Now, in the precedent which we rely on presently, the Interstate Commerce Commission case involving Atlantic Freight Lines 51 M.C.C. 175, Atlantic Freight Lines was a carrier and authorized to conduct operations between Pittsburgh all over Maryland, Philadelphia and points in the upper east including New York City. 
    It conducted operations in the transportation of sugar from Philadelphia to McKeesport which is a point adjoining Pittsburgh. 
    The Pennsylvania authorities prosecuted or proceeded otherwise simply I believe against them. 
    And ultimately prohibited them from further transporting traffic between two Pennsylvania points when they were going out-of-state over this -- over to secure this route through Baltimore and Maryland. 
    After the -- the approval of PUC's order in Pennsylvania that case came up here on writ of certiorari which was denied. 
    The carrier then went to Interstate Commerce Commission under Section 5 (d) of the Administrative Procedure Act and asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to construe its certificate. 
    The PUC or -- or Public Utilities Commission of Pennsylvania intervened. 
    They became a party to that proceeding and ultimately the Interstate Commerce Commission said, “We have issued a certificate here, both points were on the routes involved even though it goes through Baltimore. 
    We have authorized it, is bona fide, that certificate is a final order and cannot be attacked collaterally in a state court.” 
    And, subsequent thereto, the Public Utilities Commission and the Atlantic Freight Lines in and then there were a consent decree which I have made an appendix to by in my reply brief. 
    The situation of Pennsylvania at least with regard to that carrier has been clarified. 
    And I think that it's very strong precedent that the -- the order and the report sustaining the order by the Commission is persuasive on every point and it does consider this Court's opinion and decision in my calls a case that became a -- came on 10 years before. 
    Now, in addition to the criticism that we may have of the decisions of the Virginia authorities, we'd like to raise the point developed in Castle versus Hayes Freight Lines. 
    The Interstate Commerce Act has, as you know, Section 204 (c) which permits State or any interested party to complain to the Interstate Commerce Commission if the State feels that an interstate operator is conducting operations in violation of its interstate certificate. 
    I think the strong suggestion if not actual statement in the Hayes case is to this effect. 
    Now, whether is a genuine problem, a dispute between carrier and State and it appears that the Interstate Commerce Commission has finally jurisdiction, instead of taking up the matter in their own forums, the State should first resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    On the State's reply brief they have suggested that there are so -- certain local aspects in this case and that accordingly that the order be given jurisdiction because of the local aspects. 
    The local aspects -- Your Honors, in this case are no more local and operations between Philadelphia and points of New Jersey, New York and New Haven they're 90 miles apart. 
    Some of these points in -- in Virginia are as many as 150 miles apart. 
    But on the law I believe the -- the cases that I've cited on my reply trial brief, Capital Transit cases where you held that the Interstate Commerce Commission had great jurisdiction over the -- over Capital Transit in spite of the fact that they didn't leave or that carrier didn't leave the District of Columbia, fully disposed of the local aspects, contention of the State in amicus curiae. 
    They cite in support to their contention the Panhandle case and the Connecticut Light and Power case. 
    Both of these same cases were cited by the same parties to this Court in the Capital Transit cases and no -- no reference is made to those authorities cited by the State of Virginia in your decision or in your disposition of the Capital Transit cases. 
    Moreover, and finally on the issue of local aspects, protection of local carriers. 
    Let's assume that there are so. 
    I know of one that served at some point. 
    But let's assume that there are some carriers.These carriers are assumedly, would have the most direct routes. 
    They would be able to operate more quickly, assumedly, or at least that's what the State asks this Court to accept. 
    Assumedly, they can operate on -- under lower rates because their -- their cost would be lower. 
    Then it would seem to me that they could capture all of these traffic which amounts to about $500 per week without difficulty. 
    Having the direct routes, I see no reason why they couldn't capture it. 
    But Congress must have recognized in defining interstate commerce as it did in Section 203 for intent of the act that there would be some effect on state operators. 
    And accordingly, I believe that they enacted 206 or the second proviso of 206 (a). 
    That proviso permits any Virginia intrastate operator holding a certificate issued by the Virginia State Corporation Commission, to mail that certificate to Washington with an appropriate application form, identify itself, to publish tariffs and it automatically is entitled to an interstate authority, coextensive with its intrastate authority.

    That the use of an indirect and abnormal right through another State is not interstate commerce protected by the Interstate Commerce Act and secondly, upon the ground that if it is interstate commerce within the protection of the Federal Motor Carrier Act, then in any situation in which the Virginia Public Utilities Commission makes a determination of fact, prior to the time in which the matter has been ultimately and dispositively settled by the Interstate Commerce Commission then Virginia has the right to regulate, at least, until the time the I.C.C. has entered an order which is contrary.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you saying that that is still a geographic designation and not a route designation?
speaker="robert_d_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="2609.953" stopTime="2709.958">
    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    That is a geographic destination, West of Highway 29 which is here and South of Highway 60 which is here. 
    Now, it is the position of the Virginia Public Utilities Commission which is our State Corporation Commission that if the goods originate in Virginia and they are destined for another place in Virginia and if in transit, they -- a circuitous route is used to take them through another State or as in this case not actually through another State but merely into a city which is in another State. 
    And then out again, when the normal and logical right as in this case of Roanoke to Whitfield is 80 miles across the base of the triangle down U.S. 11 on flat land exactly the case here. 
    When you look at the usual logical normal route between those two points and see that it is in Virginia. 
    And when you are faced with the proposition in which an interstate carrier is holding the same goods as shown by the record twice the distance, 160 miles from Roanoke to Bluefield and back to Whitfield. 
    Instead of moving in a generally southwesterly direction for 80 miles, moving in a westerly direction beyond the point of destination and then coming back that the fact that the origin and the destination points are in Virginia coupled with the fact that the route being used by the particular carrier is not the normal and logical route is sufficient to constitute this transportation intrastate transportation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2709.958" stopTime="2728.668">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Normal and logical. 
    Does that mean that you consider merely geographic distance and not transportation facts which may make the routing through the gateway points a normal and logical transportation transaction?
speaker="robert_d_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="2728.668" stopTime="2761.761">
    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    That was the view of the State Corporation Commission in this case, Your Honor. 
    Whether it had specific knowledge of other intrastate carriers moving down U.S. 29, this distance of 80 miles or knew from its own knowledge that this distance of 80 miles was the simpler with method insofar as economy of handling or are both the breaking points such as Bluefield, West Virginia. 
    That is not shown in the record. 
    So far as the record is concerned, the State Corporation Commission took the point of origin and the point of destination.

    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    They introduced evidence to show that for them that circuitous route could be used economically for them. 
    But if Your Honors, please that is one of the two points I want to make. 
    I understand that -- that it wasn't asked of appellant's counsel here, why was this done and was it done for purposes of economics? 
    That is assumed that it was done for purposes of economics. 
    The primary reason it was not carried from Roanoke to Whitfield is because he's not authorized by the Virginia Public Utilities Commission to run from Roanoke to Whitfield down U.S. 11.

    We did not challenge that before in this -- in the Corporation Commission, Your Honor upon -- upon the ground that without a certificate, there would not be any reason to ascertain whether or not this intrastate route could be used. 
    There would be no basis of comparison.

    It was heard on November the 29th of 1956. 
    It was decided the following February. 
    There were no proceedings pending before the I.C.C. at the time the Virginia Public Utilities Commission or our State Corporation Commission issued its order or had its hearing.

    On February the 26th, the Virginia State Corporation Commission entered its order fining the appellant in this case. 
    It came -- its opinion was rendered on March 21st. 
    The State's opinion was rendered on March 21st implementing its order of preceding February the 26th and it was not until March the 29th after, all of these had transpired, that the I.C.C. interpreted its certificate.

    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    If I may call Your Honors attention to the language on page 29 (a) in the middle of the page, it says petitioner, that is the appellant here asserts that the Virginia State Corporation Commission during the past several months has instituted proceedings against it for the purpose of penalizing it for conducting operations from one point in Virginia to another point in that State, notwithstanding the fact, that the shipments moved through Bluefield West Virginia. 
    Additionally, staff members of the State Corporations Commission's Office are said to have advised shippers and consignee's that transportation performed by petitioner in a -- the single line or joint-line service from one Virginia point to another Virginia point through Bluefield, West Virginia does not constitute interstate commerce and that they should cease tendering to petitioner traffic moving between Virginia points. 
    That also is currently defendant before the Virginia State Corporation Commission, a proceeding in which state enforcement officials contended that certain shipments handled from Virginia origins to Virginia destinations through Bluefield West Virginia are not interstate and accordingly cannot lawfully be handled by the petitioner. 
    That if you will turn over to page 30, you have the -- what we consider the heart of the order here. 
    The Court, the I.C.C. said this. 
    In the absence of any showing that petitioner's use of its authorized route is a subterfuge to avoid state regulation or other than the logical and normal operation to the carrier's headquarters we are of the opinion that petitioner's operations in the manner of described constitute bona fide transportation in interstate commerce. 
    Now, you will note that that language says that in the absence of any showing that petitioner's use of its authorized route is a subject used to avoid state regulation. 
    We hold that it is bona fide interstate commerce but there is nothing in this declaratory order which shows what operations the I.C.C. had under consideration when it made that determination or what operations the I.C.C. is referring to.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.

    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    -- in connection with that, Mr. Chief Justice.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="robert_d_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="3540.090" stopTime="3548.749">
    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    The first is the fact that the routes employed between Virginia points are not unduly circuitous or impracticable.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3548.749" stopTime="3549.066">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="robert_d_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="3549.066" stopTime="3619.384">
    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    Now, we have in this case 17 charges of violation in which the Virginia Public Utility Commission or State Corporation -- State Corporation Commission found a violation in only seven. 
    So -- and as they pointed out in their opinion, they agree that transportation from some Virginia points to other Virginia points may well be interstate commerce, subject only to the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission if the normal and logical route lies that way. 
    But on seven of them, Virginia found that those routes were not the normal and logical routes. 
    Now, there's nothing in this declaratory order which is all we have with respect to what transpired before the I.C.C. 
    There is nothing in this to show exactly which of the routes or if there is in fact a conflict between what the I.C.C. has said here and what the Virginia Public Utilities Commission found with respect with -- to this particular example, for instance. 
    They also said it is not unduly circuitous for one who must go through this point. 
    Now, we -- we will agree for one who must, under his I.C.C. certificate, go through this point. 
    This route is not unduly circuitous.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Voice Overlap) just a moment to -- right on that point to clarify something in my own mind. 
    It's true, is it not, that under the I.C.C. certificate which it had, this carrier could not have operated between Roanoke and Whitfield over the shortest route, over route 11?
speaker="robert_d_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="3637.325" stopTime="3672.890">
    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    No doubt, Your Honor. 
    You must go through Bluefield as gateway. 
    And that is -- that is the distinction between what the Virginia State Corporate Commission said and what the I.C.C. said. 
    The I.C.C. said this route is not unduly circuitous for one who must go from this point. 
    But the Virginia State Corporation Commission said, 160 miles over a mountain range rather than 80 miles down the valley is unduly circuitous for a businessman who would not be regulated. 
    They stressed the word “unregulated” no “unregulated” businessman would do that.

    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    The question in this -- and that is the question in this case Your Honor. 
    Whether this certificate which authorizes this transportation by the attacking of two particular grounds, does authorize this transportation between two Virginia termini over an --- a circuitous and illogical route.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3723.377" stopTime="3730.651">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You would agree, wouldn't you, that if the -- if the Commission wants to give them the certificates to go that circuitous route, then it's all right.

    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    I think that may someday become a question, Your Honor. 
    I will stipulate it for the purposes of this particular case because I don't think the conflict exists. 
    We take the point, Your Honor, that there is no conflict between what the I.C.C has said in this case or no demonstrable conflict on the record between what the Virginia --

    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    We say that Virginia may penalize this traffic. 
    We -- as I said we have two alternative values. 
    We say that Virginia may penalize this traffic in the first instance when there has been no final determination by the I.C.C. that this particular traffic is authorized by their certificate.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3786.693" stopTime="3791.436">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What you're saying is on that point is that the certificate didn't grant that.
speaker="robert_d_mcilwaine_iii" startTime="3791.436" stopTime="3809.275">
    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    That is then it could not be shown by looking at the certificate that it did grant that authority and it is not certain at this point whether or not even under the -- the declaratory judgment which was answered that the I.C.C. was actually passing on the particular case which the Virginia State Corporation Commission had before it.

    Could they have done in actual proceedings and leave no doubt about it. 
    Could they have done that?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is the record -- was your record before the Railroad Commission or your Public Utilities Commission before the I.C.C.?

    Mr. Robert D. McIlwaine, III 
    I have no way of knowing, Your Honor nor on the record does any member of this Court. 
    This Court knows what went on before the I.C.C. because of the declaratory judgment in this case. 
    That is all the record shows in this case. 
    I don't know what was before the I.C.C. and I most respectfully submit that no member of this Court can from the record determine what was before the I.C.C. 
    And I use that point in specific reference to the Atlantic case upon which they rely, the opinion in the Atlantic case for I.C.C. shows definitely and firmly that they were taking up exactly the same case which the State had taken up, that they were deciding exactly the same point. 
    That they were considering exactly the same route which the State had held the carrier could not go over and they were directly holding that under their certificate he could go over that route so that you had a direct conflict between the two. 
    Under the record in this case, no such conflict exist between the decision of the declaratory judgement although the I.C.C. with respect to the prior determination by the Virginia Commission that this traffic was in fact intrastate and could be regulated by the Virginia State Corporation Commission.
