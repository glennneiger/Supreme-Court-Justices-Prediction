    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 46, James E. Peurifoy, Paul V. Stines, Betty O. Stines, et al., Petitioners, versus Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 
    Mr. Dixon, you may continue your argument.
speaker="daniel_r_dixon" startTime="17.556" stopTime="211.868">
    Mr. Daniel R. Dixon 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court. 
    I have reached the point in my argument where I was about to turn my attention to the -- the meaning and definition of the word “personal” as it appears in Section 24 of the Code. 
    The word -- the -- the word “personal”, as used in Section 24, has two distinct factors. 
    The statute says that no deduction shall be allowed for personal expenses. 
    Now, the denial of the deduction is a legal conclusion and such denial should follow a determination at a particular expense of this person. 
    To restate, this means that, and to my mind and nothing but a factual determination of personal, should precede the legal conclusion of nondeductibility. 
    This seems patent from the statute itself. 
    Now, in the Commissioner's argument and in the Court of Appeals below, this is the method by which the conclusion of personal results. 
    Referring again to my previous reference that the Commissioner said this expense should be denied for the reason that petitioners are not away from home. 
    Now, the -- the deduction was originally denied for the reason that the expenses were classified as personal. 
    The -- the word “home” appears in Section 23. 
    The word “personal” appears in Section 24. 
    Now, they are finding their criteria of the -- of the meaning of the word “personal” in Section 23. 
    And the -- the logic of the Commissioner's theory then becomes this. 
    Under Section 23, the deduction is denied automatically once the doctrine is applied the way you work at your home because you cannot be away from such a home at work. 
    This is a logical impact. 
    Then they say the expense is personal. 
    In other words, they say it's personal because it's nondeductible as they have defined the word “home”. 
    The whole structure of 24 is thereby reversed instead of determining that the thing is nondeductible because it's personal, they first determined that it is nondeductible under Section 23 and then label it personal and this --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="211.868" stopTime="215.911">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, the concepts blend together in some extent, don't they?
speaker="daniel_r_dixon" startTime="215.911" stopTime="637.347">
    Mr. Daniel R. Dixon 
    Your Honor, I -- I say yes, provided the facts are kept clear, but this is done purely as a rule of law. 
    Requirement one under the Flowers decision says the expense must be ordinary and necessary. 
    Now, under the Commissioner's theory that we have only failed to meet requirement two that factually concedes that our expenses are ordinary and necessary. 
    Yet, at the same time they are holding that these expenses are personal. 
    Now, I say that factually, these are in conflict. 
    I turn to requirement three of the Flowers case. 
    Requirement three says that the expense must be incurred into pursue of the trade. 
    Now, again, under the Commissioner's theory, that factually concedes that my petitioners had met this requirement in a factual sense, and I also state that is factually in conflict. 
    And further, Your Honor, I do not think that the word “blend” correctly presents this issue. 
    I think this. 
    I think that since Section 24 is the section that was enacted to deny certain expenses that a factual determination should be made under Section 24 logically prior to a determination under Section 23 for if a factual determination is made, that expense is personal. 
    Section 24 strikes it down immediately. 
    There is no necessity to refer to Section 23 in any way because Section 24 says, “No deduction shall be allowed for a personal expenditure.” 
    Now, in the proceedings below, in the Tax Court, the criteria by which this matter was resolved and which has been used in other cases stated in brief on rare occasions, but has never been fully implemented was that an inquiry should be made to determine whether or not under the all of the factual circumstances is reasonable to expect demand to move his home to his place of employment. 
    Now, if under that criteria, which was -- which was developed in the Tax Court's decisions and which was reviewed by the entire court, Your Honor, they determined that it was unreasonable to expect our petitioners to move their homes to construction sites under these factual circumstances. 
    With that factual determination before the Court, then the question of the personal nature of these expenses were disposed of and the same thing is true of all of these travel expenses, the commuting situation which has complicated this issue ever since the Barnhill case. 
    Unfortunately, the Barnhill case realized that commuting in a sense, forces travel to get to work. 
    And they said, “We cannot reach the conclusion that a man's home is where he lives because of the commuting analogy.” 
    But there are two rebuttals to that, Your Honor. 
    The first is that commuting expense and travel expense must be separate and distinct types of expenses because the statute specifically permits the deduction of travel expense, but it does not permit the deduction of commuting expense. 
    The only thing necessary to clarify that particular phase of the problem is for the Court to make a preliminary determination if this is, is or not commuting expense and no one is arguing that commuting expenses should be deductible. 
    They have never been treated as an ordinary and necessary business expense. 
    They have been labeled personal and it's to pointed out in brief, I think, that this was an unfortunate and a fact to which contributes to the confusion here because by classifying commuting expense of this person and then analogizing commuting to travel expense, you get this word “personal” brought back in to the picture improperly. 
    It then obscures the element of choice, which, I think, is the fundamental issue in all of these cases whether or not these expenses result from the personal choice of a taxpayer or required by the needs of his business. 
    Our people have homes. 
    They're -- they tried to -- to stabilize their families, they have their children in school, all of these factors, and there are away from home in every sense of the word. 
    And on that point, one further thing, Section 24 requires an ascertainment of the difference between a personal expense and a business expense. 
    It does not require an ascertainment of the difference between a -- a deductible travel expense and a nondeductible one. 
    This is a matter which order in the Section -- the purview of Section 23. 
    Section 23 says expenses that are ordinary and necessary are deductible. 
    It does not permit all business expenses as deduction. 
    So the theory of 24 is to distinguish between business and personal expenses. 
    The function of 23 is to decide whether or not a particular travel expense is or is not deductible by meeting the three requirements which this Court has established. 
    Now, under this rationale of stating that an expense is personal because it is already been decided to be nondeductible, Section 24 is then emasculated and becomes nonfunctional because the result has already been previously determined under 23 so by this one theory, one principle of saying home is where you work, 23 is in the sense rendered nonfunctional and 24, both, are rendered non-functional. 
    At that point, then the so-called exception comes into the picture and the entire legal controversy revolves around what is temporary and what is indefinite and it is our position, Your Honor, that at this stage of the game, they -- that theory is completely out from -- on the both statutes. 
    It's running free. 
    It's fabricating its loss as it sees fit.

    This means there must be a direct connection between the expenditure and the carrying on of the trade or business of the taxpayer or of his employee. 
    Now, there -- there is a further rebuttal for that position, Your Honor. 
    The Commissioner, himself has issued a ruling to the effect that that was no long -- that that was not a proper restriction on the deductibility of travel expenses. 
    In his ruling issued May 4th which was in regard to construction workers, he said this. 
    “Thus, Flowers decision and those taking a similar approach to the extent they are all expenses or not ‘incurred in pursuit of business because the employer did not require the taxpayer to travel in order to perform his duties, do not constitute precedence to be followed in determining deductibility',” and so forth.

   Rebuttal of Daniel R. Dixon
speaker="daniel_r_dixon" startTime="1015.620" stopTime="1361.935">
    Mr. Daniel R. Dixon 
    I -- I have discussed this point in brief, Your Honor, but I do not believe I discussed it in reference. 
    I discussed it in abstract rather than in reference to this particular citation. 
    Now, Your Honor will permit, there are some other cases of -- of, I would say rather extreme judicial and administrative legislation. 
    I like to refer to the fact in the Whitaker case. 
    James R. Whitaker was an engineer who has a home in Iowa and he -- in his employment with a New York construction firm that we had a contract with the army that his employment carried him to Thule, Greenland and his employment was an offshore construction. 
    Now, Whitaker worked in Greenland a total of 222 days for the taxable year in controversy today. 
    He returned to the States twice during that 222 day period and the court said there, “Your work is indefinite and you are not entitled to travel expense deduction.” 
    This -- this need marks the outer boundaries of extremity in denying his deduction. 
    I would also like to refer to the fact in the instant case. 
    In the instant case, petitioner's assignment was conceded to have deductible expenses in regard to his employment in Charleston and in regards to his employment at Fort Bragg. 
    And one of his employments lasted three weeks, as I recall, and the other, seven and a half. 
    But petitioner's assignment was following the same pattern of working and living throughout the entire year. 
    His relationship to his employer was the same. 
    The manner by which he obtained his work was the same. 
    Substantially, there was no difference in his employment in any way. 
    The Commissioner has not argued that these are -- do not give rise to deductible expenses yet he argued at the same time that his employment at -- at Kinston does not give rise to this deduction. 
    One further thing before I leave what I can say -- what I am specifying here as illustration of -- of legislation outside this statute. 
    In this very case, there is considerable reference to the fact that my petitioners quit the employment on some of these occasions and the -- the apparent logic in this is that petitioners could have work longer. 
    If they had worked longer, then their work would have become indefinite and indefinite employment does not give rise to travel expenses therefore, they are denied this deduction because they quit the employment. 
    Now, this adds a complete new requirement for deductibility that so far as I know is new in this case and I think that, while I'm not going to dwell on the constitutional aspect, if -- if the tax laws of the country are going to be interpreted in such a manner that the fact that a man quits his job, results in a denial of -- of the deduction that he would otherwise be entitled to, I say there is a grave question there of infringing his right or infringing the Thirteenth Amendment regarding his involuntary servitude and it is pointed in brief but are not directly in point. 
    In the opinion of these cases, the language of the Court there says that a man had a right, an unqualified right to terminate his employment and I think that this throws the strong shadow over that right because he puts a -- a taxpayer in a position of having to stop and consider very seriously if he can terminate his employment without loosing his tax deduction. 
    Now, the cases have -- are -- are falling into the constant theme of the cases in the Tax Couth and the Circuit now is temporary versus indefinite. 
    And this thing is called an exemption and I would like to read respondent's language as to this exception. 
    He said this exception is ameliorated in nature and is apparently based on the theory that it is inequitable to call the post the duty to tax home if the taxpayer being there only temporarily is forced by economic circumstances to maintain elsewhere. 
    What -- my objection to this is that if you accept as valid, the principle that a man's home is where he works, then the little application denies all taxpayers to travel expense then the only thing that becomes valid is what is here called an exception. 
    And I think it's difficult to find a more -- clearer repudiation of the original principle than -- than this so-called exception which he says is ameliorated in nature and is apparently based on the theory that he says is -- is equitable in nature.

    Mr. Daniel R. Dixon 
    Oh, on the basis of the fact, I think the Flowers case brings a factual determination that these expenses were -- were incurred there as a result of the personal choice of the taxpayer. 
    That involved an attorney who had been retained by railroad but did not want to move his office to the -- to the railroad's main office. 
    He kept his home the way it had been before and conducted his affairs from there. 
    That clearly met the factual determination or sufficient facts for the Court to reach that result that this was personal in fact and once that determination had been reached, then, actually, the -- the expense became nondeductible under Section 24 immediately. 
    Although the Court didn't -- didn't place it under Section 24, they said you fail to meet requirements one or one and three which is failure to be ordinary and necessary and failure to be required by the expenses of the business. 
    In our case, respondent's theory conceives we have met requirements one and three. 
    This is an enormous difference. 
    There the result stems from the theory, the substance in all theory that where you work is your home.

    Well, they had to live, this is their trade.

    They have a local union that they go to for references and they maintain home adjacent to this local union headquarter. 
    When work is available near home, they sent near home. 
    When work is not available near home, they take the closest thing they can get. 
    When the work is over, they return home and this is the -- the factual pattern that these men follow. 
    They come home at every opportunity that they can and get work near home but someone has to move when construction work is involved.

   Argument of Earl E. Pollock
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1755.427" stopTime="1762.804">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may. 
    Mr. Pollock.
speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="1762.804" stopTime="1864.956">
    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    At the outset, I like to restate, if I may, just what the party is complaining about here. 
    Contrary to the impression which may have been conveyed, the question before the Court is not whether or not construction workers should be allowed a deduction for travel expenses in connection with out-of-town construction job. 
    On that broad question, both parties are in full agreement. 
    The whole controversy here relates solely to the extent to which this deduction shall be allowed. 
    Now, as Mr. Dixon pointed out on Thursday, most of these out-of-town construction jobs are of a short-term nature, requiring an employment only of a few weeks or of a few months. 
    As to employment of that nature, it is the policy of the Commissioner, and has been for some time, it is the policy of the Commissioner who has made every effort to be reasonable in this area to allow the deduction. 
    But these taxpayers are not satisfied with that. 
    They claim that they are entitled to this deduction for travel expenses including the regular cost of meals and lodging on an everyday, day in day out basis regardless of the duration of the construction project or their employment on that project.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1864.956" stopTime="1879.934">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Is that to say then Mr. Pollock that whether the exemption shall or shall not be allowed, depends upon the Commissioner's belief whether the period involved is a little more or a little less?
speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="1879.934" stopTime="2106.240">
    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    I think that the statute requires that determination. 
    The -- in fact, this Court even recognized in Flowers case that in connection with living expenses at a particular point as distinguished from expenses incurred while actually traveling, that the stay at this particular point must be temporary. 
    For example, the -- the Court said in Flowers case that travel expenses in pursuit of business within the meaning of this statute could arise only when the railroads business forced the taxpayer to travel and to live temporarily at some place other than Mobile. 
    The difference, Your Honor, if I -- if I may say, there's a difference between travel expenses which are allowed under Section 23 and living expenses which are forbidden under Section 24. 
    This presents a difficult determination. 
    Now, these taxpayers take the position that the amount of time spent on job is immaterial whether it's 20 and a half months, two years, three years or more. 
    Panama Canal, for example, took 10 years to build. 
    Yet these taxpayers are contending because construction work is in the nature of a temporary employment because sometime the construction job will be finished, that therefore, they are entitled to deduct all of their living expenses during that period. 
    And the -- the Commissioner, on the other hand, believes that the -- this deduction for traveling expenses under standards, generally applicable to all taxpayers cannot be expanded to that point. 
    Commissioner is faced with the problem of reconciling these two statutes. 
    Congress clearly had two purposes in mind, and if I may say so, the problem of finding the dividing line is not an easy one. 
    The problem arises in large measure because the typical taxpayer really lives sort of a double life. 
    In one sense, he's a seeker after profit, an income producing mechanism, has certain expenses incident to that, yet, in another sense, he is a human being with a customary human needs. 
    For example, we all have to have meals whether we're working or not, whether we're located at the particular time near our residence or not. 
    Now, this -- this kind of double life, this schizophrenia, is recognized in the Tax Court. 
    Here, we have Section 25 which allows to each taxpayer a $600 personal exemption for himself and generally speaking, for each member of his family. 
    Then we come to deductions and other provisions of the statute, Section 24 flatly forbids any deduction for personal, living or family expenses, except for extraordinary medical expenses. 
    On the other hand, Section 23 (a) (1) (A) allows a deduction for ordinary and necessary traveling expenses including the cost of meals and lodging while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business. 
    Now, the problem is to reconcile these two Congressional mandates which are not altogether consistent without doing violence to either one. 
    The test is in no sense an easy one particularly because of the Commissioner's obligation to apply the statute, so that a deduction is not allowed to one class of employees, which results in an unjust discrimination against other classes of employees who may be very similarly situated.

    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    That's essentially -- let me give you an example, Your Honor. 
    Let's suppose that you -- we have a traveling salesman. 
    There's no question that while he is away from his home office, he is entitled to deduct his travel expenses including meals and lodging. 
    But suppose he stays at a particular point, let's say at a branch office for six months, for a year, for a year and a half, when does he stop traveling? 
    And when does he start living there in the sense that the Section 24 prohibition against the deduction of living expenses comes into play? 
    These problems don't arise while a man is on the go or is moving. 
    The question is what kind of depth or exception can you make to this Section 24 prohibition against the deduction of living expenses in connection with this deduction which is allowed for traveling expenses?
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2183.287" stopTime="2215.666">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    But in context of it in the statute (Inaudible) didn't they say that all ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in a taxable year, carrying on any trade or business including travel expenses are also included in the entire amount expended from (Inaudible) while away from home in pursuit of a trade or business are deducted.
speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="2215.666" stopTime="2249.864">
    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    That's right. 
    There are problems -- and the Commissioner's problem is to apply that mandate to any -- to a multiplicity of different factual situations in the light of the Section 24 prohibition against the deduction of personal expenses. 
    The problem arises, again and again, where is the dividing line between living expenses which are nondeductible and traveling expenses which are deductible. 
    If I say if -- if these people were traveling, there wouldn't be any question that they would get a deduction. 
    The question or the problem arises, if you'll excuse me --

    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    -- when -- when the taxpayer stops at a particular point, for example, for 20 and a half months or two years or three years, is he then entitled to deduct every -- all the cost of his meals and lodging simply because he has taken a trip three years before?
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2269.524" stopTime="2298.639">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Perhaps not.

    You think it is?
speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="2330.941" stopTime="2438.772">
    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    Yes and the Commissioner, ever since 1921, when the statute was enacted, has uniformly ruled that home within the meaning of the statute means -- refers to business home. 
    The Tax Court has uniformly ruled ever and probably dozens of decisions. 
    Every Court of Appeals has so held since Court's Flowers decision. 
    Again and again, Congress has reenacted the statute without any basic change in the terminology. 
    In these circumstances, we think that the administrative interpretation must certainly be deemed to have received -- implied Congressional approval as this Court said of a related interpretation in the Flowers case. 
    Moreover, in 1952, this interpretation was given what we regard as further recognition by Congress. 
    In 1952, which was one year before the tax year involved here, Congress enacted an amendment to this statute. 
    This amendment dealt with the taxes of Congressmen themselves, members and representatives. 
    Congress provided a specific exception to the general rule as to members of Congress. 
    This amendment provided that the place of residence of a member of Congress in a district, which he represents, shall be deemed to be his home for purposes of this travel expense deduction, but only to the extent of $3000 a year and in addition, this amendment was made operative only for two tax years.

speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="2441.650" stopTime="2687.835">
    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    -- dealt with in our reply memorandum from pages 3 to 6 of our reply memorandum, and there's a lengthy footnote at -- on pages 4 and 5 which still refer to legislative history of this amendment and the legislative history shows very clearly that Congress understood the general rule to be that a taxpayer's principle place of employment was his home within the meeting of the statute. 
    Mr. McCormick, on behalf of proponents of the bill, quoted a great length from the Commissioner's ruling and those who opposed this measure and there was heavy opposition of the measure, particularly in the Senate because it was regarded by those who opposed it as a discriminatory tax advantage in favor of members of Congress. 
    It was their regard -- regarded as clearly, making a special exception of the definition of home for members of Congress. 
    Of course, Congress did so because of the special circumstances facing congressmen frequently after maintaining a double residence. 
    But nevertheless, this statute, we think, shows on its face, and particularly in the light of the legislative history, that it was a congressional understanding beyond any doubt that home, within the meaning of the statute, referred to principal place of employment. 
    May I say in this connection that the taxpayers have filed a reply brief in response to our memorandum setting forth this legislative history and the petitioners in this brief have set forth certain quotations from the legislative debates. 
    According to the petitioners, these quotations show just the contrary of what the Government has stated. 
    However, we are real bound to point out that the statements quoted in petitioners' reply brief are taken out of context and tend to distort what actually transpired. 
    For example, the taxpayers quote Senator Walsh during the 1921 legislative debates as saying that under this travel expense provision that Congressman would be allowed to deduct their expenses while in Washington. 
    On that basis, the taxpayers say that therefore, the 1952 amendment merely restored what was the original purpose of Congress. 
    However, the taxpayers have not read quite far enough because on the very same page of the congressional record, Senator Walsh was answered by Senator Watson of Indiana, who was apparently one of the floor managers of the bill, and Senator Watson stated that he had just discussed the matter with three representatives of the Treasury Department on the floor and they had stated to him flatly that the home of a Congressman under the statute would be regarded as Washington and that therefore, Senator Walsh is strictly in error in stating that Congressmen, under the original provision, would be allowed to deduct their expenses. 
    We think that if -- if this legislative history is read in context, I believe -- we believe that only one conclusion can come from there and that is Congress has accepted this Congress -- this consistent interpretation by the Commissioner and by the Tax Court, and as I say, by every Court of Appeals, which has passed on in question ever since this Court's Flowers decision.

    And under those circumstances, they held that the word “home” in that statute did not did apply -- did apply to him while he was in Mobile and not while he was in Jackson. 
    But here, you have men who lived at one place and he get that job from one point right around and radiate out from time to time, how can you say if that statute in any case has ever held that under those circumstances, maybe it shouldn't that he's at home every time he goes from these places even though he only works half a week or two weeks or three weeks?

    The whole effort is to ameliorate the impact of that -- the general requirements of this statute would have on construction workers.

    You say that if -- if it's a short time, the difference between a short and a long time, the taxpayer and to have his home considered not at the place where he work but a place where he came from. 
    Now, the Tax Court here has held then that these times were so short, going through these varieties of cases that as a matter of fact, the home was not where he went to work.

    But in this case, the Government was of the view, and I must point out that the Commissioner's determination in these circumstances is presumed to be correct that the Commissioner and the Department of Justice were of the view that there was no evidence in this record to support the determination of the Tax Court under established criteria. 
    Let me point out for example, Mr. Peurifoy here who is -- who is a bachelor, he has no family but has a beach cottage in -- near Wellington, North Carolina was at this particular point for 20 and a half months. 
    There has never been any decision under this statute which has ever expanded this conception of temporary employment to include that term. 
    In addition, the record does not even show how long this construction job took. 
    This record is completely consistent with a hypothesis that this construction job took five years and that these taxpayers could have stayed there for five years.

    Now, the Tax Court disagreed and in this decision went, as I say, further than any other decisions under this statute. 
    The Government appealed to the Court of Appeals and I say it's a rare case when the Government takes an appeal on a strictly factual question, the Government did so here on the ground that there was no evidence to support this decision by the Tax Court.

    I -- I think that there would be many cases if the taxpayers' sweeping contention were accepted that they are entitled to deduct their living expenses no matter how long they stay on -- on a construction job. 
    For example, there -- at the Oak Ridge Atomic Energy construction project, which took 4 years to build, I understand at one point, there were 45,000 workers at -- on that construction project. 
    There was a construction job at Portsmouth, Ohio, it also took 4 years. 
    According to these taxpayers, they would be entitled to deduct all of their cost of their meals and lodging if that contention was accepted. 
    I wonder if I could illustrate one reason why we think that this temporary employment exception has to be kept within reasonable bounds. 
    This deducts -- deduction cannot be viewed solely in terms to these particular taxpayers. 
    The deduction has to be viewed in terms of all taxpayers so as to avoid what would amount to an undue discrimination against other taxpayers with very similar situations.

    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    That's right. 
    Let's take Mr. Peurifoy who as I have said, he lives near Wilmington in a beach cottage which he apparently built himself. 
    He's a bachelor, he has no family there. 
    He went to Kinston in the hope of obtaining employment and did obtain employment there. 
    Let's assume that in the same car, with Mr. Peurifoy goes three factory workers. 
    We'll call them A, B and C. 
    Let's say that factory worker A has his home in Wilmington and he works at Kinston during the week and like Peurifoy returns to Wilmington on the weekend. 
    Even if this factory worker was to be laid off in a matter of six months, he'd receive no deduction at all for his transportation or for his living expenses. 
    This is essentially the factual situation involved in the O'Toole case, a Second Circuit decision in which Mr. Justice Stewart participated. 
    Let's take factory worker B, he, like Peurifoy, has no job yet but like Peurifoy, he's going there seeking to get a job and let's assume that he's laid off in this Kinston factory in two months, certainly, a very temporary period of time, but again he is allowed no deduction for his travel expenses either for transportation or for his meals and lodging. 
    The same thing is true even as to taxpayer C who has a job lined up at Kinston. 
    But again when he goes to take this job, he is not allowed any deduction whatsoever no matter how long he stays in Kinston. 
    And let's take the example further, Mr. Peurifoy is a welder. 
    Let's assume that he is assigned to work next to three other welders doing precisely the same kind of work. 
    Let's assume they have all their meals together. 
    They work side by side, we'll make them welders X, Y and Z. 
    X lives in Kinston near the site of this construction job. 
    He's allowed no deduction at all for transportation expenses, for meals or lodging. 
    Take welder Y, here, we have a true transient construction worker, a man who lives in a trailer and goes from construction job to construction job because he doesn't maintain a house somewhere like Mr. Peurifoy even though he has his entire family with him, he's allowed no deduction at all for transportation or for any of his living expenses.

    Increasingly, we're becoming a nation of city hoppers in that sense. 
    The same thing is true of welder Z who, we'll say, also lives out of town at the Greenville, about 50 miles away, unlike Mr. Peurifoy, this man drives-in in the morning and drives back at night. 
    He also lives out of town but he's not allowed any deductions at all for his meals or for his lodging on the ground that he is commuting and that is well established not in the statute itself but under an interpretation of the statute that commuters are not entitled to deduct any of these expenses. 
    Now, I'm not citing these examples to -- for the purpose of arguing that construction workers should not be allowed a deduction where they have truly temporary employment but I am citing these examples in an effort to show that this exception or this special rule must be kept within reasonable bounds so as to prevent undue discrimination against other workers, other lawyers as well, and in fact, other categories of construction workers.

    In a situation where an employee has a succession of employers and goes from one job to another, the Commissioner does not take the position that it must be in -- at the order or at the requirement of the employer.

    In this -- in this situation, the Commissioner takes the position that these expenses for the purposes of this exception are pursuant to the trade or business and does not oppose the grant of the deduction on that ground and in fact, the Commissioner has acquiesced in this temporary employment rule which was developed by the Tax Court even prior to the Flowers decision.

    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    I think that there may -- there may be a dictum to that effect but the -- the gist of the Court's decision, we think, is on record page 38 where the Court stated, “If we assume the validity of this exception to the rule of the Flowers case as applied to one not self-employed, it is essential that employment be temporary in contemplation and not indeterminate fact as developed and of course, then proceed to find that on this evidence, it cannot be said that the record supports it. 
    We think that's the -- the basic holding. 
    As to Mr. Dixon's suggestion that the element of choice is the fundamental question in this kind of a case, I'd like to point out that there is nothing in the Tax Court's decision and there is nothing in the record to show that these taxpayers went to Kinston because they are unable to obtain employment elsewhere. 
    So far as this record is concerned, they went there because they thought this was the best opportunity for them in view of all the circumstances. 
    And at the same time, I don't think it should be assumed that commuters necessarily have any great choice in fixing their residence. 
    There may be innumerable factors which motivate a commuter to live in one city and to work in another. 
    It may be the situation of the school, location of a particular position, innumerable non-business factors.

    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    We don't believe that it's the Commissioner's business to inquire into these private personal matters. 
    And in -- in our view, the -- the term “personal” as used within Section 24 simply refers to non-business expenses and has nothing to do with the reasonableness of moving -- moving one family. 
    For example, here, during the war in Washington, many, many people including lawyers came to Washington for the duration for temporary employment and this is all for patriotic reasons. 
    It maybe that because of the -- the housing facilities or for other reasons, they could not bring their families with them yet one court after another has repeatedly held that in those circumstances, living expenses on the part of the lawyer or the worker here in Washington would not be allowed under this travel expense provision. 
    There are numerous other examples of taxpayers who have non-permanent employment and who would not qualify under ordinary test for any deduction. 
    For example, a business may send a man to Paris for two years to work at that office. 
    Certainly if -- if -- conceivably, maybe unreasonable for that taxpayer to move his family there, he may maintain his residence in a -- in a particular State back home but nevertheless, this man's expenses while in Paris or abroad even though he's there for a short period but his two years is not allowed as a deduction under this travel expense provision.

    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    We think that in those -- although the Flowers case suggest that it must always be in the pursuit of the employer's business that we -- we think that the Court was their dealing with a -- a lawyer who has indefinite employment not for a short period of time. 
    And in the circumstances such as we has -- many construction workers have and they go from one job to another, the Commissioner takes the view that it would not be reasonable under the statute to say that those expenses were not incurred in pursuit of trade or business --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4454.895" stopTime="4455.068">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    But your --
speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="4455.068" stopTime="4464.841">
    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    -- because if the employer has something there, if they have been employed before they went to the construction job presumably, they -- they may very well haven't been deducted.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4464.841" stopTime="4477.269">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    The sweep of that concession, if we choose to call it that, their point of view is not limited to construction workers. 
    It goes across the board for any temporary employment where the -- the employment is found to be temporary.
speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="4477.269" stopTime="4516.752">
    Mr. Earl E. Pollock 
    Yes, and there are other examples. 
    For example, the educational expense regulations do not necessarily require that the expenditure be required by the employer. 
    So in some of these situations, the Commissioner has taken the position that it would not be reasonable to require that the taxpayer show that the expenditure was at the command or at the requirement of the employer even though Flowers seems to say that, has applied to that situation.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4516.752" stopTime="4535.772">

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    The -- your point should win. 
    In other words, if home means actual home and not home of the principle place of employment, then it would seem to me in view of your concession in these temporary employment cases, the third requirement of Flowers to wit that the -- that the travel has to be pursuant to the employer's business. 
    That, being out of the case, it would seem to me, that it would fall on that premise that the taxpayer ought to win here.

    In addition, there maybe -- the additional question of whether a -- there isn't a shifting of the home after a man stayed on a job for particular period of time.

   Rebuttal of Daniel R. Dixon
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4688.344" stopTime="4691.534">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Dixon.
speaker="daniel_r_dixon" startTime="4691.534" stopTime="4779.107">
    Mr. Daniel R. Dixon 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court. 
    The first thing that I want to offer vigorous dispute with is the position, the asserted position that we -- we take the position that regardless of how long the work last and how many are entitled to the deduction. 
    That is not our position. 
    What we do say is this, that irrespective of the length of the employment that that is a fact we should be taking into consideration in evaluating the necessity of the travel. 
    And further, that if the -- if the employment has met the requirements of being ordinary and necessary required by the exigencies of the trade or business that the duration alone should not deprive our taxpayers of this deduction in the absence of some extraordinary factors. 
    The point is that our people are trying to maintain stabilized homes just like everyone else. 
    They have to incur the double expense which is the heart of the matter and the expense would not be incurred. 
    Likely, it is -- it is an automatic deterrent and the tax benefit does not put in back in pocket, it only reduces the burden he -- he's having anyway.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4779.107" stopTime="4804.317">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Dixon, suppose at the end of this 20 and a half months, Mr. Peurifoy left his employment (Inaudible) and concluding that there was no work at his home, he took another job of similar character in the -- in the same community, would he still be entitled to his expenses?
speaker="daniel_r_dixon" startTime="4804.317" stopTime="4806.848">
    Mr. Daniel R. Dixon 
    You mean in the same community where he just finished his employment?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="daniel_r_dixon" startTime="4807.563" stopTime="4827.886">
    Mr. Daniel R. Dixon 
    I don't think so under those circumstances, Your Honor, for the reason that at that point, the question of him -- of it being reasonable for him to say that he should maintain his home where he originally came from would -- would change the complexion of the thing.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4827.886" stopTime="4844.056">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Suppose -- suppose he went back to his home and his union then sent him to another part of the country and where he would be employed on a construction job, say, for another two years, would he be entitled with that?
speaker="daniel_r_dixon" startTime="4844.056" stopTime="4927.564">
    Mr. Daniel R. Dixon 
    I think that under our factual circumstances, he would, Your Honor, because I think that there, the uncertainties of this employment, when you use our hypothesis two years, this is looking at it at the back end, but this construction work can be brought to a sudden termination by any one of the multitude of factors. 
    They take a job. 
    They may be there a week, they may be there several weeks or in -- on a few jobs that run into a year. 
    Under those circumstances, it's not reasonable to expect our people to keep moving their homes around and force them to become transient. 
    And they're talking about quitting the work as being a matter of personal choice. 
    But all -- all people quit their work as a matter of personal choice, but that's not the question. 
    The question is whether it's reasonable and necessary at the beginning of the employment for them to undertake this travel. 
    And further, referring to these suppositions about working beside one man who has a home in Kinston and -- excuse me, yes, a man who has a home in Kinston is not entitled to the deduction and our petitioners who live in Wilmington are entitled to it. 
    But that's the identical situation the statute created deduction for because in one case, the man has two homes and another case, he only has one. 
    And this is the very purpose of the statute.
