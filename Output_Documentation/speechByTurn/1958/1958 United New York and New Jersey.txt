    I think it's one of our --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It can't be if -- if jurisdiction would sustain there when it's not derived from diversity and (Inaudible) to say there was no diversity in fact.

    Mr. Lawrence J. Mahoney

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Very well. 
    I -- I can follow that argument. 
    But it does make a difference in the analogies whether on (Inaudible) or whether the cause of action to derive approximately, and then the question, if I may say so, put by my Brother (Inaudible) a question that has to be faced or met, namely, to -- in the federal court because of admiralty jurisdiction may you have to answer the question.

    Mr. Lawrence J. Mahoney 
    Well, I -- I must respectfully defer, Your Honor. 
    In my whole approach to this, I haven't felt that diversity or the basis for bringing the case into either an admiralty or civil court was germane to the issue.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="120.910" stopTime="130.024">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So the claim wouldn't stop with that proposition otherwise we'll get lost because we got very different considerations if it is -- if they're addressed to the problem in the cases.
speaker="lawrence_j_mahoney" startTime="130.024" stopTime="162.417">
    Mr. Lawrence J. Mahoney 
    Well, as -- as I understand the proposition, it is -- that if the Court is considering the right and the rules that are to be applied in determining it, it -- then -- I don't want to be redundant, but it must be decided in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which that right originated. 
    And that works both ways, in my -- not only in my opinion, but in the opinion of Mr. Justice Black. 
    And not to oversimplify it, but I -- I think that that states the problem and answers it.

    Right.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- as meaning that admiralty, a case which is enforceable and that rises on the high seas is rooted in the state law, rather than the federal. 
    As I understood his question, if we base on the assumption that there might be a difference, maybe I'm wrong, since here, what admiralty has done was to abolish its or to withdraw away from his whole idea in some instances that admiralty would not enforce a death claim, that it would enforce a death claim. 
    Therefore, the question is, if it doesn't enforce a death claim because it is allowed in the State, does it enforce it with all the limitations of state law, does it enforce it, but only in -- with such limitations only, as in accordance with and harmony with general principles of admiralty law.
speaker="lawrence_j_mahoney" startTime="224.351" stopTime="237.879">
    Mr. Lawrence J. Mahoney 
    Well -- well, isn't it so, Your Honor, that the existence of the Death on the High Seas Act indicates an intention to leave to the various States the determination of a Wrongful Death Act where it happens within the confines of the State. 
    Now --

    (Inaudible)

    Mr. Lawrence J. Mahoney 
    -- if I may say so, the Death on the High Seas Act is appropriate to your question, Your Honor. 
    In -- in the time that I have left, I have to completely skip over my second point, because it's in common with this Skovgaard case, which immediately follows, and that's the argument that the Death Act of New Jersey doesn't include or encompass unseaworthiness at all. 
    And I'll have to leave that one to Mr. O'Neil because of the time. 
    Now, I would like to take a few moments on our third question which is the one in which the Government has joined as friend of the Court and also the one which elicited Mr. -- rather Judge Lumbard's strong dissent in the Second Circuit, and that is whether the -- the nature of the employment of this decedent, completely apart from any of other considerations, entitles him to unseaworthiness. 
    Now, in my brief, I've gone through Sieracki and Pope &amp; Talbot against Hawn, we have no time for that now. 
    I can only say this about Halecki's work. 
    He was a shoreside electrician. 
    Most of his work was ashore. 
    He was employed by a subcontract, hired by the repair yard, which was not itself equipped to do the very specialized work that he had to do. 
    His work can only be done when the vessel was out of operation. 
    This ship had been a dead vessel for about two weeks. 
    The very nature of the work cleaning generators could only be done while the vessel's power was bought. 
    It was work, as far as we know that no seaman could ever do. 
    Seaman employed in cruise as electricians, do only maintenance work. 
    This was -- work so specialized that they had to take the seamen off the vessel, take the repair yard men off the vessel, in order to have it done.

    That's correct, Your Honor, but this was in the nature of extensive overhauling and repairs, not incident to the voyage in the same way that cleaning cargo tanks for example, or cleaning pitch from a cargo compartment. 
    We maintain that this was not incident to the vessel and that the equipment itself, I may -- if I may take 30 seconds, the equipment, itself, was not the type of equipment that was considered in the Patterson case.

   Argument of Nathan Baker

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Baker, you may proceed.
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="467.285" stopTime="629.917">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    Mr. Chief Justice -- please the Court. 
    A desire, if I may, at the outset, set forth some of the pertinent facts, not the detailed facts, but some of the pertinent facts which may be involved in the legal discussions which I expect to make shortly. 
    First, I'd like to bring to the Honors' attention that this vessel was in the waters, at a dock, in the State of New Jersey. 
    That aboard this vessel, when it's undisputed, at least, the facts supported, was the captain and four or five deck men, there was a full compliment of the engine crew and there, those men were doing maintenance work at the same time that this maintenance or overhauling work was being done by the shipyard men, during the entire time. 
    I'd like to bring also to, Your Honors' attention that the specification of repairs which is set forth on page 2 of my brief, sets forth that the crew, meaning the ship's crew, was to remove and replace the eight cylinder heads from -- for the port and start with generators. 
    That the very generators which were to be cleaned by this plaintiff, this Halecki, the very generator was removed and replaced by the ship's crew and then it provided in that specifications which spray clean with carbon tetrachloride. 
    In other words, the work to be done by this Halecki, the shore-side electrician, was to spray clean with carbon tetrachloride, so set forth in the specification repairs of this defendant, the vessel, and so ordered and directed by this defendant. 
    And it was known that it was a dangerous substance in confined spaces and it was for use in the engine room. 
    And not only was it known, but the chief engineer in consultation with the foreman of the deceased, agreed to have the work done on a day when the members of the crew won't be present. 
    And that was just suddenly when this occurrence occurred. 
    And they cleared the vessel of the members of the crew from doing all the work and they just had a watchman, a ship's watchman aboard, and they started to do this work.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="629.917" stopTime="630.637">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Baker is that --

    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="631.023" stopTime="640.437">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Can anyone say one way or the other, whether the -- in any sense that has concrete unambiguous meaning, this vessel was laid up for overhauling?
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="640.437" stopTime="655.046">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    I would call it laid up, Your Honor. 
    And not when the ship's crew -- in other words, if you've timed the word laid up, where the ship's crew was off, there are cases where the ship's crew is off, the vessel is out of commission; there's nothing being done except shipyard work, is not this case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="655.046" stopTime="665.204">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But why is this -- this vessel not tied-up to the overhaul and repair and not next week or the week thereafter, to be in operation?
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="665.204" stopTime="668.523">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    Well it was the overhauled, so in preparation, preferred operation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="668.523" stopTime="692.063">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now what I want to know is whether the law is clear. 
    But if there is law about which one can be definite, that if a vessel is laid up for overhauling and repair is taking out of service for overhauling and repair and tied up to a dock, is it that -- does adopting of seaworthiness can apply to a vessel in that situation?

    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    I don't think the law is clear on that.

    As long as it's considered a vessel --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="700.547" stopTime="708.943">

    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    Now, I -- I'd like to also to bring to the attention of the Court that Thompson, the watchman, testified and when they asked him what his work was, he says it was general overhaul and minor repairs. 
    I just bring it to Your Honors' attention to the purpose of any of the factual question that maybe raised. 
    Now, I submit to Your Honor, that it is unnecessary for me, I think, to discuss the negligence aspect of this case, the question of the negligence of the vessel which was submitted to the jury. 
    The fact the trial judge submitted to the jury on the two points, one is negligence; one is unseaworthiness. 
    And I'd like to bring to Your Honors' attention, which has not been brought out yet, that there was two cause of action here. 
    The first cause of action was the survival action, namely, for the rights of the deceased up to the time of his death. 
    And then in that action the jury bought in $2500. 
    And the second cause of action is the death action. 
    The right of the representatives, the widow and children in this case or the death of the deceased and that action the jury board in $62,500 and that's the verdicts in those cases. 
    And I submit to Your Honor that the evidence which is submitted on the negligence and the -- was sustained by a jury and that it be unnecessary for me to go into the question on negligence. 
    In fact the dissenting opinion by Judge Lumbard, also agreed that the question of negligence was one probably submitted to the jury. 
    Now, I submit to Your Honor, that the first question to be determined and that I'd like to argue before Your Honors, is, was the deceased in his lifetime entitles to the warranty of seaworthiness on this vessel? 
    That's the first question -- in his lifetime. 
    And I submit to Your Honor, that this man was a shore-side electrician. 
    And that, no electrician is certainly considered as members of the ship's crew. 
    And that under the Sieracki case, mean even though the work was puzzled out to other people, that the puzzling out of this work for a shore-side electrician does not deprive him of the warranty of seaworthiness. 
    So that -- and two reasons, first this electrician which I don't think it needs any extensive argument to indicate electricians are members of the ship's crew. 
    And secondly, the work that he was doing was maintenance work -- cleaning -- so what he was doing was cleaning these generators in the engine room. 
    And certainly cleaning, the maintenance work is essentially ship's work, and I submit to Your Honor that it's work not only traditionally, but actually performed by seamen up to present time. 
    I have included in my briefs some extracts of coast guard proceedings which I think, Your Honor, may take judicial notice where it indicates that this type of work is described to be done by the seamen that talks about use of carbon tetrachloride, the dangers involved and so forth. 
    And I brought it to Your Honors' attention in my brief.

    Now, if they use this carbon tetrachloride they're warned about the dangers of it.

speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="1224.150" stopTime="1526.828">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    Of seaworthiness and negligence. 
    I submit to Your Honors an illustration, a case decision by Judge Wright in a case of a shore-based plumber-machinist, where he's repairing a small pipe in a laboratory. 
    And in that case, Judge Wright indicated on page 22 of my brief, I may just read a few lines, the top of page 23. 
    "If the warranty of seaworthiness applies to landsmen aboard a vessel, performing work historically performed by seamen, it should certainly be applied to landsmen aboard performing work currently performed by seamen and I submit to our case is analogous that he's a plumber -- plumber fixing a pipe and he was his electrician not repairing, just -- just cleaning a mechanism. 
    And Judge Learned Hand has indicated in his decision in the court below and I think he can say it in much better language than I can, that he sees no distinction between the work being done by Halecki and the work being done by Hawn, in the Hawn Pope &amp; Talbot case. 
    And he thinks that the test is whether the work is of trying to traditionally the crew is in the (Inaudible) and as to that, it makes no difference that the means employed have changed with time. 
    And he therefore, felt that since the deceased would clean the ship, he was within the doctrine of Pope &amp; Talbot and Hawn, and he entitled to seaworthy vessel. 
    Now, our case or my counsel has not gone into, although he didn't agree -- gone at this very hill and a few other cases. 
    Our case can be distinguished from those cases. 
    First, we're not the driver. 
    Second, we were not in major repairs and no structural change was being made with just minor repairs and overhauling. 
    And in that case, in those cases, the crew was discharged. 
    In our case, the crew was on board, performed the work and not discharged. 
    And I submit that none of these factors appear, if they're material in our case, which would justify any decision contrary to our argument here. 
    And I go into my, the next point, if I may, on the question of the right to recover by the representatives of the deceased for the wrongful death. 
    Namely, here we have a situation where under the Hawn case, Pope &amp; Talbot against Hawn, if the person was alive and Halecki was alive, it's undisputed under that case, a decision by Justice Black, that he would have two rights of recovering, namely one, for negligence and two, for unseaworthiness, and I might add in there that contributory negligence would not be a bar, but the admiralty rule of comparative negligence would apply. 
    But here we have not a -- personally the case, but a death case. 
    And in order to recover under the maritime law, which is silent as to recovery for death, the wrongful death and the Court was required to adopt the Wrongful Death Act of the State of New Jersey, where this acts occurred. 
    And in adopting it, it then gave this cause of action. 
    And I submit to Your Honor that in looking at the New Jersey Act, which has been adopted under the maritime law so as to give it force and effect, we look at New Jersey Act, I submit to Your Honor that the Act has a referral clause in it. 
    In other words, it refers back to the rights which the deceased would have had if he had lived. 
    And that's on page 29 of my brief. 
    "When a death of a person is caused by a wrongful act, neglect or default, such as would if death had not ensued, have entitled the person to sue." 
    Now, referring to that such as clause as we termed them refers to the rights which the deceased would have had if he had lived. 
    We look at the Pope &amp; Talbot-Hawn case, the deceased would have had the right of -- abhor the rights of negligence and the right of cause of action on seaworthiness. 
    And I submit that under that recall clause, the representative of the deceased, the widow and children, are entitled to the same two cause of action, which includes this action for unseaworthiness. 
    Now then, the question arises is the Death Act of New Jersey, which is silent in using the word, unseaworthiness. 
    Have we say that unseaworthiness comes under the term, wrongful act neglect or default. 
    And I submit to Your Honor without arguing in great detail, that certainly, it means more than neglect because neglect is the negative cause of action and that the wrongful act for the fault can be and must be to construe to include the term, unseaworthiness.

    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    I'm going to come into that argument later, Your Honor. 
    I'll -- I'll come right into it. 
    Now, under the Jersey Act, we submit to Your Honor that it's a remedial statute. 
    And -- and there is a -- and there's a little construction impended of that statute and certainly it does not intend, we submit, to give to the deceased, the -- the representative, widow and children of the deceased, less right than the persons would've had, if he lived and the little construction of the statute which permits this recovery for unseaworthiness by the representative of the deceased.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1602.081" stopTime="1612.812">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Baker, hasn't this Court held or am I mistaken that the liability for unseaworthiness is essentially liability without any reference to neglect or fault, is liability without fault.
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="1612.812" stopTime="1614.709">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    That's right, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1614.709" stopTime="1630.429">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well isn't your New Jersey statute limited by the first -- very first clause that you read. 
    It -- it's limited death caused by a wrongful act, neglect or default, not by something that's not unconnected with fault.
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="1630.429" stopTime="1721.112">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    Well, I would say, Your Honor, that a reading of the statute, it won't block the default, is a -- that unseaworthiness is a tort, a maritime tort. 
    And that -- and I was just about to come to the next point in discussing the Justin case in New Jersey which Justice Brennan at that time was judge of the Supreme Court. 
    In that case, he argued and submitted an opinion that the construction of the -- this Death Act, in deciding the point which is of issue, was a construction that it included not only negligence, but all torts including breach of warranty. 
    And under that construction and -- and I think unseaworthiness which can -- it to be considered as a --- as a breach of warranty and therefore, would come under the unseaworthy -- would come under that Act of New Jersey. 
    I might say further and I quoted two -- in my brief, two English decisions which we all know that the Lord Campbell's Act was an English act and our New Jersey Act, many other acts have fashioned after it, and in the Zinc's (ph) the Court might be -- it indicates that each warranty is included within the recovery under the Lord Campbell's Act, which uses the same language. 
    So I think that under that theory and including Judge Learned Hand's decision below, that unseaworthiness comes within the Death Act of New Jersey, even though not mentioned in that -- in that language.

    Mr. Nathan Baker

    I -- I slip to Your Honor that irrespective of the construction of the New Jersey Death Act under the arguments I'm about to make if I have the time, that maritime law covers. 
    In other words, inasmuch as this Acts -- and occurred a ship, that maritime law is the paramount law in governance. 
    And that the only reason that it accepts the New Jersey Death Act is because there's a void in the maritime law given him the right of recovery for that, either by negligence or unseaworthiness. 
    And it fills it. 
    It adopts into the maritime law the state laws, so as to give this cause of action. 
    And I submit to, Your Honor, that when it does so and adopts it even without this referral nature which is not necessary in our case, but we have the referral nature of our case and we say that refers back to the rights you would have had, if he had lived.

    The characteristic of maritime law is not to give a recovery for damage.
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="1968.746" stopTime="1978.802">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    But under the maritime law, in order to give the recovery and to take the place of this void in the law, they adopt to the State Death Act in order to give this recovery.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1978.802" stopTime="1982.322">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you can adopt something that the State doesn't give.
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="1982.322" stopTime="2010.273">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    Well, you can adopt the part of this which gives the remedy and the right and where it's repugnant to maritime law, for instance, if there was such a clause or if there was a clause in the -- in the statute which says that -- that contribute their negligence apply, doesn't pay here. 
    I submit to Your Honor that being there it's -- with hostile, the characteristic feature of maritime law, it will adopt the part which becomes a part of maritime law and not adopt the part that's hostile to maritime law.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No, but in answer to Justice Harlan's question, are you in effect suggesting this all that you're looking to the state laws for is to determine whether it provides an action for wrongful death. 
    And if it does under wrongful death is a death actionable in any event to which the maritime -- general maritime law might apply. 
    The shape of the remedy depends upon federal law and not upon state law.

    And so all you look to the state statute for is the naked fact does the State or does it not provide an action for wrongful death and ignore everything else.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    After you did the recovery for death (Inaudible) shall exclude death as admiralty -- admiralty situation. 
    You will wipe that out because the State can't discriminate against giving recovery for admiralty situation, is that right?
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="2074.617" stopTime="2077.286">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    And I just as much don't like, I lost your question on the side.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2077.286" stopTime="2097.619">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If a State gives a recovery for death into the common law, Lord Campbell's Act, but qualifies it and as this part of it qualifies, so as not to apply for death resulting from unseaworthiness, that's an unfair discrimination against the admiralty law and that would drop out in the rest of the Lord Campbell's Act instead. 
    That's your position?
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="2097.619" stopTime="2149.549">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    I think so. 
    It says solely in this case of Just versus Chambers, and it indicates that it's repugnant and half of the characteristic features of maritime law. 
    And I submit to Your Honor that that doesn't apply in our particular case Halecki because under (Inaudible) cause of action under (Inaudible) the -- of the -- under the state act, it gets the same cause of action as the deceased would've had if he had lived and the representatives, the widow and children, would have the same cause of action, namely, the right of action for negligence and the right of action on seaworthiness and that contributory negligence would not be a bar, but the comparative negligence rule would apply. 
    Now, I don't know how much time I have, but I'd like to talk a little bit if I have time on the comparative negligence feature. 
    I submit to Your Honor that the -- the --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, now it's clear, isn't it, that in an ordinary united Jersey lawyers, I think, can agree upon this? 
    In the ordinary automobile death action, in the -- under New Jersey statute, there's no rule of comparative negligence.
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="2163.559" stopTime="2164.280">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    Oh, no.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2164.280" stopTime="2165.455">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That contributory negligence --
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="2165.455" stopTime="2165.960">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    Under land cases --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2165.960" stopTime="2167.740">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Voice Overlap) barred all recovery --
speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="2167.740" stopTime="2230.612">
    Mr. Nathan Baker 
    And the land cases contribute to make an absolute bar. 
    And if the contention which is made here on the defense, namely, that there is two rules to be applied in the case of the party, if he's alive on the Hawn case and the party to represent the widow and children case of a death case that we have here, we would have the judge charging the jury in this case, where there's one cause of action for the -- the survivor cause of action where the jury would pay $250. 
    He have to say to the jury, “This cause of action is on to this Hawn case.” 
    And it's a personal injury cause of action the same as if he would have to be alive and I'll have to charge the jury in this case, the recovery can be held only for negligence. 
    And contributory negligence in that case is not a bar, but comparative negligence rule. 
    But on the second cause of action with the death case, where the innocent wife and children who were not guilty of any negligence as far as they're concerned, his charge of the jury would be that being that it's under the Death Act of New Jersey --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, but the charge which the Court of Appeals sustained in this case that it was comparative --

    Comparative negligence.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2237.506" stopTime="2239.714">

    They'd have the maritime law, although the statute says what Justice Harlan implied that you can't recover from unseaworthiness.

    All right. 
    I might say that on the theory of uniformity that Justice Brennan has mentioned and which appeared from his decision in the McAllister against Magnolia Petroleum, I submit to Your Honor that on the theory of uniformity in order to get uniform law to have one law where the man is alive and another law where he is dead and the -- and the -- and where the representatives had sworn and to say that contributory negligence is a bar in one case and comparative negligence is another case, would certainly not lead to any uniformity. 
    And I submit to Your Honor that the Hawn case, written by Justice Black, which applies to personal injury case, should also apply to a death case, the same principles of law.
