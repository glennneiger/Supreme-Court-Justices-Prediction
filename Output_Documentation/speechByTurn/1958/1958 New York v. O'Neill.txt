    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    May it please the Court. 
    The question before this Court in this case is as to whether Section 942.02 Florida Statutes unconstitutionally interferes with the right of ingress and egress of a witness who is subjected to its terms in violation of Article IV, of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    This section is an integral part of a Uniform Act which is called Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses Within or Without a State in Criminal Proceedings. 
    The section which I was -- the Supreme Court of Florida held to be unconstitutional provides that when a criminal case is pending in a court of record of a State which has an active reciprocal legislation and the judge of that State makes a certificate when it -- a criminal case is pending or a grand jury investigation is either underway or is about to begin. 
    The judge makes a certificate to that effect and says in that certificate how many days the witness will be required. 
    They send that certificate down to the State where the witness is, which also has the same law. 
    And there, a judge of a court of record procures the attendance of the witness before it and he has two options as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Florida and it's a fair interpretation. 
    The judge, if there is a recommendation in the certificate that the witness be taken into custody and bodily delivered to an officer of the demanding State, the judge of the court there may, if he finds that's a desirable thing to do order such custody and delivery. 
    But even though the judge does not find in favor of that he may also -- he may issue a subpoena -- I mean a summons directed to the witness commanding him to go to the requesting State and there shall appear as a witness during the time specified in the certificate.

    Would you be good enough to tell us exactly what happened in the case before us from the beginning of the process or procedures to the culmination?
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="180.814" stopTime="292.202">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    Yes, sir. 
    If I -- there -- there's a debate that was heard, but actually this is what happened. 
    Mr. O'Neill was a resident of the State of Illinois. 
    His presence was desired in -- before a New York grand jury which was investigating the disposition of funds of certain union to one of which was the Distillery Rectifying Wine and Allied Workers International Union of America, and Mr. O'Neill, who was the president of that union, he's the chairman of the executive board and he is also the chairman of the welfare fund. 
    And his testimony -- and the -- and the investigation was -- was aimed at ascertaining whether there had been embezzlement or a conspiracy to embezzle the funds. 
    His testimony was deemed to be material and necessary and altogether at the question of misappropriation of funds. 
    Mr. Francis H. Clark, Assistant District Attorney, made an affidavit in which he outlined all of these facts. 
    He set up in that affidavit that efforts had been made without avail to procure Mr. O'Neill to come before that grand jury, to appear to testify. 
    It said that he had consistently refused to testify, that he had -- had rejected all of the pleas that have been made to get him to come voluntarily and there was no way to get him there voluntarily. 
    It was -- it was specified that they needed him for 15 days. 
    That certificate with Mr. Clark -- I mean the judge in New York --

speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="324.692" stopTime="395.285">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    That is -- that is correct. 
    The judge in New York made a certificate in line with the affidavit and annexed the affidavit to it. 
    And in that certificate in accordance with the terms of the Act of the law -- of the Uniform Law, he -- had option, that he recommended that Mr. O'Neill be taken into custody. 
    It would -- had -- as -- as a ground work though, the -- the affidavit showed that while they haven't been able to get him to come they had found out that he was going to be in Florida on a certain date to attend a meeting of his union. 
    The -- this certificate with the next affidavit was presented to a judge in Dade County where Miami is located and he had Mr. O'Neill taken into custody. 
    Then he released him on bond, to appear before him at a later time. 
    As time went on, the -- Mr. O'Neill assailed the constitutionality of the Act -- of the law.

speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="412.837" stopTime="436.874">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    No, sir. 
    There wasn't any subpoena served because there's got to be a hearing under this Act before the judge can determine anything about whether to give him a subpoena or -- or have him delivered to an office of the -- of the requesting State. 
    And -- and the judge held the statute unconstitutional and therefore, there was no occasion to -- to subpoena him to go to New York or to turn him over to an officer.

    And the --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    -- there was no subpoena involved in the case.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="487.962" stopTime="544.974">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    No subpoena actually ever was issued. 
    And the -- the court certificate which is made in order to clarify just what it did decide in the case specifically ties it to those two clauses of the Federal Constitution. 
    An appeal was taken by the people of the State of New York and the Supreme Court of Florida and it ruled the statute unconstitutional in both aspects as it being in violation of -- of Privileges and Immunities Clause because, says the court, it interfered with the freedom of ingress and egress of Mr. O'Neill or of anybody else that might be subjected to it. 
    Now, there -- there are many other things that occurred, but essentially, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I believe that it will portray the factual situation.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="544.974" stopTime="553.288">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Does ingress and egress mean of whom leave you now to the Supreme -- of Florida?
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="553.288" stopTime="729.928">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    I -- I suppose that's what our Supreme Court meant. 
    And I don't think anything you've said actually confined it to that. 
    You know the ingress and egress doctrine includes freedom of movement across state lines and within the State. 
    So that I think the doctrine embraces both the facts. 
    Now, that law provides that when the certificate is presented to the Florida judge, he must find that the witness is a material and necessary witness. 
    Not merely material but a necessary witness to. 
    And another thing he must find is that to subject him to the inconvenience of -- of having him to go to the other State to testify will not cause him undue hardship. 
    And, of course, those two things must be determined by the judge before he has any authority to proceed. 
    There are some doubts as to whether Article -- the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2 has anything to do with the case. 
    This Court said in Paul against Virginia that the sole purpose of the Act was to say to the States that whatever privileges you grant your own or establish for your own citizens, those you should allow the citizens of other States no more, no less. 
    And in Maxwell against Bugbee, this Court said the purpose of that provision was to prevent discrimination were allowed -- there's no discrimination manifestly because the law applies to residents of Florida as well as to citizens of other States. 
    But, I desperately say that I -- I have no doubt of the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment which protects the rights of national citizenship, it protects the right of free ingress and egress and I believe that if there were no constitutional provision on privileges and immunities at all, that it would be inherent in national citizenship that the right of ingress and egress would be inherent in that citizenship. 
    So we -- we start off with a proposition that -- that a citizen does have the right of ingress and egress, but that is not an absolute right. 
    Now, this Court said in Tumor against Witzel that -- that the -- the Privileges and Immunities Clause was not like many other constitutional provisions. 
    It was not an absolute. 
    And there isn't any question but what everyday a State's constitution that literally restricts the rights of free ingress and egress in various ways. 
    In --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="729.928" stopTime="749.983">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    This -- does this mean on the theory that your Court decided it that if Florida itself has arrested one of its citizens in relation to being a witness in a state court proceeding, a Florida proceeding, would that that kind of a statute be unconstitutional? 
    Because that's certainly --
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="749.983" stopTime="750.095">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    Because if I understand you --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="750.095" stopTime="751.223">

speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="751.223" stopTime="770.297">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    -- if I understand your question, I cannot attribute to the Supreme Court of Florida the thought that Florida express that the courts of Florida are powerless to subpoena a witness within Florida to come to the court without violating the Federal Constitution. 
    Is that -- is that what you're thinking of?

    They have a right to arrest him under circumstances which it required. 
    For example, he was subpoenaed because he doesn't come. 
    The Judge issued a bench warrant, send the sheriff out, and gets him and brings him in.Our court never has meant to say that. 
    I don't think they actually said it and -- and they wouldn't say it.

    I have never known of -- of it being done. 
    The only time that a man isn't bailable in Florida is for when the charge of a crime is where it's a capital crime and the proof is evident or the presumption great. 
    In all other instances, he is entitled to bail when charged with a crime. 
    He is not entitled to bail when he sought to be extradited as a fugitive from justice for example. 
    There's no provision to bail and our court has said he's not entitled to bail. 
    There is no appeal from one of habeas corpus adverse decision.

    What about the renditions, state -- interstate rendition.

    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    Oh, yes, indeed. 
    We are -- we operate under the -- under the federal extradition statute and we also operate under the uniform state extradition statute which goes into appeal not covered by the federal statute. 
    For example, Section 6 of our uniform extradition law provides that, for the extradition of a man who's not accused, the federal law covers all the fugitives. 
    A man who commits an act in another State and the one he's charged in which intentionally results in a crime in the State where he is --

    Well, he doesn't have to do that. 
    He can -- he can fail to perform his duties to look out for his defense. 
    And they could just -- we haven't had that decision in Florida but I have found decisions in other courts interpreting that feature which says that if that law is applicable to the man who flees and leaves his defendants behind, he takes care of him until he gets going and -- and maybe for a while after. 
    So he's not in the demanding State when -- when he actually quits providing for them.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1035.409" stopTime="1045.450">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You may -- may I suggest to you that that question however is being -- that kind of legislation is also being called into question before this Court.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="1045.450" stopTime="1046.038">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    I didn't know --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But we have not yet adjudicated that.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="1048.280" stopTime="1345.376">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    I -- I didn't know that. 
    I -- I -- would confidently urge if I were dissenting that legislation that it has a very sound basis. 
    I -- I want to discuss extradition a little bit later or somewhere along that line. 
    In Coppage against Kansas, this is Court recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment does not preclude an incidental restriction of personal liberty and there are ingress and egresses personal liberty where it is incidental to the accomplishment of a paramount objective in the public -- interest of the public welfare. 
    In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Lines Company against the State Board of Kansas, this Court said that the police power, and I believe that it -- the reserved sovereign police power justifies this Act. 
    That the police power springs out of the obligation of the State to protect the life, liberty and property of its citizens and to promote good order among other things. 
    In (Inaudible), this Court recognized that the police power was reserved in the States at the time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution that the Fourteenth Amendment did not interfere with the State's police power to adopt legislation which looks after the welfare of its people. 
    I think there -- there can be no question with what I said with this Court in Queenside Realty Company against SAXL, that the police power is one of the least limitable governmental powers. 
    Now, where -- where does all of that tie into this Act? 
    I think it ties in because it is a question of necessity which is involved. 
    Now, the State of Florida adopted this law, not for the primary purpose of helping New York or anyone of the other forty-one jurisdiction, the forty-three in all, which have adopted it. 
    That wasn't Florida's paramount purpose. 
    That purpose was to help Florida and the -- the investigation and prosecution of criminal conduct. 
    Florida had to give the other State the same consideration when it or the witness out of Florida that Florida was looking for familiars. 
    It just acts reciprocally. 
    Of course, no State would give Florida a witness and it was imperative that if we were going to get any witnesses from other States, we would have to give them like consideration. 
    Now, it is perfectly apparent that it is of no help to Florida to procure the jurisdiction over the defendant himself by either arresting within -- within his own bound or by extraditing from another State and then tell Florida you have no way of procuring a witness without which you can't prosecute this felon, where the -- the defendant himself, his presence is utterly valueless to a State unless it can get a necessary witness from -- from wherever he can be obtained under this Act. 
    And I -- I believe that it is just as important to permit the State to furnish witnesses to each other under this law as it is to furnish him a means of extraditing defendants whether he's a fugitive from justice or is non-fugitive. 
    The -- the matter is -- is one which must have legislation, if it's to be held. 
    There's no way that I can conceive of that two State or two or more States could arrange for swapping witnesses in the absence of legislation as along the lines of the Florida Uniform Law.

    Or even going next door.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="1480.234" stopTime="1833.032">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    Oh, that -- if it's any -- that if it's important enough to them, they -- they'll do anything. 
    I've even heard they killed some of them, to get him out of the way. 
    But -- but certainly, they -- they have no conscience. 
    They -- they (Inaudible) to do whatever it takes to keep a necessary witness from being available for the purposes of a prosecution. 
    And all they've got to do is shuttle him across the state line or if you suggest to Mexico and some they'll notice at the state prosecution where is -- is going on. 
    Because secure in the knowledge that so long as they don't let him get back across the line that -- that they have the State's powers to conduct a prosecution. 
    I -- I believe that -- that it's no less important, the States have a method of procuring witnesses from each other than it is that they have a -- a way of procuring fugitive from justice. 
    Now, this Court has dealt with extradition on a number of occasions. 
    Respondent's brief takes to position that there's no power in any State to legislate on extradition save as that power is conferred by the United States Constitution and statutes. 
    Well, that isn't what this Court said in Innes against Tobin. 
    The Texas case where the -- where the woman had fled from Georgia to Oregon, she was extradited from Oregon to Texas. 
    And according to the wording of the -- of the federal statute which I might point out is more limited in its scope than the constitutional provision would have authorized Congress to enact. 
    The federal statute authorized extradition only from the State to which she had fled. 
    And she had not fled to Texas. 
    Therefore, she could not be extradited under federal statute. 
    But in that case, Texas had a state statute which was invoked and she was ordered extradited under the state statutes which -- which was wholly undetermined and not authorized by the federal statute or Constitution. 
    And this Court affirmed that upon the proposition that the Congress, by not including a provision for extradition of that sort, had left the field open to the same place or they left the -- the authority in the same place where this was then before the words in the Constitution, that is, in the States themselves. 
    And that -- that decision was not based on anything at all except -- I mean it just -- it did one thing. 
    It upheld a state statute which was an independent enactment not dependent upon the federal law for its validity. 
    Now, in Kentucky against Dennison which I don't claim to be in point, but which I think has a good analogy, this Court recognized that even without the extradition provision in Article IV, Section 2 that the States would have had the right in their own self-interest and as an act of comity to furnish each other of -- of persons accused of crime. 
    In other words, make him available to the fugitive from justice for example without benefit of any constitutional provision. 
    The Court said that rather than -- than take the position assumed by the Government of -- of Ohio, on a certain point, it would have been better to have left that clause entirely out of the Constitution and left it up for the State to -- to have and no one else. 
    Well now, if the States -- and I think that case is clearly authority for that -- would have had the -- the power to enact legislation for the surrender of fugitive one to the other without any federal constitutional provision. 
    If they're to have that power, why then do they not have the correlative power to legislate so as to pass witnesses back and forth because without witnesses, there can be no defense against crime. 
    You cannot curb or -- or punish crime unless you got the witnesses to do it with. 
    Now, to get a -- a hold to these venues of that -- that you mentioned, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, about the uniform state of extradition law, I believe that comes from the doctrine of Innes against Tobin. 
    That where the Federal Congress when in the first place, the -- the United States Constitution deals only with fugitives. 
    It does not say anything about it but -- and the statute likewise to this. 
    But take the Innes case and the -- and the Kentucky against Dennison cases together and they seem to mean that since it is not covered by federal law in any way, and since the States have the inherent power to do it while the federal law has not preempted the field, while then the -- they would have the right to pass that uniform state of extradition law.

    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    Yes, sir, I can tell you one. 
    In Florida, Section 942.01 gives some definition. 
    It -- the -- the uniform law as it was first recommended by the Conference of Commissioners on uniform state legislation, defined -- I believe that the word "prosecution" -- anyway, the -- the scope of that, is what it had to do with it. 
    And it -- it said that -- that you in effect -- the effect while that you could get witnesses in any prosecution or grand jury investigation and the Florida Legislature added the words, “held by the State or defendant”.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2090.873" stopTime="2092.277">

    Held by the State or what?

    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    Or the defendant. 
    I say that they added the words "held by the State or the defendant". 
    What they apparently meant was to try -- was to make the Act available to a defendant as well as to the State. 
    Now, of course, that part of it, insofar as the defendant's rights are concerned, would depend upon, if it -- if Florida wanted a -- a witness from New York for a defense in Florida, and if New York didn't -- had not added such a provision as that, why of course, Florida couldn't get him because there's no reciprocal operation as to that one thing.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Putting -- putting the question of constitutionality to one side from the point of view of -- forgive me -- of achieving the purpose in pertaining the objective of this uniform legislation, the power of arrest is almost essential for the mechanics of it, isn't it?

    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    Because you take in this case right here, Mr. O'Neill. 
    The chances are very good. 
    There's enough showing laid out in the certificate, and Mr. Clark's next affidavit to cast serious doubt upon whether Mr. O'Neill would have gone to New York if you just issued him a subpoena. 
    Illinois doesn't have this reciprocal Act, they have it enacted. 
    All he had to have done to get a subpoena was to catch a plane back to Illinois and -- and he would have been safe. 
    As long as he stayed out in Florida and New York, nobody could touch him. 
    Nobody could make him go to New York to testify. 
    Nobody could punish him for not obeying that subpoena. 
    So -- and -- and there are many instances I can conceive of. 
    For example, where a crime syndicate is put in the pressure to get a witness out of the state, if you don't grab that witness and hold him and turn him over to an officer, he isn't going to stick around just for being subpoenaed. 
    He'll -- he -- he'll leave the State and then you can't punish him for anything if he leaves the State and -- and leave you helpless.

    Or in -- in this case on what you've just told me, I didn't know.

    Mr. Reeves Bowen

speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="2309.860" stopTime="2393.946">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    Well, sir, that would impose a problem. 
    Certainly, if in a State which has enacted the law, it seems to me has put its stamp of approval upon the matter but I believe the -- what, the equivalent of Article 942.05, I think that's the section which guarantees him that the -- the right of arrest while on -- on social process while going through that State and -- and all the States have adopted it, it seems to me like or even without any expressed provision. 
    Let's say he came to Virginia, and Virginia has this law. 
    And the question arises in Virginia. 
    He -- he just asked again a writ of habeas corpus in the Virginia Court and he raises the question of what right does a New York officer has got to detain him in Virginia?

    It seems to me that it's about 40 or a little bit more but less than all I believe.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I suppose the one answer to my own question might be that whatever the situation as regards the intermediate State, that ought not to serve judicially of the Act of Florida that has taken him into custody which is all that's involved here.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="2597.362" stopTime="2774.225">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    I -- I -- don't think the other question is -- is necessary to be considered in this connection of this case that because no such question is before the Court as I see it. 
    Let me give you one more attack on this question of necessity for -- for -- getting the witness. 
    Most -- every one of the States have the confrontation which requires discretion of presence of the witness so that the defendant could confront. 
    In -- in most of the States I understand that that's backed up by a constitutional guarantee, by the State's constitution. 
    Well, if -- and you can't use a deposition against that no matter if you've got the one witness that saw the determinate -- shoot the -- the -- murdered person down. 
    And the only one that you can tie him to the crime at all maybe -- and that witness is in Alabama and we want him in Florida, we can't use the deposition. 
    We -- we got to get the witness into Florida. 
    And that's the way it is in most, all of the States. 
    Now, you might say of course, that that rule doesn't necessarily apply to a grand jury investigation, but it's my information that many of the States don't permit -- the law doesn't permit the use of deposition for venues. 
    We never heard of it in Florida, never heard of a deposition for a grand jury against the defendants at all. 
    It has bee been in our, I don't -- I'm not aware. 
    Now, the defendant himself can take deposition to be used at his trial but the State can't do this just to put the witness before him to confront him and so he can be cross-examined. 
    And there -- there is still another thought on that matter. 
    If you could use deposition in all similar proceedings against a defendant, they are noted for not being of anything like equal value to the life, flesh and blood of the witness who comes up before that jury, they can see him and hear the sound of his voice. 
    They can evaluate him and -- and could work on his testimony, yet utterly impossible in a deposition. 
    So -- so you take two educated people, one inherent liar and the other a person, a truthful man and you let them make a deposition and one of them lied about the truth, while another tells the truth, this usually -- they'll -- in the -- in the deposition and will disclose which one is the truthful man and which one is not.

    It mentioned that and -- and I made the argument there somewhat like a -- may get on the same general lines that -- that it would justify, as a matter of necessity, in order to enable a State to protect its citizens against crime and to preserve safety and good order of society. 
    And in endeavoring to cast it down on that, Mr. Justice Thomas who wrote the opinion made some observations which tended to give that and he felt there was nothing to my argument because it was also available to the defendant under this particular added clause in the Florida statute. 
    But whether it's available to the defendant or not, to my mind in the least, detract from the power of the State to protect itself -- its citizens against crime by enacting this law, regardless of its application to the defense.

    You may -- you may Mr. -- you may reserve your time, yes. 
    Mr. Cushman, you may proceed.
speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="2938.302" stopTime="3294.835">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices. 
    This, I consider a very important case. 
    In fact, I suspect it is a case important to the practicing lawyer, much more so, than many of the cases which reached this Court. 
    I want to call your attention at the outset to the fact that there are two aspects to the Act which is under consideration here. 
    First, is that aspect which provides that the judge in the demanding State may in his certificate recommend that the desired witness be taken into immediate custody and be delivered to officers of the demanding State to be returned to the demanding State, as a witness before a court or grand jury in that State. 
    The second aspect is, that which provides for the issuance of a witness subpoena in Florida, let us say, directing the witness to appear as a witness and testify before a court or grand jury while he's halfway in the State of New York. 
    Now, these two aspects of the Act were both passed on by the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    In some respects, the questions which I think control the decision of the Supreme Court, on the first aspect of the case, likewise of necessity would control the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida on the second aspect of the question. 
    I should like to discuss both aspects briefly. 
    In the first place, we are in this country, a union of states. 
    The Federal Government has certain powers and a field in which it operates. 
    I want to talk to you now about the constitutional power and authority of the States to adopt a law providing that a person, a citizen, who is not charged or suspected with having committed any crime in any State, may be seized unceremoniously and hauled off as a prisoner to a distant State. 
    Does that constitutional power exist? 
    I respectfully suggest to you that it does not. 
    In the first place, in the brief which I filed on behalf of the respondent, I have reviewed at great length, perhaps greater length than the circumstances might justify, the decisions on this subject of interstate rendition of fugitives from justice. 
    And I am of the opinion, and it was my conclusion that this authority from every corner, from every court have always held that the power of one State to surrender to a sister State even a fugitive from justice, is derived from and rest solely upon Section 2, Article IV of the Constitution of the United States and the federal-enabling statutes which were passed to implement that constitutional provision. 
    And it is my argument, it is my contention, that if he required that constitutional provision and those federal implementing statutes to authorize one State to surrender to a sister State a fugitive from justice, then surely a like authority must be required and must be necessary to authorize the seizure and arrest of a citizen not charged with any crime in any State and his transportation against his will in chains perhaps but certainly as a prisoner to a distant State, merely as a witness. 
    Now, Mr. -- the Attorney General, my esteemed friends on the other side has argued to you all about the difficulties of securing witness. 
    I'm aware of those difficulties. 
    But I say his argument proves that you must. 
    I suggest to you that no such power exists. 
    That is the power to seize and surrender a citizen charged with no offense to a sister State. 
    And if that could bring -- his argument were correct, I think there's a much more direct way to go at it. 
    There's a much more direct way to reach the same result. 
    If it can be so, if my friend's argument is valid, if the police for example, authority, then I'd say the very power that he invoked should be sufficient to authorize the State of Florida to dispatch enacting that the courts of this State shall have complete authority to issue a witness subpoena, to turn him in, in the courts of any State in this country which has enacted their law in such cases providing for the issuance of witness subpoena returnable in the courts of any other States.

speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="3296.010" stopTime="3297.471">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3297.471" stopTime="3315.545">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Did you see any invalidity in a statute in Florida which was provided, without saying or might incarcerate a witness, proximately about construing (Inaudible) and it was material to an action pending in court?
speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="3315.545" stopTime="3407.458">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Mr. Justice Whittaker, I would be less than frank if I've said that your question has not given me considerable concern before I came here. 
    But my answer is this, and I think this is the answer. 
    That within the boundaries of the State of Florida, in the enforcement of the laws of Florida, and in securing the attendance of witnesses in the courts of the State of Florida, it may be that the Legislature of Florida would have authority to pass for authorizing the attachment of a witness, authorizing a requirement that he give bond for a period in that State. 
    But, I suggest to you that that is no different than the question we have here. 
    And while I'm on the subject, today it was required of me that I refer to three cases which are in the brief: One is McLean against Mississippi in 95 F.2d, in which the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in its very clear language held, that when the limits of a State are reached, the official character of its officers drop from their shoulders like a cloak. 
    They're no longer officers. 
    In (Inaudible) another federal case which is cited in the brief, the Court held that when a sheriff in the State of Arizona passes beyond the boundaries of the State, his process turns to ashes in his hands unless --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3407.458" stopTime="3413.486">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Even including the ancillary of a reservation, or federal ancillary.
speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="3413.486" stopTime="3478.177">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    That is correct, sir. 
    You've asked -- noted Your Honor's point on that a little earlier. 
    That is correct. 
    In other words, its power to act as an officer in validity of the process exaggerates a distinct line. 
    Now, there is the difference as I speak of it. 
    So that, in my opinion, is the answer to Your Honor's question. 
    Now, as I was about to say, all of these cases hold that the right, the authority, the power of the State to surrender one citizen to a sister State has got to be derived, and doesn't derive, solely to this constitutional provision. 
    In fact, the Supreme Court of Florida, in an opinion of which I have the honor of the Court, said that if it were not for Section 2 Article IV of the Constitution of the United States, there would be no such thing as the interstate rendition of fugitive from justice. 
    And I think we are right, the Court dispose that --

    If Your Honor please, my reading of the authorities gives me this answer. 
    That this is a -- an attribute of sovereignty which the Government of the United States does posses, which it does exercise solely upon principles of political expediency I probably should say. 
    And in People against Hyatt in New York which was cited in my -- in my brief, the Court pointed out very clearly that no such power exists in the State of this figure --

    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    I -- I agree with Your Honor. 
    It sounds plausible but I suggest to you that the authorities hold that the States themselves possess no power as between themselves to surrender a citizen who is in one state to another unless it is under -- and that's Section 2 of Article IV of the Constitution and the federal statutes, and that this is the only bridge between States on this subject of surrendering one -- a citizen by one State to another.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3584.128" stopTime="3598.770">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I've put it to you but that question could not have been decided by this Court because there is a provision in the Federal Constitution so we don't know what the part of a statement of -- in vis-à-vis the other States if there had not been the federal -- of constitutional privileges.
speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="3598.770" stopTime="3692.904">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Well, I think that Your Honor may be correct in that respect and here's my only reply to you if I may give it to you, sir. 
    My only reply to you is this, that when the original Articles of Confederation were adopted, before the States became a State, before their fate became a federal union, this same provision in substance and almost word for word was in the Articles of Confederation. 
    And, according to the historic reasoning and the decisions that I've read it is indicated that the men who were in charge of the governmental affairs of the confederation realized that without a compact of that sort in the Articles of Confederation that there would be disposition on the part of some part that was not to surrender, disposition of another's to surrender and that this was necessary in order to make sure that these things were done and to promote the administration of justice and grant them in the courts between the several counties. 
    And this was carried forth into the Constitution of the United States in Section 2 of Article IV and hence, the authorities indicate to mean that this is the historical background for the proposition that the authority is derived from the Federal Constitution and the laws and acts to be implemented.

speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="3711.127" stopTime="3711.759">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3711.759" stopTime="3712.860">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    We can agree on that, can't we?
speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="3712.860" stopTime="3972.421">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Oh, most certainly, we agree wholeheartedly. 
    And may I suggest to Your Honor that one of the consequences of a more perfect union (Inaudible) by the Constitution of the United States, in my judgment was, to remove from the States any power to surrender citizens from one State to another, except in the instances provided in the Constitution of the United States. 
    Now then, I diverted there just a moment but the first point I want to make before I leave was this. 
    That this power to surrender fugitives from justice is a power which is, I believe, created and exists by virtue of Section 2 Article IV of the Constitution of the United States and without it, there'd be no such thing, any similar authority is necessary if citizens are not charged with any crime and that fugitives from justice are to be surrendered by one State to another. 
    Now, the next proposition I should like to discuss briefly is, that the Fourteenth Amendment for this, States to pass any law which abridges the rights of the citizens of the several States. 
    Now, all general statements are dangerous of course. 
    This is one of those statements which is likewise a dangerous statement, I realized. 
    However, one of the rights of national citizenship is the right to pass freely from State to State to pass to -- both are interstate, to stay there as long as you want to, go to another place in the same State, and to depart there from. 
    And I respectfully suggest that the discussion of this particular proposition by the Supreme Court of Florida is -- these very little to be desired. 
    Now, I think that Mr. Bowen perhaps has an idea a little different than I do. 
    As I understand that Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, it isn't simply a matter of discrimination, although discrimination exists certainly, discrimination between citizens of different States is permitted. 
    But, I -- as I understand it and from my reading of this, it comes down to this, that the rights of citizens cannot be abridged by the law of any State. 
    Now, I started the proposition in my contentions that the States have no power to pass such a law. 
    I was interested in one of the questions that was asked by one of Your Honors, about what would happen if they're going through a State that didn't have this law? 
    Now, let me talk about that for just a minute because I think it illustrates the proposition. 
    Georgia doesn't have this law. 
    But let us suppose that Alabama did have the law. 
    I don't know, maybe it does. 
    I think it does. 
    And suppose we started back with the prisoner in a car going to New York and they had him in handcuffs because they knew very well that if they ever turn him loose he would be -- disappears in a hurry. 
    So they get on to Georgia and the man decide if he's going to walk away from them. 
    They let him -- they take off his handcuffs and maybe he says, "Goodbye, gentlemen, I'm going." 
    Now, they have no valid process with the State of Florida because that is halfway the state line. 
    There isn't any process. 
    They're not officers of the State of New York because under the rule in McLean against Mississippi, (Inaudible) and these other cases, as soon as they step out, have gone to the State of New York, they no longer are officers of the law. 
    They no longer have the authority of the State of New York. 
    That has evaporated when they left the State of New York. 
    So they are only private citizens. 
    So we have a situation in which private citizens are undertaking to restrain a person having liberty, having in their possession no valid process of any kind. 
    What does it come down to?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3972.421" stopTime="3983.434">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But why do you it's no valid process assuming your other points have no merit? 
    The order under which he's committed to the New York officers by the State of Florida is a valid order of the courts of Florida?
speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="3983.434" stopTime="4014.100">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    But I respectfully suggest, Your Honor that under the rule in Pennoyer against Neff and under the rule in every case of which I'm acquainted and -- and maybe to some that I'm not acquainted with, the power and the process of the State cannot run beyond its border. 
    And when the -- when the process reaches the borders of the State of Florida as processed, it has evaporated. 
    It ceases to exist that process, and it's no longer effective as a process. 
    That's exactly the point.

    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Well, perhaps I misunderstand what Your Honor was talking about. 
    Here is my understanding. 
    The Supreme Court of Florida said this. 
    “Is it when this -- this process can't run beyond the boundaries of the State of Florida so that if the officers of the State of New York were in Florida, they're not officers of New York in Florida at all.” 
    They have no statuses also in Florida at all. 
    They're merely private citizens acting under an order of the State of Florida which isn't -- at least be effective after the state line is passed. 
    So that is the -- I submit to you they have no authority whatsoever.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4071.857" stopTime="4075.185">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And what would be the case of -- for an extradited prisoner?
speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="4075.185" stopTime="4203.721">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    There (Voice Overlap) -- now that point was made abundantly clear in McLean against Mississippi. 
    And the Court said this, in -- in renditions under the -- in renditions under the Constitution of the United States and the federal statute, if a sheriff is sent to get a prisoner, he goes to that foreign State not as a sheriff but as an officer designated to receive custody of a prisoner who is held under the process which obtained his validity from the Constitution of the United States and the federal laws so that by virtue of that, it does have force, it does have effect but his authority is not as a sheriff but as an officer under that process. 
    Here's what they said. 
    They said that extradition statute 18 U.S.C. Section 662 and 663 gives state sheriffs no duty or function. 
    The Governor of the two -- Governors of the two States handle the matter and the prisoners to be delivered to and returned by a specially appointed agent and not by the state sheriff or a United States Marshal. 
    Even though one who is a sheriff should be appointed such as he acts not as sheriff under his bounds, but as special agent to extradite at least until he has the prisoner in his custody in his own county. 
    When in this case McLean, extradition hasn't been waived went to Louisiana and took charge of Roy, he did it not because -- he did not because he could not exert the office sheriff in Bolivar County Mississippi, in Louisiana, and again in Tennessee he did not because he could not at either (Inaudible). 
    He has neither office nor color of office as a Mississippi sheriff while in another State where Mississippi laws were not enforced. 
    In such other States, he is only a private citizen. 
    Now, that's what I meant when I said the official character of a sheriff or a police officer, whatever you call it, evaporates at the state line.

    But I say that if that same process instead of being returnable would let us say, to the Circuit Court of -- to the Circuit Court in Duval County which is Jacksonville that said, that it's returnable if you plead at Highpoint, North Carolina. 
    I say that the invalidity of the process isn't a question of whether it's valid as far as the state line is concerned. 
    I say it isn't valid at all because the courts of the State of Florida as I understand have no power to issue process running extraterritorial -- extraterritorially beyond the limits of the State of Florida and no one is bound to obey.

    Unless the officer for the State of Florida was acting under process with extradition authorized by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, the officer of the State of Florida would have no more authority as an officer in the State of Georgia, North Carolina or Tennessee than any other person from any other State would have. 
    As a matter of fact, as he might be from Florida would not give the courts of Florida any authority to say to him, "You were because of our judicial or other by it require to act as an officer in the other States because the law of this country as I understand it says that the State of Florida cannot pass an act which has extraterritorial effect." 
    And so whether the officials of the State of Florida, whoever they might be, whether they might like it or not, they would be helpless in face of the proposition announcement, Pennoyer against Neff that the laws and judicial process in the State of Florida does run beyond the limits of the State of Florida.

speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="4754.287" stopTime="4867.124">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Well, I think if I may make a suggestion to Your Honor the -- the principle that you're alluding to, in my judgement, is quite different. 
    Let me illustrate it. 
    Suppose a court sitting in Florida had a case before it in which the disposition of property in California is involved. 
    The court in Florida may say to the defendant, “We enjoin and restrain you for making any conveyances of properties in California.” 
    And the defendant may say, “If Your Honor please, I deny your jurisdiction to make such an order. 
    I shall convey it, nevertheless.” 
    And therefore, and if he does so, and the court says, “My friends, we had you before the Court. 
    You are in the jurisdiction. 
    You are subject to our orders and you will be found in contempt." 
    Now, this very subject that Your Honor has alluded to, I suggest to you, is not entirely free from difficulties. 
    I don't believe that the courts are unanimous in expressing the view that I have just expressed to you. 
    I'm merely expressing to you what I think is perhaps the proper view. 
    But it's based on the fact that the respondent, the defendant is present in the Court which proposes to impose the sanction and it has the authority then to require your views of things and he is there to enforce it. 
    The same thing comes up frequently in Florida when the courts down there say to a man, “We enjoin you from prosecuting your suit for divorce against your wife any further up in New York, for example or in some other States.” 
    But this proposition that I suggest to Your Honors were not free from a difference of opinion. 
    I think the court in Florida has the authority as long as a defendant is there to make an order in personam, but if that defendant was not in Florida, if he were going to defend this --

    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Yes, sir. 
    But now, I don't think that the court in Florida has any authority to order a witness in -- to go to some other States. 
    I think that this took first -- what I'm talking about is the exercise of the court's power to enforce by enforcing its power of a judgment in rem or a proceeding in rem like an injunction, the performance of an act in another State because they've got jurisdiction and possession of the respondent. 
    And to make him do it, we'll put him in jail if he doesn't do it. 
    Now, that's the only -- and I think that's vast, the difference from ordering him to go to another State.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    He is not with the custody of such a witness when by order of the court, it is placed in the hands of an agent, sheriff or whatnot.

    Of the -- of the Miami Court.

    Is not the custody throughout the District Court's custody?
speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="4944.944" stopTime="5063.308">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    In my -- in -- in one of the decisions, not after borders of the State of Florida had tackled. 
    No, sir. 
    And I rely upon the decisions that I have referred to and on other decisions which were cited in the brief, one of which is (Inaudible). 
    May I tell you about that case? 
    In that case a man by the name of (Inaudible) was charged with an offense which has been committed in the District of Columbia, right here in Washington. 
    The Marshal, or whoever he is, in the District of Columbia sent the sheriff by the name of Chase (ph) down in Dade County a warrant and said pick up so and so, pick up (Inaudible). 
    We got a warrant for him. 
    And so they picked up (Inaudible) down in Florida and passed it and filed a habeas corpus and contended that they had no authority to seize him whatsoever. 
    The Supreme Court of Florida in discharging a writ of habeas corpus says that is correct. 
    If the warrant from the District of Columbia had been there, it wouldn't have been effective in Florida because it has no extraterritorial effect. 
    And unless it is under the extradition statutes, it would have no legal validity and no legal standing. 
    Now, I suggest to Your Honors that in view of the case dealing with this subject, will reveal that that is the situation so far as the cases are concerned throughout this country. 
    Now, it may be that there -- it maybe that it's necessary to make a change on that. 
    I don't know. 
    I'm almost persuaded from my learned friend on the other side that it is. 
    But I suggest to you that it can't be made within the framework of the Constitution by such a law as we have here, which is under consideration here.

    Well, I frankly confess that I am not enough of a constitutional lawyer to answer that question. 
    I wish I could. 
    I just don't know it. 
    But I would say this, taking Innes against Tobin, which is one of the favorite cases of my esteemed contemporary, all of these cases that he has cited and all of these laws that he has referred to have one thing in common. 
    All of them are in aid of interstate rendition of fugitives from justice, all of them. 
    Even the Uniform Act dealing with deserters who desert their families because in Florida and many States, it is a felony to desert a person, wife or children, and so even that is in aid of the federal power. 
    It may be that a statute which would authorize the interstate institution of witnesses, passed by Congress, would be likewise held to be in aid of the power to extradite fugitives from justice.

    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's where an American citizen living in Paris --

    Yes, sir.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- refused to heed a subpoena to appear as a witness in one of the courts to the district or in New York. 
    Now, what bearing do you think if any, does in that case has upon this situation, except that there we were dealing with the -- there, the legislation, we're dealing with an American citizen. 
    But there was a person who was living in Paris insofar as a mean -- physical means of hauling him out of Paris, they were beyond the power of this country, of this Government to recall just as a sheriff you say, his power will evaporate as soon he reaches the border of Florida, so the power of any American official evaporates except by -- by leave of the foreign country. 
    It has no power that this country can give him and yet this Court sustained a statute which said, "If he doesn't turn up, he shall be found in absentia, guilty of contempt subject to a fine of $100,000 and the forfeiture and the seizure of his property to -- to pay, to liquidate that $100,000. 
    Now, I've -- I've indicated that's with a citizen. 
    And therefore, if we have the case of a Floridian citizen or if this man that Illinois had this statute and you haven't -- not heeding New York request, default and with relation to Illinois who gives that this is lack of motive to the United States. 
    What do you say to that case?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Because as far as due process is concerned, what kind of safeguard were protected there, that are not protected here? 
    Because I think privileges, immunity or unequal protection is not for privileges, immunities and for myself I don't mind saying I think there's nothing in it because there is no discrimination. 
    Everybody gets the same deal, a Floridian citizen has indeed seen the difference with the others but I mean to see the difference in many other citizens. 
    Do you think the Blackmer case has no bearing after the egression of power over just the human beings who are freed from the possible physical control which is the ultimate power of sovereignty and yet he was subjected to a condemnation of contempt and the seizure of property worth $100,000 and all the stigmas as mentioned.

    Certainly it is but as to the people that are within it, and -- and constitutionally speaking, if a fellow wants to take advantage of sunshine and all the other favoring circumstances of life in Florida, then to that extent, Florida has some control over him. 
    And it -- it could be a response to the kind of things that is not without justification and -- and I have to press you insofar as due process is concerned by seizing somebody whom you had no control except within your limits of what greater -- what greater protection was there in Blackmer than there is here in saying, “You're within our State, you enjoy the benefits of it. 
    We have an agreement with the State of New York to our advantage in a cause that is morally a right and indeed had to be essential to the safety of a society in which you respond to the subpoena in court.”

    It doesn't even say that they ever personally asked him to come and that he directly refused.

    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Well, I think it's -- I think it's material in this respect if I may. 
    I think it's material because this application that the people of the State of New York from this proceeding was originally begun, didn't contain any kind of facts which would support any sort of a seizure of a person. 
    Now, I contend -- it is my contention that in order to sustain the issuance of process of a drastic nature such as the seizure of a person, that there should be facts stated to support the application. 
    Just like if you go to apply for an injunction, you've got to state the facts upon which to show the necessity for the issuance of the injunction. 
    And if it's necessary to state facts in order to support an application for an injunction, certainly, it ought to be necessary to state facts to authorize an application for the seizure of a person in a distant State and transportation back, if you please, as a prisoner.

    That's, as a witness, and that's about the only thing I believe the Court would entertain any kind of a hearing on.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And you -- you of course never had a hearing in this case because the circuit judge decided you will ride on your constitutional claim and that was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Florida.

    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    Yes, but to be frank with, Your Honor, I don't know what we would contend, for example, whether he would served his due process in New York or in any State to which he might go, does appear to me that he -- largely a question of law than it is a question of facts. 
    And the only other question that it would appear to me, it would be open for a consideration and discussion could be where it would constitute a hardship for him to go to New York. 
    And I suggest that to go to New York as a prisoner in custody of an officer and my examinations in New York decisions indicate that in this lack of investigation, the practice has been almost uniform for a bond around $200,000 or the -- the witness be in jail. 
    Now, in my brief filed with the Supreme of Court of Florida, I had adverted to that subject. 
    And of course I can very well see how he might get to New York when we say, "Well, Mr. O'Neill, we'll be glad to issue a bond higher while you're here, if you want to post a bond, say $200,000 that Mr. O'Neill couldn't post a bond of $200,000, they'd say well to the two with it, and when we get ready for him as a witness, we'll call him as a witness if you know right where he is.

    Can you give us the facts and your conclusion briefly?
speaker="l_j_cushman" startTime="6284.724" stopTime="6363.197">
    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    I can indeed. 
    When Mr. O'Neill came to Florida to preside at a meeting of the International Union, he was seized on an attachment, a body attachment. 
    He was taken immediately before the circuit judge. 
    The circuit judge ordered him released upon giving a bond, condition that he would appear at any subsequent hearing in the proceedings and stand to and abide by any order that the court made in the premise. 
    When the time came, he being at liberty on the bond, I filed a response and motion, to quash the attachment and the rule to show cause. 
    And the Court, in an opinion and ordered, granted my motion and discharged the rule to show cause and the attachment and discharged the bond and discharged O'Neill and his sureties on that bond. 
    Now, then, I suspect, and I will state that it is my opinion, based on those facts, that if the judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, it would necessarily reverse also the order discharging the bond so that the bond would still be in effect. 
    Yes, sir?

    As far as actually getting O'Neill back to Florida, it might well be considered moot.

    Mr. L. J. Cushman 
    The bond is made payable to -- as I can recall it to the Governor of the State of Florida and his successors in office. 
    It's an ordinary bail bond. 
    And a suit would have to be maintained by the State for the benefit of the fine and forfeiture fund is my opinion. 
    It isn't anything that would operate to the financial benefit of the people in the State of New York, however much that might be desired.

    Mr. Bowen.
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="6409.032" stopTime="6414.724">

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I beg your pardon?
speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="6415.482" stopTime="6496.174">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    I said I don't think this case is moot because if this Court -- Court of the State of Florida has swung in the balance the question of whether it can collect that bond or not. 
    If the decision is reversed, then -- and Mr. O'Neill doesn't show up whenever -- when he's demanded, then the bond will be mistreated and if he doesn't show up, it can be collected. 
    But if the Court should dismiss the case as being moot, then Florida is automatically cutoff from collecting that bond because it would leave in effect the order of the Circuit Court and affirmed by the Supreme Court saying they have no right to -- to do anything to him at all. 
    We'd -- we'd lose the right to collect the bond we are entitled have. 
    If this thing is reversed, we're entitled to have him or the bond money. 
    And -- and a dismissal would cut us off from the possibility of getting either one. 
    It's always possible that a man will get to feel like he -- he's small enough to slip in and out of state and try -- and -- and have another dash down, then they'd catch him again.

    What was the amount of the bond?

    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    $2500. 
    Now, let me say this. 
    Some question was raised about what could be heard if this thing is reversed. 
    The question can be heard under the law as to whether Mr. O'Neill is a material and necessary witness because our statute requires the judge to determine that fact. 
    And if Mr. O'Neill is able to show our judge down there that he is not a material witness in spite all these positions that he holds in the union, the head of all or most everything in it, and in spite of that, he knows nothing about the -- the facts that the grand jury is trying to investigate up there. 
    Then if the judge finds that to be true, he will necessarily find that he's not a necessary witness and he won't -- he -- he can't under the law, hold him to set up. 
    I think that question is certainly open for consideration if this case should be reversed. 
    Now, Mr. Cushman still contends --

speaker="reeves_bowen" startTime="6612.420" stopTime="6675.050">
    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    If a subpoena has been issued to him back then in 1956 when this case was decided in the Circuit Court, and if -- while the case was on appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida, it had made -- made to appear that the body before whom the subpoena was returnable, that is the grand jury, had ceased to exist. 
    Then, the hauling would have to have been in his favor as to that particular subpoena, but here we've had no subpoena at all. 
    And I don't know actually whether the same grand jury has been in session or not. 
    I -- some of these grand juries last a long time but I don't know about that one. 
    But even so, it says no subpoena has been issued which could have been vitiated by the -- by the expiration of that grand jury term and says New York still wants him before a grand jury and a subpoena could be issued to put him before a current grand jury.

    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    The basis of course, New York asked that he'd be sent there once if they'll go have a term of grand jury and they already had one, I believe, in session, that they were investigating the disposition of funds in the union, certain unions including Mr. O'Neill's union. 
    And that was the basis upon which they asked for him to come.

    No, the judge in New York as shown by the order that he was just here before November grand jury of that year. 
    Is that the only basis on which the order rests and on which the controversy with him as to going back (Inaudible)

    That has, to my knowledge, been nothing put before the Florida court except that original certificate of Judge Fischer, the New York judge.

    Mr. Reeves Bowen 
    That is what he acted on and -- and among other things, he held that the papers on their face didn't show that Mr. O'Neill was a material and necessary witness but Supreme Court of Florida turned him down on that and said that was -- and they said they did show on its face.

    Well, perhaps you did but I don't recall it. 
    It may -- it may have been a reference to due process.
