    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    May it please the Court. 
    I will conclude my opening argument merely by saying that under the clear edict of all four North Dakota cases on this subject that trial judge in the federal court was right in submitting this case to a jury. 
    He was required to submit it to a jury and that the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, I submit, was in error when they reversed the judgment. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Norman G. Tenneson

    Mr. Tenneson, you may proceed.

    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think in this case, there is very little dispute between us as to the essential facts. 
    I have disagreed very hardly with some of the inferences as to this man's conduct prior to death as stated by Mr. Vogel. 
    I think also it can be said that there is no argument between us as to the applicable North Dakota substantive law. 
    The law of North Dakota is that proof of death by gunshot wound aided by the presumption against suicide creates a prima facie case, that is the law of North Dakota as enunciated in the four cases that counsel has referred to and set forth in the Svihovec case which Judge Sanborn in his opinion expressly referred to. 
    Now, under that rule a verdict for a plaintiff in this type of case will not be set aside unless the facts and circumstances cannot be reconciled with any reasonable theory of accidental death.

    But, Mr. Tenneson, do I understand from that that you do not -- you and your adversary then do not disagree on what the law --

    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- the law --
speaker="norman_g_tenneson" startTime="130.229" stopTime="303.662">
    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    I did endeavor to convince the trial court that the North Dakota rule was not the best rule. 
    I endeavor to convince the trial court that once we had offered credible evidence indicating suicide that the presumption fell out of the case and should not be referred to in the instructions. 
    That I believe is the better rule. 
    The rule sponsored by both Professor Wigmore and Professor Morgan but unfortunately, to our view, it is not the law of North Dakota. 
    Our contention, of course, here is that the facts and circumstances as disclosed here are consistent only with suicide and wholly inconsistent with accident. 
    Now, counsel has drawn in his argument numerous inferences which I think are based on little foundation of fact. 
    I, of course, concede the right of counsel to draw inferences but as the Court of Appeals in its decision said that the plaintiff is not entitled to the benefit of inferences which are unreasonable or which are opposed to the undisputed facts. 
    I think that is sound to all. 
    Now, I think when you've boil this case down, what you've got here as far as the plaintiff is concerned is only two ultimate facts, namely, the insured is death. 
    And second, none of the usual motifs that appear in these types of cases is present here. 
    The evidence did indicate some ill health on the part of this insured. 
    He was troubled with prostate, land trouble that he felt helpless, not well that he was in some pain. 
    The testimony is clear that he went to his family physician during the months of September, October, November and December preceding his death on January 20, 1955. 
    His wife testified that she knew of only two trips to the doctor and the family has closely met as counsel has indicated this family is with such a fine seating back and fort between the parents and the children, the neighbors and everybody else. 
    It's somewhat inconceivable that this man would not disclose to his wife the six of the trips. 
    Now, I conceive that certainly, this travel he had is not of such a nature that it would ordinarily lead a man to commit suicide. 
    But I think it is argued that perhaps, he regarded this illness much more seriously than he was justified in doing. 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="303.662" stopTime="308.750">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What did the doctor say about -- about the seriousness of it?
speaker="norman_g_tenneson" startTime="308.750" stopTime="423.266">
    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    Oh, he said, he had a mild to moderate nonspecific prostatitis, I think. 
    Then he said he had a certain amount of pain with it. 
    Well, he has certain discomfort but I don't think I can fairly say that this was a serious illness. 
    He was a farmer and customized whom to sitting on tractor seats and he had trouble in his back, in the area of his back. 
    The doctor did give him hormone injections and as I recall the testimony put him on sulfa therapy. 
    But the man came in and I think the doctor's testimony is the last time in December that it was a windy and a cold day and he said he probably had some aches and pains in his back and that's the reason he came in. 
    Now, the plaintiff here naturally has made much of the absence of some of the usual motifs which are common in the suicide cases. 
    As the courts have said, a motif, of course, is helpful to the defendant naturally but it is not essential. 
    That is the holding of the courts. 
    And I think it is common knowledge and as the Court say that men who have no known motif to commit suicide perhaps there is always a motif but it is not always disclosed. 
    Now, I hope -- I think you noticed in the argument that counsel made the statement, “He may have done this. 
    He might have done this. 
    It's likely that he did that.” 
    Now, that seems to me that makes a weak case on the part of the plaintiff. 
    The plaintiff has the burden of showing how this accident occurred if this was an accident. 
    Seems to me that you are entitled to something more here than bare conjecture as to what might have happen.

    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    Well, my point is simply this, perhaps, I used the wrong words, stronger words than I meant to is that the plaintiff in his effort to point out how this might have happened has indulged in what I would say is conjecture rather than embodying but on some facts that were established by the evidence in the case. 
    And I think its -- pursuing that line of inquiry will lead us into the realm of speculation based upon --

    All those conjectures did happen, didn't it?
speaker="norman_g_tenneson" startTime="483.964" stopTime="705.351">
    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    I think on our part, as I will attempt to demonstrate later, that there are certain, essential facts here which are proven and which, in our view, are consistent only with suicide and wholly inconsistent with accident. 
    Now, what are the undisputed facts here? 
    As I view, perhaps counsel will disagree with me or the Court may disagree. 
    But we do have testimony from the wife, the brother, the nephew and the other relatives that William Dick was an experienced hunter. 
    We're not dealing here with a man that was not familiar with firearms. 
    He had hunted practically every fall since 1926. 
    He had hunted for pheasants, ducks, geese and deer. 
    That's not uncommon in our part of the country where game is quite plentiful. 
    He was very thoroughly familiar with shotguns and how they operate it. 
    He had owned this gun for 26 years after all. 
    And the testimony by his wife and his brothers is uncontradicted that he was careful in the handling of firearms. 
    He was not a careless man. 
    The gun he owned, the gun that caused his death was the only gun that he owns. 
    Testimony is undisputed that he was a husky, strong man and the doctor said that he would do his regular farm work in spite of the misery that he was having from this prostate trouble. 
    Now, I think it's important here to consider the gun that is here on evidence. 
    What kind of a gun is it? 
    Well, it's a 12-gauge, Stevens, double-barrel. 
    And when you break the gun, insert the shells in here close that breech, this gun is automatically unsafe. 
    You cannot fire both triggers. 
    And to guide the hunter, there's an S above this little button here on this top. 
    In order to fire both triggers, you have to do something. 
    You have to push this button forward and take it off safe, then you may fire both triggers. 
    You break the gun again when you insert shell, do it again, that gun is unsafe. 
    So it is obvious that this gun must have been taken off safe otherwise it would not have fired. 
    And as was asked earlier in the argument, the front trigger fires the right barrel. 
    The rear trigger fires the left barrel. 
    I think that is common in practically all shotguns although some of the modern ones, you could select what trigger you want to push if you're fast enough to do it. 
    Now, immediately after this death was reported, the sheriff in the corner came out to this little farm, found this man lying in what is known in the evidence as a silage shed. 
    It is a small building between the barn and the silage and has been testified that he was lying on his back with his right knees slightly cocked up against an outer door. 
    Along side up of him was this gun, the barrel up high, the stack down below, thus beyond that again was an 8 to 10 inch screwdriver. 
    That's the way he was found in the record. 
    There are pictures showing the way he lay as post by his brother who came there afterwards.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="705.351" stopTime="707.875">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    An 8 to 10 inch what?
speaker="norman_g_tenneson" startTime="707.875" stopTime="708.595">
    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    Screwdriver.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="708.595" stopTime="709.213">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh, screwdriver.
speaker="norman_g_tenneson" startTime="709.213" stopTime="757.887">
    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    Yes. 
    Now, the sheriff took this gun back to the courthouse and he proceeded to make a series of test of it. 
    He put the gun off safe. 
    And then as I recall the testimony, he pounded at 10 times on the floor. 
    This would have stopped down. 
    See if it would discharge, it did not. 
    He reversed it and did the same process to the barrel, then he put the gun in firing position and banged it against an object then took the gun and dropped it several times. 
    He made all these tests and then that results of all the test was the gun did not fire, warded off safe. 
    What's indicated should indicate and I think it's a reasonable inference that that gun was in good working condition. 
    It certainly was immediately after this man's death.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="757.887" stopTime="760.367">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Had it always been in good condition as far as you know?
speaker="norman_g_tenneson" startTime="760.367" stopTime="774.014">
    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    Well, there is some testimony on the record that some time previously the gun was accidentally discharged but I don't think quite of the -- the -- on cross examination, the testimony does not stand up but there is some such testimony.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="774.014" stopTime="777.760">

    Who is -- who is handling it when it went off accidentally, supposedly?

    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    I think if -- if it went off accidentally, Your Honor, Mr. Dick. 
    Yes. 
    Now --

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Where do they keep the gun?
speaker="norman_g_tenneson" startTime="787.185" stopTime="811.791">
    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    That is not too clear in the record. 
    The only testimony, as I recall, is the testimony of the widow that it was usually kept in the barn. 
    But I -- I'm sure there is no other testimony as to that, usually kept in the barn. 
    There was this barn and then it right angles to the barn was this little silage shed and beyond that, the silage.

speaker="norman_g_tenneson" startTime="815.243" stopTime="879.337">
    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    None whatsoever, Your Honor. 
    The testimony is that at the time of Mr. Dick's death, there were only two people there, Mr. Dick and his wife. 
    At the time Mr. Dick was found in the silage shed, two discharged 12-gauge shells were in the chambers indicating that two shots had been fired. 
    As I've said, the shot came lay along side, the left of the body and beyond that the screwdriver about in line with the axis of the body. 
    Now, counsel has made much of the argument that if a man is going to commit suicide, he would take his gloves off. 
    The testimony is that this was a cold day somewhere around zero as I recall. 
    And it is not uncommon in our country for people to wear gloves and it is not uncommon for hunters to use gloves. 
    If it means anything, I have hunted myself and whether it gets wet or gets cold you always wear gloves, and generally, gloves of this type.

    -- just ordinary 25 Cents Store gloves that most fit fingers but it's obvious this can be put in there. 
    Now, here's another evidentiary fact that we consider of great importance here is the presence of shot pellets or patterns in this little shed. 
    Now, then quoting now the testimony from George Dick, the brother of the insured, he said that there were shot pellets in the northwest corner of this little shed and that they were also shot pellets in the southeast corner near this outside door. 
    The shot pellets at the southeast were four or five feet from the floor, as I recall the testimony.

    Well, it is my personal opinion it would.

    And the hazard in this case, as I see it, is that we can indulge in any kind of speculation and conjecture and depart from what's in the record. 
    Now, we can build theories one way or the other and I have tried in my argument here to stay with the undisputed facts in the case. 
    And I realize if this is a fruitful case in which to indulge in speculation as to what might have happened.

    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    Yes, yes, and that is about the position that the Court of Appeals took and the appellate court on the record concluded the judgment couldn't stand because as Judge Sanborn said, you can believe an experienced hunter might accidentally shoot himself once but the certain theory that he could accidentally shoot himself first with one barrel and then with the other stretch his credulity beyond the wrecking point and that was the view of the -- of the Court of Appeals. 
    Now, you got another circumstance here, I haven't dwelled on. 
    I don't believe that this death occurred in a small shed probably 7 feet wide and 11 or 12 feet long, as I recall, I maybe off 1 foot or more. 
    What was this man doing in the shed if there were wild dogs around, as the counsel would have us believe? 
    What was he doing in the shed? 
    He can't shoot them there and a significant fact in the record here as far as these wild dogs killing sheep is concerned, there isn't any testimony from the witness anywhere that the sheep or the cattle or anything else was being molested around that farmstead that morning and this wild dog business happened more than a year, about a year prior to this particular day.

    Mr. Norman G. Tenneson 
    All right, let us -- let us assume that he did. 
    Now, it is -- there --- there is no evidence here that he stumbled anywhere.

    There is no testimony. 
    There are no nails, hooks or projections in the shed of any kind might uphold these triggers. 
    And certainly, it required some act of somebody to discharge these triggers unless you are going to throw out completely the testimony of the sheriff as to the efforts he made to discharge this gun and he also testified that it took seven pounds pull to discharge these triggers and that he made that test on both triggers.

    Dropping it or any other the test that were made and they gave subject to this gun to vary violent abuse to determine whether it was conceivable that this gun might have accidentally discharge. 
    That was the purpose of the test. 
    And I might close by quoting here the -- briefly the conclusion of Judge Sanborn that the infliction of two wounds in succession, one in the left side in close proximity to the heart and the other in the head cannot be in reconciled with any reasonable theory of accident, and that under the evidence, the question whether the death was accidental, was not a question of fact from the jury. 
    And in the language of the Svihovec case which is the last question of our court and which restates the holding in the other cases that -- it's our view here that any inference of accidental death from the known facts, not speculation would take us away from the field of rational inferences based on human experience and into speculation upon fantastic possibility.

    Their bodies were burned.

    Very well, Mr. Vogel.

    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    May it please the Court. 
    The evidence that was read from the record by Mr. Justice Black is the record that I relied upon in saying that one of the witnesses produced by the insurance company did say that the shot was up from the ground and across the body, and I think that that is the fair inference to draw from that particular evidence.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What evidence? 
    Was that on cross-examination?

    On cross-examination, Mr. Justice.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, there any redirect evidence brought out, just to try to explain this?
speaker="philip_b_vogel" startTime="2629.528" stopTime="2633.675">
    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    There was not.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Where does that appear, Mr. Vogel?
speaker="philip_b_vogel" startTime="2635.426" stopTime="2735.872">
    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    It appears, Mr. Chief Justice, on page 22 of the transcript of the record.And the words that Mr. Black -- Mr. Justice Black read are exactly the words that I would have read. 
    Insofar as the North Dakota law regarding the burden of proof is concerned, it is more than just the burden of going forward with the evidence or the burden of making out the prima facie case. 
    In the four lawsuits that were tried in the four decisions that were quoted, our Supreme Court has said that the burden of proof is on the insurance companies but it does seem to me that as far as this lawsuit is concerned, the big factor is the fact that the first wound of this man received on his left side was a serious wound that it was a mortal wound from which he was going to die in a matter of days according to the testimony of the doctor. 
    It injured his ribs. 
    It collapsed his lungs. 
    And to think that under those circumstances, if the man had wanted to kill himself that he would have had the will or the strength or the power to lift up that gun and hold it in a horizontal position out to one side the way Mr. Tenneson tried to hold it with one lung on his left side collapsed, with a mortal wound in his side to say that he would do something like that in Justice Sanborn's words passed the bounds of credulity. 
    And I'm sure the jury felt that too.

    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    Well, Mr. Justice, I don't know how the accident did happen but I do know in the first place that the burden of proof was on the insurance company. 
    I think what did happen was that the man was outside feeding his cattle. 
    He put down his basket of corn, he went into the barn to get his gun and the quickest way out of the barn to where the vicious dogs might be would be through this little shed that we're talking about and out the side door. 
    That would be the perfect way for him to go. 
    He could have stumbled on the steps. 
    The first shot could have come along his left side and could have landed in the wall in the northwest corner where the shot did land. 
    He could have been turned around by the force of the explosion and as the gun was thrown against the south wall, it could have gone over once more when he was falling from his first mortal wound and taken off the top of his head. 
    I don't know that it happened that way but it could have happened that way.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="philip_b_vogel" startTime="2808.932" stopTime="2826.760">
    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    I believe that it would be. 
    I believe that it would be a good deal more consistent with that than the theory that the insurance company has put forward that this mortally wounded man would have the strength and the power to hold that gun out with a collapsed lung and shoot off the top of his head.

    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    Then, I think, if that had happened, Mr. Justice, then, I think, the shots in the southeast corner of that little shed would not have been four or five feet from the ground, they would have been up much further and probably in the ceiling of the little shed. 
    And that's why in the brief of the insurance company has filed. 
    They say that the shot that come in from the side must have come with the gun held in more nearly they say a parallel position just as demonstrated by Mr. Tenneson. 
    He has stooped down a little so that the shot would go in to the wall with the top of this man's head four or five feet from the ground.

    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    A considerable distance because his body, when it was lying, was lying somewhat west of the little door that went out of the shed into the farmstead yard. 
    And as I say, the gun was lying by his side.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2917.541" stopTime="2928.112">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, if the butt of the ground -- butt of the gun was on the ground when he shot the top of his head off, it could -- couldn't possibly have been parallel, could it?
speaker="philip_b_vogel" startTime="2928.112" stopTime="2930.196">
    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    It could not have been.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2930.196" stopTime="2938.062">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It would have to be elevated if -- if the butt was on the ground, the barrel would have to be elevated. 
    It couldn't possibly shoot parallel.
speaker="philip_b_vogel" startTime="2938.062" stopTime="2942.361">
    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    It could not possibly go parallel into the wall.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2942.361" stopTime="2947.607">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And -- and the evidence is that those -- those pellets did go parallel into the wall.
speaker="philip_b_vogel" startTime="2947.607" stopTime="2948.577">
    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    That is right.

    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    Mr. Justice, I don't know how I would tell it but I know that it is a concession that is made by the insurance company lawyers in their brief. 
    They take the position that the shots that went into the southeast corner went into the corner in such a position so that the gun must have been parallel when it was fired. 
    It is true that there is evidence in the record, as Mr. Tenneson has said that the insurance company investigator and the sheriff did make certain test with his gun and that it did not fire when they made the test even though the gun was off safe. 
    But on the other side of the coin, there is testimony from Mrs. Dick herself that is completely uncontradicted that her husband did not like to hunt with this gun because a lot of times, it went off when it was not suppose to go off and sometimes it would not go off when it should have gone off. 
    Now, that was testimony that was in the record. 
    And the jury under those circumstances could have believed that and form their conclusion that under those circumstances, the gun was accidentally discharged.

    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    It is in the testimony of -- of Mrs. Dick, the widow, and I let Mr. Holand here to find it.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It said “Sometimes, it wouldn't fire when he wanted it to or would when he didn't.” 
    Is that it?
speaker="philip_b_vogel" startTime="3079.632" stopTime="3082.812">
    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    That is right.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3082.812" stopTime="3090.082">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    “When my husband went hunting, he sometimes picked up his father's gun because he did -- he didn't trust his own.” 
    Is that it?
speaker="philip_b_vogel" startTime="3090.082" stopTime="3165.100">
    Mr. Philip B. Vogel 
    That is right. 
    It is true, as Mr. Tenneson said that the attending physician who, by the way, was the examining physician for the New York Life Insurance Company testified that in his opinion, in spite of the fact that this man had unbearable pain, in spite of the fact that the first wound was mortal, in spite of the fact that he could hardly stand it would still be conscious after the first wound, but as our Supreme Court in North Dakota has said many times, the jury was not bound to believe that evidence if the jury didn't want to believe the evidence. 
    The position of the appellant here, the plaintiff below and the petitioner is simply that under these circumstances, there was evidence in this record from which the jury could have concluded that the death was accidental. 
    We believe that the District Court in denying the motions for a new trial or for judgment not withstanding the verdict was correct. 
    And we believe that the Circuit Court of Appeals in reversing that judgment was in error. 
    Thank you.
