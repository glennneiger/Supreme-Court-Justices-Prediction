    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors. 
    The specific question presented by this case is whether the retail or service establishment exemption from both the minimum wage and the overtime requirement for the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to the business of lending money on credit and purchasing conditional sales contracts, and taking life insurance to insure the borrowers, specifically the business of making small loans and discounting condition of sales contract. 
    The broader and underlying issue that's inherent in this specific issue here is whether the 1949 amendment to the original Fair Labor Standards Act, which was enacted in 1938, whether the 1949 amendment so broadened the scope of the so-called retail or service establishment exemption as to make every and any business within the general coverage of the Act eligible to claim this exemption. 
    The exemption and question is quoted on page 2 of the Government's brief in Section 13 (a) (10), and it provides that Section VI and VII, which are the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Act, shall not apply with respect to any employee employed by any retail or service establishment under certain conditions. 
    One, being more than 50% of its annual dollar volume of sales is -- of services is made within the State in which the establishment is located. 
    And the second condition being that 75% of annual dollar volume of sales or services is not to resale and is recognized as retail sales or services in the particular industry.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is there any issue on the 50% borrowed here, Ms. Margolin?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="174.077" stopTime="675.827">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Well, there's no issue if we get to that. 
    The Government's basic position is that this exemption has no application whatsoever to the business of lending money to credit companies. 
    And therefore, that there is no occasion or need to determine whether or not 50 -- whether the percentage requirements are met so that -- although, the court below found that they did meet -- the Court of Appeals found that they did meet both of those conditions. 
    The Government's basic position is that there's no occasion to go into those conditions. 
    The Court of Appeals -- the business here, respondent's business is located in Louisville, Kentucky and they make loans both in Kentucky and Indiana which was stipulated. 
    There's no question of their engagement in interstate commerce. 
    It was a pretrial stipulation that they were engaged in interstate commerce and then they are in the production of goods for interstate commerce, their employees, sufficiently to be with the subject to this Act unless they came within this exemption. 
    So that the entire evidence was directed to the exemption point. 
    The rather voluminous records is explained by respondent's endeavor to prove that their lending of money and the purchasing of this discount favor thus constitute sales of services within the liberal language of the exemption. 
    The Court of Appeals accepted respondent's construction of this Act, of this provision stating that the literal terms of -- that the statutory language was so clear and unambiguous and so plainly applied to any business that was engaged in the broadest sense of the term “engaged in sales of goods or in performing services,” that it was unnecessary to look to the legislative history to tell -- to determine what Congress meant by this attention. 
    The Government's position is that this exemption does not encompass every conceivable business that might be said to be engaged in service. 
    That it is limited to the particular kinds of businesses that are traditionally regarded as retail, and the services of a light character, except that the establishment of sales, services, instead of goods. 
    This was definitely the interpretation of the original exemption which was enacted at the time of 1938 that the courts have upheld the law restricted interpretation, but it didn't. 
    This exemption was not intended to encompass everything that could, in the economic sense and the broadest sense constitute a service. 
    And it is -- it is clear that before the 1949 amendment, this exemption was given that limited construction both by the Administrator and by the Court. 
    The exemption at that time, read, simply, that any employee engaged in any retail or service establishment, the greater part of who's selling their services -- servicing is in intrastate commerce. 
    In other words, there was no spelling out except in the general terms of the 50% rule, but there was no spelling out of the 75% with respect to retail sales or sales not recognized or recognized as retail in the industry. 
    Congress in enacting the 1949 amendment or -- as -- did as counsel -- as opposing counsel point out was dissatisfied with some of the Administrator's interpretations of this exemption. 
    What counsel does not recognize, however, is that the legislative history makes it perfectly clear that Congress was dissatisfied with only a very limited aspect of those interpretations and the legislative history makes it so clear that Congress had no -- we had felt no dissatisfaction at all with the basic interpretation of the former exemption. 
    That is, that it was limited to certain types of establishments and did not extend to categories in the financial field and the utility field and the real estate or in the insurance field. 
    Legislative history makes that so clear, that we submit, that it is controlling and conclusive, and clearly shows the error of the Court of Appeals. 
    Prior to the decision of the Court of Appeals in the instant case, every court which considered this issue, and that includes the First Circuit Court of Appeals, in the Aetna Finance case and all three District Courts in the Household Finance and Aetna Finance and in the instant case, every court which had considered this issue and examined the legislative history concluded that the legislative history was conclusive on this and as did dissenting judge in the instant case, Judge Miller dissented here. 
    For that reason, in the limited time available, I would like to emphasize the legislative history. 
    As I stated earlier, there was no question that the administrative interpretation prior to the 1949 amendment, was that this exemption had no application to banks, insurance companies, credit companies including personal finance companies, newspapers, telephone companies and the like that those -- those areas of industry according to the Administrator and the judicial interpretations might save because the personal finance company issue had not arisen, specifically of that issue, but the courts have pretty -- pretty generally upheld the basic classifications of the Administrator. 
    When the proposal -- proposed amendment came before Congress, the sponsors explicitly asserted the legislative intent to do nothing to change, and I'm quoting, “to do nothing to change the previous non-exempt status of establishments” such as, and I'm quoting, “banks, insurance companies, credit companies, newspapers, telephone companies, gas and electric utility companies, telegraph companies, et cetera”. 
    Now, this statement was made in the reports of both the House and the Senate as quoted on pages 25 and 26 of the Government's brief.

    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Well, the -- the original legislative history I haven't gone into here because this Court had pretty well expressed what it was in the Phillips case and in the Kirschbaum case, and --

    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Yes, I think those cases did turn on the certain enroll and elected it too, that those terms did not -- were not used in the broad sense, but were used to -- in reference to the corner grocery store, the drug store, the department store, the -- and the beauty shop, the shoe shop, the -- the barber shop, and service establishments comparable to your traditional retail establishments. 
    Never once was anything mentioned about any credit company being a -- or any financial institution or any bank being in that category.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="778.295" stopTime="790.799">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It was the other way around. 
    You are contending that those terms as used by Congress had to define this -- define meaning of which the corner grocery is -- is typical.
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="790.799" stopTime="836.761">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Well, I'll say what this Court said in the Phillips case was that the reference was to establishments selling merchandise epitomized by the corner grocery, the drug store and the department store. 
    And in the -- the Roland Electric, recognized the Administrator's interpretation that service establishments was a comparable type. 
    Now, what the Administrator said with respect to service establishments was that, those akin to typical, these typical retailer establishments, except that they sell services instead of merchandise, such as restaurants, barber shops, beauty parlors, general homes, shoe repairs shops, et cetera.

    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    But the Administrator explicitly said, he explicitly said, that this did not refer in the financial field to banks. 
    It did not refer to utilities. 
    Those were usually and ordinarily put in a different classification and they were so classified in Government standard classifications for the practical use for industry. 
    And that it was obvious that Congress had not intended to include all of those in this one exemption because it has specific -- other specific -- one of the indications was it had other specific exemptions. 
    For example, exempting small weekly newspapers whose circulation was largely within the State, small telephone exchanges. 
    In -- and in these areas of the -- the -- Congress has indicated to what extent in these other areas exemption was to be granted.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What are these -- what are the classifications by these Senators? 
    Where -- you said in other aspects of Government, there are some other classification.

    Now, assuming you're right, that was fixed both by the administrative construction by the Court upholding of them, but as for the original act, this thing -- the amendment isn't changed, the categories to which the exemption is applied. 
    Can you make them -- some changes with reference to those categories? 
    But they didn't change their categories --

    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Well, that -- that is the contention that they meant to use the old terms with new meanings and to create a self-sufficient, self-contained definition which any business could come in and bring in experts or bring in their own industry people to prove that they regarded their particular type of transaction is retail.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="975.179" stopTime="981.532">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Because, in fact, they enlarged the exempted areas, enlarged the exempted opportunity, is that right?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="981.532" stopTime="987.764">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    There's no question that Congress, in demanding this exemption, did enlarge it. 
    We don't deny that. 
    We think they enlarged it pretty --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="987.764" stopTime="988.804">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And regarding it is --
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="988.804" stopTime="988.976">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    -- pretty substantially.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="988.976" stopTime="995.418">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- that for that enlargement of the qualifications for exemption, you enlarge the categories of exemption.
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="995.418" stopTime="1169.720">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    That is the -- that's -- that's the respondent's case. 
    That enlarging the qualifications for exemption, Congress opened up the whole exemption and just granted a field day and open season to every -- every and every -- every employer that could possibly be subject to the Act to come in and -- and prove and put the Government to -- to rebuttal. 
    As this record indicates, this is a pretty complicated and complex and kind of a -- a battle of the experts that's involved in -- in trying to determine whether a particular transaction is recognized as retail in -- in a particular industry. 
    We say that -- that the whole purpose of the voluminous legislative history and the whole purpose was to disavow any such intent to -- to open this exemption up to everyone. 
    And the -- that the very reason why the legislative history is so voluminous is that the sponsors were required to answer the -- felt required to answer the charges and the criticism, that this would open -- this was going to expand this exemption far beyond anything that -- and -- that the -- the Congress would be willing to pass. 
    Now, in this connection, I'd like to refer to -- to opposing counsel's reference to twice -- two or three times, he mentioned that the Administrator himself said that these amendments were -- was substituting a wholly, completely new definitions of the retail establishments. 
    What counsel failed to note is that the -- that the Administrator's criticism was one of the very reasons why the lengthy debates were held. 
    That the -- the debates took up the Administrator's charges and the sponsors disavowed repeatedly that there was any intent to expand this -- this exemption to any such extent, and specifically stated that they were adopting the Administrator's basic categories. 
    Every reference that they made to the basic categories to be within this exemption was a paraphrase of the Administrator's basic category that the Court will compare it. 
    We have gotten up because the counsel quotes some excerpts from the legislative history too, some general excerpts. 
    We have prepared and it was submitted to the First Circuit in the Aetna case and to the Sixth Circuit below here. 
    The substance of the legislative history and its -- we have filed copies of it in this Court which brings together in one booklet, all of -- virtually all of the legislative history that bears on this particular point.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1169.720" stopTime="1180.034">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Could you pinpoint -- excuse me -- could you pinpoint exactly what it was that you find the 1949 amendment did to the old statute?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="1180.034" stopTime="1448.908">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Yes, the Administrator, in addition to making this distinction in basic category, said that some establishments, many in fact, frequently, establishments which one would regard as retail establishments also make wholesales or nonretail sales. 
    For example a coal -- coal dealer will sell in small amounts, and he'll also sell in coal, load lots to hotels and apartments and industry. 
    And the question was whether a retail -- whether an establishment that might look retail also engaged in a lot of this wholesale, this wholesale, a quantity of sales, sale for business use, whether that would defeat the exemption. 
    The Administrator, taking cognizance of the fact that frequently, an establishment did both -- made both kinds of sale, adopted this 25% tolerance test which is the forerunner of the 75% provision in the amendment. 
    He said that if a -- an establishment made such wholesale or nonretail sales, and it didn't exceed 25% of its total annual dollar volume of business, it would not defeat the exemption. 
    And in connection with applying that test to the categories that he held were eligible, he said that he would treat it as a retail sale, a nonretail sales, sales for industrial use. 
    This is where the so-called consumer use, “business use” test came in. 
    Now, the Supreme Court adopted that view that a retail sale is something ordinarily for consumer use. 
    And in the Roland Electric case, the Supreme Court approved that and stated it in general terms. 
    Now, that was what Congress was dissatisfied with. 
    They felt that there should be more leeway for your dealers, your coal dealers, and your paint dealers and your other shops to be able to engage in more sales for non-consumer use without losing the exemption. 
    Undoubtedly, the sponsors felt that that type of establishment, even if it -- if it sold -- what -- for business use, was still of the traditional type of retail establishment. 
    And therefore, they put in this provision that if they would -- instead of -- of having the consumer use, “business use” test determine, it should be what was recognized in the particular industry. 
    Now, that was what they hold. 
    If you can't read this legislative history without seeing that that was the thing, they were primary -- primarily concerned with, if not solely. 
    And the sponsors themselves repeatedly said that was the only substantial difference between their proposed amendment and what the Administrator had been doing. 
    That was the only substantial difference. 
    And as I say, they repeatedly, explicitly said that credit companies, banks, public utilities, telephone companies were not to be -- were to remain non-exempt. 
    They recognized they were non-exempt and so they were to remain that way. 
    And of -- of -- what I want to point out is that the approach of respondents, the construction respondent's take of this amendment, and of the court below, means not only that credit companies or small loan companies, personal loan companies, not only that those would be eligible for this exemption, but they frankly concede that their reasoning, the manner in which they construed this exemption means that banks, insurance companies, newspapers, telephone companies, utility companies, telegraph companies, transportation companies, all of those can come in and if they can show that the 75% of their services to -- is to consumers or individual use, or that -- even if it isn't, if it's recognized in that particular industry, if they call it retail, they can show that they're entitled to this exemption.

    Mr. Harold H. Levin 
    Mr. Chief Justice and the Court. 
    (Inaudible) my knowledge. 
    Our position in brief is this. 
    Congress never intended to encompass local activities within the Act. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter and other justices of this and the former members of the Court have warned the courts not to absorb by -- by adjudication that which Congress left to the State. 
    And it certainly is clear from the legislative history that local activity which can better be served under the jurisdiction of the States as Mr. Justice Black well knows, because of the statement he made in the -- in the polls of the Senate, that they were left to the States. 
    And our claim is that this is the kind of an activity at the end of the stream of commerce. 
    This does not affect interstate commerce which should be lodged with the States in general. 
    Specifically, we would point out that -- and if Mr. Justice Frankfurter was expressing an opinion, I would have to take objection to it, to differ with him, the categories were not established by the first -- by the enactment of the -- of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
    The --

    Mr. Harold H. Levin 
    No, I wouldn't say that, Your Honor. 
    I would say that when the original amendment had no definition, the Administrator was free as he did, to make interpretations of his own, and many of them were adopted by this Court. 
    Congress was not only dissatisfied with the consumer versus the “business use” test. 
    It would have been a very simple thing to add two lines to the amendment and say that this -- that the fact that something is sold to -- for business use, it was not to be considered necessarily wholesale or -- yes, wholesale. 
    They were concerned greatly with the broad expansion of the Act in 1949. 
    If, Your Honors, will recall, an amendment was made of the definition of production because that had been too broadened. 
    The Beetle amendment had been virtually killed by the administrative interpretations of the amended Act. 
    When they got around to talking about this retail exemption, the Administrator, appealing his oath, so to speak, had the Lesinski Bill introduced, which was designed to approve of all of the administrative interpretations. 
    But what happened was that the Congress objected and the Harlan Lucas Bill was introduced in its stead, precisely because that the Congress found the interpretations inaccurate. 
    They used such words out of thin air, “Vacillation,” and one of the Senators said, if you -- if you left it to -- to the Administrator, “You would exclude everybody from the exemption and include everybody under the Act whether they were local or not.” 
    And so, they adopted a precise definition and they said specifically, and this is addressed to the statement about category. 
    They said, “We're not going to have the same test in every situation. 
    We're going to go to the industry. 
    And whatever is regarded as retail in the industry is to be regarded as retail. 
    What is regarded as wholesale is to be regarded as wholesale. 
    ” And they said --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was there any change made as to what -- what enterprise is to be judged whether it is retail, it doubtless made the changes as to what constitutes retail --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- something about that. 
    But if they make any change or if they manifest any change in the starting point, in the base question namely, as to what enterprise you require words --
speaker="harold_h_levin" startTime="1861.565" stopTime="1883.709">
    Mr. Harold H. Levin 
    Well, I think so and of course, that's a matter of interpretation. 
    And if Your Honor pleases, we take the position as did the Court of Appeals. 
    Was -- that when a statute is clear and unambiguous on its face and if you look to the legislative history, and you get confusing answers, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter once said, we have a right to take a look at the statute.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1883.709" stopTime="1892.718">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was it -- was it made -- was that part the exemption? 
    Made any clearer about the ‘49 amendment and it was by the city --
speaker="harold_h_levin" startTime="1892.718" stopTime="2114.146">
    Mr. Harold H. Levin 
    I think most certainly. 
    When the exemption merely read that “An establishment, the greater part of whose sales or services is intrastate, shall be exempt”, it meant nothing. 
    It -- it had no definition, but when it got down to the 1949 amendment, and I'm going to come to legislative history which I'm going to read to you, where not only did they say, “We're going to go further, we're going to define what is retail,” what is a retail service establishment, Your Honor. 
    Those very words were used by the Senate sponsor. 
    And when they went that far, then I say that one has no right to say that the categories were not changed. 
    They left it to the industry to determine what the categories are, and I might say a word about our establishment. 
    It's inaccurate to describe it as one selling insurance or something of that sort or merely buying discount paper. 
    This is a little store, ground floor office, where a poor working person comes in and borrows $5 to $300, the average is $200. 
    They make an application and a telephone call is made to check on the employment record and they are given this money. 
    At high interest rates, I'll agree. 
    But much lower than the -- than the earlier, before the uniform small no longer established, the -- the sharks got after them and got much higher rates of interest. 
    These are regulated by the State. 
    That's one aspect of the business. 
    Testimony is clear and undisputed that the purposes for which these loans were made were for household goods, for school expenses, for clothing, furniture. 
    Nothing could be more local in the sense that this Court or rather retail in the sense that this Court described it when it talked about consumptive purposes rather than business purposes. 
    And by the way, we claim we come under the amendment regardless -- we -- we come under the -- the exemption regardless of whether we are talking about the old or the new law. 
    The courts never tested the ruling of the Administrator on this question. 
    And so, we come to the discount operation. 
    Now, what happens there? 
    A person goes in to buy a radio or a television set and hasn't the money. 
    A telephone call is made to this office and they check the credit of the individual and if the credit is good, the credit is advanced and allowed. 
    We take the paper and we take the -- collect the money on the debt. 
    So that as the court below found, also these establishments are a single unit engaged in lending money to individuals, not the businesses for consumptive purposes. 
    There's no re-lending, no element of resale. 
    Now, that brings us to this question of recognition in the industry, and if the statute is to be interpreted in its plain meaning and -- and language, the question arises whether the industries, the financial industry recognizes this establishment as a retail establishment. 
    Well, we have testimony from Elmer (Inaudible) Trust Company of the First National Bank of Chicago, Mr. (Inaudible) Trust Company of New York and Leon Henderson, they all agreed that there is a very definite distinction in the financial industry between wholesale and retail. 
    And that these small loan offices are regarded as a retail into the industry. 
    That to tonight --

    The -- the bill was not intended to and it did not attempt to fix minimum wages and maximum hours in the very peculiarly local business units of the nation. 
    And then, Mr. Justice Black stated, "Businesses of a purely local type, which serve a particular local community, and which do not send their products into the stream of interstate commerce can better be regulated by the laws of the communities and of the states in which the business units operate.

    Did you find any indication that any other possess that, the one between wholesale and retail into the money?
speaker="harold_h_levin" startTime="2477.639" stopTime="2621.485">
    Mr. Harold H. Levin 
    No, I don't think that it was even thought of, but I think I said I was going to take up that credit company business which seems to be bothering some of Your Honors. 
    We had a ruling, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    A ruling was asked by the personal loan companies as to whether or not they were covered by the Act and whether or not they fitted in to the retail exemption. 
    And the ruling encompassed banks, insurance companies, building and loan associations, and personal loan companies, all grouped in that order. 
    Now, the strange thing happened when the question was put, obviously, on half of the Administrator in the courts of the debates as to whether or not this category was to be exempt or not under the amendment. 
    And curiously, there were credit companies which substituted for personal loan companies, which indicates the danger of giving too much reliance on legislative debates, because credit companies, if we read the dictionary, refers you to the commercial credit companies. 
    As we all know, they're obviously wholesalers. 
    Credit companies were thrown in with banks and insurance companies, also obviously wholesalers. 
    Now, my adversary, in her fine brief, says – well, a small loan company is a credit company. 
    Our answer is, so is a pawn shop, so as a credit retail store, or a furniture store which sells goods on credit. 
    But certainly, they were encompassed by this credit company classification. 
    If the Administrator wanted a definite opinion, whether we agree or not that legislative history should be planted so that it can be used at the time of the harvest, makes no difference. 
    But I have no objection to the -- to the legislative history being injected with the question of that kind. 
    But why it wasn't made clear that they were talking about personal loan companies? 
    Exactly the same language is used as in the ruling except for this substitution of credit companies for personal loan company.

    I know. 
    I'm sorry to say that too, Your Honor, and I share your view on it. 
    Now, the Senator Holland was asked whether this amendment would add to the number of the exempt people and his answer was no. 
    Insofar as concerns, those who are exempted under the proper meaning of the original Act, the answer will be yes, as to an undetermined number which are included in the field that has been included within the jurisdiction of this Act by interpretive ruling. 
    Now, the word “traditional” was used here that the -- the establishment must be retail in the traditional sense, but this is what the House sponsor said about -- about traditional. 
    He used the word “traditional”. 
    He says, "My amendment clears that up by exempting the establishments which are traditionally regarded as retail. 
    It is only in that sense that it clarifies such doubt that my amendment can be regarded as expanding the present exemption, but in real sense, it is not expanding the exemption but simply confirming it, for those establishments which Congress always intended to exempt” and this was said in the spirit of criticism. 
    “The contrary view must assume” and this is important on the word “traditional,” “that in granting the retail and service establishment exemption, Congress intended to reject what is traditionally recognized as a retail or service, as a retail sale or service, in an industry and to adapt an arbitrary concept of what is retailing or servicing.”

    Yes, they say retail or service. 
    I'll accept, Your Honor's correction, but I'm not sure that you wouldn't have to consider them also a retail in the -- in the sense that we've been talking about it. 
    Now, the Senate -- Senator Taft said, in those power of Lucas said, that the amendment was to have the effect of confirming the exemption for the various local neighborhood businesses, to call it was the original purpose of the existing law to exempt. 
    And on the subject of definition, as Senator Holland said, and this has to do with the question of categories. 
    Senator Holland said, “It is our desire to clarify entirely the status of retail and service establishments by defining them, defining establishments and letting them know, beyond per venture, of doubt whether and when they are in fact, exempt from the provisions of the law. 
    It is of you, the sponsors of the amendment, that is, the duty of the Congress at this time while the Act is being amended,” and they weren't just talking about consumer test. 
    “To clarify the meaning of the terms ‘retail establishment' and ‘service establishment.” 
    I think your father is -- is right above that, and service establishment so that every person affected thereby, both employers and employees, including, of course, the administrator and the staff, will know who is intended to be covered and who is not. 
    And then, as my friend said, the -- the Administrator objected to the Act, precisely because it would supply a definition. 
    And this is what he wrote to the -- to one of the Senators and it was read in the Senate. 
    He said, “The bill would substitute a completely new set of definition.” 
    And I'd like Mr. Justice Frankfurter to hear this because he talked about categories, you'll excuse me for suggesting it. 
    “The bill would substitute a completely a new set of definition”, said the Administrator, “Of a retail or service establishment in place of the clear definition now recognized by the courts. 
    Years of litigations,” he said. 
    “He would be required to determine how the exemption should be applied. 
    The amendment would give rise to exceedingly difficult problems in administration since it is by no means clear what different industries regard as retail sale.” 
    So, that I think there was an intention to provide a binding and controlling definition and if there's any -- if you aren't convinced of that, I have one more, says that here.

    Mr. Harold H. Levin 
    All right. 
    Now, let's take -- take the next one. 
    Senator Holland said that under the third test any sale or service, absolute resale will have to be treated by the Administrator and the courts as a retail sale or service, so long as such sale or service is recognized in the particular industry as a retail sale or service. 
    And he went on further and said, “The Administrator and the courts, as well as the people who are in business, are warned that the rules prevailing in the business, the understanding of the terms in the business, would apply with the complete knowledge that the same would not apply in every industry.”

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I don't see on that how then you can make a distinction between a small local building and loan and the small loan company? 
    Now, it just seems to me that there isn't any difference between the two.
speaker="harold_h_levin" startTime="3128.976" stopTime="3148.326">
    Mr. Harold H. Levin 
    Well, perhaps -- perhaps I ought to be prepared on that, Your Honor, but well, I am not here representing a building and loan association or a small or -- nor do I know how they operate. 
    I know some of them operate in very fancy buildings and like banks and lend very substantial sums.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3156.158" stopTime="3157.348">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- they could be.
speaker="harold_h_levin" startTime="3157.348" stopTime="3420.651">
    Mr. Harold H. Levin 
    That's correct, but you're talking in terms of what the employer is or does. 
    I agree with Your Honor 100%, but if you're talking about -- and this doesn't happen to be one of those. 
    But if you're talking about what happens and what the employees do, and we certainly have been warned sufficiently by this Court. 
    That is what the employees do that counts and not what the employer does, then I think the question is, are these employees engaged in a local activity or aren't they? 
    Are they engaged in an activity where they are dealing at the end of the stream of commerce to “the Administrator” or are they not? 
    And I -- I assert that the Congress, in adapting this amendment, definitely indicated that it was going to leave it to the industries, that is not leave it to the industries, but permit the industries to say what is their custom and practice and then have the courts or the Administrator, and the Administrator determine what is correct. 
    Now, the fear that this would open the -- the door to a tremendous number of -- of cases is not -- has not been realized. 
    This is the first case on the subject, in this Court, and the only -- there are only two or three cases besides the small loan cases that -- that I have come across in all of the Circuits. 
    I want to call, Your Honors' attention, if my time is not up. 
    I think I have five minutes. 
    I want to call attention to -- to this aspect, the one referred to by the Chief Justice. 
    One of the objections to the amendment in Congress was that it would leave it to the industry, and that therefore, it wasn't a good idea. 
    This industry recognition test was therefore called a joker. 
    But the answer given by the sponsors was and I quote, “Under the amendment, the courts would decide the question of what sales or services are recognized as retail in a particular industry.” 
    Now, that decision has been made by three -- every court that's heard it. 
    Each of the three lower courts have agreed that this business is recognized as retail in the financial industry. 
    They have the qualifications where we lost, based on the claim that you cannot apply the retail exemption to personal loan company. 
    Now, Senator Holland said, “How better could the matter be left than by recognizing the dividing line between retail sales and wholesale sales in a particular industry of the thousands of industries which will be affected by the law.” 
    And Senator Taft said, hardly, and this is the answer given in the House of Congress, “Hardly, an industry can be found in which the question of what is retail and what is wholesale had not been settled for years. 
    It is a question of fact, just as much as any other question of fact. 
    It is a question of fact which we are perfectly able to determine.” 
    Now, with those pronouncements, I don't see how it can be said that an establishment, which is recognized as retail, as a retail service establishment in an industry, can't qualify unless it meets some preconceived idea of what is a retail service establishment, whether that preconceived idea comes from the Administrator or anybody else. 
    And I might say this to, Your Honors'. 
    I know that you have held and we are reminded that the -- great weight must be given to the Administrator, but the Administrator in -- for a long time has served as an advocate to expand this very good Act and to limit exemptions under it. 
    And when he's defeated in Congress, he turns to the Court. 
    In fact Judge Magruder had occasion to -- to comment on that in connection with the (Inaudible) amendment where he said that the administrator would have us decide this -- this case as though the amendment had not been adapted, and that's what the Administrator is trying to do in this case. 
    Thank you, Your Honors.

   Rebuttal of Bessie Margolin

    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    We do not say that a pawnshop, as such, is within this exemption. 
    We say that to the extent that if it make sales, it might be, but its lending activities are not. 
    As a matter of fact this is a --

    (Voice overlap) pawnshop, is that right?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="3438.376" stopTime="3514.475">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    It's a bailment more than a sale. 
    We say to the extent that they make sales. 
    They are engaged in retail sale, but we do not say that it is such, but its credit transactions are -- are retail. 
    Now, these people are engaged in nothing but the extension of credit. 
    They are dealing with money, not -- not goods or services. 
    A loan is a loan. 
    It's a service only in the broad generic sense that Mr. Henderson and the other economic experts testified and they admittedly testified -- some testified on the theory that every economic endeavor is either a service or sale of goods. 
    Every economic -- couldn't think of anything they wouldn't be and that's the whole theory of the claim here. 
    If you look at the language of this exemption and because I haven't argued it, doesn't mean that we are conceding that the court below was correct in saying this language as clear as a bail. 
    We think the language on its phase is in apposite to the making, to the lending of money. 
    As a matter of fact, the stipulation provides they are engaged in purchasing these accounts receivable. 
    There is no sale of -- of anything there of goods or services.

    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    Well, the -- the original basis the Administrator originally adapted, he was following the stand -- primarily the standard -- industrial classification that the Government had established for other purposes. 
    And as I say, that was approved by the Court. 
    In fact, the record in this case, one of the exhibits of -- of the respondents carried over from the Household Finance case specifically state merchandising and -- and financing are two distinct industries.

    I mean this was -- this was generally recognized.

    For you it's not --
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="3599.031" stopTime="3654.547">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    That it's just not -- it's just not in the category of a retail establishment. 
    Now, it may be that some of their -- that if they don't engage in interstate activities, many of their employees would not be exempt. 
    This exemption was -- was originally, as this Court stated, put in to take care of -- to kind of --to kind of supplement the local retailing capacity exemption, in the Jacksonville paper that was stated. 
    And it was early interpreted, to have nothing to do in the -- in the other distinct types of industries. 
    Now, I did want them to make -- take some time to make a response to this picture of this little local basement office that counsel has painted. 
    The stipulation -- in this case, the interstate activities of the small loan business was not developed or were not developed because of the stipulation that they were sufficiently engaged in interstate activity.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3654.547" stopTime="3656.027">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Where that stipulation?
speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="3656.027" stopTime="3742.442">
    Ms. Bessie Margolin 
    The stipulation is -- is in the record and I don't think there's any question about it. 
    If I don't need to take the term, it is definitely stipulated, but they weren't sufficiently engaged to be within the general coverage terms if they were not within this exemption. 
    Now, I take it that the Court isn't concerned with this question related specifically to this particular small loan company. 
    That what we're concerned with here is whether the -- this exemption applies to the small loan business generally in this country, and that is one of the -- the exhibits in this case. 
    It says that a small loan business is not a small business. 
    That's big business. 
    It's a billion and a dollar a year annual business and its -- the bulk of it is in the hands of 20 huge chains, nationwide chains, closely integrated. 
    And I see my time's expired, but I will refer the Court to the decision in the Aetna Finance case, the First Circuit's decision to see the interstate character of this business is -- but it's certainly not purely local.
