Anonymous Nos. 6 and 7 v. Baker
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="0.000" stopTime="518.222">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    .Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from contempt of court convictions made by a New York State Supreme Court justice, conducting a judicial inquiry into alleged so called ambulance chasing in Kings County, Brooklyn, New York. 
    The appellants were sentenced 30 days to sit in prison for refusal to answer questions. 
    Each appellant served two days and they are both enlarged in bail pending the determination of the appeal. 
    Their refusal to answer these questions was based upon the fact that the justice denied or refused to allow their counsel to be present in the courtroom while they were being questioned. 
    And the appellants now make a claim on this appeal that the denial of their counsel's presence in the courtroom while they were being questioned and the appellants now make the claim on this appeal that the denial of their counsel presence in the courtroom where they were being question was a denial to them of their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. 
    The order of this Court of November was from the consideration of jurisdiction until the argument of the case on appeal. 
    Our position on that jurisdictional aspect is that appeal does lie here as a matter of technical right, and in any event a substantial question being presented that the Court can make the decision of the question by the route of certiorari if for technical reasons, appeal fails. 
    Now, on the right to come here by way of appeal, the appellants take the position that Section 90 subdivision 10 of our local judiciary law in the State of New York, as construed and applied in this case, denied them their Fourteenth Amendment due process. 
    The section in brief provides for conduct of investigations by the appellate division of the conduct of attorneys at law. 
    And one of the provisions is that until a certain stage is reached, these investigations must be made privately. 
    Now in this case, the review of the commitments on the local law has to be taken by so called Article 78 proceedings, the equivalent of a common law certiorari and where a justice of the Supreme Court is involved as a party, the proceeding must be initiated in the intermediate appellate court or the appellate division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York. 
    So that the instant case started by original petitions in the appellate division of the Supreme Court for a review of these commitments. 
    The appellate division in this case, dismissed the petition on the ground that there was no distinction between the case we presented and a prior case which we designate as a companion case, which had then recently been decided by the appellate division and needs to appeal had been denied by the Court of Appeals. 
    In our case, the essential part of the ruling on this point is stated on page 10 of our brief and the appellate division said that we contented that our case was different from Anonymous M from the so called companion case. 
    They cite the Anonymous M case and they find that there was no difference and therefore our petitions were dismissed. 
    Now the Anonymous M case, the opinion on that or the essential portion on jurisdiction is printed on page 15 of our brief and there we say that the appellate division construed the right of the justice conducting the inquiry to exclude counsel to come out of this Section 90 subdivision 10. 
    The excerpt of this is a short one, it's central, and I'll read it. 
    The order also provided, this is from the companion case, that for the purposes of protecting the reputation of innocent persons, the said inquiry and investigation shall be conducted in private pursuant to the provisions of the judiciary law Section 90, Subdivision 10. 
    Then I have omitted certain portions and they conclude, it was not an abuse of discretion for the additional special term to exclude petitioner's attorney from the room while petitioner was being questioned. 
    Now was it a violation of his constitutional rights? 
    Citing a local case which has nothing to do with it and matter of Groban then recently decided in this Court in judiciary law Section 90, so that we say that our petitions were dismissed in the appellate division on the ground that this local statute authorized the exclusion of counsel in order to maintain the statutory privacy. 
    Now after the dismissal of our petitions in the intermediary appellate court, we took an appeal as a matter of a right to the Court of Appeals to higher State Court of New York on the ground that a constitutional question was involved. 
    Then counsel for respondent made a motion in that court to dismiss on the ground that no substantial constitutional question was involved and the Court of Appeals granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that no substantial constitutional question was involved. 
    It should be no different if there was no challenge to the form in which we took our appeal. 
    It was the substance of our appeal that was thus adjudicated and we say that under the decisions of this Court that adjudication by the Court of Appeals at least for the purposes of jurisdiction is an affirmance of what was done in the appellate division. 
    Now with that as the premise, this is the way we start out our right to appeal as a technical matter under the decisions of this Court. 
    This Court will not review a construction of the statute of the state, especially in its constitutional aspect unless the court -- the higher State Court itself either had an opportunity to construe it in relation to the constitutional challenge or in fact they construe it in relation to the constitutional challenge. 
    Now we say that the appellate division decision went up to the Court of Appeals which the Court of Appeals in effect did affirm, gave a full and complete notice that what was done here was done under this local statute, that it was challenged on the ground that would be unconstitutionality that is to say that it would deny due process. 
    And that the Court of Appeals had ample opportunity to say what it wanted to say in point of construction of that statute so that we say as a technical legal manner that appeal lies here because we have satisfied the rule, laid down on the cases of this Court that the highest State Court either did construe it or had a chance to construe it.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you specifically advise the statute -- constitutionality of the statute?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="522.509" stopTime="572.545">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    I did not, not in the appellate division. 
    The point I am making here is there is a bifocal approach. 
    Either the necessity for the challenge in the State Court as I see it Your Honor is to give the highest State Court an opportunity to construe the statute, but if even without anybody raising the question, the record as a whole shows that the decision in the higher State Court was an affirmance of our position taken on the basis of a statute, then we have the substantial or real equivalent of a decision by the higher State Court that this statute authorizes exclusion and we are here as a matter of right by route of appeal.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="572.545" stopTime="583.981">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do I hear correctly that do you think the companion case Anonymous M was a different case from your case and did not govern your case, isn't it?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="583.981" stopTime="615.679">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Only -- not in respect -- my answer should be no sir. 
    Only in respect of a local matter, there was a question of discretion involved. 
    The appellate division had decided two things. 
    The appellant division didn't say that all must, all counsel must be excluded. 
    The appellate division there said that the justice at the inquiry had the right to exclude counsel over discretion to admit him. 
    The fuller text of that opinion shows that. 
    Now the distinction we make --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="615.679" stopTime="629.650">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I thought, read it actually somewhere that you indicated the circumstances in the companion case, Anonymous M, were different from circumstances in this case, that is correct, isn't it?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="629.650" stopTime="630.866">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    That is correct in respect --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="630.866" stopTime="647.214">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And in this case, your claim is that he is not merely a witness as to the conduct of others but potentially he himself was or the defendant or may, may become a defendant that was not true in the companion case, was it?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="647.214" stopTime="648.259">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="648.259" stopTime="681.849">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And therefore you say the misconception, it wasn't misconception, the appellate division to find Anonymous M controlling from which I draw the inference, you tell me if it were just as I believe that the statute as such does not -- does not violate or offend the Fourteenth Amendment, but the application made of it to the particular circumstances of the case which you are arguing, am I right about that?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="681.849" stopTime="695.232">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    We have -- perhaps one qualification -- I think Your Honor is right on that as to our position. 
    We take the traditional position that the statute as construed and applied to our particular case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="695.232" stopTime="717.733">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That is true of every statute which is as it were arbitrarily applied to a particular situation makes them appeal although the statute continues to stand, continues to be enforceable and tomorrow after the effects of decision it just as operated as it was the day before?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="717.733" stopTime="731.377">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    That could be. 
    On the other hand there are statutes by their face upon a mere reading so far impinge upon constitutional limitation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="731.377" stopTime="732.545">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That is in this case.
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="732.545" stopTime="753.108">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    No because that statute was dragged in here by the heels. 
    It was never intended to cover a so called ambulance chasing investigation. 
    The statute has a long history, but that of course is not for this Court. 
    Those were some of the collateral matters that we argued in the local court. 
    We were --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="753.108" stopTime="765.113">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What becomes then, the underlying basis of the action of, what this judge authorized was this order to investigate ambulance case, wasn't it?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="765.113" stopTime="765.625">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="765.625" stopTime="767.213">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That gave him his jurisdiction.
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="767.213" stopTime="768.842">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Yes sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="768.842" stopTime="776.545">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that is the real, the real offence here is whether under that order he could do what is denied to him?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="776.545" stopTime="795.812">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Only in one way, he didn't act only under the order. 
    He was authorized by the order to act under the law. 
    He applied the law. 
    He was authorized by the order to undo the statute to exclude people so as to maintain the privacy. 
    The statute is right in the crux of this problem.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="795.812" stopTime="806.474">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Didn't the order accorded at a special term -- set forth that in order to protect the innocent people he may exclusively hold the hearings in camera.
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="806.474" stopTime="810.446">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Yes and it referred to this section of the statute. 
    The statute is right there.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="810.446" stopTime="814.587">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But because if flowed from that order, is it not?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="814.587" stopTime="1110.480">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    His appointment flowed from the order, but he applied the law, he applied the statute. 
    Now on this question of the jurisdiction, we, he didn't detain the case much longer because in any event I think the question as to whether or not we presented a substantial question is, subsumed in the court's decision that the problem be postponed, the jurisdictional problem for the argument of the case on the merit. 
    So even if for technical reasons we failed on this question of right of appeal, I think the Court can decide the question by way of certiorari and the problem is really here without any serious impediment and now to the merits. 
    This was an order to investigate alleged malpractice by attorneys and others associated with them in Kings County. 
    The appellants here are not attorneys. 
    They are licensed investigators and they are just that. 
    They are licensed by the State of New York. 
    They have a defined function in the scheme of negligence, litigation and settlement. 
    Now they were subpoenaed to come before this investigation of the judicial inquiry. 
    They came with counsel and they repeatedly pointed out to the judge that before they had come in for the actual questioning, they and their counsel had been informed by a member of inquiry staff that enough evidence had already been gathered against them to submit to the district attorney, that the enquiry doesn't intend to pussyfoot with them and that is if they come clean so to speak, that will be taken into consideration. 
    The testimony that was given by this member of the staff is found on page 115 and 116 in the record. 
    The way he came to give the testimony was that these parties repeatedly turned to the judge and said, we are not here as witnesses, we are here as prospective defendants, we are here as targets of this investigation. 
    We need the advice of counsel, and we were threatened they said. 
    And so the judge for the integrity of this process I suppose held a hearing to find out who threatened and when he was told especially that a member of the inquiry staff did it. 
    And so he heard testimony about one or two other witnesses and then came to the particular member of the staff and questioned and he was told you heard what was said and what you say about it. 
    And Your Honor see here, there on the page, that he tells his part of the story and he goes on to say, I don't know my exact language, but I indicated that we did not intend to pussyfoot with them. 
    We were not trying to trap them in any manner, but the testimony and evidence have come before us in the course of our investigation that someone and the employer Gotham Claims Service, these appellants did business on their partnership name of Gotham Claims Service, had with some frequency obtained statements from defendants holding themselves out to be from defendants carriers and also holding themselves out to be from other agencies and in one instance the district attorney's office. 
    That our investigation had disclosed that these statements had been tampered with and that it was these statements -- and that it was relative to this that we wish to speak to them to find out if these statements were actually taken by Gotham Claims service for what attorneys these statements were taken, and whether the tampering was done by them or their employees, or a direction of some attorney. 
    And then he says something else, he finally says, I further stated that in my opinion there was prima facie evidence in the event that the clients decided to plead the Fifth Amendment to refer the matter to the district attorney's office. 
    All this had happened before these people were called into the courtroom to be questioned and in light of this they repeatedly made their protest to the judge that they want the help of counsel while they were being questioned and he nevertheless denied.

    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    No Your Honor they weren't yet. 
    Their further investigation is being held up pending this litigation. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1125.235" stopTime="1140.668">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did the appellant claim immunity under the New York constitution? 
    Did they refuse, did they object to the whole inquiry and not merely decide a counsel --
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1140.668" stopTime="1148.279">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Now they faced their refusal solely on the ground that their counsel was not allowed to be present?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1148.279" stopTime="1151.435">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They did not invoke the state constitution of immunity, did they?

    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    They did not.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1152.409" stopTime="1159.251">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Or contest against the constitutionality of the proceeding in its entirely?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1159.251" stopTime="1284.422">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    No sir. 
    There is no other questions in this case that whether or not the denial to them or the presence of their own counsel during the questioning in the courtroom so vitiated the process as to render this commitment void, that's the sole question before this Court. 
    Now what actually is done with this evidence that is gathered at the judicial inquiry is disclosed now by a report made, an interim report by Mr. Justice Arkwright to the appellate division. 
    In quotations from that report in our brief, he says how many doctors the evidence that the doctors sent up for a prosecution before the medical board, how many are sent to the District Attorney's office and it shows the closest liaison between this office and the District Attorney's office, it's right there in his own report, it's just as though they were in an anteroom of the District Attorney's office once you take people after they are examined, right into the other room for presentation for indictment, I said you take people, I mean you take their evidence. 
    Now, the reason for emphasizing this is that the brief for appellee and the position of Mr. Justice Arkwright in his answer, made very light of the whole thing. 
    They preceded on as though (Inaudible) as though this was something else, as though they were just conducting some sort of preliminary inquiry and thereafter a report is made for the appellate division and the appellate division then says what to do with it. 
    Now, in words that of course is so but in reality and there is own report shows, that isn't anymore so than if the people here involved were clerks in the District Attorney's office gathering the information so as to bring it into the Grand Jury room.

    Technically Your Honor when Mr. Justice Arkwright gets through, he does nothing more then send his report to the appellate division, but that's only technically. 
    It's as if the clerk and the anteroom in the District Attorney's office, when he gets through examining somebody, and develops a case against him, he doesn't himself make a judgment of conviction he takes it in for the further steps. 
    Substantially what happens is that here is where these people are being tried.

    They were the ones being questioned and secondly aside from that, there wasn't any question in any one of the prior investigations as to whether or not privacy reaches to the point, when a man accused in every realistic sense of the word cannot come in with his counsel.

    We say that he being a potential defendant had all his constitutional rights, among them the right in the first place to be represented by counsel and that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1697.799" stopTime="1700.362">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So is that the Fourteenth Amendment?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1700.362" stopTime="1702.342">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Under the Fourteenth Amendment.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1702.342" stopTime="1709.394">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Why he, under the Fourteenth Amendment he could be prosecuted for a crime and not be entitled to the defense of counsel.
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1709.394" stopTime="1752.027">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Well that depends upon the -- yes there are situations, but in this case he had the right as a potential defendant to representation in a criminal case by -- a potentially (Inaudible) by a counsel. 
    In our state we allow counsel in all criminal cases. 
    Now, getting back to the question or the implications as I get them from Your Honor's question, about he could have invoked the state privilege against self incrimination, of course he could have, but does the existence of one constitutional right constitute a basis for the denial of another?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1752.027" stopTime="1753.086">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Not if he has it.
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1753.086" stopTime="1773.674">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Not if he has it, now of course we claim he had, now the second thing is, these were laymen. 
    There are difficulties about invoking constitutional rights. 
    There are intricate angles of waiver, depends upon how much you say, and what attitude you take and whether you do it on the affirmative.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1773.674" stopTime="1776.053">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Could he go out in the hall and consult his counsel?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1776.053" stopTime="1802.806">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Yes he could go out in the hall and consult his counsel and that only emphasizes the violation of his constitutional rights. 
    In this case the judge below at certain junctures told them that they may consult their counsel outside. 
    Now Your Honor will surely know, the counsel outside cannot know the course of proceedings, the conjunction at which a man is asked the question.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1802.806" stopTime="1804.900">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But he could tell him don't answer anything.
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1804.900" stopTime="1805.335">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    He could tell him --

    (Inaudible)
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1807.185" stopTime="1836.316">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    It all depends upon whether or not counsel wants to act clumsily or whether he wants to act to the best of his ability with full knowledge. 
    Now counsel outside doesn't know exactly what's happening. 
    Here is a (Inaudible) layman who comes out and tells him, the judge told me this or that. 
    That has happened. 
    I have been outside with trials there. 
    It's the most difficult thing in the world to get it from them whether layman or lawyer to get the exact conjunction at which whatever question arouse.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1836.316" stopTime="1857.342">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Weissman but your case here if it doesn't (Inaudible) finds great support from the fact that a member of the staff told him we are not going to pussyfoot with you, you could have reported that. 
    That's not a clumsy problem. 
    Even the layman in this business would understand that, wouldn't he?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1857.342" stopTime="1857.779">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Yeah.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1857.779" stopTime="1862.626">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Indeed your claim is that that would make your case different from Anonymous M?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1862.626" stopTime="1868.050">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Yeah. 
    He didn't have to resort to that. 
    Every man doesn't have to claim --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1868.050" stopTime="1878.286">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now but the question is whether it violates the federal constitution, whether – that he wasn't allowed to have a lawyer in although he could have protected himself (Inaudible) by not having him in?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="1878.286" stopTime="2285.662">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    He could not -- if he could have protected -- I will say two things. 
    In the first place he could not have protected himself and plead no reason adequately if he didn't have his lawyer in there. 
    And then in second place even if he could, if he faced is a criminal trial, he is entitled to be presented in pretrial proceedings by counsel and he doesn't have to have counsel on an as-if basis, counsel standing outside to get information from him in a frightened condition or otherwise. 
    If counsel is going to represent somebody, if he has a right to representation by counsel, it must be then and there. 
    There's another consideration as was indicated by the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black in the Groban case. 
    This in an in-camera proceeding. 
    While it's been sanctioned in the Karlin case and never taken up higher, this is still an in-camera proceeding with all the invidious and unfortunate consequences that in-camera proceedings have to this day. 
    An in-camera proceeding is not only vicious when it was conducted in history, it is infinitely more vicious in these more civilized times. 
    Now in such a situation it is a very comfort and great protection for a man when he is being grilled by a judge, a large staff of counsel in the courtroom to have the guiding hand of counsel and he is entitled to it. 
    Now we say Your Honors that that the decisions below were rested on the misapprehension of the reach of the decision of this case in matter of Groban. 
    And while dissecting precedence is hardly a profitable undertaking in most times, in this case it will help to focus the problem down, the considerations in relation to this problem were fully developed by the three opinions in matter of Groban and we say that in substantial, realistic respect, the case of matter of Groban is based upon considerations that do not apply here and entirely different from the considerations that apply here and that in this case the man was entitled to his counsel. 
    Now there were the three opinions, one by Mr. Justice Reed and there was a concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter and there was the dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Black. 
    First I think it is profitable to see that the considerations that moved the prevailing opinion of Mr. Justice Reed are entirely absent and different here and I shall show that even the concurring opinion was based on considerations that has applied to the circumstances of this case would warrant a holding here, require a holding here, the counsel should have been allowed. 
    In the first place, we had in the Groban case, a fire marshal making an investigation of causes of a fire. 
    Perhaps the situation as you view it as a whole (Inaudible), but practically through the imagination you could see that one cannot compare, considerations applying to the investigation of a fire by a fire marshal to hearing in the courtroom, the old appellate division courtroom with bench as long as this, Judge in a courtroom outside as lighted up as this courtroom with a large staff of counsel on one side having a man in there and he is not to be represented. 
    The situations are entirely different in the, and the difference is even shown in the very open book of our language. 
    People say what's your hurry where is the fire. 
    The fire marshal is in a hurry. 
    He has to do things quickly. 
    It didn't happen to be in that case that it was done in such a hurry but the ruling had to be made on a basis that he would exercise his power this way and that way Your Honors kind of made a ruling for every hour of these function, but he was a fire marshal. 
    He may have to run with some people right down and while things are smoldering and find out what's the cause of the fire and in such circumstances to require representation and perhaps some reasonable time for preparation. 
    It violates the essential function involved. 
    We have no such problem here and this is a long investigation, judicial investigation, hearings in a courtroom presided over by a judge. 
    We don't have that kind of hurry. 
    Now in the Groban case it was prominently stated both in the majority opinion and Mr. Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion that all that you had there was that the man who came here to this Court and complained, said that he suspected or that there was a suspicion against him. 
    And both Mr. Justice Reed's opinion and Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion had worded to the fact that this was not anything aimed at a man who have been accused. 
    There was a suspicion and Mr. Justice Reed pointed out in that case that the suspicion that was -- they had argued before this Court, was without even any (Inaudible) or any proof or any affidavit to sustain the fact that the fire marshal had any suspicion against the man involved in Groban. 
    And you have no such problem here because before the questioning commenced, the very judge was informed in that proceeding that his assistant had already told the man that they had gathered against him evidence, prima facie evidence sufficient to make out a crime and we won't pussyfoot with you. 
    If you don't play ball we'll send it to the district attorney. 
    So that in the Groban case you had a suspicion, and here you have a man who in every real sense of the word and its meaning in the English language was accused. 
    The brief for appellee and that's the argument we'll talk about accusation in the technical sense.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2285.662" stopTime="2298.139">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Suppose in the New York statute or the Judge Arkwright said, one man grand jury, would that be of any difference to your position?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="2298.139" stopTime="2530.107">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Well as I remember the Murchison case which I didn't cite here I don't think that there'd be much difference but I am not in a position to say, difficult enough to focus on the one problem and perhaps the analogy might be misleading and I have really haven't considered it from that point of view. 
    There is another aspect of the investigation and will involve the Murchison situation because this judge sits in a dual capacity explicitly under the (Inaudible). 
    He is both investigator and justice of the Supreme Court. 
    He investigates and he adjudicates, but that problem is not involved in this. 
    This is solely the question of right of representation by counsel. 
    Now in another point that was made in the prevailing opinion in Groban was that in any event, if anything was done unfairly to extract evidence from the person who ultimately is charged with crime that can be shown upon a subsequent prosecution at the prosecution level as a basis for a plea to exclude like in the general considerations of the forced evidence or involuntary evidence of whether there was something on there. 
    Now that's the very important thing to remember because in this case these people had no such chance whatever, these people are called to give evidence before a justice of the Supreme Court and under our local practice act and under the common law everywhere, when you give evidence in court (Inaudible) that's it, you have no more defenses. 
    You can't impeach that in any subsequent trial except on relevancy, but I mean as to it's -- the genuineness of the evidence that was given. 
    Now in the concurring opinion written by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, emphasis was laid on the fact that the statute there was not aimed at suspect and the thought was developed from which I rely here to some extent, that if there are differences, as I read the opinion, the concurring opinion it reserved on the decision made and the concurring opinion as I read it, and this sounds probably I'm sure to Mr. Justice Frankfurter, because he knows what he wrote and I'm just reading it and imagining the (Inaudible). 
    That was no general warrant in the Groban case to investigate people without counsel, no matter how near you get to the suspect line and so on. 
    And Mr. Justice Frankfurter there wrote the sentence that if there are differences in degree a due regard for due process requires that those differences be given their significance. 
    Now here we don't have any differences of degree. 
    We have a substantially different situation. 
    We have a court process and not a fire marshal's investigation or anybody else's investigation. 
    This is called an investigation, but it's made by a court. 
    A court in all its aspects functions judicially. 
    A court has administrative functions, but in the whole, in the gross and scope of their judicial functions, administrative aspects of judicial functions.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2530.107" stopTime="2575.943">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I don't find at all the distinction that you are making. 
    As I understand that your -- you of course have to accept the Groban decision because there it is, and as I understand the distinction you have been making, it suggests that there is less danger of unfairness in the case of a man not represented by counsel if the hearing officer is a fire marshal than there is for a man unrepresented by counsel if the hearing officer is a judge, do I gather that correctly?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="2575.943" stopTime="2640.844">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Well I'm sorry if you got that impression it's my fault. 
    I think the danger maybe as great perhaps of one case as in the other. 
    I point out that in fact according to that record and this the danger here was infinitely greater than it was there and then I point out as a matter of law, the judicial process that the court has to take account of the way things are done in life, that what the court may have to reluctantly yield to a fire marshal it doesn't at all have to either reluctantly or yield to a judge. 
    Those things happen all the time in the judicial process, and then they are all like a mathematical formula. 
    You first take account of realities, and I think that pervading the whole Groban opinion and this language shows it was, that the majority side, was that this was a fire marshal. 
    We are dealing with fires. 
    Fires need expedi --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2640.844" stopTime="2643.167">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The fire was over in that case, wasn't it?
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="2643.167" stopTime="2724.565">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    In there, I said before in that case, it happened that the fire was over, but it is hardly to be expected that this Court will make a decision for a fire marshal when he is at the fire and then what happens a half hour later or a half hour before or a half hour or a day later, those things are done that way. 
    Maybe if a fire marshal comes back here or a fire marshal's case where the thing had been over for six or eight weeks, maybe Your Honors might think that the considerations of fine even to a fire marshal should not apply to a situation six or eight weeks later. 
    I do not say that our man was in less danger, if he were before one or another. 
    What I said about the fire marshal was try to read the considerations that the judicial process has to wrestle with in concrete situations. 
    Now what it says about a fire marshal is one thing, what it says about a judge, holding a hearing in an open court with a large staff of counsel on another side is another thing. 
    But further my distinctions go in showing that in point of fact the facts disclosed by that record showed an infinitely less situation of danger requiring protection than ours.

    Just in the interest of accuracy, I suppose your brother would tell us, but isn't this like the many instances to which Chief Judge Cardozo referred where the whole proceeding is initiated by a bar association, it makes the petitions to the appellate division and the appellate division then decides whether the representations are of sufficient gravity to call for an inquiry and when it finds a sufficient gravity as it did in the Karlin case, it then designates a special justice of the Supreme Court to sit in as the hearing master, a report to it, and the hearing master (Inaudible) Supreme Court of either the first division or the second or any of the other four divisions in New York, is then assisted by a lawyer designated by the petition in bar association, isn't that correct?

    The appellate division did that in a decision. 
    If I answer Your Honor inadvertently here and perhaps mislead you, the appellate division enjoined privacy in the older, but in another decision which we have included in our brief, they indicated that since in that case, this companion case, the matter of M. Anonymous, the person who came before the justice was not a mere witness as to act of somebody else, but was himself a target of the investigation that the judge might well -- very well have exercised his discretion to allow counsel with him in courtroom while he was being questioned.

    -- where I appeared with another witness who again refused, that time he was (Inaudible) to go in without counsel and I was permitted and that was the only instance and the judge himself told me that, that was the only exception, but theretofore he had maintained a rigid adherence to exclusion.

    Yes.
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="3241.917" stopTime="3334.672">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Now Your Honors there are two cases that the filed brief mentions, at the end of term this Court had two cases involving the denial of counsel during a period of preliminary police investigation, and I just want to point out briefly that those cases have nothing to do with this kind of situation. 
    In those cases it was pointed out, in both opinions that whatever was said to the prosecuting authorities was said voluntarily, whereas here the people were brought in under compulsion, to be raised by their heals if they refused to answer, and secondly you have the feature in those two cases, the (Inaudible) case that if there were some abuse involved in procuring the evidence that maybe shown for the purposes of later exclusion, which I've shown before does not exist here. 
    Once they give their evidence they are gone. 
    Now, there has been some attempt to equate this with a Grand Jury procedure and I need only refer to what Mr. Justice Black said in the dissenting opinion, in Groban about the attempt to do that. 
    This of course is not anything like a Grand Jury procedure, certainly not in our state. 
    They couldn't get him to come in and testify without giving him immunity, if he is a target of the investigation.

    Well might, for example on the basis of testimony taken before the judge, the District Attorney prosecute by information, say your client is --
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="3368.833" stopTime="3527.645">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Indeed. 
    My client didn't testify, but others who do indeed. 
    That's one of the functions and purposes of this. 
    If a crime discloses one that could be prosecuted by information, you pick it up from here, you bring in there, you prosecute, that's all there is to it. 
    And then one other point I want to mention is this that some attempt has been made in the brief heretofore and I think obliquely or briefly in this brief, to say that this right of representation by counsel in the criminal case doesn't apply until you have practically called the man up for trial. 
    And verbally that was arguable before the end of term of this Court, and now even verbally that is not arguable. 
    If a man has a right to be represented by a counsel, he has the right to have him when it is most important. 
    If a man goes in before this judge and gives his evidence and has no counsel, then it doesn't matter if had John W. Davis represent him at the prosecution. 
    He is a goner, because all his rights are gone and there is no way to reclaim, and one of those preliminary police investigation cases Your Honors made clear in the opinion by Mr. Justice Clark, that the right for counsel commences at the point in free trial, I think the word was proceedings, but in the scope of the setting, I take it to mean that at the pre-trial action whatever it is, where the man comes in for jeopardy. 
    In this case if the man didn't have his counsel while he was before the judge, he will have been prosecuted later on, if they had as they say they have a case against him for crime without ever having effective representation of counsel. 
    This case Your Honors was in the court. 
    I am aware that I have made this point in several aspects. 
    This was in the courtroom conducted by a judge. 
    This was part of the judicial process, and I say to Your Honors that the Court is the one place in this world where the denial to a person charged to refuse of counsel, should not be allowed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Denis M. Hurley
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3527.645" stopTime="3530.337">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Hurley.
speaker="denis_m_hurley" startTime="3530.337" stopTime="3835.542">
    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think I can probably clarify some of the questions that the Court has been asking by a brief reference to the order of the appellate division establishing this judicial inquiry and investigation. 
    For the convenience of the Court, I have set out the order in an appendix, Appendix A at page 27 of my brief. 
    And there briefly this order was made on the 21st of January 1957 by the court and signed by the presiding justice of the appellate division. 
    And Your Honors will note that it's in the matter of the petition of the Brooklyn Bar Association that this investigation was launched into unprofessional conduct by attorneys and others acting in concert with them in Kings County. 
    Now there's the order on page 27. 
    Then on page 28, the order sets forth the scope of the inquiry, and the scope of the inquiry as set forth therein under the various paragraphs one, two, three, four with respect to alleged improper practices and abuses by attorneys and counselors at law, with respect to alleged, corrupt and unethical practices including the practice of solicitation in obtaining retainers, and in the subsequent prosecution and disposition of claims with respect to any other practice involving professional misconduct, fraud, deceit corruption, crime, misdemeanor and so on. 
    Then the order provides that Judge Arkwright be appointed to conduct this additional special term with full power to compel the attendance of witnesses, their testimony under oath, the production of books and papers. 
    That it was to begin on the 22nd of January 57, and then – I, an attorney and counselor at law, who has been duly designated by the Brooklyn Bar Association is designated to aid the justice in the conduct of the inquiry and in the prosecution of the investigation pursuant to the provisions of the judiciary law set forth. 
    Then the last paragraph concerning privacy as you will notice from the introductory words is for the purpose of protecting the reputation of innocent persons. 
    Now immediately following the order – oh and the one other very important factor, the last directory paragraph states that upon the conclusion of the inquiry and investigation, the justice shall make and file with this Court, that is with the appellate division, his report setting forth his proceedings, his findings and his recommendations. 
    In other words, going back to very first case in New York that I know of where such an inquiry was ordered on the application of the association of the bar of the City of New York in the first department in 1928, in that case the appellate division said and I cited the case in my brief, Matter of Association of the Bar, that is the leading case, and in that case, the court said that the -- it had inherent power to order this investigation, but it also had statutory power to order such an inquiry, a preliminary investigation as this. 
    And the court said, that because the appellate division by virtue of Section 90 of the judiciary law, which is printed in my brief for the convenience of the court immediately following the order Appendix B on page 30, in this statute in the judiciary law Section 90, plenary power as I can see that is vested in the appellate division although the conduct of attorneys they have regulatory control, disciplinary control over attorneys, which incidentally as I understand it from Judge Cardozo's opinion goes back to some 300 years in England, with the Inns of Court where the justices delegated their power to the members of the Inns of Court, all of which is very elaborately set forth in Chief Judge Cardozo's opinion in the Karlin case that's been referred to here.

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    No Your Honor, that is very interesting question and we have found that there is no such power in the justice to grant immunity.

    As a matter of fact for the benefit of such an inquiry as this, and because we had had up to the date of this particular proceeding, we had 60 witnesses invoke their privilege, 24 of whom were attorneys and these attorneys over the last three years or so had some 9500 cases and with their plea of immunity we just can't find out, we can't get the facts from these attorneys. 
    We have been trying to get the state legislature to pass legislation so that a judge presiding with such an inquiry as this may have the power to grant the witness immunity and thereby compel him to talk.

    I think I, one of my assistants started with one and then I added some other questions, he was sick, he wasn't well and he has to be relieved and I took over.

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Only in this, only in this particular case, and in this particular instance where this assistant of mine happened to get sick. 
    He -- judge couldn't hear me. 
    He said he had a terrible cold and he asked me if I please take over and ask the questions. 
    Now referring if Your Honors please to the statute this will answer some more questions, I think I was up to the point of saying that the appellate division has full control of the lawyers. 
    And this order that I have just referred to is a statutory order in this sense that it follows almost literally and in some cases verbatim Section 90 of our judiciary law. 
    And beginning on page 30 I set forth the pertinent parts of the judiciary law pertaining to such a proceeding as this. 
    And then if you get down to about the middle of page 31, you'll see that there is language there to the effect that the presiding justice of the appellate division to which charges of professional misconduct against an attorney and counsel at law had been presented may make an order directing, and then it talks about expenses, how the expenses have to be paid, and then down below that that would as to a specific disciplinary proceeding against attorney A. 
    Then down below that the presiding judge may also make an order directing the expense of a preliminary investigation in such charge, to such charges to be paid by the county treasurer of the county and so forth within the judicial department. 
    And the subdivision 7, that it shall be the duty of any district attorney within the department when so designated by the presiding judge to prosecute all proceedings for the removal or suspension of attorneys, and down below that, or in county's of a certain size that presiding justice may appoint an attorney and counsel at law designated by a duly incorporated bar association approved by him to prosecute any such proceedings and so on. 
    Then we come to subdivision 10 which is the statute which my friend attacks as I say for the first time in this Court, never, never raised in the courts below. 
    Now if Your Honors would glance through subdivision 10 of Section 90 set forth in full on page 32 about any statute or rule to the contrary not withstanding all papers, records and documents upon the application or examination of any person for admission to the bar and so forth or in any compliant, on any compliant, inquiry, investigation all these papers shall be sealed and deemed private and confidential and then it goes into the question that the court may on good cause show, divulge these papers and so forth.

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    We think both and judges have so acted.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well does this mean this time then as to the appellants here, there might be finding say that they were dropped in someway, are those findings under Section 10 might be released at the discretion of the appellate division even though they may never have been prosecuted for the crimes suggested by the findings?
speaker="denis_m_hurley" startTime="4601.837" stopTime="4662.770">
    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Yes that's -- you see the duty of the judge and my duty I think this answers another question of the court, our job ends when judge, when the judge reports his proceedings, his findings and his recommendations. 
    Now in answering a question before my friend said, maybe I could elaborate on that. 
    Well what the appellate division, what the judge has done so far is to with respect to lawyers? Well that breaks down into two categories, if there is an adverse report. 
    It breaks down, was there some evidence of criminality here on the part of the lawyer and the appellate division has decided under the judiciary law to send the whole package as it were to the district attorney, they say the district attorney has it now for criminal investigation, he may as well have it for disciplinary proceedings too and under the statute I've just read the district attorney maybe designated to conduct a disciplinary--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4662.770" stopTime="4675.866">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    When you said for a criminal investigation did I correctly understand that maybe that on the basis of the findings and evidence alone there could be a prosecution and information without further criminal investigation?
speaker="denis_m_hurley" startTime="4675.866" stopTime="4698.888">
    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    I don't concede -- I don't understand it that way Your Honor, because what we do, what Judge Arkwright does in this preliminary investigation -- he listens to the witnesses, he listens to the proof and the exhibits we give and when we are all through he sends out, he sends these the stenographer's minutes, the exhibits, he sends the whole kit and caboodle to the appellate division with recommendations.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4698.888" stopTime="4702.537">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well now suppose the appellate division sends as you say the package to the --
speaker="denis_m_hurley" startTime="4702.537" stopTime="4793.486">
    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Well then -- the appellate division has been very careful about what it does in these matters. 
    It doesn't appear here but what it does is this. 
    It looks over what the judge submits, conferences in the court with the seven judges, and then they determine whether or not follow the recommendations of Judge Arkwright. 
    They always -- in some cases they haven't followed them. 
    They haven't followed them. 
    In one case where I recall he recommended criminal proceedings they didn't follow that, they just sent it for disciplinary proceedings. 
    Now then if the criminality involved and when it goes to the district attorney. 
    The appellate division has been very careful not in saying that it would refer the material to the district attorney, but they make an order first they made resolutions and now they make orders in this way. 
    And they say that Mr. Justice Arkwright and then necessarily the counsel may in their discretion if they see fit turn over material to the district attorney. 
    In other words, they are being, as I understand, they're being very careful there because since Kings county is in the second judicial department if there should be criminal prosecutions later, the matter may eventually get back on a criminal appeal to that court and the appellate division doesn't want to be put in a position of having prejudged the matter. 
    So that they just do it by this resolution and grant us permission to tell the matter is over.

    It's the first time it has been done and then I asked him why, in addition to that, and they said they wanted to save money.

    The appellate division has to study it, and then it's the appellate division that takes some action or doesn't take any action. 
    If they say it goes to the District Attorney, then the District Attorney considers the whole thing de novo. 
    He's an independent elected official. 
    He decides whether there is a crime here and frankly I'm sure my opponent will go along with me as a practical proposition, there haven't been many criminal prosecutions and those if there have been, they very frankly too haven't been too successful.

    I have a real package in order to answer my opponent and that comes down to answering the question of the Chief Justice. 
    But Justice Harlan asked my opponent a little while ago about whether this was the substandard procedure and my friend said in a few cases. 
    Well I can think off hand of about nine or ten such proceedings, that before I got into this one, frankly two years ago I had nothing, never had anything to do with a disciplinary proceeding and had no idea what this was all about. 
    I looked at the precedents and I found them in Kings County and Queens County and Westchester County and Nassau County, in New York County, presiding Justice Botine, I think it was in 1940 as an Assistant District Attorney had conducted just such a proceeding as this. 
    There were proceedings all over the state, and as a matter of fact, this particular matter is being watched with great interest, because there is one about to be launched in Nassau County on Long Island and they have been in constant touch with me from Buffalo from the Fourth Department that they're thinking of an investigation up there.

    No Your Honor, I'm sorry, but as I read it, and it's a matter of practice, it's not mandatory.

    It doesn't need to be conducted in private and as a matter of fact in the very first case that I referred to before, Association of the Bar, the City of New York in 222 Appellate Division and that's the case the investigation where this matter of Karlan went to the Court of Appeals, there, there was no privacy. 
    There was nothing in the order about conducting it in camera or in secret. 
    So what Judge Wasable did there, and I think very wisely, when an attorney was called in and was to testify, Judge wasable, who said counselor, your conduct is going to be looked into here, we're going to inquire about all these negligence cases you have, do you want a public hearing or do you want it in private?

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Well I don't think so for this reason, this was a summary contempt, criminal contempt as we call it committed in the presence of the justice. 
    Everything had happened before Judge Arkwright and what I was going to come to, except that it's been taking so much time to get across the statutory provisions in the order, is that the time factor here was -- is I think of vital consideration. 
    The interesting thing here is that these witnesses were first called in as witnesses on December 4, 1957 they were called in. 
    And on the plea of their attorney, there was different counsel at the special time, the matter was adjourned, that testimony was adjourned, pending this appeal in matter of Anonymous, which was then pending in the appellate division. 
    Now the -- that was an unrelated matter to this particular situation except on the sense it arose out of this inquiry and M. Anonymous involved an attorney. 
    Now my friend says it's -- his case is so different and the appellate division didn't find itself. 
    As a matter of fact there was so much criminality in the M. Anonymous case that he was later indicated by the grand jury in King's county and tried in the county court. 
    But on that day December 24 -- December 4th there was the attorney for the appellants who in the presence of the appellants walked up to my assistant counsel as soon as they got the adjournment and came out of the courtroom, and these were his words according to the record, counsel for the appellants wanted to know from my assistant exactly what was wanted of his clients in this matter. 
    And then it was that my assistant without any previous authorization or consultation with me or the judge or anybody else off the record and as a favor to them, for which he was thanked, gave his views as to what evidence we had available that are concerning them and there was his language that's been quoted in both briefs about a sufficient evidence to present to the grand jury.

    115, yes I have it here.
speaker="denis_m_hurley" startTime="5540.202" stopTime="5673.107">
    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    The point that I'd like to make in that connection is where my assistant said first he talked about the fact that we were interested primarily in attorneys, we were looking into the conduct of attorneys. 
    And he wanted to know whether these young men, licensed private detectives, whether they had taken these statements, for what attorney's statements were taken, and whether the tampering was done by them or their employees or at the direction of some attorney. 
    So that he was indicating that we were primarily interested in lawyers and what lawyers did. 
    Then he goes on and he says I further stated that in my opinion there was prima facie evidence in the event that the clients decided to plead the Fifth Amendment to refer this matter to the district attorney. 
    Now my friend in this Court and courts below and the other attorney for these appellants in the courts below say that that was a threat of prosecution by the district attorney. 
    Well I think if you study that language carefully and honestly this is what I believe my assistant had in mind since we were concerned with the conduct of these attorneys. 
    I further stated in my opinion it was prima facie evidence in the event the clients decided to plead the Fifth Amendment invoked their, rather than it should have been the New Yorker constitution, but to invoke that constitutional privilege to refer the matter to the district attorney for prosecution, I don't think so. 
    We wanted these men to talk and I think that that language is far more susceptible. 
    Though I am going to take, I am going to take for granted in this argument what my, what my adversary says it means but I think it's far more susceptible of the proposition that these young men would probably say to the district attorney in order to obtain immunity from prosecution rather than, rather than they were going to be sent there to be convicted for crime, because that wouldn't do our inquiry any good.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5673.107" stopTime="5743.227">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well it seems to me that the language at the beginning of his answers is a little more cryptic and a little more challenging than you suggest what you have read. 
    His answer was, my recollection of the facts as they took place on December 4th was that following Mr. Zangara, this is on top of page 115, was that following Mr. Zangara being before the court and asking for an adjournment that he and his clients approached me in the outer foyer outside the courtroom and Mr. Zangara as spokesman for the group, asked me exactly what was wanted of his clients in this matter. 
    I, at that time, told Mr. Zangara that all, I don't know my exact language, but I indicated that we did not intend to pussyfoot with them. 
    Now that's pretty -- that's rather strong language it seems to me if taken together with the rest of it. 
    It isn't -- it isn't just I'll do you a favor and I'll be glad to tell you what to, what we have got here and so forth and --
speaker="denis_m_hurley" startTime="5743.227" stopTime="5752.773">
    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Your Honor please, the point where I say that favor was involved, is that my assistant talked at all. 
    He had a -- he had this lawyer Zangara --

    He should have had counsel too and talk with these people outside of the court room.

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    He had Zangara their lawyer and these two appellants, these two licensed private detectives, who -- who were so fearful of what might happen that that -- that the reason they ultimately said that they wouldn't testify without the presence of counsel after the court and I had repeatedly told them the matter had been decided by the appellate division and leave to appeal had been denied in the Court of Appeals, one of these young man said, this to the court, the court if you wish to go out I will suspend for a few minutes and let you go out and here is the answer of this witness, the witness, no Your Honor because I understand the United States Supreme Court has not ruled on it yet. 
    Now these were not ignorant layman as my friend would have you believe. 
    He is a licensed private detective and they are also insurance brokers.

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Well I think I don't -- I haven't got the specific case in mind if Your Honor please as to what the licensing department would do here, but I am sure there would be a very serious question if a young man comes in to be a licensed private detective that he certainly got to answer any proper questions that the authorities would put to him. 
    I don't say it's strictly analogous with this Court's recent decision in Lerner against Casey and in the matter of the Philadelphia school teacher, but I would say if they are asking for the privilege of a license from the State of New York, they certainly got to answer any questions that the authority wants to put to them.

    May I say this --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5895.674" stopTime="5911.345">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean, as I understand it, that if the man had, he is not allowed to have a lawyer there, apparently he can't refuse to testify on that ground and if he claimed the privilege, he would be denied a license, to continue in the business, if he claimed the constitutional privilege.

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Yes. 
    May I just in answer to that question paraphrase or reword the question as I see it that's before this Court and this will sum up everything I think. 
    In other words, the question as I see it is do these appellants, as mere witnesses, have a constitutional right to the presence of their counsel in the hearing room in what has been called by the Court of Appeals as a quasi administrative proceeding. 
    In other words, the appellate division could have conducted this investigation itself and Judge Arkwright and now Judge Baker is merely the nominee of the appellate division and I am assisting the judges. 
    It's a quasi administrative in that sense. 
    It's non-adversary. 
    It's non accusatory, it's non-prosecutorial and it's a preliminary fact finding inquiry that doesn't end in any judgment or decree and establishes the rights of no persons whatsoever.

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Now that's the question, on the merits as to that Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6015.548" stopTime="6016.320">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The question that I --
speaker="denis_m_hurley" startTime="6016.320" stopTime="6178.962">
    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    I'd like to give you a three fold answer in capsule form, one we rely upon the decisional law of the State of New York as to the right of a witness to counsel which has remained unchallenged for 73 years. 
    I am going back to a case that was decided by the Court of Appeals in 1885 and the right of a witness to counsel didn't come up again, until came up in this proceeding in matter of Anonymous. 
    That is 73 years unchallenged in the State of New York till it was challenged in matter of Anonymous and now here again. 
    We rely upon the decision of this Court in matter of Groban, decided two years ago. 
    And thirdly I don't want to sit down without saying this Your Honors that we rely upon the public policy of the State of New York expressed by the people through their legislatures that witnesses in such an inquiry as this have no right to counsel. 
    In the back of my brief, in the back of my brief Your Honors, the very last pages, you will find on page 41 Appendix E, the Civil Rights Law of the State of New York. 
    There on page 41, 73 five different agencies are given, are defined as agencies where a witness is given the limited or restricted right to be accompanied by counsel and then judicial inquiries were not included there. 
    That was in 54. 
    So in 1958, a bill was introduced which I have set forth in the last two pages of my brief page 43 and 44. 
    A bill was introduced in the legislature in New York to amend the civil rights law in relation to the right of representation by counsel of persons called as witnesses in certain inquires and investigations. 
    That bill would have answered this case and would have answered the contention of my opponent, because it doesn't allow, even the bill doesn't allow in a judicial inquiry or another investigation, it doesn't allow witnesses in blanket form, every witness, the right to counsel but only witnesses whose testimony, and I am reading from the bill, may tend to involve himself or other persons in any subsequent criminal or quasi criminal prosecution. 
    I submit that on that basis --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6178.962" stopTime="6179.919">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was that bill enacted?

    What is its relevance here?
speaker="denis_m_hurley" startTime="6187.312" stopTime="6237.496">
    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    I say that the people of the State of New York having enacted the civil rights law and having granted in five different investigations by five different agencies, the right to counsel to witnesses in limited form, then when the, the assemblymen came along and introduced the measure that would have amended that and allowed counsel in a judicial inquiry under certain circumstances and that failed a passage that this matter is very much of a great concern to the people of the State of New York through their legislators. 
    And I submit that as a proposition of whether with that consideration going on in the State of New York, this Court should intervene or interfere and overrule and predetermine for the people what has been decided now as a matter of policy.

    Most of the – most of the witnesses, it is hard for me to say, I would say one to four, or one to five, in other words every witness -- if we call five witnesses, it would be one lawyer in the five. 
    In other words, we have to call in plaintiffs and claimants, and doctors, and police, and labor delegates and so forth. 
    I suggest this to Your Honors that of these witnesses, we examined 726 in court up to June 11th, by the time that this matter broke and if witnesses were allowed -- counsel was allowed for witnesses in these 100s of cases, it seems to me, as was pointed out in the opinion of the Groban case, that we have -- to say that there would be delay, that this would be cumbersome, that this would be unwieldy, and add unduly to the cost of this well. 
    I just don't see any possibility of our ever getting through and I might suggest to Your Honors that up to this very moment, the expenses have run over $200,000 a year where -- the City of New York has paid over $400,000 to date and if witnesses were allowed counsel, it would just make it that much more cumbersome and make just that much more delay and I don't know when we have to get through with the investigation.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well I suppose if there are four lay witness who run for the lawyers that the numbers, the numbers that you gave us isn't the sort of materials might otherwise be, because I suppose most of those and a great many of them are voluntary witnesses who would have no case and have a lawyer who were not under investigation, but how many people are potential defendants among those that you examined?
speaker="denis_m_hurley" startTime="6422.223" stopTime="6497.817">
    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Well, that's very difficult to say. 
    I'd say before we get through we have got -- if we only examine into lawyers who filed say a 100 statements of retainer a year, now that's about a two a week allowing two weeks of vacation and we file a prima facie, lawyers just do not get two cases a weekly legitimately. 
    If the appellate division goes along with the thinking that is prima facie course for investigation, for inquiry. 
    We call them up and say how did you get a 100 -- how do you get two cases a week. 
    The law firms in the city go along and they don't get ten, they don't get 12, they don't half a dozen in negligence cases and these lawyers are not experts. 
    Some of them had never tried a case in their lives. 
    They are settlers and what this investigation as Judge Arkwright's report will show, what the y are actually doing is they are conspiring with doctors, with collision shop and with others all -- and then they bribe the man in the insurance company so that it is all coming around to get to these golden reserves of the insurance companies.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6497.817" stopTime="6537.089">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I am sure you realize Mr. Hurley that no one on this Court would be out of sympathy with an investigation of such matters because they have been involved with some experience with that situation, and what we're interested in only is whether the individual who is called before a secret investigation at that time has his federal rights protected under the constitution, and that's what these questions at least I have asked are directed to them (Inaudible) sympathy investigation of this kind to determine what to --

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    I can readily understand that Your Honor. 
    Now my friend in concluding says that with the last place that – of all places the witness was -- should have the right to counsel in before a justice of the Supreme Court and before a court. 
    I take this as a contrary view. 
    It seems to me that the last place where a witness, a lay witness particularly should need counsel is in before a justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York. 
    Now I say that on this basis that I conceive it to be the duty of a justice of the court, and I know that judges always exercise it persistently in every case that I ever heard of, they turn around and protect the witnesses the minute the witness is beginning to get into danger. 
    I regard that as a duty of the judge to look, to see to it that the witnesses are fully protected.

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    No, but I don't think -- I don't think, I certainly wouldn't make any presumptions as to it or I presume that any such thing.

    I am convinced that you wouldn't. 
    I am convinced that you wouldn't, but we can go on the basis if the – of power in that realm, that a judge and the prosecutor can't deny the right even to go to see their counsel? 
    Can we decide the case on the basis, within the instance that which you are permitted, you have permitted that to be done?

    Mr. Denis M. Hurley 
    Well, so far as this -- that's true, and I am not going to talk too much because I haven't got time now, but I wouldn't have too much time to talk about jurisdiction. 
    I think Your Honors will look in vain through subdivision 10, the statute he attacks to find anything about depravation of right of counsel. 
    There is no such thing in the statute. 
    So he takes it direct appeal on the theory that this statute -- he is claiming this statute is unconstitutional and he is claiming it for the first time in this Court. 
    There is no word and he is so conceded here there isn't word in this record at the additional special term, the appellate division, the Court of Appeals anywhere that he ever claimed that this statute was unconstitutional and there isn't a word in it that deprives a witness of the right to counsel. 
    I submit Your Honor that both on jurisdiction and on the merits we should prevail.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, of course whatever time you have left the record show you have one minute, but you may have your one minute, whatever the time is, you want to take it right now, you may or it --
speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="6813.093" stopTime="6957.913">
    Mr. Raphael H. Weissman 
    Well, I do it very quickly perhaps (Inaudible). 
    I want to make answers to unfinished questions from bench, first to say that every witness would come with a counsel that's partially (Inaudible). 
    It isn't to claim that every witness would come. 
    If every witness came with the counsel this investigation would never be finished. 
    That doesn't help this problem. 
    It's only such a witness as becomes the target of the investigation who then becomes really a defendant who has the right for counsel. 
    And that brings the numbers down so that the significance of all the figures given, disappear. 
    The claim that the New York Court of Appeals decided that a witness hasn't got right to counsel is true, but that has nothing to do with this, if this man weren't in a position of a witness these appellants, to what somebody else did, I wouldn't claim their right to counsel and they wouldn't have it. 
    Only when it became apparent that they no longer witnesses, but defendants, targets of the investigation, then they were entitled to counsel. 
    And as Mr. Justice Whittaker asked the question that, it had been cleared up and this is the most important thing. 
    It is Mr. Hurley and the judge now who without discretion on the part of the appellate division referred these matters to the district attorney for prosecution. 
    Now I was handicapped. 
    I suspected that myself. 
    Mr. Justice Arkwright filed his final report and I wrote a letter for appellate division en banc asking for a copy of that report for transmission to this Court in eight of the pending cases and the court met in en banc and denied my request. 
    I think the counsel ought to produce here for the information of this Court the final report of Mr. Justice Arkwright, and that will tell you precisely the number of witnesses, the number of people who were targets of the investigation, what can they do with the evidence and how it is done. 
    And it will clarify the question asked by Mr. Justice Whittaker as to whether there is some intervening discretion involved. 
    Even if they were, the case is not much weaker than it was, but now it been made perfectly clear, and I think the report ought to be produced so the Court should have it, that there is no intervening discretion. 
    As Mr. Hurley and the judge themselves are a norm of the prosecution. 
    Thanks.
