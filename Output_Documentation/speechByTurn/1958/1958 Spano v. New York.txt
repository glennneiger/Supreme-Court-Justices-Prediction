    Mr. Siegal, you may proceed.

    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The petitioner, Vincent Joseph Spano, was convicted of a crime of murder in the first degree in the County Court, Bronx County, New York, was sentenced to death. 
    The sentence has been stayed. 
    Certiorari was granted by this Honorable Court on the 15th day of December, 1958. 
    The Court of Appeals of the State of New York affirmed the judgment of conviction by a vote of 4-to-3. 
    Now, may it please the Court, briefly the facts are these. 
    On January 22nd, 1957, the petitioner, Vincent Joseph Spano, was in a bar and grill and had a $10-bill on the counter when the deceased, one Frank Palermo walked in and took the bill off the counter and walked out of the bar. 
    Vincent Joseph Spano walked out after him, an argument started and Frank Palermo, a former professional fighter gave the petitioner Spano a most vicious beating, punching him down to the ground and kicking him in the head, leaving him in a dazed and bloody condition. 
    He became violently sick immediately, vomited right in front of him, was taken into the bar. 
    Someone there washed his bruises. 
    He went home, walked home, came back and went to the candy store that he was directed to go to by Palermo. 
    When Palermo gave Spano this beating he said, “This isn't all. 
    Bring the rest of the money to this candy store,” designating a certain candy store.

    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    Well, he had made a demand for certain money and all he had gotten, sir, was $10 off the bar.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, you mean (Inaudible) man claiming that he owed it or --
speaker="herbert_s_siegal" startTime="165.884" stopTime="295.378">
    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    Not that he owed it. 
    We contend, sir, that it was a matter of tribute, was a matter of extortion. 
    Palermo directed Spano to go to this designated candy store. 
    That to anyone in that neighborhood, amongst those people, was known as the headquarters of Palermo and when Spano got in there, as the evidence shows, three gangsters were in the place besides Palermo. 
    Spano had gone home in his dazed condition, had gotten a gun, had walked to the candy store and at first fired a volley of two shots up near the top of the ceiling, no where's near or in the direction of Palermo. 
    The evidence shows that at that time, as the petitioner stated the door behind him closed or opened and he felt someone running towards him from behind, the three in the store closing in on him and it was at that time that he fired a volley of three shots and killed Palermo. 
    He then, as the evidence showed, left the scene and was missing for a period of about I believe it was 10 days or two weeks, something of that order. 
    It then developed that Spano got in touch with an attorney named Tobias Russo, a well-known lawyer in Bronx and arranged for Mr. Russo to surrender to the authorities. 
    In the meantime before the surrender, the District Attorney of Bronx County had presented the evidence that they had before the Grand Jury of Bronx County and obtained an indictment charging this defendant with the crime of murder in the first degree.

    The attorney, Mr. Russo made arrangements with the District Attorney, met the District Attorney in the street in front of the County Court House at or about 7:30 p.m. and there turned over, the petitioner Spano to the District Attorney, Personal Assistant District Attorney, Goldsmith and the county detective and then left. 
    The testimony shows that the Assistant District Attorney and the police talked the petitioner to a District Attorney's office. 
    This was about 7:30 or quarter to 8 p.m.

    The Assistant District Attorney interrogate or attempted to interrogate Spano from 7:30 until 12, or 12 o'clock in the morning and during all that time, Spano said, “I want my attorney.” 
    The District Attorney knew he had an attorney because only a few moments ago he had been surrendered by his attorney upon arrangement. 
    The District Attorney, nevertheless, knowing that he had an attorney and being told by Spano, “I have been advised not to make any statement except to give you my name. 
    I want to consult with my attorney.”

    “You are therefore commanded forthwith to arrest the above name and bring him before that Court to answer the indictment or if the courts have adjourned for the term that you deliver him into the custody of a sheriff of the county of or in the City of New York to the warden of the city prison of the City of New York.

    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    They didn't take him and put him into the city prison. 
    They took him into the District Attorney's Office, sir, and questioned him until 12:30 and when they saw at 12:30 in the morning that he's still persistent, that he --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="487.084" stopTime="489.046">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Were the courts open or was this term?
speaker="herbert_s_siegal" startTime="489.046" stopTime="515.927">
    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    Well, the Court was open, sir, but may I say this, sir. 
    The District Attorney is present as a custom in the Bronx that when a man is arrested on a warrant after indictment, no matter what time, he is brought before a county judge even if it's at his home because they all live right there in the neighborhood. 
    There wasn't any -- any trouble at all about getting a judge if they wanted him at that hour.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="515.927" stopTime="519.022">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I gather the Court there it was termed time. 
    The courts were actually sitting during the day.
speaker="herbert_s_siegal" startTime="519.022" stopTime="659.257">
    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    That is right, the time was not called. 
    They were actually sitting. 
    They were going to sit the next morning at 10 o'clock. 
    Now, sir, after, 12:30, they saw they couldn't get anywhere, they took the petitioner up to the squad room of a police station and there continued to interrogate him and he there again, asked for his attorney, time and time again. 
    At time, one of the police officers testified that he couldn't find the -- a lawyer with the said name or telephone number in the telephone book. 
    At any rate, he never got an attorney. 
    At any rate, during that time, the District Attorney and the police sent a police officer named Bruno, who was a friend of Spano and to Spano a number of times, to tell him that he, Bruno, was in trouble if he didn't make -- if Spano didn't make a statement in this case, that his wife was going to have another child. 
    He might lose his job. 
    And he insisted that he make a statement. 
    The reason for that is this. 
    While the defendant or the petitioner was out before he arranged for the surrender, he called his friend Bruno and told him what had happened and said that Palermo had been on his back and had given him a bad beating and that he was dazed and so forth that he killed him and he wanted advice, that he was going to get a lawyer. 
    So now, they use this same friend, Bruno, to coerce Spano into making a statement. 
    They used him for the purpose of having him disregard, if they could, the advice and instructions of his attorney. 
    The District Attorney all of the time knew that this man was represented by an attorney, knew that there had been an indictment, knew that there was a judicial proceeding pending, yet nevertheless, continued to interrogate and interrogate until sometime around 3:30 a.m., after Bruno had left Spano for a few minutes, Spano said, “All right, let me make a statement.” 
    They called in a stenographer and they got a statement.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, I don't understand what you mean in that light.
speaker="herbert_s_siegal" startTime="877.692" stopTime="1053.544">
    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    Well, it's a coerced confession. 
    May I say this. 
    It's a coerced confession in the -- in the sense or in the language of Judge Desmond of the Court of Appeals in the dissenting opinion. 
    And may I answer this way, sir? 
    Well, Judge Desmond said this, “Usually, of course, the test for admissibility of a confession is voluntariness and usually voluntariness is a question of fact for the jury.” 
    But one of the senses in which the courts used voluntary, a confession or incriminating testimony taken from a defendant without warranting of his rights, during the progress of a criminal cause against them is not voluntary since in such a case the fact is undisputed. 
    The question is not one for the jury but a constitutional question of due process, an undisputed fact. 
    Some violations of rights, are too fundamental to be excused by a jury or layman, directly and frankly violated here with two such rights, the right to have the advice of lawyer at every stage of a Court proceeding and the right not to be forced to testify against oneself during such a proceeding. 
    Now, may it please this Court, I'd like to read just a bit further from Judge Desmond's opinion. 
    Now, we accept as evidence a confession extracted during the very course of a judicial proceeding after indictment and surrender on a bench warrant. 
    When the time for investigation has passed and when the prisoner no longer is a suspect, but now a defendant held on the Court process awaiting trial has retained counsel who has warned him not to give evidence to the public authorities. 
    A citizen learning that he has been indicted and that a bench warrant is outstanding against him consults an attorney. 
    The attorney confirming strictly to his professional duty instructs his client forthwith to surrender, arranges for surrender to the representatives of the District Attorney's Office. 
    The lawyer accompanies his client to the place of surrender, warns him not to make any statement then leaves his client in the custody of the officers justifiably confident that the client's rights are safely under the protection of the Court and all of its mandate. 
    The prosecutor in his brief on this appeal reminds us that Spano's attorney could have waited until 10 o'clock the next morning and surrendered his client to the County Court. 
    Of course, he could but as we shall show defendant's rights and immunity would be no different since whether at 7 p.m. or 10 a.m. the surrender was to the Court in obedience to the process.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- whether you can think the case would have been different that the same questioning, for the same duration under or the statement you raised on certain circumstances at the same time by the same personnel had been carried on and a confession then secured that Spano have had no lawyer?

    Suppose that?
speaker="herbert_s_siegal" startTime="1080.325" stopTime="1088.888">
    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    I think the situation would have been the same if he demanded a lawyer, if he asked for a lawyer so long as there was a judicial proceeding in there.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1088.888" stopTime="1095.316">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He was advised that the didn't have a lawyer or that he was that the confession was involuntary which is --
speaker="herbert_s_siegal" startTime="1095.316" stopTime="1113.363">
    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    The confession was involuntary because he was deprived of his right to counsel during a judicial proceeding. 
    We submit most respectfully that there was a judicial proceeding. 
    This was a -- at a pretrial stage. 
    He was entitled to a counsel at every stage of the proceedings.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1113.363" stopTime="1120.833">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that the questioning itself do you think was not -- did not deprive the confession from being voluntary?
speaker="herbert_s_siegal" startTime="1120.833" stopTime="1124.885">
    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    Not in that sense if we're talking about physical coercion.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1124.885" stopTime="1128.168">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    This Court hasn't restricted coercion, or physical coercion.
speaker="herbert_s_siegal" startTime="1128.168" stopTime="1129.109">
    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    But this Court --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1129.109" stopTime="1133.042">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    This Court hasn't held that you require a beating.
speaker="herbert_s_siegal" startTime="1133.042" stopTime="1215.852">
    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    Not of those elements separately but this Court has held I believe in the Crooker case that although in that case, the Court held that it was not a violation of due process to deprive a defendant of counsel but that was at the time of arrest and a -- that was at the time of arrest before there was an indictment. 
    And this Court held I believe that to say that the deprivation of counsel in such a stage would be a violation of due process would hamstring the authorities. 
    But in this case, there is no such question and we draw that distinction if we may. 
    We say they have investigated the petitioners' no more a suspect, he is now a defendant. 
    There is a formal accusation against him. 
    It's pending in the Court. 
    He surrenders pursuant to that bench warrant. 
    Therefore, at that time, at the moment of the filing of the indictment, two things happen. 
    Number one, he has an obligation to defend and number two he has the right to attack and at that moment, he certainly could come into Court. 
    He is in Court. 
    There is a judicial proceeding and he could make any kind of a motion that he wanted at that moment. 
    He is certainly -- is entitled to counsel.

    Well (Voice Overlap) it might raise some other questions before indictment. 
    It might raise some other questions.

    Mr. Herbert S. Siegal 
    I would say, sir. 
    I would say that in this case if the attorney or the petitioner had been sitting in the courtroom with the petitioner at five minutes to ten waiting for the petitioner to be arraigned and before the clerk of the Court had an opportunity to call the petitioner for arraignment, the District Attorney or the police had snatched the petitioner out of the courtroom, and taken him into a side room outside of the hearing and presence of the defendant and question him, that certainly would have been a violation of due process and the District Attorney's contention that he had a right to question because it was before arraignment, we respectfully submit has no merit because they certainly cannot delay arraignments and say that because the physical act of arraignment didn't take place, they have a right to question. 
    We submit most respectfully to this Court that from the moment of that indictment that defendant was in Court when he surrendered pursuant to the bench warrant he was in Court. 
    He had a right to counsel and that his persistent demands throughout the seven or eight hours of interrogation that he wanted a counsel was a deprivation of due process. 
    Now, we most respectfully urge this Court to reverse the conviction and sentence of death. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Irving Anolik

    Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of the Court. 
    At the outset, the people respectfully call this Court's attention to page 2 of the transcript of the record furnished by this Court where the New York Court of Appeals said very clearly, the second full paragraph. 
    It is clear in the record and the fact that not now seriously challenge that this confession was neither physically nor psychologically coerced. 
    I think that that is the premise that must be accepted here and I do not believe that petitioner seriously contradicts that fact.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I would say that in view of their citation of a number of decisions by this Court that they had in mind situations such as might have been presented in detention of a defend on duly such as Mallory against United States, things that McNabb against the United States and situations where although no physical beatings were promulgated against the person of defendant that psychologically such pressures that the totality of conduct might have been such that it would have been coerced despite the fact that no physical violence were -- were exerted against him.

    Well, Justice Frankfurter, Justices of the Court, I'd like to point out that at the -- at the -- at a period before petitioner had surrendered, that is about two or three days after the murder had been perpetrated. 
    He telephoned one, Anthony Napolitano who was one of the owners of the Roosevelt bar and tavern outside of which this fight between the deceased and him had occurred and he indicated to him that I'm going to give himself up. 
    This was on the telephone call. 
    I'm going to get a lawyer. 
    Then on February 3rd after the indictment which took place February 1st incidentally, but on February 3rd which was a day before he surrendered, he telephoned a childhood friend, a rookie patrolman named, Patrolman Bruno to which my adversary has a verdict and said to him on the telephone, in effect, that I shot at the deceased. 
    He admitted the shooting of Perlemo and he did not give as much detail but there was no question from the conversation that there was a completed mission that he had shot Perlemo and as a matter of fact in the Court of Appeals of the State of New York at page 60 of the brief there, the -- the defendant in that Court, petitioner here admits that there's no question that he shot Perlemo and that --

    I don't -- I haven't read the (Inaudible) case but what Judge Desmond says about it, there was a distinction of it (Inaudible) by the Court of Appeals between a person who became a material witness who at the time he was questioned was not yet an accused or a defendant, was merely a witness. 
    And in this case, where the choice was made, that this wasn't an inquiry by the police to ascertain the guilt of the party, the District Attorney had already committed himself in making the accusation -- I mean made the accusations against this person. 
    Although you're quite right in saying this wasn't the traditional inquiry.

    No I understand that Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    He was then -- after a hiatus of some 45 minutes or -- or an hour brought to the 46th Precinct in the Bronx and there this childhood friend of him, of his to whom he had already given an admission as to the shooting was brought in and spoke to him. 
    And the statement given to the District Attorney following that conversation was substantially consistent with the statement he had given to Patrolman Bruno. 
    Spano did not confess anything to the police by virtue of their questioning, he adhered to the advice of his attorney. 
    The record I believe substantiates the fact of Spano did not take the stance so there's no contest in this record but that it was voluntary in that sense.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But we're not -- we're not here called upon to consider whether what he told his childhood friend was a voluntary explosion of expression (Inaudible)

    If that second statement was under conditions that debar the conclusion as a matter of law this is voluntary, it doesn't help me to have a prior statement that was voluntary.

    Now, the record indicates that he did not know an indictment was even outstanding. 
    He was well-aware that he was sought by the police before the indictment was even handed down against them. 
    Under New York law it is a misdemeanor to disclose the fact of indictment. 
    So it is quite probable that he knew nothing of the indictment of such, he merely knew he was wanted and that's the reason he surrendered.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I would not say that. 
    I would -- the last statement I could not agree with. 
    I think that they were certainly interested in getting a statement. 
    What --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did he just -- what -- what would it be?

    Oh no, no.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2756.646" stopTime="2757.619">

    What did they talk about?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2757.619" stopTime="2769.055">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    For example they asked him about a red mark on his head. 
    He indicated to them that because of his baldness he suffered from a -- a disease. 
    Later at the trial it indicated from his own doctor that he just -- that he suffered from --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2769.055" stopTime="2775.390">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    According to your reading of the record, how many hours is that transaction in the District Attorney's Office to take place?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2775.390" stopTime="2780.716">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I would say from about 7:30 to 11 and perhaps --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2780.716" stopTime="2782.863">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That can't be four hours, three and a half hours.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2782.863" stopTime="2783.489">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2783.489" stopTime="2784.078">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right (Inaudible)
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2784.078" stopTime="2792.730">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    And then -- then there was a meal and thereafter -- it is difficult to ascertain whether he was requesting or whether he was just transported to the 46th Squad.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2792.730" stopTime="2810.843">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But the testimony at the trial in regard to what took place during those hours between 7:30 until 3 whatever the intermission (Inaudible) that the preoccupation of the questioning related to the transaction between other than this unfortunate murder.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2810.843" stopTime="2823.712">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I would say that certainly it would be improper of me to say that they were not anxious to get a confession in the sense that they wanted to verify the statement that they had already received from Patrolman Bruno.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2823.712" stopTime="2834.338">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you're saying if we had nothing but that that this would not fall in within -- that this would not satisfy, or this would not be condemnable under the Fourteenth Amendment in the light of our case here, correct?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2834.338" stopTime="2836.462">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That is correct, Justice Frankfurter, that's my position.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That is your position?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2837.197" stopTime="2837.847">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Yes, Justice Frankfurter.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2837.847" stopTime="2840.145">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So, that reversed on what the record may --
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2840.145" stopTime="2840.902">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That -- that is absolutely --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2840.902" stopTime="2842.467">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2842.467" stopTime="2843.349">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Absolutely correct, Justice Frankfurter.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2843.349" stopTime="2857.136">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, what do you say so that then from your point of view, there are really two questions in this case. 
    One, judged by the criteria of our decisions, for this -- on this side or on the other side for inadmissible confession under the Due Process Clause.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2857.136" stopTime="2857.747">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2857.747" stopTime="2873.344">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Number two, if this was a capital case then he is entitled to have a lawyer. 
    That means at some stage and for some purpose number two, order the trial with that protection of the Due Process Clause the protection of a lawyer.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2873.344" stopTime="2925.053">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That is correct. 
    Now, I would say that if I can just hope this one particular point that I think this case raises that was not raised in the Crooker or the Cicenia case -- cases that here we have an indictment. 
    Does the fact of an indictment ipso facto alter the situation so that federal rights are violated by questioning? 
    Now, we have seen cases, Lisenba against California where a man is taken out of jail and questioned by an invalid court order and yet the -- the conviction there was upheld. 
    We have seen cases about that. 
    Now, does the fact of an indictment, in fact, I can't answer this question. 
    Thus to the best of my knowledge, it's one of first impression on this Court. 
    Does an indictment ipso facto endow a man with rights superior to those to which any other accused would be entitled?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2925.053" stopTime="2952.592">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But Judge Desmond's opinion indicates one consideration on restraints namely the difference between this case and the (Inaudible) case in your court in the Court of Appeals, namely, where a man is detained as a witness, he does not know and has no reason to know or believe that his state is that of an accused with all the difference that that make in the witness of an accused.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2952.592" stopTime="2952.732">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2952.732" stopTime="2956.983">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So, that that may be a fact which in the totality of the situation makes a difference.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2956.983" stopTime="2957.769">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2957.769" stopTime="2971.669">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He asked that question merely because if a man goes in and talks to him about, he happened to be a very literate or literate person, we discuss (Inaudible) problem and that's the reason of indictment, wouldn't not make or that make -- that make an involuntary confession?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2971.669" stopTime="2981.361">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    The Perez (ph) case, Justice Frankfurter, the -- the material witness there was in the custody of the warden of the city prison or with the civil --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2981.361" stopTime="2981.909">

    He was a witness --

    -- prison rather.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2982.462" stopTime="2984.217">

    He was a witness, clearly.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2984.217" stopTime="2984.979">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That's is correct now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2984.979" stopTime="2993.110">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He was not an accused, he did not -- he did not stand in the position of a man over whom the (Inaudible) sought of a conviction for murder --
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2993.110" stopTime="2993.726">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That is correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2993.726" stopTime="2994.710">

    -- was upon him.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="2994.710" stopTime="3004.391">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That is correct. 
    Now, of course, in the Perez (ph) case, we do not have a situation where the man was legally and properly in the custody of the police authorities.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3004.391" stopTime="3018.573">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But when you say that, when -- when I ask you, when a lawyer surrenders a client, charged with murder I suppose that that means nothing more than murder is not a bailable offense I assume in New York. 
    Is it?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="3018.573" stopTime="3019.303">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    No, it's not.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3019.303" stopTime="3035.657">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Very well, he surrendered him because his -- his client was not -- he can't get bail and there he simply says he has surrendered his body completely should be put in jail. 
    But what consequences follow the surrender? 
    What indications are there beyond that?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="3035.657" stopTime="3035.856">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3035.856" stopTime="3045.400">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But is he not bailable and he doesn't want to escape, he doesn't want to be a fugitive and he assessed it that way, surrendered him. 
    That's all it means --
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="3045.400" stopTime="3045.573">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3045.573" stopTime="3047.323">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- assumedly. 
    May I involve that?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="3047.323" stopTime="3047.895">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well, of course --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3047.895" stopTime="3050.571">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It doesn't mean go ahead and pressure him all you please doesn't it?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="3050.571" stopTime="3136.500">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    No it doesn't necessarily. 
    Now, he had to be booked. 
    He had to be finger printed and photographed. 
    That is true whether the man is under indictment or not. 
    He must be arrested on the indictment on the New York Law. 
    Now, what if this had occurred during that course? 
    He was detained here for the purpose of booking primarily. 
    Now it's true in the District Attorney's Office since he was surrendered that was convenient to take him there. 
    I might add this, Justice Frankfurter, that there is a detective squad of the New York City Police Department that has headquarters in the District Attorney's Office. 
    It's true the questioning here happened to take place in the Office of Assistant District Attorney, Goldsmith. 
    But two New York City detectives to whom he was surrendered were present. 
    They were then brought to the 46th Squad. 
    Now the -- a petitioner here urges that if there had been no indictment and I believe I translated his intentions and his sentiments correctly. 
    He would have no quarrel or whatsoever with this situation. 
    In other words, if 50 people saw Spano shoot Palermo he obviously would be the prime suspect. 
    Yet, if he had not been indicted petitioner would say that perfectly all right to question them all you want, but if you indict him then you can't do anything. 
    Would it be morally correct for the District Attorney here Justice Frankfurter to have withheld an indictment merely to get a statement and then get the indictment when he had all the evidence he needed for it?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3136.500" stopTime="3140.109">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That I meant for a clause by that kind of analogy for our petitioner.

    Bruno suggested that he give himself up.

    Bruno, pursuant to police regulations I would assume testified.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Of the record, the folios. 
    There's an elaborate voir dire conducted by Mr. Siegal here on behalf of the -- of the petitioner that's to whether or not the confession should go into evidence and it was not until that or the confession even went into evidence and then there was instructions --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3472.985" stopTime="3476.451">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Who -- who were the people who were summoned under voir dire? 
    The policemen or the District Attorney?

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I think it was Detective Farrell who was summoned in the voir dire.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3479.068" stopTime="3480.674">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    How about the Assistant District Attorney?

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    No, he was not called for the stand. 
    He was available there obviously but he was not called for the stand.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3485.322" stopTime="3486.280">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He wasn't --
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="3486.280" stopTime="3486.878">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    He -- in fact he tried --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3486.878" stopTime="3492.402">

    (Voice Overlap) people to -- to ascertain the circumstances under which this questioning took place.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="3492.402" stopTime="3540.211">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    No, he was not called by the people. 
    In the final analysis, Mr. Chief Justice and Justices of the Court, I think that the focal point of this issue is whether an indictment making a man a defendant it is true but being no more than an accusation of guilt means (1) that investigation -- further investigation is precluded and the people contend, it does not mean that because under New York statutory law, less proof is necessary for an indictment then is necessary for a conviction. 
    (2) Does the fact of an indictment, ipso facto preclude questioning of an accused? 
    If the answer --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I don't --- I don't see how even if your adversary has (Inaudible) I didn't so understand. 
    Certainly, Justice Frankfurter said he couldn't buy or does change his analysis. 
    Why do you say that -- settles it all, just makes all the difference in the world if he's indicted?

speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="3565.678" stopTime="3590.958">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I didn't come to number three yet, Justice Black. 
    Number three would be that if the record itself discloses that not withstanding an indictment and not withstanding the other matters that the confession itself was taken under circumstances, the totality of circumstances that would have rendered it involuntary not withstanding the finding of New York Court, then, of course this Court would -- would have a duty to reverse, too.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3590.958" stopTime="3621.751">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I think the nub -- at least for me, the nub of the problem is that one (Inaudible) to Judge Desmond being independent in the case -- criminal case held under the process of the same court can -- it is now decided being subjected to secret midnight questioning out of reach of any lawyer until he confessed it. 
    Now, if that is the -- if the record sustained that characterization by Judge Desmond it is one thing because this judgment is another thing.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="3621.751" stopTime="3634.412">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well, I'll point out, Justice Frankfurter, that the defendant here was arraigned promptly.

    If in fact, although you have all the evidence that was necessary for conviction, who seal of all enterprise are one it was sort to get them all formal and more detailed confession under circumstances characterized by what I have read from Judge Desmond then that confession is not admissible under our decision.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Or you can say, Justice Frankfurter that I think a perusal of the record will indicate that Justice Desmond's -- Judge Desmond's statement is not wise. 
    I would add this fact that in the case at bar, it is fairly clear, I would say clear beyond doubt that the questioning of Spano was to cover a hiatus. 
    There were eyewitnesses to a -- beating, how severe that beating was, is a matter of dispute.

    Then there was an eyewitness to the actual shooting.

    The purpose of the conversation was the fact that he had embarrassed Bruno by calling him the day before that Bruno might get into difficulty because of the fact that Spano, an accused murderer had called him the day before and that he would -- would appreciate it as a matter of friendship to a confess, to give some statement.

    You haven't dealt with the problem which for you seems to be crucial in this case namely, assuming you're right about everything concerning the confession.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That's quite true that this is a murder case. 
    This man was not just plucked out of the street, Justice Frankfurter as a possible suspect. 
    He was -- an eyewitness had already identified him. 
    He'd already given a statement to Patrolman Bruno. 
    And he was questioned. 
    The Court -- this Court has often recognized that and has condemned plucking a man as a possible suspect and hammering away and until they get a confession. 
    In this case they had a man who they certainly have probable cause to believe had committed this crime.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well, there's nothing in the record to indicate, Justice Frankfurter that there was any agreement that he would not be questioned. 
    On the contrary, since he was admonished not to say anything, as the New York Court of Appeals recognizes, apparently interrogation was anticipated otherwise why admonish him to say nothing.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Justice Frankfurter, all I can say is that the record indicates that Detective Ciccone alleges that he attempted to find the name in the telephone book and could not.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, but it could -- if it's a question of getting protection from legal advice, legal advice that the -- the suffering or rather the hurt, the denial that's involved in his right to get a lawyer reduces a State.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I would agree. 
    If the Court, this Court has passed upon similar problems, Justice Frankfurter, not while on indictment was extant, that's true but certainly this Court has passed on in the Cicenia and the Crooker cases.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That's quite correct. 
    Now, of course, in State v. Bump which is a New Jersey decision cited on my brief, the court there indicates where a -- a somewhat similar but not identical situation obtained that while an attorney should be present to defend the client an attorney is not necessary to protect the client from his own voluntary statements. 
    And if this was a voluntary statement, then the people submit no federal right was produced.

    But for how many hours after -- after the District Attorney and the police know that a man has -- has a lawyer and know who he is and -- and the defendant has protested that his lawyer has told him not to talk and he doesn't want to talk. 
    For how many hours can they question him in order to overcome his will in that regard and get the statement that they desire?

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well, I would say that -- of course, it's a difficult question to answer. 
    I would say that that's where the significance of a prompt arraignment might come into issue. 
    If this man had been detained, shall we say until the 6th of February, another full day and then the -- the confession obtained. 
    Then we might say that here they went too far. 
    But in this case, this -- this specific case they arraigned him promptly as soon as the courts reopened that morning.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4677.682" stopTime="4686.672">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, could they have continued to -- to interrogate him all night long and then brought him in at 10 o'clock with the same result?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4686.672" stopTime="4695.408">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I suppose, it would be conceivable but unlikely in view of the fact they have to have him fingerprinted, booked and photographed before he was brought into that Court and that was done.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    But I mean if they had done -- if they had done it, the situation would be the same as far as you can see as long as they arraigned him on time.

    Is it not sufficient for him to -- to say to whoever is in charge of questioning him that his lawyer has advised him not to talk. 
    That he doesn't propose to talk and -- and the client should do it. 
    And then for four or five hours, he -- he declines to make a statement for that reason. 
    Does he have to be meticulous about seeing that he made the same statement to every single one

    Of course, not.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, then what -- why do you keep (Inaudible)

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well, I -- I --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4777.306" stopTime="4781.927">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- they only said it to two of the detectives who where there.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4781.927" stopTime="4830.840">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I -- I merely emphasize that from this point of view only, Justice Warren, that there is no direct evidence in this record that that request was made to the District Attorney or to the two detectives to whom he surrendered. 
    To them it's true. 
    They testified, he said, “You'd better see my lawyer about that.” 
    Now, that -- that is what the record says, Justice Warren. 
    I'm not attempting to characterize it one way or the other. 
    We're bound by the record. 
    There's no question about that. 
    Now, if -- if this meant that the questioning here, if it was voluntary, the people submit that there's no reason to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment because an indictment was extant. 
    If it was not voluntary, of course, there is obviously, a Fourteenth Amendment problem.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What the -- now, what is the practice in New York after arraignment where a man was incarcerated waiting -- what instructions do the police have as to whether it's admissible or mandatory or not?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4844.585" stopTime="4847.499">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Instructions are not the question at all after that.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4847.499" stopTime="4855.003">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you say that everything up until arraignment (Inaudible)
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4855.003" stopTime="4879.531">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Typically, that is what institutes the judicial proceeding. 
    Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of New York speaks of judicial proceedings commencing with the filing of an indictment but that section has reference to statutes of limitations. 
    And in only in that sense that a judicial proceeding start and certainly, I think that this Court will recognize that this interrogation was not a judicial proceeding upon that indictment as the dissent --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4879.531" stopTime="4894.446">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's precisely -- that's precisely what the petitioner is complaining about. 
    They said that after indictment what -- the only thing that can follow properly under the law and Constitution is an arraignment and the trial which are judicial proceedings. 
    And he says here that this --
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4894.446" stopTime="4894.722">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4894.722" stopTime="4898.930">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- after an indictment instead they actually have these proceedings in the backroom of the station house.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4898.930" stopTime="4931.077">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Justice Stewart, if an indictment, as I say, precludes any questioning whatsoever, then, of course, my cause is -- is lost. 
    I concede that. 
    If this Court is prepared to say that the fact of an indictment in a state court precludes any further investigation, any further question then I -- I concede that my cause is lost. 
    But I respectfully submit that this Court is not -- is not required to make such a determination in view of its decisions and in view of this record.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. -- before you sit down. 
    I'd like to ask you now that I have cast my eye over the pages of Bruno's testimony and I want to be sure that I haven't -- in my skimpy reading of it misread. 
    In the first place, there's testimony by him that Mr. (Inaudible) came at 4:00 a.m. not 3:00 a.m. as both of you have said, but much important than that, he made several efforts to get -- what's his name-- Spano as he thought, didn't he?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4961.390" stopTime="4962.810">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Yes, he did.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4962.810" stopTime="4965.273">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And Spano stood his ground and wouldn't talk.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4965.273" stopTime="4965.934">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4965.934" stopTime="4968.870">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And Gannon sent him back again and again.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4968.870" stopTime="4970.461">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That -- that's correct. 
    He sent them back several times.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4970.461" stopTime="4974.503">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That there was a refusal to talk.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4974.503" stopTime="4974.589">

    That's a --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4974.589" stopTime="4981.929">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That there was an insistence by (Inaudible) friend Bruno to get him to talk.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    I -- I would say that the --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Lieutenant Gannon his superior, this fellow (Inaudible) he was brought down from the academy, wasn't it?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4989.319" stopTime="4990.591">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well, he happened to live in the neighborhood.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4990.591" stopTime="4992.447">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes. 
    But he wasn't part of the police --

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Oh, no, no.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4993.963" stopTime="4997.954">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And somewhere they found out that he's a great credibility, they got hold of him.
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4997.954" stopTime="4999.613">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    Well -- no. 
    He telephoned him --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Just --
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="4999.622" stopTime="5003.632">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    -- a day before this. 
    So they knew about this conversation, the day before you see.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5003.632" stopTime="5043.721">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But he -- he stood his ground at the insistence of his boyhood friend, he wouldn't talk, several times that he says -- and at that time he told Lieutenant Gannon that they could get no statement out of this man, is that right? 
    I did and you went back into the room? 
    Yes. 
    At whose direction? 
    The Lieutenant and come -- what it was that he was said (Inaudible) don't worry etcetera. 
    (Inaudible) a long course of -- or an effort or rather serious continuing effort to have Spano speak freely, is that right?
speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="5043.721" stopTime="5044.934">
    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That's correct, Justice Frankfurter.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5044.934" stopTime="5054.024">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And -- and he did, he was not forthcoming until to these -- these hours in which took place what you've said took place.

    Mr. Irving Anolik 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5054.227" stopTime="5056.564">

    That's correct.
