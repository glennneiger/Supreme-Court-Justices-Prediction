    Number 88, Edgar B. Sims versus United States of America. 
    Mr. Caplan.
speaker="fred_h_caplan" startTime="33.048" stopTime="292.605">
    Mr. Fred H. Caplan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    The petitioner, Edgar B. Sims, who was the auditor of the State of West Virginia, has been subjected to personal liability under the penal provisions of Section 6332 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    Now, to better clarify the facts of this case, I respectfully direct the Court's attention to Sections 6331 and 6332 of the Internal Revenue Code which may be found in the petitioner's brief in the appendix on pages 1A or A1 and A2. 
    Section 6331 of the Code authorizes the Secretary the -- that is the Secretary of the Treasurer to collect delinquent taxes by levy upon all the property of the taxpayer. 
    Section 6332 provides for the surrender of that property, and there is a penalty provision in that section. 
    Because this entire case is based upon this particular section, I ask the Court's indulgence while I quote briefly from Section 6332. 
    It is stated therein in subsection (a) under requirement, “Any person in possession of or obligated with respect to property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made shall, upon demand of the Secretary or his delegate, surrender such property or rights or discharge such obligation to the Secretary or his delegate.” 
    In (b) of that section entitled “Penalty for violation,” it stated, “Any person who fails or refuses as required by subsection (a) any property or rights to property, subject to levy, upon demand by the Secretary or his delegate, shall be liable in his own person and estate to the United States in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not so surrendered.” 
    Now, the issue, the principle issue here at this time is whether this petitioner should be held personally liable for the consequences of his acts performed in the line of his official duties as auditor of the State of West Virginia. 
    There are, of course, many sub questions which must be discussed and answered. 
    It is the contention of the petitioner here this morning that the State is not a person, nor is this petitioner a person within the contemplation of Section 6332 and that he could not therefore be held personally and individually liable under the terms and provisions of that section. 
    It is further contended here by the petitioner that the broad general rule of law that a public officer should not be held personally liable for the consequences of his acts when performed in the official line of duties -- of his duties as such public officer. 
    Now, the lower courts --

    The petition here is one of statutory construction or (Inaudible)

    Mr. Fred H. Caplan 
    Your Honor, it is my thought that the primary question here is of statutory construction. 
    Yes, sir. 
    The United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia held in effect that this petitioner and the State were included in the term person and therefore, entered a judgment against him. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed this judgment. 
    And this Court granted certiorari thereafter. 
    The facts of this case are not complicated. 
    There was no hearing, they are stipulated and are found in the record. 
    But the fact show that certain state employees on the State of West Virginia were engaged in endeavors entirely separate on the part from their state employment. 
    That apparently was during the after-hours from such employment in -- well, it isn't shown in the record to clarify. 
    It appeared that certain state employees had engaged in catering services and that sort of thing after hours during the evening time. 
    That they gain -- earned incomes due to such outside employment and that they did not, apparently pay any federal income tax on this income so earned. 
    This is mentioned expressly for the purpose to show that no taxes on any income earned in their state employment is involved here. 
    That of course was withheld in accordance with law and was submitted to the Internal Revenue.

speaker="fred_h_caplan" startTime="510.772" stopTime="660.401">
    Mr. Fred H. Caplan 
    I know of no such language which would distinguish this except that this is -- and I haven't considered that particularly for the reason that this is a statute having to do with delinquent taxes for the non-payment of delinquent taxes and a levy served pursuant to the failure to pay. 
    The question of withholding tax has never been raised, that I know of. 
    It has been withheld as a matter of course. 
    And I do not, Your Honor know of any language which would make that distinction here. 
    Now, I stated these employees having failed to pay their income -- such income tax after demands were made and after their contingent failure to pay. 
    A levy as provided in Section 6331 was served upon the State of West Virginia demanding that any wages due the taxpayer be turned over to the director of the district -- District Director of Internal Revenue. 
    Now, these levies were addressed to the State of West Virginia as the person in possession of the property and so forth. 
    And in every instance were served upon Edgar B. Sims, Auditor of the State of West Virginia. 
    Now, Mr. Sims, after receiving or being served with such levies consulted with the Attorney General of the State and we do not, Your Honors, as may have been indicated, we do not rely upon that as justifying the action of the auditor. 
    We do not rely on the fact that he -- because he consulted with the Attorney General that he is justified. 
    But we do believe that it shows his sincerity and his honest desire to determine this question. 
    And after so consulting and exercising the discretion, he believed with -- he was entitled to exercise, he refused to honor the levies and did pay the money over to the -- the wages due this -- the tax payers, two such tax payers.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.

    Mr. Fred H. Caplan 
    After the auditor, Mr. Sims, had refused to honor these levies. 
    The United States Government instituted a suit against the Auditor of the State and against Mr. Sims individually. 
    Wherein, it sought to impose the penalty contained in Section 6332 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    Upon the petitioner's motion to dismiss in this suit instituted in the District Court for the Southern District to West Virginia, the auditor was dismissed as a party by the Court, but the action was maintained against Mr. Sims in his individual capacity. 
    I will state it here, we believe at this point that the principle issue is whether Mr. Sims is -- should be held individually and personally liable under the penal provisions of Section 6332 (b) and under the circumstances of this case. 
    The first point which we desired to make before this Court concerns the meaning of the term person as used in the statutes here involved. 
    As stated, we contend that the term person as used in Section 6332 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code does not include a State. 
    We believe that it is most pertinent to the consideration of this entire question that in the language of this section whether it'd be 6332 (a), (b), or (c). 
    Nowhere therein is the term State mentioned nor an officer or employee thereof, while other persons and entities are mentioned. 
    It is necessary of course to consider then what the term person means and includes as used in this section. 
    We turn to subsection (c) of 6332 and we find the definition of 'person'. 
    Person there, and we acknowledge that the term is -- includes. 
    It is stated that the term “person” includes an officer or employee of a corporation. 
    A -- and a member or employee of a partnership who has such officer or employee has possession of the property and so forth. 
    Now, in 26 or in the Internal Revenue Code at Section 7701, definitions are contained there of terms for the terms used anywhere throughout the Internal Revenue Code. 
    The term “person” is there again and generally defined. 
    Now, that section states that the term “person” shall be construed to mean and include an individual, a trust and estate, that's E-S-T-A-T-E, a partnership, association, company or corporation.

    As stated it's noted therein, in considering both of these definitions that nowhere is the State, nor an officer or employee thereof included. 
    And this latter Section 7701 pertains to the term “person” wherever used throughout the entire Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise specifically indicated. 
    Now, we contend Your Honors that the language here stating person, stating individual, stating trust, estate, partnership, association, company, and officers or employees thereof is clear and that the language is clear and unambiguous and therefore, is not in need of interpretation or addition. 
    There is no necessity of construction of this because there is a covered list and the State is not included in that covered list.

    Oh, I'm sorry.
speaker="fred_h_caplan" startTime="1178.818" stopTime="1475.658">
    Mr. Fred H. Caplan 
    We believe that the language of such statute should be read as it is and should not be construed to mean what an administrator or even a Court thinks that Congress intended for it to mean. 
    Now, both of the District Court and the Court of Appeals readily acknowledged that neither the State nor an officer employee thereof was mentioned in these sections. 
    And in fact, they expressed some concern about it. 
    I quote from the memorandum of opinion of the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia which may be found in the transcript of record on page 26, and I will quote briefly. 
    And the Court said in relation to the -- to the fact that the term -- that word “state” is not included in the term “person”. 
    He said, “Well, I am somewhat disturbed by the provisions of Section 6332 (c), defining a person and that it does not mention officers or employees of a State. 
    I think that there might be a valid argument that in not mentioning them, they were intended to be excluded. 
    But that would lead, as I view it, to a very illogical and unreasonable result.” 
    Those are the words of the United States District Court and it is quite apparent that the Court of Appeals affirmed that view. 
    Now, this Court, this Honorable Court has very forcefully commented on that sort of reasoning. 
    In Crooks versus Harrelson in page -- in 282 United States which is mentioned in our brief at page -- pages 7 and 8, the Court in very forceful language stated that great caution must be exercised in rejecting the literal meaning of a statute in favor of a construction in harmony with a supposed spirit and purpose thereof. 
    And, in so many words, the Court had this to say, I will not -- of course burden the Court with a quote of the entire section in my brief. 
    That the Court said that, “Laws enacted with good intention when put to the test frequently and to the surprise of the lawmaker himself, turn out to be mischievous, absurd or otherwise objectionable. 
    But in such case, the remedy lies with the lawmaking authority and not with the Courts.” 
    I submit to Your Honors that the same reasoning applies in the instant case, should the Court have read words into the statute merely because of a supposed absurdity. 
    If the statute is absurd, is it not up to Congress to correct the statute. 
    Now, we believe as we stated, that the State is not included in this term “person”. 
    But we further know that there are several factors which must be considered in determining that. 
    One of course, is the legislative history of the section involve, that is again Section 6332. 
    We submit to Your Honors that an examination of the legislative history fails to reveal that Congress intended for its provisions to relate to a State. 
    The Internal Revenue Code has been revised many times over a period of many years. 
    I think of three in particular, back as far as 1926, 1939, and the last great overhaul as you may call it, in 1954. 
    Although it was amended and revised many times, the -- basically, the same language has been retained in relation to the statutes here involved.

    Whatever the reason for that necessity to include the Federal Government expressly, we say that as for the same reason, the State should have been included and the employees thereof so included so that there could have been no question.

    Mr. Fred H. Caplan 
    Well, a lien under Section 6321, perhaps, the -- the general lien statute for -- for delinquent taxes which is on page 81 of our brief. 
    Now, a further consideration here is the congressional intent of the -- at the time of the enactment and we believe that such congressional intent should be determined as of the time of the enactment and not by the influence by later development. 
    And if a later development necessitates a change, then it should be brought about by a congressional action and not by interpretation. 
    This of course, being one of the very principle reasons for a -- for the frequent meetings of Congress. 
    Now, this -- this language which is -- is contained in the present section, was in this section in 1926. 
    And at that time, the Federal Government did not even look to state employees for income taxes. 
    But the same language was there and the definitions were the same. 
    So we believe that that is indicative of the congressional intent failing to show that States or employees thereof were included. 
    Now, in relation to this question, let us look briefly to the notice of levy which was served in this case. 
    And we note that the notice of levy was served upon the State as the person in possession of the property and so forth of the taxpayer.

    Upon the State.
speaker="fred_h_caplan" startTime="3079.718" stopTime="3229.469">
    Mr. Fred H. Caplan 
    Upon the State. 
    It was addressed to the State of West Virginia as the person. 
    It must be remembered again that the State, the word “state” is not included in the statute. 
    The state has been said to be sui generis or as discussed or defined in Black's Law Dictionary as one of its own kind, or the only one of its kind, or peculiar. 
    It is a separate and distinct entity. 
    The state is different from any other entity and of necessity must be afforded separate and different treatment. 
    Now, certainly in common usage, the term “person” does not include the sovereign state. 
    Now, we realize fully well that there are exceptions to this and that the courts have on occasion and in many occasions, declared the state to be a person. 
    Now, the Government has cited several cases in its brief such as South Carolina versus United States, and Georgia versus -- Georgia versus Evans, Ohio versus Helvering. 
    And we submit to Your Honors that these cases are distinguishable from the case at bar, and that in those cases and in practically all of the cases cited, the State has been performing a proprietary function rather than a Governmental function. 
    In Ohio versus Helvering, for example, it was a case of the Federal Government imposing a tax. 
    And I believe this was an injunction suit by the State to prevent the Federal Government from imposing us to pay tax on the State's activity of selling spirituous liquors. 
    Now, in that case, the Court held that the State was a person because it was engaged in business in competition with the general public. 
    And when it sheds its cloak of -- its governmental cloak for that of a proprietor, it sheds any immunity which it may have had of this nature.

    Don't you think in all the conscience to hold that South Carolina was the first, and under the taxing law, required -- what shall I say, more courageous interpretation than to hold -- because that was an adverse ruling against South Carolina, wasn't it? 
    It imposed a tax, it imposed -- it levied something to the disadvantage of South Carolina against South Carolina.

   Argument of Melva M. Graney
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3626.217" stopTime="3631.345">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Ms. Graney.
speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="3631.345" stopTime="3705.646">
    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court. 
    I think it maybe said in general that the petitioners' position in this case is that the Government cannot garnish either way of a state employee except through the state garnishment procedure. 
    And of course, the lien and levy procedures set forth in Section 6321 and Section 6331, is a summary garnishment procedure. 
    That's what it amounts to. 
    The lien, the Government which attaches by the delinquent taxpayer refuses or fails to pay, is the equivalent of a court judgment. 
    And the notice of the levy is the equivalent of process -- court process. 
    The summary procedure which date way back to the 18th Century, I believe, in the internal revenue laws. 
    The particular section that we're concerned with here was first passed in 1926. 
    Until that time, the levy could not be enforced against the property of delinquent taxpayers if it were in the hands of third persons. 
    That's what --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3705.646" stopTime="3721.449">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There's -- I want to know, there's an early case Ms. Graney, Cary and Curtis way back which allows administrative restraint for money going through that, is that still the law?
speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="3721.449" stopTime="3722.384">
    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    I don't know about that case --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3722.384" stopTime="3724.669">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Voice Overlap) I think.
speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="3724.669" stopTime="3909.354">
    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    -- but I do know that in 1926, a provision was specifically inserted in the revenue laws to permit the enforcement of levies when the property was held by third persons, and that is the statute. 
    It's substantially the same as the 1926 statute. 
    Now, the only reason all the requirements of the garnishment are present here as I think Mr. Caplan has conceded. 
    The only argument that's really being made is that the Government can't use the summary procedure, the summary garnishment procedure provided by federal statute because he argues that the State and the state officer are not persons within the meaning of the statute. 
    So, we get down to a pure question of statutory construction. 
    And the petitioner's position on that is directly contrary to the rule that's already established by decisions of this Court. 
    The argument is that the state is not included within the meaning of the word “person” unless it is expressly included. 
    The rule established by several decisions of this Court and principlely, cases relating to revenue measures, is that a state is included within the meaning of the word person, unless a contrary intent is indicated. 
    Now, no argument is made by the petitioner as to any contrary intent in this case, at least I -- it's difficult to discern any other than the fact that a state is involved and a state is a sovereign. 
    Actually, the sovereignty of the state is in no way affected by this notice of levy served upon the State Auditor. 
    The State's only interest is to pay the accrued salary either to the employee or to the employee's account in such a way as to discharge the obligation of the state to pay compensation. 
    And of course that obligation would be discharged if Mr. Sims had honored the levis. 
    That is, the money would be paid over on the delinquent taxpayers' obligation to the Government. 
    So, there's no sovereign interest of the State involved here. 
    The State is in no different position from any other employer, as evidenced by the fact that the State West Virginia like the majority of other States, permits even private creditors to garnish either salaries of state employees through the court process, the normal garnishment procedure. 
    Now, on the question of construction of course, we think first of all that the word person as defined right in the code itself is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3909.354" stopTime="3930.000">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Before you proceed Ms. Graney, may I ask you one question. 
    You said there was no impairment of state sovereignty here. 
    Is there any showing, is there anything in the stipulation of facts or anywhere in the record thq1at this would be a -- a hardship or a burden upon the State, as a matter of difficult bookkeeping or additional manpower or anything like that?
speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="3930.000" stopTime="4021.401">
    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    No, Your Honor. 
    And I think the constitutional question is completely out of the case. 
    As a matter of fact, this Court has already held that the Government can require a state agency itself just like under the withholding tax for -- to collect a federal tax. 
    The Wilmette Park District case decided in 338 US is a case where a public corporation organized under the laws of Illinois to conduct a municipal bathing beach, refused to collect the admissions tax, the federal admissions tax. 
    The commissioner imposed penalties under a statute similar to this, every person. 
    And the penalties were paid, a suit for refund followed. 
    This Court held in that case that the state agency was required to collect a federal admissions tax, that after all, they're just a collecting agency. 
    And at the same time, the Court held that the state agency, the Park District was a person within the meaning of the penalty provision. 
    So, I don't think there's really any constitutional question involved here. 
    The Government can impose the duty to collect tax on private persons, that's settled by several decisions of the Court. 
    And can impose the tax directly upon the State for a non-governmental function.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4021.401" stopTime="4054.189">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, the number of instances, Ms. Graney, which this Court have held that a state is a person, the Safety Appliance Act and so on. 
    The governing consideration is incorrectly, that's why I'm putting here the question. 
    Governing consideration has been that it applies unless if the -- if the purpose of the statute would be equally applicable to the State as an agent, as a -- as a legal personality as it would be to a private corporation and individuals.
speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="4054.189" stopTime="4054.739">

    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4057.907" stopTime="4076.615">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now -- so that -- so that the burden really rests on West Virginia or any other State that the bar of this Court will say, there are reasons that would negative the purpose of that statute for the inclusion of the state as a person is that their way of putting the problem?
speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="4076.615" stopTime="4099.133">
    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    I think so. 
    I would also add that they have not sustained that burden. 
    Actually, there's no reason why the State should not be included in the word person here. 
    Well, in the first place, let me say that the -- the word person itself is defined in statute in the code, sufficiently broad enough to cover a state.

    Yes.

speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="4163.590" stopTime="4184.569">
    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    Well, perhaps we have to show that it also applies to the principle, because Mr. Sims possession and obligation was as an agent of the State. 
    But that creates no problem because we think the statute applies both to the principle -- the state as the principle and to Mr. Sims and the agent. 
    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4184.569" stopTime="4196.580">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It's creates a little more problem to me for you to hold individually about it. 
    That's the whole state (Inaudible) and it seems to me that you have not preceded the state.
speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="4196.580" stopTime="4269.708">
    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    No, we have not preceded against the State. 
    But I think this is something Mr. Caplan was attempting to explain before with reference to our position and so on. 
    The word person -- now, for general purposes of the code, it's defined as a corporation, individuals and so on and so forth. 
    And the words includes and including are also stated -- that -- well, the same section of the code states that when those words are used in a definition, they shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the term -- meaning of the term defined. 
    So, the word person is comprehensive. 
    It can include a state and a state it is sometimes considered to be a person. 
    The question is, should it be excluded here. 
    Now, on the question of whether or not Mr. Sims should be held personally liable acting as an agent of the State, the very section that we're involved with here, Section 6332 provide in subsection (c) the term person as used in subsection (a). 
    That refers to possession and obligation. 
    Includes --

    That's right. 
    The term person includes an officer or employee of a corporation or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer employee or member is under a duty to surrender the property or rights to property or to discharge the obligation. 
    In other words, the word is defined to cover people acting in a representative capacity.

    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    Yes, but I would also say that it did not become applicable to state employees until 1938 when this Court held that state employees were subject to the federal income tax. 
    Now, speaking of the administrative practice, the Treasury Regulation of course has been in effect now, almost four years or over three at least. 
    Normally, the Court would give some weight to that fact. 
    But in addition to that, the administrative practice of levying upon state employees' salaries for delinquent federal taxes, dates way back at least the 1943 as the court below pointed out in its opinion. 
    In -- on June 20, 1943 issue of the Wall Street Journal, there was an article stating that the United States is cracking down on New York workers who are evading their taxes. 
    That the Government has filed notices of levy with the state controller and that the state controller, unadvised of the Attorney General of the State, was honoring those levis. 
    That's over 15 years ago. 
    The practice has been consistent. 
    And I might say that the Internal Revenue service has advised that some information it has, it's believed that the vast majority of the State has complied or made other arrangements for the payment of the tax.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4484.255" stopTime="4611.710">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Ms. Graney, could you please tell me why -- I think you do not make your problem more complicated than it needs to be, and -- and it could be specific. 
    Whether or not the auditor is personally liable, isn't the question with which we start, that's the question with which we end. 
    The question is whether an auditor comes within the terms of 6332 (a). 
    And that means -- is he a person? 
    He would certainly be a person. 
    Is he in possession of or obligated with respect to property? 
    And I just think on -- on the statement of the Attorney General, I don't mean to say -- say imply the Attorney General made any concession. 
    That simply cannot be recognized, that the Auditor of West Virginia being the conduit to which officials and employees of the State get their money, even in possession of the piece of the paper, checks if they pay full, checks assumed are due or is obligated with respect thereto because it could be mandamus. 
    And therefore, if -- if the auditor comes within (a), they seems to unless there's some reason why a person should be given the restrictive meaning. 
    These powers have a consequence. 
    Unless you say a State Auditor being between two fires, that of a state that of the United States, may pay the money to the -- to the Secretary. 
    But I should think the short answer to that is, it was always -- put the money versary of the court, and say here. 
    Uncle Sam and -- and the delinquent taxpayers fighting over this thing, I put this in the versary of the Court and I'm through with it. 
    So, I don't see why he's bothered by it, whether he's personally liable. 
    He isn't if he doesn't come within (a), I mean necessarily, is if he does come within (a).
speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="4611.710" stopTime="4634.262">
    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    That's right. 
    I think two points in that connection. 
    The argument with respect to (a), he says on the one hand that he is not in position of the property because he was not in possession of it as an individual. 
    Well, that's true. 
    But the statute makes him liable for his possession and obligation as an agent of the State.

    But now, the South Carolina case stating the facts at 199 U.S., the dispensers or state liquor stores were held to be liable for the federal license tax on retail liquor dealers. 
    And in that case, the Court expressly recognized that they were acting only as agents of the State but it said, if the principle is not exempt, they are not either. 
    So, maybe we shouldn't worry about it.

    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    Well, I think the language in possession of or obligated with respect to is about as broad as it could be made in the circumstance of a statute of this nature. 
    Now, petitioner does not make any argument about this other than the fact that he wasn't obligated as an individual, that's his only argument.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4811.083" stopTime="4827.385">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, if -- if that means with reference (Inaudible) that suppose an agent is the person who owes the debt, he's liable in his pretty broad interpretation of the statute.
speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="4827.385" stopTime="4853.450">
    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    Well, I think that interpretation is required by the definition of a person contained in subsection (c) and it's defined for the purposes of subsection (a) as including a person acting in a representative capacity, who as such officer, employee or member is under a duty to surrender the property.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I don't -- I -- I don't think -- it seems to me like the statute (Inaudible) is on that property, isn't he? 
    With the actual property that the person has in possession, not a debt that he owes the State of the money.
speaker="melva_m_graney" startTime="4869.867" stopTime="4870.342">
    Ms. Melva M. Graney 
    Oh.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Of course, he doesn't have any money particularly in his possession. 
    This is a debt owing by (Inaudible) and it's owing by the State.

    Of course the paper wouldn't -- the paper wouldn't be enough.

    Actually, the -- the levy could have been released with Mr. Sims with simply made arrangements with the district director and the delinquent taxpayers. 
    Another way in which he could have evaded the personal liability was by simply holding the warrant and said, “I have them, I haven't paid them out.” 
    It would have required a suit by the Government but his personal liability would have only been technical because he still have the money be available for the payment of the tax liabilities.
