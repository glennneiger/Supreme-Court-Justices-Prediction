    Mr. William B. Moore, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices, if it please the Court. 
    This is a criminal case which has been in the federal courts throughout its entire life. 
    In November 1949, Johnny Ray Smith was apprehended under the Osceola Hotel in Geneva, Alabama by the FBI. 
    He and two others, who later became his codefendants, were carried to Dothan where they were arraigned and incarcerated. 
    They -- this was on a Friday. 
    They were questioned that night in Saturday and Sunday, and right in the early Monday morning, the 21st day of November, 1949, they were carried to Montgomery. 
    There, they had a conference with the Assistant United States Attorney. 
    And during that time or some time during the morning while they were in the United States Attorney's Office, FBI agent John Lill went to the chambers of Judge Charles Kennamer, presiding judge, and had a conference with him about this matter. 
    Shortly thereafter, Judge Kennamer went on the bench, Johnny Ray Smith and his two defendants -- codefendants, who were two 17-year-old boys, Johnny Ray was 26, went into the courtroom. 
    And in the words of the Fifth Circuit after a few didactic questions, all three defendants pled guilty. 
    Whereupon, the judge says, “I have discussed this matter with Mr. Lill,” meaning the FBI agent and immediately proceeded to pronounce sentences, 30 years to Johnny Ray and 15 years to each of the two 17-year-old boys. 
    Now, Smith was incarcerated in the federal prison system and finally was sent to California to Alcatraz. 
    He there initiated a petition, a -- a petition for writ of habeas corpus, and it got to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals there. 
    They told him he had the wrong remedy, that he should be proceeding under 2255. 
    Thereupon, he filed in the Fifth Circuit in Alabama after making due motions to Judge Kennamer. 
    The Fifth Circuit of Alabama of the Fifth -- not of Alabama but the United States Court of Appeals Circuit, granted him this relief under 2255 and ordered a hearing. 
    At that stage, I was fortunate enough to be appointed by the Court to come in to defend the man's rights. 
    We had a full hearing with the petitioner being brought from Alcatraz and then the presiding District Judge decided we were entitled to no relief so we went to the -- back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    And in 238 F. 2d 925, they issued another opinion. 
    We thought we had won our lawsuit at that point. 
    They decided that when it comes to the controlling question whether or not the waivers and the plea was taken in violation of due process, that it was. 
    And in the opinion they set out a number of reasons why they thought it was. 
    Then the judgment is reversed, the cause is remanded with directions to grant the motion to set aside the conviction and sentence and to proceed further and not inconsistently, herewith. 
    The United States Attorney saw fit to file for rehearing. 
    The rehearing was refused but the Court added a further sentence in addition to what I just read, including if the District Judge is of the opinion that the ends of justice required it, permitting the defendant to withdraw his waiver of counsel and his plea of guilty, and to stand trial. 
    We went back to the Fifth Circuit Court again -- to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals again, and pointed out that we thought it was quite inconsistent in the body of the opinion to say, the due -- due process has not been granted because of the waivers and these other matters which I'm going to bring up that we thought we were entitled to more relief but we didn't get it. 
    Hence, we are here. 
    Now, what our District did -- Judge did, when the case was sent back to him with these instructions, was the following. 
    When the case was called we appeared and he did remove -- he followed the Court in removing the conviction and the sentence. 
    As the man stood before the Court, with the conviction and sentence removed, we asked for a writ of habeas corpus, which was refused. 
    We then asked to withdraw our plea of guilty, which was refused. 
    Then we asked to withdraw the waivers of indictment of counsel and venue which was refused. 
    Then as he stood before the Court, based on this plea he had made in 1949, the Court sentenced him to 10 additional years. 
    The man had been in jail eight years at that time.

    Mr. William B. Moore, Jr. 
    No, sir. 
    Judge Frank Johnson was appointed and this is his first case that he had heard since he went on the bench. 
    And he had heard the entire 2255. 
    When it came back to him, he reduced the sentence on the fact we had a 30-year sentence to start with. 
    The man had served eight years. 
    The judge took cognizance of eight years and resentenced the man to an additional 10 years from that date, which he is serving at this time.

    Mr. William B. Moore, Jr. 
    Well I claim some other things other than that if it please the Court and which I want to get to right now if I may. 
    And I -- I want quite fully. 
    In the first place, I say that this Court, under the proceeding that they had, did not have jurisdiction. 
    The reasons to these. 
    This case is a kidnapping case and it's -- it's a federal law. 
    It's the Lindbergh Law, Section 1201. 
    And under that case the man is accused of a capital crime.

    No, sir. 
    I do not. 
    Under the Parrino case if it does not specify whether the man did or did not release the victim unharmed, he can be found guilty of a capital crime. 
    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="552.515" stopTime="563.896">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you saying, Mr. Moore that if the indictment itself alleges that in fact the victim was unharmed, there could by no possibility be a capital sentence?
speaker="william_b_moore_jr" startTime="563.896" stopTime="564.782">
    Mr. William B. Moore, Jr. 
    That is correct, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="564.782" stopTime="573.433">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if it doesn't say so, there may be a capital sentence although the victim in fact was unharmed.
speaker="william_b_moore_jr" startTime="573.433" stopTime="577.850">
    Mr. William B. Moore, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's a jury question of a fact where he was or was not released unharmed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="577.850" stopTime="596.497">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well I mean if -- if in fact the indictment, there may be a prosecution for and a conviction of the Lindbergh offense and the imposition of a death sentence, although the indictment says nothing about what happened to the victim.
speaker="william_b_moore_jr" startTime="596.497" stopTime="598.119">
    Mr. William B. Moore, Jr. 
    Yes, that's what the Parrino case holds --

    Yes.

    -- exactly.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="599.018" stopTime="608.647">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And therefore -- but if the indictment itself qualifies it by saying that the victim was unharmed, then there couldn't be a capital sentence.

    Mr. William B. Moore, Jr. 
    Yes.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you prove it -- but you prove it because of what you and I went through of what happens if an indictment is brought. 
    If an indictment is brought which merely says there was a kidnapping, period. 
    He may be sentenced to death on a showing that in fact the victim was hurt.

    No, sir. 
    And the rule -- Rule 7 (b) of the Federal Criminal Rules, only allows an information where the offense is not capital. 
    I hadn't answered your question yet, and I realized it. 
    But as the first step in this, in -- in our contention, it -- if this is in fact a capital case, then there is no way by which the United States Attorney can start this by an information. 
    And I -- I've got to convince you of that first, at least I mean I've got to make that point. 
    That this is a capital case or can be a capital case, because by the very nature of things the man can be found guilty -- is this what he's charged with, doesn't necessarily mean that's what he did, even though it was by an information. 
    Then the judge can ask for a jury, and the jury can find that the victim was not released unharmed.

    Whether you determine or whether the question of filing a charge by information rather than requiring an indictment to say that that is the requirement of the rule is the very issue.

    So that really the nub of the situation between you and the Government is, whether this requirement of Rule 7 is to be judged in terms of the actual facts in a particular case as to whether a death sentence could have been given, or in terms, as you claim, as to what the or what the information charges.

    That's that's what --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1090.853" stopTime="1112.736">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    -- would have to be, I take it, that in any situation where there was no dispute, no dispute whatever, that a death sentence could not be imposed still, the District Attorney if he wants to proceed by information in order to get a waiver of the indictment has got to allege in the indictment -- in the information as the man was unharmed.
speaker="william_b_moore_jr" startTime="1112.736" stopTime="1220.487">
    Mr. William B. Moore, Jr. 
    That's right. 
    That's the position and that's point number one. 
    Point number two, if I may go into it, sir is the fact that an FBI agent acting in line and scope of his duty as an FBI agent and in no other capacity, and of the chambers of the judge who was later the sentencing judge, and the record will reveal that he had a good bit to say about -- about this man, about his alleged confession, about this crime, about other crimes, information he got from another FBI agent, and a rather full report. 
    Now, the record would also show that Mr. Lill went to California when the habeas corpus was held and had a good bit to say at that time about this and gave testimony our there. 
    At that time there was some talk about a presentence report and the Government has made quite a point out of the fact that what difference does it make if this information was given before instead of after. 
    Our answer to that is this. 
    Mr. Lill was never giving information in the form of a presentence report. 
    Mr. Lill admitted, off on my examination in Montgomery that we had a probation service there. 
    He knew the probation officers by name. 
    We didn't have to -- the Court didn't have to go to an FBI agent to -- to get a presentence report. 
    Mr. Lill never left his job as an FBI agent as this Court held in Von Moltke case. 
    It's laudable for a -- a government agent to be a government agent but at the same time, he can't work for both sides of the street. 
    Williams case was brought out this morning and there a probation officer and the probation report is certainly supposed to be giving the full truth, picture and possibly be the man's protector if, possible.

    And I think if I go in to my third point in some detail, it will answer your question. 
    My point -- my third point is that, as of right now, it's a law of the land as given by the Fifth Circuit that this man was deprived of due process in the taking of all these waivers and the plea and this sentence. 
    And it's all tied up in one package. 
    And you can't just set aside a conviction and turn around and give him a new sentence.

    “When it comes to the controlling question however, which the motion presents whether under the undisputed facts, the defendant was denied due process in the taking of his waivers in plea, the matter stands quite differently. 
    And because it is clear that it was not accorded to him, the judgment must be reversed. 
    This is so because considering the inordinate haste, the inordinate speed, they encountered haste with which the defendants were brought up for hearing, the trial moved to face the fact that the government prosecuting agent and the District Judge before the defendant had made any waiver or pleaded, indicate in the course, conferred privately in chambers with the prosecuting agent with regard to defendant's guilt and the punishment to be imposed therefore in connection with both what was said and done and what was left unsaid and undone by the judge in taking the waivers and the plea and the sentencing the defendant. 
    We are left in no doubt that the move was not accorded but was denied due process and the judgment and sentence may not stand.So it's all tied in together.

   Argument of Leon Silverman

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Silverman.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="1806.103" stopTime="1859.854">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices, may it please the Court. 
    My adversary has touched on three points that he wishes to urge and I will deal with him if I may in the same order that he dealt with them. 
    In the first place, there was here a waiver of indictment, the filing of an information. 
    The information charged the violation of the kidnapping statute and the question is then presented, was the offense involved in this entire transaction, one that was punishable by death? 
    And our answer to that question is that it was not. 
    In the first place --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1859.854" stopTime="1870.429">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well if this is the information that have been in the form of an indictment and is not on the trial (Inaudible)
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="1870.429" stopTime="1898.996">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    If Your Honor please. 
    Justice -- that Judge Hand in the Parrino case, in a case which was not like the one we are dealing with, said that the allegation as to whether the man was released harmed or unharmed is not -- is not a part of the offense. 
    And if one may look to the entire circumstances of the case and one may then decide whether or not the man was harmed or unharmed, and then that will determine whether this was a capital offense.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1898.996" stopTime="1901.393">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well then aren't you (Inaudible)
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="1901.393" stopTime="1902.501">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    I'm saying, sir, that if --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1902.501" stopTime="1910.927">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    If it were under such an indictment shows no harm or (Inaudible) and it might be that --
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="1910.927" stopTime="1979.631">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    I would say that if Judge Hand's dictum in that case is right, then the Government is ahead on that point because in the entire case, it is undisputed and that was found both by the lower court and the Court of Appeals that the victim here was released unharmed and there has never been the slightest question as to that. 
    But if Judge Hand may not -- is not right and I needn't argue whether he is or he's not at the moment, then the question as to what it is that must be alleged, we submit, is not that the victim was released unharmed in order to proceed by information. 
    The necessary allegation is, if it is necessary that the man was released harmed in order to seek the death penalty. 
    Consequently, our position is that if Judge Hand is right, then the information was proper. 
    And if Judge Hand was wrong, then we proceeded in a manner here which lends itself to the filing of an information because this was not a capital crime.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1979.631" stopTime="2003.792">

    Yes. 
    Well, now let's put it this way. 
    You charge him with -- you charge with murder in a manner under which he could be convicted of either first degree murder or second degree murder. 
    And the Government made no attempt to prove a first degree murder but proved a second degree murder. 
    And it had been done by the -- by information rather than an indictment, would that have been good?

    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    If I may rephrase my understanding of what you have said before I concede too much. 
    If the supposition is that a --a pleading was acceptable of two kinds of proof, one which would subject the accused to a greater penalty and one to a lesser, and if the Government never had any intention and indeed had no reason to believe that the greater offense had been committed. 
    Under those circumstances I would say that by not alleging greater circumstances or surrounding or aggravating circumstances, the Government would not seek the capital punishment.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2095.053" stopTime="2154.629">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well let me put it this way. 
    This might be a little more what I'm -- what I'm thinking. 
    The Government charges a --a person with the crime of murder in terms that would justify his conviction of either first degree murder or second degree murder, and then the -- the Government goes into court and says to the -- to the court, “Your Honor, we have no intention of trying to establish a capital offense here. 
    We are -- we are satisfied that the defendant only committed a second degree murder.” 
    And the defendant then says, “In those circumstances, I will plead guilty to the -- to second degree murder under the information.” 
    Would that be right going and --and could he then waive in that manner the right to be charged by an indictment rather than an information?

    I would think so, sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2197.825" stopTime="2212.072">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But as I understand you, your argument is that or your position is that if it does not judge a capital offense, unless it shows all the ingredients one of which is that the person is released, no person was harmed.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="2212.072" stopTime="2334.656">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    That is the second string to my bow if it please, the Court. 
    The first string is the argument of Mr -- or of Judge Hand in the Parrino case. 
    None of these is necessarily alleged but that you may determine the capital nature of the offense from everything that you know about the case, and that found it's echo in the Parker case, a very similar -- to the Parrino case involving a -- the -- this kidnapping statute in which the issue was whether the accused should have been given a list of (Inaudible) man and list of witnesses. 
    If this were a capital crime he would have been entitled to that. 
    He was not furnished that. 
    And the Court then at the conclusion of the case said, “This is no grounds for throwing this case out.” 
    In that case, no death penalty had been recommended by the -- by the jury. 
    If -- and there's no question if the man was not released harmed and that means that this is not a capital case. 
    And indeed Judge Hand's decision is -- is a very similar one. 
    It was a statute of limitations problem. 
    The question was whether the statute was told if this were a capital offense. 
    In that case, that the jury returned a recommendation of no death penalty. 
    That didn't satisfy Judge Hand. 
    What he said was that you really can't make this a capital case by the mere allegation. 
    In order to make this a capital case, you must in fact determine whether the man was released harmed or unharmed and the jury's recommendation that there should not be a death penalty here, was not conclusive because they may have decided not to recommend the death penalty for all kinds of reasons, none of which may have had anything to do with the harmed or unharmed condition of the victim. 
    And so he sends it back, remands it for a trial and presumably for a finding on the specific question as to whether or not the man was harmed or unharmed because it is -- it is that which make it a capital offense.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2334.656" stopTime="2344.120">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Your first position then is that a man can be convicted and sentenced to death on an indictment although he's not charged if the person was harmed.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="2344.120" stopTime="2370.303">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    My first position is that that is not a necessary Allegation. 
    My second position is that if it is, it is necessary to charge that he was harmed. 
    That you -- it -- that it is not fair to say that the Government must give notice of the lesser crime and this is really, I -- I submit, a notice problem. 
    We are interested in having the accused I -- I should think, aware of what it is that he is facing. 
    And it --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2370.303" stopTime="2385.547">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Along that the lines of your -- what you're just arguing have you a third string to your bow? 
    To the effect that the very fact that the Government proceeded by information rather than by indictment gave notice to this defendant that this was not an offense punishable by death?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There maybe --
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="2414.794" stopTime="2414.908">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    -- speculation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2414.908" stopTime="2490.241">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- other considerations particular in the federal -- in the federal penal system namely, the role that is expected to be played by -- by the process or the procedure with indictment. 
    But if the thing has contingency that seriously, was such a nature, that they may result either in the capital sentence or beyond infamous crime meaning a year or on a day, whatever it is, that then you need the intervention of a grand jury as the charging body. 
    And I shouldn't think -- I shouldn't think to take the constitutional provision requiring indictment for capital or other infamous offenses -- crimes, whatever it is -- infamous crime that if Congress passed a statute saying, outlawing, had given Congress to say, “If it's the first offense, it should be punished by six months. 
    If it's the second offense, then it should be punished by not less than two years.” 
    I should think the indictment clearly wouldn't have to set forth what it is to impose one or the other sentence. 
    But --
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="2490.241" stopTime="2491.263">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    Would or would not, I'm sorry, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2491.263" stopTime="2552.910">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Would not. 
    The second thing, the consequences of the offense is not part of the offense charge, It's relevant to the punishment. 
    And therefore if the potentiality is more than a year becomes an infamous crime and I don't think the government could argue. 
    You don't have to indict putting labor to one side because as a matter of fact it is conceded in the case that he was only a first offender. 
    And I don't see why the same argument assuming I'm right about the constitutional construction, doesn't apply to the federal rule namely, it's not merely a concern of notice to the defendant but also the kind of safeguard, the kind of conservative safeguard, in all whole process of prosecution that are deemed relevant to a crime that may be, on the fact, not going in through in advance but at the end of the prosecution. 
    That maybe, that may end in death.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="2552.910" stopTime="2585.825">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    If Your Honor please, I -- I certainly agree here that notice is not the only consideration, and that indeed a grand jury certainly if the federal rules have not been adopted one would have serious questions to whether there could ever be a waiver not on a constitutional level because the Gill case get away with that but on the authority of the Government to proceed in a manner other than by indictment. 
    But the federal rules have made it quite clear that this may be waived except in a capital crime.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2585.825" stopTime="2594.084">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So, we have a problem of construction in the light of the whole tradition of history of prosecutions in the federal system?
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="2594.084" stopTime="2674.976">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    I would say sir that I -- I should like to comment at least on one aspect of the formulation that you made. 
    And that is the second offender situation. 
    That has been distinguished from the kind of thing that I am talking about. 
    And that is the aggravating circumstances of crime. 
    It's been distinguished in the case of Myers against the United States in the Fifth Circuit. 
    And in the subsequent case of Jordan against the United States District Court of the District of Columbia in the Circuit Court in the district. 
    And in the Jordan case, the Court distinguished the second offender situation in these words. 
    It said, “In the second offender situation, however, the criminal act which is proscribed is the same regardless of the background of the criminal. 
    The previous offense is merely out of historical fact. 
    As a result of which, the penalty may appropriately be made more severe because of the demonstrated contributings of the defendant. 
    On the other hand, where the aggravation arises from the manner in which the crime was committed, in substance, a different aspect of the offense is sought to be punished. 
    Accordingly, we think is the -- the Fifth Circuit in the Myers case, that the facts and aggravation must be charged in the indictment and found to be true by the jury. 
    And I submit, sir, that was --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2674.976" stopTime="2701.835">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That -- that raises the whole -- of course if you're right, that an indictment charging what this information did could not eventually lead in death that it's the necessary part of the charge. 
    If -- if that is so, if that were established, but if we could agree on that or conclude that -- that's one thing. 
    But if you don't, it's a very different thing and the nice distinction that you've just quoted, doesn't seem to me to be very convincing.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="2701.835" stopTime="2732.737">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    Well sir, I -- I must repeat again the two of possible three-string argument and I don't mean to be unnecessarily persistent about this. 
    And, that is, that I am not in a position to say that Judge Hand was right or wrong about the necessity for alleging. 
    But if he is right, then he and indeed the judge in the Parker case said that one could determine whether the victim was released unharmed from circumstances outside the specific pleading. 
    And that's what --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2732.737" stopTime="2740.205">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And that statute is -- just reading your statute, I'm inclined to find the convicting proof leading to that conclusion.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="2740.205" stopTime="2798.780">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    If that is right sir, then I submit that in this case there is unquestioned and undoubted evidence or undisputed evidence. 
    The fact was the fact. 
    If I need go further and I do not want to be driven to -- to go further, but I present this because I think that a full discussion of what is perhaps a matter of first instance, in this Court, ought to be developed. 
    If I need go further then I would take the position that I have outlined as the second string to my bow and would cite in support of that. 
    This Court's decision in the Cordell case where in a footnote, the Court says that in effect, you may proceed for the lesser of the two aspects of the offense by information. 
    Unless I convey the impression that that was not a thought -- a well thought-out part of the Cordell case, I hasten to add that it was thoroughly briefed by both sides that was appealed from that case.

    (A) -- (a) is it necessary to be charged and if it's included in his deed that it was not necessary to be charged, then is the offense, that which kidnapping with all the possible consequences and therefore not is a measure of punishment and not part of the offense.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="2836.164" stopTime="2892.670">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    Well if you all please -- if as I believe your -- your remarks suggest, the Court may become interested in the broader problem here presented. 
    I would ask the Court to consider the material at the end of our brief which I think rather, persuasively, talks about the policy considerations with respect to the waiver of the indictment. 
    And I need not belabor you the point except to say that it would be a most serious decision from the point of view of those prisoners who may have to languish in jail for months awaiting the action of a grand jury which does not meet as frequently as it does in our larger Metropolitan areas. 
    Waiting only for the formality of an indictment when he knows, and I must assume for these purposes, that he is guilty of the crime, and wants to plead to the crime having released the man unharmed he --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2892.670" stopTime="2899.009">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But where is the hardship there really?It's just a difference of whether he's languishing in jail or languishing in prison isn't it?
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="2899.009" stopTime="2960.656">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    Well, the -- the hardship here, Mr. Justice Stewart, but a man gets no credit for time in the federal system, prior to his sentence. 
    And so every moment that he spends in jail prior to the judge giving him a term of his is, is granted and sir, I may suggest and if I may be permitted at least from my personal experience in the United States Attorney's Office, I -- I -- it has happened so very often that a man apprehended in the course of a crime, comes in and says, “Now, look, let's -- let's get this show on the road. 
    I'm -- I'm -- you -- you got me." 
    Now, how can I most quickly get this -- start to do the time that I'm going to get? 
    And there's no nonsense about the fact that the man knows that he's going to get time. 
    If in -- if in New York, that happened, I -- I suggest there's a grand jury in session, at least everyday, and indeed many grand juries who are in session concurrently. 
    But if you go to the more rural areas of our country, it maybe months and --

    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    It is indeed, sir. 
    And I would ask this Court to note that although Judge Hand uses very broad language about the necessity for making an allegation of all of the aspects of the offense and he finds that this is not an aspect of the offense, but he is using this language in a case which is very peculiar because it is a statute of limitations case and as I read it, and perhaps I am reading it with more intuition than understanding but as I read it, I have the feeling that what Judge Hand was there saying that it isn't good enough for the prosecutor to charge that the man was released harmed to convert it into a capital case because that gives the prosecutor free play.

    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    No, sir. 
    I think that probably he would be bound by it and I must, of course, say that if I were the Assistant United States Attorney and the United States Attorney drawing up an information or an indictment as the case may be, it would not be terribly difficult to put these words into --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3258.570" stopTime="3279.519">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, put yourself in the situation of a U.S. Attorney, who doesn't seem like you do. 
    What kind of feelings would prompt the U.S. Attorney to fix about it, not putting it in? 
    What embarrassment to make that as a necessary consequence of a decision that if you don't put it in, then there's the potentiality of a capital offense?
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3279.519" stopTime="3300.456">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    Then I would go -- I -- I would have to take your argument, sir, and take it one step forward. 
    And that is, the poor fellow who may be caught and says, I want out. 
    I want to start to do my time. 
    And the United States Attorney under those circumstances, well, I suppose there he could charge him with an information.

    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    He could, sir. 
    But I really think that the problem is one, of where a man has been released harmed. 
    It seems to me that that is the allegation that perhaps ought to be made to put the man who is now being charged, on notice of the fact that this is a -- this is the capital offense. 
    The harming of a man during a kidnapping, that is the thing that leads to the capital offense. 
    And I say I find support for this position in the cases that I have read and I -- I have found no support for the alternative position.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, there's one that the --
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3427.189" stopTime="3445.439">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    -- that the answer came back that in all of the cases and those people who'd been in the department for donkey's years in this section of the department that we seek the capital offense only after an allegation that the victim has been released harmed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3445.439" stopTime="3494.810">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But isn't that a practical or does one have -- does one go on with his imagination? 
    I know nothing about the records in this cases but it seems to be not too imaginative to assume that there are kidnapping cases in which an indictment for one reason or another but partly for the reason that you give is sought to be secured very promptly. 
    And the state of the victim is not yet determined at the time that the indictment is brought. 
    He may have been slightly bruised. 
    It may turn out to be one of the mysterious things, that later, results in death or so that -- and that is left open and I take it to statute. 
    And I take it. 
    I can argue. 
    I can read the statute as dealing with that probability that you wait until the end to find out what kind of punishment should be imposed --
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3494.810" stopTime="3495.075">

speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3500.393" stopTime="3515.142">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    In which case, sir, I -- I would suggest that if one may wait to the end of the -- of the proceedings before one makes a determination, then in this case, there can be no question that the victim was released unharmed --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Silverman, suppose this information had been filed after the time limit for the filing of -- of an information of indictment in a normal felony case, not a capital case, would the statute of limitations be open to the defendant in this case?
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3547.662" stopTime="3552.436">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    I would say -- if you say in a felony, in -- in a normal felony case.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Probably a felony case.

    Had this information had been filed beyond that time limit?

    You'd say it would be open, right.

    Because under no circumstances --

    Would this then be --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3580.656" stopTime="3585.326">

    -- could be, because under no circumstances, could he be convicted of a capital offense.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3585.326" stopTime="3587.378">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    That's right, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3587.378" stopTime="3598.980">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, I didn't understand to say before that -- that you thought under no circumstances could he have been convicted of a capital offense under this kind of an information.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3598.980" stopTime="3603.459">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    That was, if I may go back to my former -- my -- my prior formulation, that was the second string.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3603.459" stopTime="3642.895">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    See my trouble -- my trouble is that it seems to me you both -- you both embrace at the same time reject the language of -- of Judge Hand when he said this Court within petitioner's brief, we agree that the indictment stated all the essentials of the crime as charged, and that it was not necessary to allege that the victim was not released unharmed in order that the jury might recommend the death penalty. 
    We, too, think that the indictment need not allege whether the victim had been released unharmed. 
    So --
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3642.895" stopTime="3651.332">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    My -- my -- you're absolutely right, sir that my opponent and I point to the same case and -- and indeed almost the language and draw different conclusions from it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3651.332" stopTime="3651.333">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well --
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3651.333" stopTime="3652.844">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    If I go through that, however --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3652.844" stopTime="3668.074">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well I -- I wish you would if could in a -- in few words, tell me how you construe this language to -- to support this information.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3668.074" stopTime="3729.441">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    If it is not a necessary element of the offense to allege whether a victim has been released harmed or unharmed, and I must then seek refuge in the -- in -- in the other thing that Judge Hand says. 
    And if you may look to the entire proceedings to make that determination, then I say, in this case if it was not necessary to make the allegation and if we do look to the other -- to the remaining part of this proceeding, we come to the undeniable conclusion that the victim was released unharmed. 
    Therefore I say that if Judge Hand was right, then this is not a capital offense. 
    Now, I -- I -- so this is obviously an inability on my part to communicate the thought that I'm trying to express but I'm not sure that I --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3729.441" stopTime="3729.602">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Therefore --
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3729.602" stopTime="3730.631">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    -- can differ with that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3730.631" stopTime="3757.429">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But it was -- if the least language is, that the information did not say that he was unharmed. 
    And Judge Hand said that regardless of the fact that it did not say that he was unharmed, the jury had the right to find him guilty of a capital offense. 
    Am I wrong in that?
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3757.429" stopTime="3759.471">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    If the remaining evidence showed that in --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3759.471" stopTime="3759.618">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No --
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3759.618" stopTime="3760.087">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    -- fact he was released --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3760.087" stopTime="3760.409">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Would that --
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3760.409" stopTime="3760.791">

    -- harmed.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3760.791" stopTime="3784.362">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But that is within this language. 
    Now if he -- because he goes on to say, “We too think that the indictment need not allege whether the victim had been released unharmed,” now it may be there are other language in there and if you say that there's language that qualifies this, I won't trouble you to read it because I'll read it myself. 
    But I would talk to you about this language that was quoted in the petitioner's brief.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="3784.362" stopTime="3790.921">
    Mr. Leon Silverman

    The other two are, if there is an allegation that is necessary, it must come in terms of the aggravated circumstances of the crime that absent the aggravated circumstances charged.

    If you want to make it a capital crime, you must charge in undeniable language that the man was released harmed.

    If one found in propriety they use that including term in the FBI man seeing the judge in the chambers, ex-party before the judge knew what kind of plea the defendant would make. 
    That's -- that's part of our supervisory function in dealing with the conduct of lower courts in connection with the rule as the probation officer, one doesn't have to go as far as due process to find impropriety here.

    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    On the other hand sir, although one may find the impropriety and certainly, the Government does not state that the conduct of the judge in entertaining Mr. Lill in his chambers prior to accepting the plea is one that can be commended.I am not at all sure that the simple impropriety unless it had some effect on the rights of the accused.

speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="4258.572" stopTime="4294.796">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    Well, sir, I suggest that the -- the per quod of the federal rules have never gone to the point where a judge who has tried a man and has had -- and has imposed sentence, and for one reason or another, has had that sentence in trial reversed by an appellant court, I know of no reason why that judge is ever precluded from retrying the same man yet that is -- isn't that in the same spirit? 
    Here is a judge who has gotten information about the man's criminal background one thing and another but we had so far as I know, never ruled a judge out of a second --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4294.796" stopTime="4313.152">

    No, but because we have assumed that judges who are reversed by Courts of Appeals are sufficiently disciplined to at least beyond the alert in regard to their conduct where the case is retried.

    And the part which is a very important element from my point of view in considering the conduct of the kind of man who ought to be and presumably normally are under federal courts, our own profession and particular judge's profession train them in that kind of discipline. 
    But that's a very different thing from a judge having listened to a report that evil conduct and mischievousness but a fellow who then has appearing before him in an independent role in deciding what to do with him.

    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    Well sir, whether it'd be due process or whether it'd be the power of this Court to supervise the administration of the criminal law that is no longer in this case. 
    Whatever the grounds were, the Court of Appeals saw to it that this man was brought up for sentence by a judge who had not engaged in that practice, Judge Kennamer --

    The Court of Appeals did use the language in the first time that it considered the merits after the 2255 hearing before Judge -- before Judge Johnson. 
    They did use the language that my adversary cited to the Court. 
    And they concluded their opinion and indeed their mandate originally prepared contained the language. 
    The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to grant the motion to satisfy the conviction and sentence, and to proceed further and not inconsistently herewith. 
    However, the United States --

    Where is that here?

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, it's in the footnote?
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="4471.358" stopTime="4515.505">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    However it said, immediately the United States turned to move for reargument before rehearing. 
    And the Court, while it's opinion was fresh in its mind and when it had a chance to see what the implications of this language were, then changed its mandate. 
    And its mandate then with, that is it added to what appears, the language, instead of putting a period after herewith, they put a comma there and they then went on “including if the District Court is of the opinion that the ends of justice require it, permitting the defendant to withdraw his waiver of counsel and his plea of guilty and to stand trial.”

    Unknown Speaker 
    Now that's the very addition to which Judge Rives addressed himself they're valuing what Judge Rives said. 
    He said that that was utterly incompetent. 
    That was for the reason that the Court already knows that this was another void condition.

    Now I say --

    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    That is what he said but Judge Rives' position in this case is a very interesting one. 
    In the first place, he said when this first came up, when there was no 2255 here --

    I say this issue is before us for a decision.
speaker="leon_silverman" startTime="4553.009" stopTime="4672.042">
    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    As to whether or not the -- the Court -- what the Court meant by using the language that it did, of course. 
    And I would say to you that the Court has interpreted what it meant on two separate occasions. 
    One on the rehearing, when it amended its mandate, and the second time on the appeal from the new sentence when it found specifically that the district George -- judge had meticulously carried out the mandate. 
    And that appears in the -- in the record on page 267 of the record by suitable language in the opinion itself and by similar precise terms in the mandate, we sought on rehearing to make it plain that the sentence of conviction of 30 years imprisonment was alone mandatorily to be set aside. 
    And that is to the plea of guilty in waivers the District Court was free to allow such of these as the interest of justice might require. 
    The District Court finding expressly that the interest of justice did not so require, paid scrupulous heed to and carried out the precise terms of our mandate. 
    So that the Court of Appeals who knew best what it meant, said that it did not mean that this denial of due process or Justice Frankfurter's lesser formulation of -- of the -- of the problem, it -- it did not say that this vitiated the proceedings at all. 
    It vitiated the sentence and the sentence was then re-imposed. 
    The -- the trial judge made very, very specific findings with respect to what have taken place before Judge Kennamer and found that the pleas and the waivers were all quite voluntarily made.

    And secondly, this Court may inspect the transcript of what took place before Judge Kennamer. 
    And I am thoroughly convinced that this Court will find that the defendant here involved, who when he came before Judge Kennamer was no stranger to the criminal law to use the phrase that the cases used.

    Mr. Leon Silverman 
    Well I can -- I can tell you his familiarity with the criminal law because that is a part of this record. 
    And Judge Johnson elicited the information from this man. 
    He had been convicted of two prior direct offenses. 
    He escaped from Chillicothe Institute. 
    He stole a car. 
    He then had it on robbery. 
    He was sentenced for that. 
    I can go on and on, sir and -- and indicate to you that this man knew very well what it is that he was charged with and what it is that he was doing and that the record is replete. 
    And if I -- if I may I can -- I can deal with any one of these things and point out where in the record. 
    This man was informed of his rights to counsel. 
    This happened time and time again from the moment he came before the Commissioner on arraignment until the -- the time that he was sentenced by the Court. 
    He was told by the Commissioner, he was told by the FBI agent, he was told by the United States Attorney and his codefendant even protested that, “Don't bother us now, we -- we'd had enough of this. 
    We don't want counsel.” 
    And he was told by the judge -- he was told by the judge on several occasions in -- during the course of the hearing. 
    So that the - the talk about his -- his waiver of counsel I suggest is not substantiated by the record but in fact the record points out that this man knew, had adequate advice with respect to his right to counsel.

    And Judge Johnson developed it on his own before the resentence that admissions from the defendant. 
    But that there was something wrong about a man imposing sentence having gained information in -- in a way that the rule did not contemplate. 
    And that the Court of Appeals felt that if there was any injury to this defendant, the injury was occasioned only in the sentence. 
    And in the next sets of caution perhaps it said, “We will do away with the injury that may have been caused here. 
    And we will have this man go back and be resentenced.” 
    And indeed that is what happened that is -- it was pointed out. 
    12 years was taken from the sentence.

    But first, due process was accorded to this defendant. 
    It was accorded to him that when the District Judge, Judge Johnson resentenced him taking care of whatever may have been the ill effects of the conversation between agent Lill and Judge Kennamer, every other part of the proceeding, we submit, was absolutely proper and fully accorded to the defendant his rights with respect to whether or not the Government could proceed by information, I think I would be laboring the obvious if I repeated the three arguments that I made before. 
    I would submit that the Government has proceeded in this case with perfect propriety that the defendant has nothing to complain of in terms of what rights were given him or denied him and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.

    Mr. William B. Moore, Jr. 
    I'm very -- very much appreciate, sir. 
    I don't intend to go beyond 4:30. 
    I think just a brief summation of my points and then I'll answer that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5251.104" stopTime="5255.033">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
speaker="william_b_moore_jr" startTime="5255.033" stopTime="5499.908">
    Mr. William B. Moore, Jr. 
    In answer to the Government position or notice, he said that it would -- we would -- that's give us notice. 
    The first thing before we got that notice, we'd have to have a waiver of indictment. 
    And when the indictment was waived, that doesn't mean that we know what the United States Attorney is going through. 
    I think Judge Rives does it very nicely here with Rule 7. 
    While Rule 7 vests a wide discretion in the United States Attorney and frees him from the necessity of obtaining leave of the court in case it's properly prosecuted by information, its language leaves no doubt that such uncontrolled discretion does not include the right to preclude the imposition of the death penalty in any case which might possibly be so punished. 
    A discretion which could therefore be finally exercised by no one man alone, in other words, the whole proposition there is jurisdiction above all other matters. 
    Most exist from the beginning and should affirmatively appear of record. 
    And I might further add that if that jurisdiction did not exist, then the case falls on its face and an answer to what you Justice Black the point your raise as to what could be the possible consequences of this matter. 
    I think we would first ask this Honorable Court to determine that there was no jurisdiction about which this information could be brought or no -- no way why that -- by which this information could be brought. 
    Therefore there was no jurisdiction. 
    We think that I will not go back into the Parrino case in any detail because I'm sure the Court will make a determination and that case would either stand or fall on one of our interpretations. 
    We think the statute of limitations that -- that the Honorable Chief Justice, the question he raised there they have to discuss by Judge Hand in that particular case. 
    Therefore we would ask this Honorable Court that it'd be determined that the United States Attorney have no way and since this is a capital case, since a man could be punished by death, to commence his action. 
    If he had no way to commence the action, there was no jurisdiction within the Court. 
    Secondly, we would -- in the event that we did not prevail in that position, we would like to urge that the lower court was quite right in determining that this man had not properly waived his right to counsel, venue and jurisdiction. 
    And that therefore these other two things which followed in consequence his plea, I think you -- we can put them all in one package and follow 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- 10 pins practically. 
    Then that plea as well as the conviction must be set aside. 
    And that that is defining and is the law as announced by the Fifth Circuit at this time. 
    Therefore if we do not prevail (Inaudible) to jurisdiction, we would think that the lower court could not -- it had a situation that was impossible to follow. 
    The Court of Appeals said, “These things were taken in violation of due process.” 
    Then they said -- set aside the sentence and proceed not inconsistent therewith. 
    Well, it is certainly inconsistent to find that a man has been deprived of due process by certain things he's done, namely, these waivers and not to follow through and say that all the waivers and the plea and the convictions should all be set aside. 
    That would be our second request. 
    If the Court got that far that all the pleas and the waivers be set aside for a violation of due process and, of course, this Court has made many other which is on due process --
