    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The question in this case here on certiorari to the Ninth Circuit is whether in the absence of any due process or other constitutional question, a District Court has the jurisdiction to review and pass upon the grounds relied upon by the National Railroad Adjustment Board in denying respondent's claim of wrongful discharge, looked at from another view is the denial award of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, final and binding as Congress said it would be in the Railway Labor Act. 
    Also involved here is the question of whether respondent's election to proceed administrate -- under the administrative remedy of the Act, bars his subsequent action for damages in the course. 
    The facts in this case are not in dispute. 
    They are these: Respondent Price was employed by the petitioner Union Pacific as a brakeman at Las Vegas, Nevada. 
    Back in 1949, in July, he was called to work in about nine in the evening and he was told to “dead-head” to a small point in California, Nipton, 56 miles away. 
    Upon arriving at Nipton, he called his superior officer, the train dispatcher, and he was instructed to stay at Nipton for a few hours and then to work as a swing brakeman on a train coming back in to Las Vegas. 
    Mr. Price, the respondent objected to those instructions.

    What is a “swing brakeman”?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="122.350" stopTime="334.769">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    A swing brakeman, sir, is a brakeman that is required we say in the railroad industry unnecessarily but it's required under the state law, the -- the extra brakeman. 
    It is required under Nevada law. 
    Mr. Price objected this instruction of staying there, this three to four hours and he asserted that it was in violation of a provision in the collective bargaining agreement between the Union Pacific and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen who represented for purposes of the Railway Labor Act, the man employed as brakeman on our property. 
    He was again told to stay at that point but Price took the matters into his own hands and proceeded back to Las Vegas. 
    As a consequence, he was charged with being insubordinate and pursuant to the provisions of the agreement, a hiring or investigation was scheduled to be held. 
    Price was directed to appear at this hearing. 
    Now, this hearing was twice postponed and when it was finally held, Mr. Price did not show up. 
    The hearing was, however, held in his absence, evidence taken and put in and taken down in short hand and a transcript prepared of that insubordinate action. 
    Following that, Price was discharged. 
    This was in July of 1949. 
    Subsequently, Price has requested the Brotherhood to handle his grievance over his alleged wrongful discharge with the carrier and sought there in his reinstatement would pay for all time loss. 
    That dispute was not settled on the property but was ultimately referred at Mr. Price's election to the National Railroad Adjustment Board pursuant to the provisions of 3 First (i) of the Railway Labor Act. 
    The claim at the Board was a claim for reinstatement with back pay, premised upon an alleged wrongful discharge. 
    The claim was handled in a usual manner at the Board. 
    At that -- before that tribunal, only Mr. Price urged two basic contentions. 
    First, he said that his disobedience, his failure to follow instructions was not insubordination. 
    It was justified because we had no right to make -- to command him to stay there. 
    The other point that he had was that we violated the labor contract in holding the hearing in his absence. 
    The Board deadlocked on that case. 
    Ultimately, under the provisions of 3 First (l), a referee was called in, a neutral person whom Congress has said, shall sit with the division and make an award. 
    On June 25, 1952, the Board issued its award or decision, as it's known. 
    And that award was simply 'Claim denied.' 
    The Board also made some findings. 
    And in those findings, the Board did discuss the question of Mr. Price's failure to follow his instructions. 
    And the Board stated and I'm quoting, “Price, was found to have wilfully disobeyed his orders.” 
    And the Board then said, “This was insubordination and merited discipline.”

    That finding, sir, is on page 57 of the record. 
    It is the first paragraph there. 
    There is a preceding sentence where the Board said, “If the carrier is to have efficient operations on its railroad, its employees must be relied upon to obey instructions.” 
    The Board then proceeded in the balance of its findings to hold that the carrier did not violate the agreement in holding the hearing in Mr. Price's absence.

    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    No, sir. 
    We don't rely to it. 
    As a matter of full disclosure, we put it in our brief. 
    It is not record matter. 
    The request or the petition for an interpretation was made prior to the petition for certiorari being filed here. 
    It was rendered a week after you granted certiorari but we do not rely upon it. 
    We think the language itself is clear and we did in the court below. 
    Now, there are other points raised by Mr. Price at the Board. 
    And the Board made no pretends of ruling upon those points at all. 
    He made a number of arguments. 
    But those were the two main points. 
    Following the issuance of that award, Mr. Price, the petitioner, took no -- made no effort to challenge that board award on any constitutional or procedural or statutory basis. 
    Instead, three years later, and I regret to announce that there is an error at page 6 of our brief where we said, 'one year later' when in fact it is 'three years later.'
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="472.300" stopTime="473.140">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What page is it in?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="473.140" stopTime="854.000">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    At page 6, sir. 
    We said --- almost in the middle of the page there. 
    Almost a year later and that should be almost three years later right in the middle of page 6. 
    He filed this action which was a diversity action in the District Court in Nevada. 
    He sought damages for wrongful discharge. 
    The carrier, the petitioner filed an answer setting forth the award of the Board and asserting that it was final and binding under Section 3 First (m) of the Act which provides that awards shall be final and binding on both parties except insofar as they shall contain a money award. 
    I might state that there's no question here that this was not a money award. 
    It is pretty well settled that a denial of a claim for money is not a money award. 
    And we also assert -- alleged that the claim was barred under the doctrine of election of remedy. 
    Our motion for a summary judgment was granted and the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals where the -- that Court reversed in a two to one decision, Judge Healy dissenting. 
    However, for the purposes of this case, we think Judge Healy was also wrong as far as the law is concerned which I'll explain a little later. 
    The Court's opinion is a little difficult to rationalize. 
    The Bo -- that Court recognize that the Board had made an award in this matter. 
    As a matter of fact, the Court itself said, “The Adjustment Board denied Price's claim in its entirety." 
    Now, the claim was for reinstatement and back pay and it was based upon wrongful discharge. 
    It was that claim that the court below said, “Was denied in its entirety.” 
    It also recognized that this was simply a collateral attack on the board award. 
    It also recognized the finality language which I've just read to you. 
    But it avoided the effect of that finality language by adopting a very unusual argument advanced by respondent that the Board had failed to pass upon the merits of Price's dispute with the railroad. 
    In order to adopt that argument, the court below, first of all, had to amend the Railway Labor Act and they did it in this fashion. 
    They said that an award of the Board is final and binding if it represents an adjudication on the merit. 
    Then having open the door or carved out an area that they could review the Board's award, they walked through it and said, “Let's decide what were the merits.” 
    They not only reviewed the Board's findings, they went to the submissions that were filed to the Board. 
    They found that two questions were presented as I've outlined. 
    Was Price's disobedience justified and was the holding of the hearing in his absence a violation of the agreement? 
    They concluded that the question as to Price's disobedience being justified was the merit of the case. 
    And they said that the Board has misunderstood the case. 
    The Board has misconstrued Price's submission. 
    They even went so far as to try to find out what the Board believed. 
    And that word, “believe” is in their opinion. 
    They held that since the Board did not pass upon what they determine to be the merit, that the award was not final and binding. 
    Now, it is significant to know that the court below is very, very candid. 
    They said that this question was simply a dispute over the grounds relied upon by the Board in reaching its denial award which all parties could see to have been unambiguous. 
    Now, I just submit that in its quest for the merit, its unnecessarily search for the merit, the court below confused arguments advanced by the respondent, Price, in support of his claim with the ultimate question which he presented to the Board. 
    And the ultimate question was, “Could Price be reinstated with pay?” 
    And the Board said, “No.” 
    Now, anyone of the arguments that were advanced by Price, have they been accepted by the Board? 
    An award sustaining his claim for back pay and reinstatement would have been an issue. 
    Justice Brennan has brought up this question of the interpretation subsequent to the Court of Appeals decision. 
    The petitioner did file a petition with the Adjustment Board pursuant to 3 First (m) which provide that in case a dispute arises involving an interpretation of the award, the division of the Board upon request of either party, shall interpret the award in the light of the dispute. 
    Now, we asserted in the court below that if respondent, Price was serious in his contention that the Board had failed to consider the merits of his discharge, then all he had to do was refer the matter back to the Board. 
    The court below rejected that contention. 
    In the interpretation which the Board issued following this Court's grant of certiorari, and that interpretation incidentally was rendered by the Board in this -- as composed exactly at the time the award was made namely, the referee, A. Langley (Inaudible), was a member of that Board and sat as 11-man Board in interpreting its award. 
    I just like to point out that the Board stated that its award -- that the sentence in its award, “This was insubordination and merited discipline,” demonstrated that the Board had considered and rejected the argument that Price's refusal to follow orders was justified. 
    The Board went ahead and said that that award constituted a final disposition of that dispute.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="854.000" stopTime="859.959">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I don't understand why you sought the interpretation as you told Justice Brennan you don't rely on it.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="859.959" stopTime="968.126">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Sir, I have to back up a little bit and get on and off the record but I will explain it. 
    The court below relied upon a case by the name of (Inaudible) where there was an award that was not clear and it was a District Court. 
    And in that case, the Court said, “I'm not sure as to the meaning of this award. 
    It's incumbent upon the parties to get an interpretation.” 
    Now that case was cited as one of the authorities by the court below and by respondent -- by the respondent. 
    But that court said, “We should get an interpretation.” 
    Then the other reason that actually militated for this, is at the time Mr. Price refused to follow the instructions, we were in rather serious labor difficulties with the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen over the question of our -- keeping this men at Nipton. 
    And they are asserting that it was in violation of the local contract. 
    In fact, the National Mediation Board had taken a hold of the matter and they come into the case only when it represents a rather serious problem that being a major dispute as distinguished from a minor. 
    It was in that atmosphere that Mr. Price decided to take matters into his own hand. 
    And I will say that things were just a little warm for a little while over this entire matter. 
    The matter was referred to the Board and our management was crazy after receiving the Court of Appeals decision with an order of the Court which set that award aside. 
    Now, as a matter of policy, we decided that it would be best to get the Board's own interpretation of its award to exhaust everything that we should do and we did just that.

    I might -- I should back up on that too, that it's interesting to know and the records support this, if you will review the handling on the property by Brotherhood on Mr. Price's behalf, not one's in a number of letters did they ever even take any exception to the man having been insubordinate. 
    Their only complaint was that we went ahead and held that hearing without his being present after having twice postponed it. 
    And then when they got to the Board, they did raise that other issue that he was justified in being disobedient.

    He started out with the purpose if the carrier is going to have efficient operations, they've got to rely upon employees to obey instructions. 
    And then he says, claimant was found to a willfully disobeyed order and this was insubordination and narrative discipline and then he proceed to discuss the other point. 
    Only recently, this Court, two years ago in the Chicago River case adverted to the final and binding clause as being unequivocal and in a unanimous opinion, stated that it should be literally applied in the absence of a clear showing of a contrary or qualified intention of Congress. 
    And in that case, this Court rejected the attempt of the Brotherhood to follow an alternative which they thought was more desirable. 
    This Court said that such an interpretation of the Act would render the finality language meaningless.

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    As Your Honors indicated before, this is an independent common-law action. 
    We do not seek review of the action by the court. 
    Our position briefly is this that the case is taken to the Board, regardless of what its award is, a discharged railroad employee nevertheless has right to go into a Federal District Court or a state court and invoke his common-law remedy.

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    That's --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1606.622" stopTime="1607.398">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That's your position.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1607.398" stopTime="1702.746">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    That's our first position. 
    Our second position is assuming that finality would occur or the election of remedies does in fact exist that certainly in the case where the Board has not determined the case upon the merits that then he still has the right to litigate in a common-law action. 
    I would like briefly to just allude to the facts. 
    I think that Union Pacific counsel has perhaps not made it clear as they should be from the standpoint of time. 
    In this case, Mr. Price was sent from Las Vegas to Nipton and this is about 56 miles and I believe 9:25 in the evening. 
    He called up about 10 -- 10:30 approximately 10:30 in the evening from Nipton, and said there was no place to eat. 
    I want to come back to Las Vegas to eat. 
    There's nothing in the record indicating that he would give his interpretation of any kind of a collective agreement at that particular time. 
    He was told not to come back and he came back to eat. 
    I would like at this point just very briefly, to read -- to quote Article 32 (b) of the collective agreement which provides “Swing brakemen will not be tied up nor released at points where sleeping and eating accommodations are not available.” 
    In my mind, I don't think there is anything there that is so difficult to be construed. 
    It seems to me to be clear. 
    I don't think there should be any question as to what that means either there are or there are not eating and sleeping facilities available at a place.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1702.746" stopTime="1707.698">

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Whittaker, they are.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1727.901" stopTime="1734.781">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    -- there were facts that were cited by Price itself in his claim.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1734.781" stopTime="1736.132">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Precisely.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1736.132" stopTime="1742.944">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    -- thus showing, actually, that he had been instructed to do one thing but did another.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1742.944" stopTime="1932.388">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    That, we will dispute, that is so. 
    But I just -- the point I wish to make clear was that when he came back to Las Vegas, he telephoned and said I have now eaten, do you want me to go back out there, an a certain train which train would have arrived at Nipton at 1:25 in the morning. 
    His job was to protect the train at 4 o'clock if that was necessary. 
    He was supposed to call in at 3:20 in the morning. 
    But the chronology with respect to the investigation is this. 
    This occurred on the morning of the 12. 
    At the time, the Brotherhood and the railroad were in controversy, because the railroad had just started to drop the swing brakeman about two weeks before, out here at Nipton in the desert. 
    As a result, the matter has been taken to the National Mediation Board. 
    And on the 15th of July, an agreement was entered into between the Railroad and the Brotherhood that the railroad would no longer put swing brakemen out here in Nipton. 
    They would use the old place they had, Chelsea which was a station nearby. 
    Now, on the morning of the 16th, the day following this agreement, Mr. Price gets a notice of hearing from the Assistant Superintendent here in Las Vegas saying that's going to be you're suspended. 
    There will be an investigation and hearing tomorrow on your insubordination. 
    He showed up the next morning and he said, “I don't have a witness. 
    My witness is here. 
    A railroad man and he had gone out.” 
    And the notice of investigation which he received said, “You may present witnesses at your own expense.” 
    In other words, you'd have to pay the man. 
    He was granted a continuance until the following day when he appeared and asked for another extension because the representative that he wanted to have is Brotherhood Chairman was -- had been sent out by the railroad the night before. 
    The same Assistant Superintendent said, “You'll be here this afternoon at 2 o'clock and you get another representative at 2 o'clock.” 
    Mr. Price wasn't there. 
    A hearing was held by the assistant representative, no transcript of any kind. 
    All we have is a series of questions and answers guided by the Assistant Clerk and the Assistant Superintendent -- to the clerk the Assistant Superintendent does all records that went up later on to the Adjustment Board. 
    As a matter of fact the -- this little transcript indicates that after these witnesses at least apparently were heard and apparently subsequently reduced in writing some form of these questions and answers, the same Assistant Superintendent said being there know what -- this is here for Mr. Price, no evidence and the investigation is closed. 
    That is the sum total of the hearing which ultimately here appears to have so far deprived Mr. Price valuable contract rights which he has under the collective agreement. 
    Now, I'd like to get back to our first contention namely that here, a person, regardless of whether or not the case has gone to the Board or even if the Board has held adversely to him on the merits, he has the right to go into a suit -- a court and litigate on the basis of a common-law action. 
    The key case --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1932.388" stopTime="1940.643">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Before you go into cases, is your theory that in the second sentence of this case, there really was no proceeding for the Board.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1940.643" stopTime="1944.481">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    No, there was a proceeding but no determination upon the merits.

    Well, that's --
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1945.781" stopTime="1949.128">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    That there was a complete misconstruction of his submission. 
    They did not answer the --

    Second -- second yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1953.688" stopTime="1961.657">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You start out by saying that there's no doubt about it. 
    This is an independent (Inaudible) Moore proceeding, is that right?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1961.657" stopTime="1963.384">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Exactly.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1963.384" stopTime="1969.684">

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1970.443" stopTime="1983.007">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And therefore I ask you whether you claim that in fact there was no legally significant proceeding before the Board and therefore you emphasize Moore's position. 
    Is that your position?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="1983.007" stopTime="1996.849">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    No. 
    Well, I say our position is not as good as Moore because of the fact at least from the standpoint of our first point. 
    Moore did not go to the Board. 
    In my first point, we assume that our men went to the Board and they held and they term it against it.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1996.849" stopTime="2042.711">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, don't you really go this far Mr. Lionel, I thought I understood this from your answer to me earlier. 
    You're in effect saying that he was privileged to litigate before the Board the merits of this discharge based upon his insistence that he was improperly discharged and was still an employee and he could have the fullest hearing on the facts in that regard and if decided adversely to him, he then was free to maintain the action that is now brought for wages, putting again an issue in this independent floor action, the legitimacy of this discharge. 
    Is that right?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2042.711" stopTime="2068.543">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Except for one thing, Mr. Justice Brennan and that is there could not have been any possible opportunity for a full litigation of the facts in that priority case because under the procedure before the Board, they apparently just had the transcript up there and this particular case -- there was no oral argument of any kind. 
    It was just a submission made by the Brotherhood in his behalf which is contained in the record.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2068.543" stopTime="2070.489">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2095.539" stopTime="2113.742">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    That's my first position. 
    As a matter of fact, that was one of the points which was raised in the Elgin-Burley case here and the Court reserved decision finding unnecessary to answer it because they remand it for the purpose of determining whether the Brotherhood was properly authorized by the individuals involved. 
    Now, in the Moore case --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2113.742" stopTime="2130.905">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I'd like to know why -- the why of your answer to Justice Brennan. 
    Is it -- does that mean -- he couldn't get the relief he asked and he can then go to court and get the relief he want, is that it?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2130.905" stopTime="2140.472">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    In substance, I am saying that the relief -- the administrative remedy granted by the Act does not preclude a subsequent court action.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2140.472" stopTime="2146.537">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And this has nothing to do with the fact that he didn't get the kind of a hearing you should have done and --
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2146.537" stopTime="2154.828">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Well, that is one of the reasons we -- I -- it's my view that he should not be deprived of this common-law remedy because -- I'm sorry --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2154.828" stopTime="2167.763">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But not -- not the terms of the circumstances in this particular case. 
    We're not resting on the particular circumstances of what happened at the Board that gives him at least a common-law action.

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    No, not on my first point.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2169.665" stopTime="2179.417">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's not on your first point, you stick to that for a moment but you say because those are the kind of things that happened before the Board. 
    That's one reason why the statute is to be so construed.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2179.417" stopTime="2181.013">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Precisely.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2181.013" stopTime="2205.621">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, Mr. Lionel, you say, the search for an administrative remedy does not preclude an action of law. 
    What if -- what if he had been awarded reinstatement and back pay by the Board, could he then have brought this action of law for damages for a wrongful discharge?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2205.621" stopTime="2206.941">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    I would say --

    I say yes.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2216.074" stopTime="2228.827">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So even if he had succeeded in this administrative remedy and the admin -- and the administrative body, the Board had given him all that it could give and all that he asked. 
    He could still bring this independent and independent suit of law growing out of the same discharge.

    Possibly follow. 
    But of course we must not overlook this fact but -- that if he won before the Board and they had ordered reinstatement and back pay, where would he be if the Railroad said, “We still don't want to give it to you.” 
    He would have to bring in an enforcement suit and in that enforcement suit, the findings of the Board would be merely prima facie evidence and there would be a trial de novo. 
    Now, I can't believe that it was the intention of the Congress in enacting 1934 amendments to place an employee in that particular position. 
    And I think the purpose of the words final and binding were not intended to preclude this. 
    I think they intended to cover a situation more like that in the Chicago-Trainmen case.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I suggest that giving prima facie way to defining the Board, it's inconsistent when saying there's a trial de novo. 
    As I understand, trial de novo means begin all over again. 
    You don't begin all over again if you begin with low desire -- against it.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2344.139" stopTime="2349.144">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Well, it's the old question of what is -- how much -- how loaded is your presumption or findings.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2349.144" stopTime="2352.503">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- (Voice Overlap) all I'm saying is that it isn't de novo.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2352.503" stopTime="2482.597">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    We have a case here, the Dober case in the Third Circuit which I quote in my brief here where employees sought seniority rights under their collective agreement. 
    They went before the Board and the Board held they were entitled to this collective -- to these seniority rights under this collective agreement. 
    The Board refused to go along with it. 
    They brought an enforcement suit and the -- a motion was made to dismiss on the ground that the Board was wrong in saying they were entitled to these seniority rights. 
    There -- there the employee said final and binding. 
    This time they want to use it and the courts didn't know. 
    This is not final and binding and dismissed the complaint in the enforcement suit even with the -- no matter how loaded they may have been by raising those prima facie findings. 
    But the Board there -- in the (Inaudible) case of the Third Circuit said, this -- it was not final and binding on the same provision of law. 
    Now, in the Moore case and that was actually a case which was an exhausted case. 
    In that case, there, the Railroad claim that the employee having failed to go before the Board, he could not come in under the common-law action. 
    The Board said, “No, we did not. 
    The exhaustion of the administrative remedy going to the Board is not a prerequisite to filing a common-law action," but this Court used this language. 
    We find nothing in that act which purports to take away from the courts the jurisdiction to determine the controversy over a wrongful discharge or to make that administrative finding a prerequisite to filing a suit in Court. 
    So this Court is saying, “We see nothing." 
    Nothing at all in the Railway Labor Act to take away the jurisdiction of courts to determine a wrongful discharge case, and that I think is in effect what the Union Pacific Railroad is contending here. 
    They are saying that this District Court has no jurisdiction because this particular finality provision in the Railway Labor Act says it's final and binding. 
    This Court apparently did not think so in the Moore case. 
    I can see the question was not presented but I think the language is clear and in the Slocum case --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2482.597" stopTime="2504.232">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is there no difference in your mind between starting a proceeding and having action by the Board -- and not starting a proceeding and having action before the Board -- was it a saying, can you take or block out a sentence like that in a situation in which you didn't have in which there was a vital difference and if there is between your case in that field?
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="2504.232" stopTime="2538.345">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    But I -- I think in this Moore case, there was a -- a very close examination made of the legislative intent. 
    As a matter of fact, the Government was asked to file a brief amicus -- an amicus brief which it did. 
    And on page 40 of that brief, it concluded that we think it's clear that Congress did not intend the machinery established in the Railway Labor Act to deprive any individual or group of all means of protecting the rights granted on the collective labor agreements. 
    Now, I think here was a right which he had.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2538.345" stopTime="2593.439">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That was where -- where a common-law right was invoked and not where the machinery of the Board was taught to be utilized and (Inaudible). 
    The whole point of the Railway Labor Board -- the whole -- the essence of that legislation is to hold cases that would never get into court. 
    That's before (Inaudible) putting the message and asking Congress to -- to enact of that which the two powerful organizations can agree upon. 
    And the hope was through the -- in turn of administration in the first place, things will be settled within this system and second, if they're not settled within the system, it will be settled by the machinery of the two parties to give them administrative machinery. 
    And it was expected, there -- there would be no resort to court because the experience with the court is eventually a railroad dispute and it was not like a policeman (Inaudible)

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Well, that I have -- I -- I incur Mr. Justice Frankfurter with that, but I think here is a case we are talking only about an individual. 
    The prime purpose of these amendments as pointed out by Mr. Justice Warren in Chicago-Trainmen case was to have this compulsory arbitration so that there would be no strikes. 
    But I think with respect to an individual here that there was no intent in the Railway Labor Act to take away his common-law rights and that I feel is what this Court said in the Moore case in which it annunciated once again in the Slocum case in 1950.

    -- the power from the courts. 
    And now the contention is that the court is without jurisdiction because of what the Railway Labor Act says. 
    Now, it's also contended here that there is an election that went up before the Board, that he elected to go that route. 
    There is nothing in the Act would say so. 
    And here they cite cases which come under Section 9 of the Interstate Commerce course -- Act which specifically provides that you have an election to either go before the Interstate Commerce Commission or go into courts for a violation under the Act and it's --

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Well, apparently Congress felt it necessary in that case and that was enacted long before the 1934 amendments came into being but -- and I certainly, in Mr. Justice Black's language in that United States versus the Interstate Commerce Commission, I think it -- this Court there indicated that the administrative finality of a decision by the Board was out of harmony with the general legislative pattern.

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    Right. 
    I might say that there have been several occasions where reference has made with -- as to what the legislative intent was. 
    And with respect to the 1934 amendments of the Railway Labor Act, in the Slocum case here in 1950, Mr. Justice Reed, in that case there, this Court said that the Moore holding, namely, that you can go into a -- litigate in a court the wrongful discharge case that that did not apply if it was a matter within the exclusive primary jurisdiction of the Board. 
    In this particular case, it was a matter involving interpretation of collective bargaining agreements as to I believe who was entitled to a particular work.

    Anything in the Constitution that prevents Congress from establishing a separate system of dealing with controversies between railroads and their employees and saying that the machinery doing that can be deemed final and say, fine, there is no merit to the course and nothing have rest there. 
    Is there anything of the Constitution of United States prevents that and saying that if you get a money award and then you go through your usual business of enforcing it and then you go to court. 
    Is there anything in the Constitution of the United States prevents the scheme from being formulated, legalized by Congress?

    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel

    Is there anything -- is there anything in this Act that requires any constitutional interpretation as to what is said when it said that suits can be filed as others.

    No.

    When he's denied an award.
speaker="samuel_s_lionel" startTime="3407.962" stopTime="3427.915">
    Mr. Samuel S. Lionel 
    The I.C.C. specifically says he cannot commit and file a suit. 
    There is nothing in here and there is nothing in the legislative intent which would fairly indicate that it was intended to preclude them and I think in the Moore case, we say there is -- this Court said there is nothing in the Act to preclude them.

    Mr. Wilcox.

    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    The Railway Labor Act does not require nor even permit explicitly that findings shall be made in any award. 
    Findings are not even mentioned. 
    The intention of Congress is that these disputes shall be referred to a board and they shall be decided by the Board by the making of an award. 
    Now, in an enforcement action, if such an action is brought and if there are finding, they will then be prima facie as well as the award of what the expense.

    Do they -- do the findings of the Board -- let's -- in this case, if there had been an award of -- for the employee of $50,000 by the Board and the railroad didn't pay and they brought an enforcement proceeding under the statute, might he recover in that enforcement proceeding $118,000?

    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Well, I have to answer your question this way, Your Honor. 
    That is not the way -- the -- the Board does not award specific money damages if they claim for reinstatement with back pay. 
    If it is sustained, we go back and check the record. 
    As a matter of fact, in Mr. Price's case, we would probably take the next junior man take his earnings and those will be the earnings that Mr. Price would be given. 
    The award of the Board is nearly on sustaining or a denial award and these discharge cases are always framed on the basis of claim for reinstatement with that --

    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Well, the judgment is within an enforcement proceeding, the -- the ultimate amount of money would be the amount that is shown from the records of the carrier, I assume that would be lost.
