    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    With the Court's permission, I should like to take up, in the remaining time that I have at my disposal, the constitutional questions, both those relating to in camera inspection and those relating to the Sixth and Fifth Amendments. 
    And, I should also like to spend a little while, if I may, on the question of harmless error as it relates to this particular case. 
    First, on the subject of in camera inspection, there are three aspects of that problem that may arise in -- in a trial. 
    The first is that you may have a statement which is admittedly an authenticated statement which admittedly, at least in part, touches upon the testimony of the witness but contains, in the view of the Government, irrelevant material. 
    Now, Congress has provided in subsection (c) of 18 U.S.C. 3500 that, in those circumstances, the judge is to excise the irrelevant materials, preserving them for the benefit of the appellate court. 
    Now, there are two other types of situations in which a similar comparable problem may arise. 
    The Government may say “We don't have any statement of the witness which is producible under the statute at all, such as in this case and the next case.” 
    And, the third type of situation is the Government may say “Yes, we have a statement of the witness signed, but it has nothing to do with this case at all and it has no relationship. 
    It doesn't touch upon the testimony of the witness at this trial.” 
    Now, in each of those three situations, we think that the -- a proper procedure is for the judge to make an in camera inspection to determine whether the statement is producible and, if it is producible, whether certain portions of it should be excised.

    But you would not restrict the judge -- the trial judge to the examination of the document if his examination reasons, as a matter of expression and understanding to say “I can't tell from the argument if we could do this and I want to ask some questions.”
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="152.905" stopTime="153.864">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    I'm just coming right to that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="153.864" stopTime="154.249">

    All right.

    -- to that point --

    All right.
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="155.048" stopTime="221.068">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    -- Mr. Justice. 
    The first thing I want to say is that I think that, in many instances, you can tell from an examination on a face of a document that it is not producible. 
    For instance, as will appear, I believe, in the next case, if it appears that the interview with the potential or perspective witness took three hours and the document has 55 lines in it, you would think that it would not be a substantially verbatim recital of what went on at that interview. 
    Or, if the document, on its face, contains statements by the agent that the potential witness was evasive or lying or -- or didn't know what he was talking about, you would know that that was not within the terms of the statute. 
    Or, similarly, if the document contained a material that didn't come out of the mouth of the witness at all, material that clearly and obviously came from some other person, a third person, but someone else told the agent about the witness or what someone -- what the agent learned about the matters in controversy from some third person, you would know that that was not a statement of the witness.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, now, Mr. Davis, you said if that -- something appeared that the witness had been evasive or lying or such --
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="228.429" stopTime="229.540">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    A statement by the agent.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="229.540" stopTime="260.519">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    A statement by the agent, I see. 
    Well, suppose, in this very case, there had been a statement by the agent, “I talked with Carlin. 
    Carlin denied having any knowledge whatever of this business.” 
    That's all that the statement says. 
    And then, Carlin testifies as Carlin testified at the trial. 
    Would that statement be producible under the statute?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="260.519" stopTime="299.489">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    No, sir. 
    I do -- I don't think that that statement would be producible because it is not a substantially verbatim recording of what the witness said, unless the judge, on inquiry, and that's the next point I'm coming to, in the normal case, the agent -- the witness is on the stand. 
    Carlin is on the stand. 
    The defense attorney can question Carlin, “Did you give a statement? 
    Did you give a written statement? 
    Did you see one that was written up by the agent? 
    What did you tell the agent? 
    Was the agent taking notes? 
    Was there a shorthand reporter there? 
    Was there a recording machine?” 
    In the ordinary case, that's -- that type of questioning is available to the defense counsel.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="299.489" stopTime="325.012">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, suppose the examination of Carlin was “Did you have an interview with any government agent?” 
    “Yes, I did.” 
    “What did you say at that interview?” 
    “I don't remember.” 
    And, the statement is the one that I have suggested to you that, in the interview, what Carlin said to the agent was “I don't know a thing about this business, never heard of it, and had no connection with it whatever.”

    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    If it were not a substantially verbatim recital, yes.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="336.996" stopTime="345.459">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, what's in my mind of course is, and perfectly obviously, that would be an extraordinarily helpful statement to the defense in cross-examination of Carlin, wouldn't it?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="345.459" stopTime="377.266">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Yes, but there are ways that that can be handled, we think, without -- outside of the statute. 
    First place, you can cross-examine Carlin as to what he said. 
    Second place, it's always possible to call the agent to the stand if there's suspicion foundation laid for that. 
    If you have -- you can say to the judge “this is an important issue not collateral to the case, but it's very important. 
    It's central to this case. 
    I would like to call the agent to the stand to see what Carlin did say to the agent, from the agent's recollection.”

    Well, maybe even under the statute, that the agent's own -- see, it will no longer be an unauthenticated document. 
    It will be the agent's own document, so that it will be attributable to the agent, and I think that that would be producible probably under the statute.

    Did Congress, in your judgment, provide that evidence which is relevant to the defense on question of the relevance can be denied that the defense and go on with his trial on the basis that it would be bad for the Government interest to supply this relevant, very important testimony?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="445.879" stopTime="456.089">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    The short of my answer, Mr. Justice, is that Congress has not, in our view, denied the production to the defense of unquestionably relevant material.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="456.089" stopTime="482.414">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose this -- suppose this piece of paper which has not been seen by the counsel, saying the statement by the officer that “this witness told me he hated this man, had been an enemy of his for a long time, and then he proceeded to talk but I have not set out substantially what he said.” 
    Would that be admissible?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="482.414" stopTime="497.561">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    The paper itself would not be because it's merely the statement by the interviewer, the agent, of what he recalled of what the witness said.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, let me give you another hypothetical. 
    Now, suppose you were -- had a prosecution for the murder of a federal officer and the witness takes the stand and he says that he attended a meeting at which the defendant and others were present. 
    And, at that meeting, the defendant said that he had shot and killed the federal officer, and he also says that he reported that to a government agent. 
    He signed nothing. 
    He never saw any memorandum of his report, and the reports are called for and the Government produces a report. 
    And, the report -- the memorandum, rather, of the report is that, yes, he'd been told by the witness that there was such a meeting and that, at that meeting, the defendant was present and there were others also present. 
    And, that the statement was made that someone had shot and killed the federal officer, but that the statement was made not by the defendant but by someone else at the meeting. 
    Would that report qualify him in the statute?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="676.324" stopTime="728.393">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    No, but it would certainly be the duty of the United States Attorney.I 
    f a witness on a stand denies having made a statement, a previous statement which was contradictory to the one that he makes on the stand, and the U.S. Attorney knows that that's not true, to call it to the attention of the Court and of the defense counsel. 
    And the -- and the fact of the prior inconsistent statement is the important thing and, once that's been brought to the attention as it would, I think, in this case where it was -- where the witness made a statement on the stand which, to the knowledge of the United States Attorney at that moment, was not true whether because the witness forgot or was lying. 
    I think, then, it would be the duty of the United States Attorney. 
    And, I think that the statute can be appropriately administered in accordance with the spirit which Congress intended and, also, to advance the cause of criminal justice by appropriate --

    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Well, perhaps, we me -- we have a semantic difference, Mr. Justice Brenan, but I think the statute is exclusive, the statute properly interpreted, and I think the statute is exclusive. 
    What I was saying to you before is that the statute can be supplemented by statements by the Government, by oral statements by the Government, by the calling of the agents, and so forth, so that there is no need to find any inc -- any constitutional invalidity in the statute because the end of -- ends of criminal justice can be attained by these other methods, so.

    Suppose a -- an agent interviews a witness and he says “well, now, we'll talk about this or talk about that,” something that is not particularly connected with the case and maybe they'll talk for an hour or so, and then, he'd get down to business and he'll talk about two things in the case and he'll record, in the 55 lines that you were talking about, the vital things, but he puts on the top that “I talked to this man for an hour-and-a half and this does not purport to be a verbatim or a substantial report of our entire conversation.

    I beg your pardon?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="957.144" stopTime="1035.669">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    There are aides for the Court to make this determination. 
    In the first place, the defense counsel can question the witness. 
    “How long did you talk to the agent? 
    Was the entire discussion about this case or was it about some wholly extraneous matters? 
    Did you cover all what you've testified to on direct examination?” 
    That will be of great help to determine whether the agent's report is a complete -- summary or substantially verbatim or not. 
    Then, if the Court feels that, after having inspected the document itself and having heard the -- or the direct testimony of the witness and also the cross-examination as to what went on at the interview, if the Court then feels that it's necessary to have a voir dire, it is within the discretion of the Court to call the agent to see what the agent did after having, I should think, exhausted what can be done through the witness himself, that is, asking the witness what the agent did. 
    “Did he take shorthand notes? 
    Did he -- did he have a recording machine? 
    Was there a stenographer there?” 
    We certainly don't take the position that there is no -- that there is an exclusion on the part of the Courts of the power to hold a voir dire. 
    We think that's the unusual situation, a situation which will not arise very frequently but, certainly, it is not excluded.

    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1162.439" stopTime="1337.339">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That approaches the problem that arises in my mind that you haven't mentioned. 
    It may not rise to the constitutional level, but it's there. 
    Every trial lawyer recognizes, who has tried lawsuits, that you need information to cross-examine. 
    Here, the only person that will have the information is the judge. 
    The other man cannot look to see whether there are probably conclusions to be reached different to the conclusion that the judge might reach. 
    History, unfortunately, records the fact that, sometimes, judges might be wrong for one reason or another and the defendant might not have the slightest knowledge of what is in that paper. 
    It might be on the borderline. 
    The judge might think it's not and yet they're -- you have to have them. 
    The -- the lawyer needs -- I'm saying this may not arrive to a constitutional level, but I'm talking about in practice. 
    When you try a civil case or a criminal case, the rule with which I've always been familiar with is, if the judge doesn't take your papers and look at it secretly, would that -- and deny to whichever counsel needs the information the right to look at it, to present his views and his arguments, but it -- both look at it. 
    Here, Congress has adopted a rule which forbids anyone but the judge to look at it, unless it would be the prosecuting attorney in some instances. 
    The lawyer for the defendant cannot see it. 
    It may be that the judge looks it and has a very guilty man and so forth, and the case is strong. 
    He reaches the conclusion that “after all, we can't waste time letting counsel look at this. 
    It won't do the man any harm.” 
    Is there anything in your judgment to the idea of passing the evidence? 
    When you permit the judge in his discretion in camera to look, he and the prosecuting attorney knows what's in it and you do not let the defendant have any look on it at all, how can you say that the defendant can be protected by his asking the proper questions to the witnesses, so as to bring out the facts that would make this admissible? 
    How -- how does that give him the be -- full benefit of having witnesses in his behalf, confronted by him, with his chance to cross-examine them with knowledge a lawyer would have to have in order to cross-examine?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="1337.339" stopTime="1345.690">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Mr. Justice, Congress adopted this view after consideration and the problem with an in camera inspection was the -- was considered on the Floor of the Senate.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1345.690" stopTime="1346.906">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

    It --

    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Yes, it -- it adopted it because he felt that there was no other solution possible. 
    If you allow the defense counsel to inspect all these documents, then you would have frustrated the whole purpose of the legislation, that is, they would see that which they're not suppose to see if it turned out that the document was not the kind they were suppose to see. 
    And, if the defense counsel made a very large and sweeping demand, they would have inspection of large and sweeping areas of documents which Congress thought they should not get to see.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1379.400" stopTime="1392.763">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, you agree, do you not, that there are some things that a defendant has a right to see and some witnesses he has a right to have, under the constitution, whether Congress wants him to have it or not?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="1392.763" stopTime="1393.724">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    Yes, but I think that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1393.724" stopTime="1397.890">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So, you are getting here into the area of whether this is one of those instances.
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="1397.890" stopTime="1474.154">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    I -- and our position, of course, is that Congress had the right to say that the defense should not see the kind of non-producible documents which were spelled out in the statute as non-producible. 
    Now, if you had this situation in which, if the defendant sees it all, you have frustrated the purpose of the statute, you have only two solutions, either to say that it's wholly in the hands of the prosecutor,, that he will determine what's to be made available or that the judge will look at it. 
    And, if I might read just one sentence from an opinion of Judge Learned Hand in which he dealt with a comparable situation, he said “there is no way in which this conflict,” that is, the conflict between the right of the Government to retain certain things from the defendant and the right of the defendant to see other types of producible documents where you have a controversy as to whether it's a producible document, there is no way in which this conflict can be resolved except by making the judge's private inspection final, subject to review. 
    And, of course, you have appellate review here that these documents must be sealed and sent up to the higher courts, including this Court, subject to review. 
    And, while it is true that this deprives the party who is denied inspection of any opportunity to dispute the judge's conclusion, that is unavoidable.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Three of the cops -- I think, when you said that -- when you agreed that there are certain things that -- certain relevant evidence that Congress can deny to the defense, I don't think that's quite the issue. 
    The issue isn't whether Congress may deny certain evidence relevant to a fair trial. 
    The question that this statute raises is whether Congress may determine the means by determining --
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="1501.987" stopTime="1502.142">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    I --

    I hold --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1503.406" stopTime="1504.698">

    These are very different things.
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="1504.698" stopTime="1507.460">

    I think that is -- that is what we are now talking about.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1507.460" stopTime="1542.535">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But it is different, as all court proceedings differ. 
    The constitution sets out a large number of things that Congress can't do, and even that courts cannot do. 
    It tells the courts that they must try people in certain ways to accuse a crime. 
    So that, it's not enough, is it, to say that Congress can determine which instrument will be used, finally and secretly, to say whether or not a defendant's rights have been accorded with?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="1542.535" stopTime="1561.989">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    But if you assume, as you -- I think you must assume, that in -- that some of these documents may not properly be producible and, therefore, are not relevant and should not be seen by the defense, then there must be some mechanism for determining that issues which does not give the defense the very thing which Congress has a right to see -- to say that they shall not see.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1561.989" stopTime="1565.241">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's an old argument. 
    It's made before the Bill of Rights, was it not?
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="1565.241" stopTime="1566.107">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    But it is --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1566.107" stopTime="1566.749">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    In many cases.
speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="1566.749" stopTime="1650.059">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    It is the -- it is what happens today in relation to subpoenas. 
    If a subpoena is issued and the Government or the party to whom the subpoena is issued comes in and says “I don't have these documents,” the defense counsel or the potential defendant doesn't rummage through the files of the other side to see whether there is something there, the Court determines whether the return is an accurate one as to whether there is a subpoena document of this kind. 
    In civil cases, we have trade secrets which are kept away from the other side, at the discretion of judge, under the rules adopt by this Court. 
    And then, there is the question of privileges. 
    If a doctor is on the stand and he is asked to discuss something that occurred during the course of treatment, he can claim the privilege of the doctor-patient relationship if -- unless it's waived by the patient. 
    Now, it doesn't make any difference that the defendant or the other side may say “I want to hear everything that you told him, Doctor, because I think there were certain things you told that had nothing to do his treatment whatsoever. 
    So, therefore, I want to hear everything you did and told him with relation to his treatment because I want to figure out for myself whether what you did related to his treatment,” and that relates to the other types of privileges, too. 
    And so, we think that this provision that Congress adopted is not without precedent in our law, going all the way back --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Davis, this gets to the fact to allude the discussion you and I had yesterday. 
    As I understand the statute, as I read it, the prohibition against showing the other side anything deals only with those papers which the Government hands up and says “this includes something relevant in the sense that it bears and touches upon the witness' testimony, but it also includes other irrelevant material.”

    But, in the area we're now discussing that is involved in this case, as I understand it, that is, whether not a report is a substantially verbatim recital, certainly, the Congress did not expressly provide a like procedure --

    I should try to make it clear to the Court, because I don't think I have, that, after Carlin's interview with the witness, there were open -- I mean, with the agents, there were open-Senate hearings at which Carlin appeared and testified, as did many of the other witnesses in this case. 
    Those open-Senate hearings were available to the defendant in these cases and were used on cross-examination of Carlin and of other witnesses. 
    So, they were not wholly without means of testing his credibility at the trial.

speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="2075.212" stopTime="2190.635">
    Mr. Oscar H. Davis 
    One is that, as to Rubin, there was overwhelming evidence of guilt by many witnesses, not only -- Carlin was a very secondary witness with relation to Rubin. 
    All of Carlin's testimony -- incriminating testimony was corroborated by other witnesses in the case, either Levi or the bookkeeper or other people, so that, there was nothing that Carlin said which stood on Carlin's testimony alone. 
    And, all -- in fact, the testimony of Carlin was, in part, corroborated by the defendant Rubin himself and by another defendant, Ades, who did take the stand. 
    Now, that's the summary with relation to Rubin. 
    As to Wool, I would say that Carlin did not implicate him at all. 
    He did not even come into the conspiracy admittedly until a period after Carlin had left the Office of the Bonita Company. 
    And, the only last thing I would like to say as to the argument that the counsel were deterred from asking for statements from other witnesses by the ruling of Judge Kaufman, two things, if I might. 
    Judge Kaufman said that, under a very slight suggestion of inconsistency, under the then-prevailing Second Circuit rule, he would order the production of the document. 
    They never made an effort to show with respect to any other witnesses, except one, as to whether there were prior inconsistent statements. 
    As to Porreca, one of the Prosecution witnesses, they got him to admit that he had made a prior inconsistent statement and they did not ask for the statement, so that even clearly on the Second Circuit rule and under Judge Kaufman's ruling, that would have been producible, but they did not ask for a correct statement. 
    And, so, we think that there is really no basis for saying that Judge Kaufman's ruling as to Carlin permeated the trial in the sense that it deterred the petitioner's counsel from asking for statements with respect to other words. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

speaker="john_t_sullivan" startTime="2214.383" stopTime="2437.766">
    Mr. John T. Sullivan 
    If the Court please, in response to what Mr. Davis just said, Judge Kaufman ruled, not only that he wouldn't have the statement produced, he ruled that before he would even read the statement that I had to show it had inconsistency. 
    And, of course, his ruling was so absolutely clear-cut that I couldn't possibly insult the Court further by pressing the objection over and over. 
    Now, if the Court please, yesterday, of course, I tried to, rather laboriously, go through the facts to meet the contention of Mr. Davis that this is overwhelming. 
    I dispute that with every fiber of my makeup. 
    This was a clear-cut case of credibility of a few key witnesses. 
    That's all the case amounted to. 
    The decision of the c -- the decision of the jury held that Pollock was acquitted. 
    Pollock was acquitted, although Levi had positively identified him as receiving the money. 
    Therefore, the jury didn't believe Pollock, but the jury did believe Carlin. 
    Carlin was a very important witness, and I say to this Court that, if the record was read a thousand times, there never could be any overwhelming interpretation placed upon it. 
    Now, if the -- If Your Honor please, I wish also to address myself to the question of relevance. 
    In the question of relevance, it is my understanding that I do not have to prove when I ask for the production of a statement that I have to show competence, that I have to show that it's admissible in evidence, that I have to show that it doesn't violate the hearsay rule. 
    I'm seeking these -- these papers merely to use them to impeach the credibility. 
    They may furnish me one little portion of a jigsaw puzzle which will really bring the truth out in the criminal case. 
    Why should I have to be dependent upon that charity of the United States Attorney, upon his honor and his integrity? 
    And, I must say, I never met one who didn't have those qualities, but why must we be faced with such a thing, that we who defend people in the courts that we have to be dependent upon the United States Attorney, and even upon the bench, that we may not see a document to save a man from the destruction of his life? 
    If the Court please, I must say that, after listening to the argument of Mr. Davis, I can only conclude that the -- he has many different sides to his argument. 
    His -- he says that, on account of the confusion of the Jencks Rule with the law of courts, that that's why they had to pass a new statute. 
    He says that, because the -- because they wanted to be sure to codify the statute, he actually -- he actually argues in his brief, in my opinion as I read it, that so enamored was the Department of Justice and the courts or, rather, the Congress with the Jencks decision that they decided to codify it, to give a stat -- so that subsequent changes in the personnel in this Court wouldn't affect this -- the wonderful rationale of that. 
    I submit to Your Honor that that is sheer hypocrisy. 
    I say that the -- what they wanted to do was overrule and get him off the books. 
    That's the purpose and, I say, that this statute which is passed in such a hurry, which was rushed through the Congress, your congressional history is worthless, worthless to determined the real truth. 
    And, the real truth is that it was directed strictly against us and I say, in conclusion, that it is my opinion that this statute and the application of this statute, in this case, constitutes a direct unconstitutional violation of Amendment Five and Six of the constitution. 
    I thank you for your attention. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Anthony Bradley Eben
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2437.766" stopTime="2439.009">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Eben.
speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="2439.009" stopTime="2590.038">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    May it please the Court. 
    I would, first, like to reply to Mr. Justice Brennan's question put to my brother Davis here. 
    In order to make the record, I went to the Clerk's Office this morning and inquired for the sealed envelope and asked to examine its contents. 
    I was not shown the -- the envelope. 
    We do not yet know what was in it. 
    Yesterday, during the course of the Government's argument and also during my own, my antenna, more or less, picked up a message from a segment of the Court that, conceivably, here, there may be some error but that it does not apply to the petitioner Lev because he had filed no objection in the first place and his then-attorney had not developed the demand for production as made by Mr. Sullivan. 
    And, if such a view exists, I would like to say that the Rubin -- rather, the Carlin testimony became very admissible against Mr. Lev. 
    Therefore, any impeachment of it would have been of great help to Mr. Lev in possibly obtaining an acquittal. 
    The reason that it was admitted, the reason that the evidence was admissible against Lev, was because, although there may have been two conspiracies described by the Government as the Bonita conspiracy and the White Hat conspiracy and that Lev was involved only in the White Hat conspiracy and was insulated from the Bonita conspiracy by the obstructions of the Court that, therefore, the Carlin testimony was not admissible against him. 
    I would point out, if that thought is in the minds of any member of the Court, that the instructions of the trial court were, and they were so determined by the Court of Appeals, that there was one continuous conspiracy as to all defendants expect Lev, and he thereupon instructed that the acts of declarations and omissions of any conspirator during the life of that conspiracy were admissible against any other person who, at anytime, entered into the conspiracy. 
    So, there can be no question in my mind but one, Lev was seriously harmed by the error, if any.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2590.038" stopTime="2602.245">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm not sure I understood you. 
    You just said that the judge's charge restricted testimony so as not to be applicable to Lev, or did I misunderstand you?
speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="2602.245" stopTime="2677.865">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    No, you understood me correctly. 
    The charge, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, was, in reality, a monstrosity. 
    It was impossible to understand. 
    It went through 96 pages of the typewritten record. 
    It -- in some places, it referred to two conspiracies then, in other places, to one conspiracy. 
    We raised the question of variance in our petition for certiorari and, unfortunately, from our standpoint, the Court did not grant certiorari on those questions. 
    But, finally, the jury came back, after having been out some-24 or 36 hours, and asked whether or not one conspiracy was related to the other, and the judge gave an entirely inclusive instruction on it that I, as a lawyer, have a great deal of difficulty to understand. 
    I don't understand it, I will say to the Court quite frankly. 
    But, in any event, from it, it became clearer and, from eight or nine other instructions, it became clear that Lev could be chargeable in the White Hat conspiracy with the acts of Rubin who was his co-conspirator concededly in the White Hat conspiracy, even if Lev was not in the Bonita conspiracy, and the Carlin testimony related directly to Rubin.

speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="2698.309" stopTime="2725.782">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    Yes, in this sense, that the Court told the jury that Lev was not involved in the Bonita conspiracy and was involved only in the White Hat conspiracy. 
    But, as I've just pointed out, so was Rubin involved in the White Hat conspiracy and, if the Carlin testimony was admissible against Rubin, as it concededly was, then Lev was stuck with it under the familiar rules governing the acts and declarations of conspirators.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2725.782" stopTime="2758.975">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    As you probably know, I have a good deal of sympathy with complaints against a dragnet character of conspiracy charges, but that isn't before us. 
    It was before the Court of Appeals, and what you are now suggesting is that the confusion attributable to two conspiracies which, in fact, might be interpretable as one would have made it difficult for the jury to segregate Carlin's testimony so as to allocate it in part to White Hat and in part to Bonita. 
    That's really what it gets down to, isn't that right?
speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="2758.975" stopTime="2789.358">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    Yes, the Court of Appeals said that and the trial court attempted to do that, but the Court of Appeals admitted that the error was in there. 
    They called it error, but they called it harmless error. 
    In my opinion, I think it was a most prejudicial type of error to permit the jury to consider, as it must under this Court's decision in the Paoli case, this great mass of evidence relative to bribery and corruption in the Bonita conspiracy against Lev. 
    I think a very unjust result --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And you ask us to -- you ask us to read the record that, in fact, there was only one conspiracy. 
    It was so blended that you couldn't segregate it when we specifically refused to take that question.
speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="2841.052" stopTime="2977.583">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    Oh, I'm not arguing that and I certainly, Your Honor, do not want to be understood as trying to inject it here. 
    It's only here and against the -- I only argue it to show that the Carlin -- the error as to Rubin goes over as to Lev. 
    I don't have a great deal of time left and I'd like to address myself, very briefly, to this question as to whether the statute is exclusive or not. 
    The Government, yesterday, expressed some surprise that we would even argue it and I am surprised that the Government's surprised since it's point one in our opening brief here. 
    And, we again deal with it in a reply brief. 
    The Government says, as I follow Mr. Davis' argument, that Senate Report 891 describes the procedure to be exclusive, and that's quite true, I've examined the report, but that report was handed into the Senate or handed up by the Subcommittee of the Senate long before there were any amendments to the suggested legislation. 
    And, when you examine the amendments, it becomes very clear and very obvious that Congress was saying and the Senate in its debates was saying that it was not to be exclusive. 
    I respectfully direct the Court's attention to the fact that when the Department of Justice sent up the bill, it intended it to be exclusive. 
    But, Senator O'Maley and some of his colleagues were able to detect that particular record by the Department of Justice, and there was an exchange of letters between the then-Acting Attorney General and Senator O'Maley. 
    And, Senator O'Maley then exposed, if I may use the expression, the desire on the part of the Department of Justice to do away with the Rules of Pre -- Federal Criminal Procedure of that particular point. 
    And, there is a discussion in -- by Professor Keith in the Catholic University Law Review, which I refer to in my brief, which goes into that extensively. 
    In any event, once the Senate was able to detect what the Department of Justice was up to at that particular time, it really amendment that first section and it knocked out the provision which, as I recall, was somewhat this language that there should -- that the statute governed no claim -- no rule of court or of criminal procedure to the contrary, notwithstanding, and that went out very fast for the Senate understands it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2977.583" stopTime="3002.031">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, isn't it a fact, though, in the event that the provision in the Rule -- in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to discovery is not co-extended or doesn't touch the same subject matter as the subject matter of this statute. 
    In other words, there's discovery as to all sorts of thing having nothing to do with laying the foundation for impeachment.
speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="3002.031" stopTime="3010.017">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    No, I would say that, under Rule 17 (c), under the prior case, I believe, you are entitled to documents such as we're discussing here.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm not saying that, under the Rule of -- that was the disputed controversies I remember reading contemporaneously. 
    That, today, is a great deal of confusion, if I may say so, in the minds of legislators as to what the rule of discovery was and they did not want this statute explicitly to impair the continuance of the rule regarding discovery.

speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="3033.617" stopTime="3066.448">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    Precisely, and I agree with Your Honor, which show then that they did not intend to interfere with the operation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure if they had the application, and they so wrote it in their subsequent amendment to put in the word “if,” and then, when the bill came out of conference, the House had bought completely the Department of Justice version. 
    When it came out of conference, they moved it back then to the Senate version and struck all reference to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or to the procedure as outlined in the subsequent paragraph (b).

speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="3097.353" stopTime="3394.904">
    Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben 
    That -- I would like to respond but I better pass onto something else, if I'm going to finish my argument. 
    I would like to call the Court's attention to what was decided in the case itself, and I dragged out the record in here this morning and it is very brief. 
    And, I would like to call the Court's attention to the examination of the witness Ford whose testimony, of course, was considered in Jenks, and this is precisely the testimony to which this Court referred. 
    Ford was asked “After you made your contact with the FBI, did you give them information concerning activities going on before you made contact with the FBI?” 
    Answer, “Yes, because that is what led me to the FBI.” 
    “And did you make those reports in writing?” 
    Answer, “Some of them in writing and some of them oral.” 
    Question, “When you gave oral reports, were they taken down by someone?” 
    “I think some notes were taken.I think some notes were taken.” 
    Question, “And after you gave the oral reports and the notes were taken, was something typed up for you to sign?” 
    “No.” 
    “Do you recall giving a written report to the FBI concerning the foundling convention of the progressive party in July of 1948?” 
    Question, “But your recollection is that you did not give such a report?” 
    Answer, “My recollection is that I told the FBI exactly what went on at the convention and some other events preceding that.” 
    “And was that written down?” 
    “Did I write it?” 
    “First, did you write it then?” 
    “I don't recall.” 
    “You don't recall?” 
    “I don't recall that I wrote it down specifically, but I am pretty sure that I didn't.” 
    “Did someone write it down as you told it to them? 
    As you told it to them?” 
    “I think some notes were taken.” 
    “Isn't it a fact that you dictated something in the presence of a stenographer on that convention?” 
    “Weren't you asked questions and didn't you give answers which were taken down by a stenographer?” 
    “Your recollection about that is precise, is it? 
    You are sure that you did -- that you did not either dictate a statement or answer questions which were taken down by a shorthand reporter?” 
    Answer, “I am positive.” 
    Now, I submit, again, respectfully to the Court that this Court decided in Jenks that notes, just notes of what a witness said which, quite obviously, might not be a substantially verbatim statement as to what he said, was admissible. 
    I say that, in my opinion, the Court was holding that inadmissible documents are producible if relevant under the definition as given by the Court in Jenks. 
    Now, I have listened here to Brother Davis and I have read the congressional debates over and over again, and there are pious avowals by all of the legislators and by the Government here that nobody indented to touch Jenks by this legislation, that all that they wanted to do is to codify it. 
    Well, if what the Government is contending for here is so, they certainly went way past any codification. 
    In fact, they put Jenks right out of -- out of the business. 
    If this Court holds that the statute is exclusive and if this Court holds that it's constitutional, I, for the life of me, cannot see the objection by the Government to the production of any report of what a witness said. 
    There is no fishing expedition involved in this case. 
    The precise report was identified in the trial court. 
    And I do not see why the Government should not produce it. 
    In fact, outside of Jenks, it seems to me that Berger, a famous decision of this Court, requires, as to -- as to the Canons of Ethics that a prosecutor turned over to a defendant, any material which he may have, any evidence, if you will, which he may have which is helpful to the defendant. 
    And I think, really, that was the philosophy of this Court in handing down Jenks. 
    Finally, I would like to say that some remark was made here yesterday that -- as to the Lutwak case. 
    I appeared before the Court and argued that particular case and we lost it on a 5-3 decision. 
    And, I think Mr. Davis said that the majority opinion, applying the -- the language here, stated that the record shrieked of error. 
    And, I would like to point out, before I conclude, that Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Jackson dissented from the theory that the record did shriek of error. 
    And I say --

    It might have shrieked then you -- we might yet have dissented.
