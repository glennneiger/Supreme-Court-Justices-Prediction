    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Arnold, you may proceed.
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="2.487" stopTime="228.582">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    At the recess I was discussing the legal implications of the appeal on the Alaska property tax. 
    At Chapter 22, the Session Laws of 1953 commonly known as the repealing Act. 
    It is our view of course that under the general universal rules of statutory construction that the repealing Act having saved some taxes from the effect of repeal is to be construed as an intention on the part of the Legislature to save those taxes and none other upon the general ground that a specific exemption, exception or provision is controlling over a general provision expressed in other laws. 
    Of course under the common law as it existed even back to foundation of our own Constitution, the repeal of a taxing statute abrogated all taxes due and unpaid at that time of the repeal unless they were specifically saved or unless -- in other words, the repealing Act contained a specific provision to the contrary. 
    This is the universal rule. 
    There's no authority to a contrary. 
    None is cited by the territory. 
    I do not think that they challenge the rule. 
    They simply seek to avoid its application. 
    Now, many states -- United States, Territory of Alaska, all have general laws dealing with this subject. 
    Alaska had a General Savings Act which is quoted in the briefs of counsel which saves -- provides at a no obligation founded on the statute or obligation incurred, tax or license to be due. 
    It provides -- cuts the fees and licenses due may be enforced after repeal unless the repealing Act provides to the contrary. 
    And of course it's our position and supported I think amply that this repealing Act did provide to the contrary. 
    It was not the intention of the Legislature to save all taxes due under the Act nor was it their intention to abrogate all the taxes due under the Act. 
    They enacted a special section, Section 2 of the Act, specifically delineating the taxes they desired to save. 
    That provision is contrary or in conflict with the General Savings Act of Alaska. 
    And being specific, later in point at time, it must be held to control.

    Mr. Arnold, what -- what was the purpose of subsection (b) (Inaudible)
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="247.180" stopTime="264.856">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Because the exemption -- the -- in setting provisions of the Alaska Property Tax Act, it contained a provision authorizing the territorial tax commissioner and other officials of the territory to grant incentive exemptions --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="264.856" stopTime="265.517">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    To what?
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="265.517" stopTime="341.563">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Incentive exemptions for other creation of new industries, a territory at it came out of efforts to induce the development of Alaska's pulp and other -- other resources. 
    There was a provision in the law authorizing the issuance of exemption certificates, as an incentive to induce capital and those certificates. 
    And those exemption ran not only to the territorial taxes but to the municipal taxes and the public utility district taxes so that they -- the effort here by (b) was to provide that the exemption certificates in existence should continue in existence throughout the current year when the municipalities and public utility districts were levying taxes under this Section 2 (a). 
    It was to complete, it was an effort on the part of the Legislature successful one to leave that phase of the matter just as it was before.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="341.563" stopTime="353.082">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, again this time (b) really had a -- in fact, only for the current fact here whatever that might be, governed by (a)?
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="353.082" stopTime="383.664">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    It -- it so reads, Mr. Justice. 
    An exemption from taxes referred to in Section A above, it refers only to the exemptions to those taxes, (a) above are the taxes which have been levied and assessed by any municipality or which are levied and assessed during the current fiscal year. 
    Now of course the exemption had been in effect in prior years, they left it in effect just to priors years and continued it in effect as to the current year.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="383.664" stopTime="389.135">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But so far as (Inaudible)
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="389.135" stopTime="402.420">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    The taxes were not forgiven for prior years in -- in municipalities and school districts, in public utility districts. 
    They were expect -- expressly saved from the effect of the repeal. 
    None of them were forgiven.

    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Whittaker. 
    That is in my opinion is the effect. 
    It saved those taxes in municipalities, school districts, and it continued the incentive exemption after those taxes.

    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Well, taxes which have been levied in my -- in my view apply to taxes levied in municipalities, school districts and so forth during the year 1949 or 1950, 1951 and 1952.

    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    That's correct. 
    But Mr. Justice Whittaker, he sustains that argument by changing the tax to the Act and I -- I quote him, I think, correctly. 
    And his argument here a few minutes ago. 
    And I'm referring now, to Section 2 (a) which is on page 5 of the brief. 
    He says, “Now let's read this, to mean any taxes which are levied (Inaudible).” 
    Well it doesn't say that.

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Not only -- as I understand the Attorney General, (Inaudible) that situation and apply it. 
    Now applies in Section 2 (Inaudible) that Section 2 means that many tax that has been assessed by one of those (Inaudible) in the current year. 
    Or that maybe if that's -- after the passage (Inaudible) is that that should be authorized by this Section 2 (Inaudible) only to current years, its not safe transaction.

    Mr. W. C. Arnold

    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Yes. 
    And if -- I think that that's a strain upon the -- upon the wording the Act that it will not bear it as true, that municipalities and school districts have varying assessment periods and varying periods when the taxes are -- their taxes are due and payable. 
    It does not appear in the record. 
    I questioned very, very much whether any of those periods occur before March 12th in the year. 
    I call your attention to that -- that the journal entries that are set forth in this record and briefs of the parties show that this -- this legislation was -- was introduced in the early part of January. 
    That these amendments which were -- were adopted in February so that the period that the Attorney General speaks about is 40 or 45 days, 50 days in January and in the early part of February. 
    I -- I -- it's inconceivable to me that the Legislature could have had that brief period in mind. 
    As -- as Your Honors know, tax is --

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="797.577" stopTime="880.437">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Arnold, one of the things that bothers me and this is that -- on your Chapter 22, Session Laws of Alaska 1953, the original bill was entitled, "An Act to repeal Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska 1949 as amended by Chapter 88, Session Laws of Alaska 1949 and abrogating and repealing all accrued and unpaid taxes levied thereunder and declaring an emergency." 
    Then there were several changes made as it went through and the title ended up this way. 
    An Act to repeal the Alaska property tax Act enacted by Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska 1949 as amended by Chapter 88, Session Laws of Alaska excepting from repeal certain taxes and tax exemptions, and declaring an emergency. 
    Now, if -- if they intended to enact this law, according to your construction, why wouldn't they leave in there and abrogating and repealing all accrued and unpaid taxes levied thereunder except?
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="880.437" stopTime="909.354">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Because Mr. Chief Justice, had they done so, they would have deprived the municipalities and the public utility districts of a good measure of their revenue both current and past. 
    The municipalities would not have been able to enforce the collection of any taxes levied during the life of this Act that were not paid on the date of the repeal as they've gone ahead with that wording.
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="909.354" stopTime="915.757">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Nor would they have been able to levy or collect them for the current year, which the legislature desired them to do.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="915.757" stopTime="946.900">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well why would they not under specific language, which abrogated and repealed all accrued and unpaid tax levies except those that you had just mentioned? 
    Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that be just as a -- reasonable to do as to put the construction that you put upon this Act after the title has been changed because you get the same result that without it being in the -- in the title?
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="946.900" stopTime="970.316">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think they can done a better job in drawing this Act and title, I -- I agree with that, and if they had adopted the wording, the title that you used, abrogating and repealing all taxes except those specifically saying by Section 2 (a) why -- this controversy would not have arisen. 
    But they didn't do that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="970.316" stopTime="996.750">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No, they didn't but it show some significance to me when they started that way. 
    And in the original bill they spoke of abrogating and repealing all accrued and unpaid tax levies and then backed away from it and use something else. 
    It seems to me that that -- that would indicate they -- a change of mind on the part of the Legislature as to what they had intended to do when they -- when they filed the original bill.
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="996.750" stopTime="1024.714">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    There's no question but if there was a change of mind. 
    That they were bill, the authors of the bill proposed to abrogate all unpaid taxes and -- and they so state it. 
    The legislature didn't want to do that. 
    They wanted to save from that repeal, from the effect of the repeal, the taxes in the municipalities and public utilities and they changed the bill accordingly.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1024.714" stopTime="1039.584">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But my point -- my point is that as -- as the bill was finally enacted they don't specifically say either in the title or in the body of the Act that they abrogate or forgive any taxes.
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="1039.584" stopTime="1040.945">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold

    -- that -- that seems significant to me is they started out one way to do that and -- and that I -- I suppose was one of the things that -- that caused controversy over the bill.
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="1054.812" stopTime="1056.524">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold

    This bill --

    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    This bill, like all bills in the legislature introduced in committee and was considering, it was amended several times. 
    Some of the proposals, the title changes only are -- are carried in the legislative journals. 
    The tax to the bills and the amendments and the debate are not made a matter of record. 
    But it's the bill as finally enacted which is -- which we treat we are here today as this Court said and as the Circuit Court said. 
    This Court in Trailmobile Company versus Whirls, interpretation of statutes cannot safely be made the rest upon mute, intermediate, legislative maneuvers. 
    Now, I can't say -- I don't -- I'm not familiar with all the -- the forces, the changes of view and the conflicts of opinion which went into the enactment of this law in its final form. 
    But it is clear, from this record and from an inspection of the legislative Journals, that the bill as originally introduced did not suit the majority of will of the legislature. 
    They did not want to abrogate for all taxes. 
    They wanted to save some taxes. 
    They changed the bill accordingly and they changed the title accordingly. 
    And -- and we're here now in an effort to construe the effect of that repeal. 
    And since under the rules of statutory construction as we understand them and as the trial on appellate court understands them, having saved some taxes it must be intended, that they intended to save no others.

    But it was necessary if they desired to save for the remainder of 1953, the right to perfect the taxes by the utility district that they do what they did in Section 2 -- of Section 2 (a), was it not?

    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    They had to do in the latter part of it, all which are levied and assessed during the current fiscal year of such municipalities.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well yes, all right. 
    And they also wanted to make it sure, did they not, that as part as that -- that that didn't foreclose those taxes for that year. 
    They were treated differently, were they not, in both bills? 
    And the reason was that they wanted to leave it up to the utility districts and so forth.I believe the claim was made the case before that made the Act unconstitutional because it didn't apply uniformly.

    But as this came out and what the State and the Territory insist on would mean, as I understand it, that they're taxes for the entire Territory including the utility districts would be enforced and applied in precisely the same way if his argument is correct. 
    But if your argument is -- if your -- if they had not put this in, it would have been a matter toward forgiveness of any taxes where they have assessment had not been completed on March 12th, 1953.

    Because they -- if they expected the taxes that are already levied and assessed to be saved under the general repeal statute, there would be no use for them to repeat themselves over again and say, again, that any taxes which have been levied and assessed. 
    Because under the construction that the counsel contend for and under the -- Your Honor's statements as I understand it, they're duplicating, they would be duplicating the general repealing statute in that respect.

    And they saved them within municipalities having expressed their desire to save them there, under the rule of statutory construction it follows that they did not desire to save them anywhere else.

    I -- they have cited the general rules of statutory construction, the decisions of this Court, the rule established in the portal-to-portal cases. 
    The rule on repealing Act and Prohibition Act, one came from the Second Circuit and the other the Fourth, a long line of authorities in this Court supporting this type of construction. 
    Only recently, this Court through Mr. Justice Whittaker said, “However, inclusive may be the general language of a statute, it will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment. 
    Specific terms prevail over the general and the same or another statute, which otherwise might be controlling.”

    If the comma were placed after the word “assessed” in the next to the last line, then all preceding would relate to the phrase “during the current fiscal year”.

    I -- what it says because by -- by operation of the -- of the Alaska Code and -- and by the settled constructions in such cases, over constructions of such cases. 
    The Alaska general savings statute is to be read as though it were a part of this repeal. 
    It's to be read as a part of and that's what it says. 
    It says that this repeal shall not abrogate any taxes due on the repeal date. 
    But the legislature didn't want it that way. 
    So they said that some taxes should be saved but not all.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Can I ask you, Mr. Arnold, about one rule of construction invoked by the Attorney General? 
    You haven't discussed it and maybe you think it has no merit deserves. 
    He takes the position that the Act here precluded was actually construed would lead to an unconscionable result. 
    And many courts have said that if one construction leads to an unconscionable result, that you should try to find another -- you would try to find another. 
    Did you --

    What do you say about that?
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="2191.083" stopTime="2244.908">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    This Court followed it. 
    The Attorney General's conclusion in that -- in that respect it would overrule dozens of decisions of this Court and thousands of decisions of state courts and -- and under the common -- English common law. 
    That is the rule that when a taxing Act is repealed, no -- a liability exists to pay the taxes that have not been collected as of the date of the repeal. 
    Now, this is the unconscionable result which the Attorney General talks about because the repeal cuts off the unpaid taxes and does not refund the taxes of those who paid prior to the repeal. 
    It has been -- as a law of this country since the adoption of the Constitution came here from England. 
    I -- I --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2244.908" stopTime="2250.679">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You say that the rule he invokes doesn't apply here because the results cannot be unconscionable.
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="2250.679" stopTime="2306.658">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Well, if it -- if it's unconscionable then in the thousands of cases that had been decided in this country and many by this Court, that feature has been overlooked. 
    Now, taxes are not a contractual obligation. 
    They're purely involuntary. 
    Nobody has any duty to pay taxes except if that duty is imposed upon him by law. 
    And when that law is repealed, the duty to pay the taxes disappears. 
    And there's nothing unconscionable about that or it's never been so considered in our system of Government, and that's what occurred here. 
    Now, while this is not in the records, the Attorney General in his brief says that 8000 people paid taxes under this -- or 11,000 people paid taxes under this Act, 8000 people didn't. 
    Now -- as of the date of the repeal.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2306.658" stopTime="2308.439">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that correct?
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="2308.439" stopTime="2387.878">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Well, I -- I don't know but I -- I don't -- I don't think the Attorney General would say so if it weren't correct. 
    I don't have any -- any way of testing it but I assume that it is correct. 
    So that some people elected to pay the -- some people elected to pay these taxes while the tax commissioner was in -- under injunction from collecting them or enforcing their collection upon the ground of the problem, in the validity of the Act. 
    Others elected to pay due out to other stages of this litigation which existed in the entire life of the Act. 
    At some stages, the Territory refused to receive taxes that were proferred under Act because they said the matter was in litigation, they didn't want them. 
    Now, then the legislature repealed the law. 
    8000 people have paid 400 -- I guess, I get it twisted -- 11,000 people had paid $400,000.8000 people owed a $1,200,000. 
    Now, the -- the Attorney General's argument is it would be unconscionable for the legislature to pass such a law, and if they did pass such a law it would be the duty of this Court to strike it down.

    Yes, many of them.

    The same attack was made that this cutoff claims, some of which had been paid and some of which hadn't, that the -- that had reached this Court, certiorari was denied. 
    The constitutionality was attacked and the Act was declared valid by the Circuits. 
    Same result was reached in a -- in many state cases which we have cited, on the reference to on our brief, very exhaustive notes in the matter.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2470.435" stopTime="2513.789">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But here we have -- here we have a statute to levying a tax that has gone through to the Highest Court, and the Highest Court has determined it is valid. 
    And 8000 people or 11,000 people have paid that tax. 
    And then the legislature comes along, and according to your theory, relieves the rest of them from their obligation to pay those unquestionably valid taxes. 
    Do you have any -- any specific case in mind that under those circumstances holds that the legislature can do that without violating constitutional principles?
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="2513.789" stopTime="2666.779">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Yes, Mr. Justice, and they're cited in our brief but I would call your attention. 
    In fact, that the decision holding this Act to be valid, property tax to be invalid was handed down a year after the legislature repealed the law. 
    A year after the legislature repealed the law. 
    And a part -- and a very large part -- as you and I can see of this $400,000 that you paid was paid after the repeal by people who -- who for one reason or another, voluntarily or otherwise, continued to make the payments. 
    Now, we thought the tax is no longer in existence. 
    We advised our clients not to pay them. 
    Others took a different position. 
    For over a year or more, a year-and-a-half, court was enjoin -- the Court has enjoined the collection of these taxes, some people continued to pay them during that period. 
    That was their right. 
    But we don't think it prejudice, the position of those who -- who elected not to pay them until uplifting was finally determined. 
    I haven't said anything about this House Bill 3 and 5. 
    The Territory specified the refuser -- refusal of the trial court to receive these documents in evidence during an oral argument on a motion to dismiss as prejudicial error. 
    This case was never tried. 
    It never opened for the reception of evidence. 
    The motion to dismiss was granted upon the ground of no personal action would lie to collect these taxes and upon the further ground that the tax did not survive the repeal. 
    During the course of that argument the Territory attempted to introduce these documents as evidence and they were rejected. 
    That rejection was specified as error to the -- to the Circuit Court. 
    The Circuit Court held that it was not error and by inference, with which I agree, they said that the result would be the same in any event. 
    And that they would assume that the title of the bill is shown in the Journals, showed their purpose. 
    And after denying it was error they said that -- they went ahead to consider the bills arrived at the same conclusion. 
    I'm not able to tell from this record whether the Territory seeks to have this Court reverse upon the ground of error or to receive evidence --

    I don't think, however, the matter by a material. 
    I -- I think again about the same answer. 
    Now, I called attention of course the fact that these are personal actions. 
    The trial court held that no personal action would lie to collect the tax such as this that was leaning on the property, was a special provision for collection provided in the Act that the remedy was exclusive and that no personal liability existed.

    No. 
    But if there's the -- if there's a signature of the -- the Secretary of Alaska and the seal of the Territory, isn't that not -- to indicate that it's a document of the Senate?
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="3179.941" stopTime="3202.954">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Well Mr. Justice, I have never indicated at all and I thought it was a forgery or -- or spurious in any fashion. 
    But now, I don't -- if I seek to get the Secretary of Alaska to give me a copy of some document in his office and affix his seal, do I understand then that this Court could take judicial notice of that document?

    Why not?

    If it's a public document, why not.

    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Well I -- I -- I have -- I have never heard or I know of no recorded case where -- where the rule of judicial knowledge is -- has -- has extended that far. 
    This Court frequently refuses to recognize or -- or consider debates from the congressional record. 
    They are official documents, too.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It's not on the ground if we don't know about it or we can't consider it. 
    Sometimes the Court refuse to consider it as having anything to do with it to say, we won't vote, we don't need to go through it. 
    I don't recall --

    Well --

    -- why (Inaudible) -- turns out on the ground that we could judicially notice it.

    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    This Court has repeatedly held that in this type of -- of matter, Mr. Justice Black. 
    That -- and this is just -- I read this a while ago, just a sense, but there are several other decisions. 
    Interpretation of statutes cannot safely be made to rest upon mute, intermediate legislative maneuvers.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I --

    In other words that these questions are --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3264.757" stopTime="3289.991">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That doesn't touch the question here. 
    What you are reading on to some -- and then some cases it said, we will not consider the legislative history. 
    And I do not recall maybe -- maybe it has been done. 
    I do not recall this Court has ever held that you have to have evidence at all for the -- about the things that take place in the legislative body when you have the certificate of the official who keeps them.
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="3289.991" stopTime="3317.467">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    Well, I -- I wanted -- my time is up and I close only this way. 
    But I -- I certainly would not like to be understood as agreeing and I think this Court ought to accept and receive, and consider documents here which the lower court rejected. 
    Now, let's say the lower courts erroneously rejected them, then the case should be reversed upon that ground in my view.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3317.467" stopTime="3335.402">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think that would be harmless error if they had done that? 
    If it's error -- let's suppose it's error, do you mean to say that this -- that's so important in connection or whether this is a good record and whether we can consider it? 
    That this case ought to be reversed on that ground if it was wrong, not to let it come in?
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="3335.402" stopTime="3361.683">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    That question should be addressed to the Attorney General because he comes here asking that very thing. 
    He asks you to reverse these courts upon the ground of error committed below in that respect, we don't ask it. 
    We don't think it makes any difference. 
    We think that if you consider the bills, consider the titles, you considered everything. 
    We don't think it makes any difference at all. 
    The Circuit Court in their decisions that they wouldn't -- they would consider the bills because they were the same as the titles.

    Mr. Chief Justice, might I ask just one big question?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, of course.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3364.903" stopTime="3380.127">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Would you please tell me, is it agreed by counsel on both sides that this whole statute, Chapter 10, did not impose a personal liability but only leans upon physical properties?
speaker="w_c_arnold" startTime="3380.127" stopTime="3398.633">
    Mr. W. C. Arnold 
    I think the answer to that is no, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    That is our position and that was the position of the trial court below. 
    I -- it's my understanding that the -- the Attorney General argued below -- he did argue below and it's my understanding that he maintains the position yet that there is a personal liability.
