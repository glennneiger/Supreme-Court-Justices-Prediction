United States v. 93.970 Acres of Land
speaker="leonard_r_hartenfeld" startTime="0.000" stopTime="486.695">
    Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld 
    --the election of remedies issue and it isn't as simple as the Government's argument seems to -- might indicate. 
    First of all, if this Court is to -- does sustain our position on the lease, obviously, the election of remedies issue is no longer pertinent. 
    On the other hand, if this Court does not agree with our position on the lease then the election of remedy issue becomes of great importance to the condemnee. 
    Now, the facts in every case are important and it is pretty difficult to discuss general principles of law without saying, “What are the facts in the particular case?” 
    And therefore, on this argument of election of remedies, I would appreciate if this Court would start with the simple fundamental proposition that we are not in the position of squatters. 
    I don't know what the law is with reference to squatters but I do know that we held possession for seven and one-half years under color of a formal naval lease. 
    We operated the property and maintained that on behalf of the Navy and we did everything in compliance faithfully with that lease. 
    We think it's most unconscionable on the part of the Government to now seek to take advantage of the situation by taking two inconsistent positions, number one, that you don't have a title to this -- to the lease, under the lease. 
    Or number two, we're going to grab it anyhow regardless. 
    And I would like to show later in this argument how this works and will work a tremendous hardship upon all condemnees situated such as this lessee was situated if the Government's theory of this case on election of remedies is followed by this Court. 
    Prior to the case at bar, there are only four cases in the whole history of United States in which the right of the Government to contest title of the condemnee was an issue. 
    In all the other cases cited by the Government except the U.S. versus Turner and U.S. versus San Geronimo, in all the other cases, the issue of election of remedies was never made a part of the case so they weren't discussed in the case. 
    Now, it is important to understand that a determination in our favor in this case will not in any way affect the governmental procedures that have been going out for years about title contest as between claimants to different funds. 
    And the Court of Appeals makes this distinction very clearly. 
    In fact because of the paucity of election on remedy cases such us ours where there was a title contest in the condemnation proceeding and the point was actually argued and decided since there are only four of those cases in the whole history of the country, the occasion can't arise very often and the possibilities of it arising hereafter again is very remote. 
    Therefore, when the Government argues expediency, justifies the result in this case, it is a fallacious argument. 
    Now, the Government relies U.S. versus Turner and U.S. versus San Geronimo Development Company, both of which held that the condemnee's title can be contested in a condemnation proceeding. 
    In other words, these two cases do support the Government's position. 
    The Turner case was decided in 1949 by the Fifth Circuit and the First Circuit decided the San Geronimo case in 1946. 
    On the other hand, interestingly enough, there are exactly two cases supporting our position and the Court of Appeals below. 
    One was U.S. versus Chicago B &amp; Q. Railroad decided by the Seventh Circuit back in very early days and U.S. versus 1148 of Acres decided by the Fifth Circuit in 1954. 
    U.S. versus 11 Acres is an election of remedies case saying that you cannot contest title in a condemnation proceeding. 
    You cannot test the title of the condemnee in a condemnation proceeding. 
    It directly overrules the holding in U.S. versus Turner which is relied upon by the Government and which was decided it by the same Fifth Circuit, seven or so years before. 
    Now, it overrules the Turner case, it doesn't refer to the Turner case. 
    But the net result is that it overrules that there's any doubt about it. 
    And the Turner case and -- and -- pardon me. 
    In the U.S. versus 11 Acres as cited by the Court of Appeals as one of the federal cases, the Court of Appeals below, as one of the federal cases establishing a federal law of this country to be, that you cannot contest title in a condemnation proceeding. 
    Now, the net result is that the Government in this case has only the old San Geronimo case to rely upon as far as what the Court of Appeals below has done. 
    The San Geronimo case, the Court in that case and there's no evidence if the parties really brought up the election of remedies point, in that decision, from reading it as, that may very well have been that the judge just passingly said that this is a hybrid proceeding justified only by the peculiar circumstances. 
    So that even the First Circuit which is relied upon by the Government on San Geronimo case, admits that it applies only with our peculiar circumstances justifying the Government to try a title in a case -- try a title of the condemnee in the case. 
    On the other hand, there was a dissent in the Turner case, that was a split decision, which I would like to read if I may out of page five of our brief. 
    Now, the Turner case was subsequently, as I mentioned before, overruled by U.S. versus 11 Acres but the dissent in the Turner case at page five stated the following. 
    “The Government initially set out towards the goal of acquiring title to the lands by a condemnation suit but now has reversed the field and is trying to run with the ball in the opposite direction.” 
    It's assertion that it does not now want condemnation but confirmation of a title that it already owns seems to me to be so utterly and violently inconsistent with proceedings and eminent domain as not to be permissible. 
    And that is exactly how the Court of Appeals below felt about this case. 
    They were the two Judges, Judge Major and Judge Schnackenberg have had years of experience with condemnation proceedings in the state courts. 
    As soon as the oral arguments started, they immediately jumped on Government counsel saying, “How can you adopt such an inconsistent procedure?” 
    It is inconsistent with everything that is brought up in -- in condemnation proceedings. 
    In fact, the customary jury verdict that every federal court in the land uses on a condemnation case merely has one short sentence, “How much is the condemnee entitled to receive his just compensation?” 
    That is the instruction that goes out in every condemnation in this country. 
    And that's how simple -- that's a simple basic issue in an orthodox condemnation proceeding.

speaker="leonard_r_hartenfeld" startTime="574.595" stopTime="711.895">
    Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld 
    Only if you draw the analysis from the other situation, Your Honor. 
    But I think that under the federal statutes I will mention later which require the application of state law. 
    Under the Fifth Circuit case that I've mentioned, U.S. versus 11 Acres as against an individual whom that Government is trying to seek title from. 
    They cannot contest their title. 
    In other words, if I claim title, and let us talk about the Illinois law if I may for a minute. 
    The condemnor has before acquiesces under Illinois law in the condemnee's title by the mere filing of the condemnation proceeding. 
    There's no way in the world that the condemnor in Illinois and Wisconsin and most States that I know can contest title of the condemnee. 
    Now, where there are many people who are asserting claims for -- the just asserting the title to the lands so that the real contest is not whether the Government is going to pay for that land that's being contended but who gets the money when the Government does pay. 
    That's a completely different situation, Your Honor. 
    That is the basis of our whole case and that's exactly what the Court of Appeals says. 
    In other words, if I may read one sentence out of the Court of Appeals below's decision with reference to the cases cited by the Government. 
    The Government argues that claims based on liens or contracts may be settled and clouds on titles resolved in condemnation proceedings. 
    This is true, no doubt, where such claims or rights are incidental to the taking of property for which just compensation is to be awarded. 
    But where there is to be no just compensation awarded to anybody, whatsoever, then you just don't have a condemnation suit because a condemnation suit necessarily presupposes under the statutes of -- setting forth what is condemnation. 
    Presupposes that the Government is taking by force something which they can't get any other way and they're paying just compensation to somebody for the taking of their property. 
    That is exactly what --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="711.895" stopTime="716.473">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Voice Overlap) presuppose in the specific.

    Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="716.792" stopTime="726.127">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Does it presupposes anymore than that the condemnation that the Government has some interest or may have some interest?
speaker="leonard_r_hartenfeld" startTime="726.127" stopTime="757.972">
    Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld 
    Yes sir, Your Honor. 
    There has to be a taking by the United States in order to have a condemnation proceeding. 
    That is the fundamental premise of our case. 
    Now, there has to be a taking by -- from somebody. 
    Now, if they're not taking property by virtue of the condemnation proceeding, then they are not taking by virtue of condemnation, they're taking by virtue of a possessory action which are disguising this condemnation.

speaker="leonard_r_hartenfeld" startTime="761.291" stopTime="780.242">
    Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld 
    Well, as a matter of justice, I'm very happy you mentioned because this is really what the crux of it is, is the justice to the condemnee and to the courts. 
    If the procedure followed by Government were to be followed, the courts would be burdened with unnecessary litigation which just makes no sense at all.

speaker="leonard_r_hartenfeld" startTime="780.707" stopTime="829.576">
    Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld 
    And -- and the condemnee would likewise be burdened. 
    For example, in our case, that's very easily to understand if you assume -- well, which actually happened. 
    As soon as our case started, the Government filed a motion to dismiss our answer setting up the doctrine of election of remedies and was overruled by the Court. 
    And if their motion for summary judgment before the trial had been granted, there wouldn't have been any problem actually because we'd be out of court as a matter of law. 
    There wouldn't have been a condemnation trial. 
    But because we won on the question of our lease and our right to be in the Court, we had to go through an eight weeks trial of a condemnation proceeding which is a proceeding to determine the value of the property. 
    How much compensation --

    Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Basically, this might be my statement of the case. 
    It was one proviso that the federal statute requires that.

    Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld 
    But, Your Honor, 50 U.S.C., the federal statute requires the federal courts to follow the state procedures. 
    That statute has been construed to require -- I mean there's no question that the federal courts have to follow it under that statute, and that statute was in fact, at the time the order of possession was entered in our case which is the decisive point. 
    Even the Government concedes that -- in its brief that this is the decisive point when the election of remedies occurred for the current law, was when we were deprived of our property irrevocably.

    It isn't the basic statute which -- upon which the complaint was filed. 
    Now, what this other statute says had nothing to do with this case. 
    But aside from that, even that statute that counsel talks about, is talking about quieting title where there are may be 16 different people claiming for the same amount of money.

    Because the Government is condemning an interest in the land and is paying somebody some money for it and therefore, it is not electing any remedy in a sense in our case where they're -- they're contesting our title. 
    And the cases your talking about, Your Honor, the Government admits that there's always for somebody, admits that the title is not in the Government. 
    The condemnation proceeding must go ahead in order to get the title to the Government and the Government is willing to pay the money. 
    That isn't our situation. 
    In our case, the Government is saying that they -- that we shouldn't be paid anything because our lease was cancelled.

    Now, if I may elaborate on that, Your Honor. 
    In this case before the Government filed this condemnation proceeding, we are anxious to have this matter determined, the lease question determined and we file suit in the federal court for declaratory judgment action hoping that the Government would come in and join with us a summary proceeding which would of course is very little. 
    We could have litigated the matter of in that proceeding.

    Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    That is correct. 
    Now, there's two basic reasons why we think it's unjust to follow the condemnor's position in this case, number one is the 50 U.S.C. 171 expressly provides that the federal court shall follow the state law. 
    Now, the Government argues that Rule 71A was in effect at the time of this institution of the condemnation suit which is a decisive factor when the order of possession was entered, and they argue from that that Rule 71 overcame the statute. 
    Well actually, Rule 71A is merely a procedural device. 
    It's merely our -- just as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure stated, merely pertains to a procedure. 
    It does not apply to substantive law. 
    And the Government admits in its brief that the doctrine of election of remedies is a substantive matter because it's substantially affects the rights of the Government if you bar the Government from having the right to contest title in condemnation. 
    Now, if it is a substantive matter, obviously, Rule 71A has nothing at all to do with the substantive provisions of 50 U.S.C. 171. 
    Those still remain in effect and under those substantive provisions, the doctrine of election of remedies precludes the Government and under Illinois law and federal courts from contesting our title. 
    This is just clear cut and the Government has not answered this in their oral argument or in their briefs.

    Now, I -- I beg your pardon, they did repeal 10 U.S.C. and 10 U.S.C. repealed 50 U.C.S. so therefore, there is no 50 U.S.C. or 10 U.S.C. to rely upon today.

    Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld 
    Now, because we won the lawsuit below, we had to go through this tremendous eight-day condemnation proceeding trial evaluation. 
    The Court of Appeals in its opinion says that our case was the most complicated valuation question in the history of all the law books. 
    This is really a state, when out of the Court of Appeals and we had to go through that for eight days, answer all kinds of complicated questions of law in fact with appraisers and all the kinds of expenses to try the question of value. 
    And yet, even today, we don't know if were entitled of the kind. 
    And likewise, the trial court had to spend eight days of its time closing of this case and the trial court doesn't know if it hasn't wasted its time. 
    That is why we say there's a hardship on the Court and on the litigants also to follow this theory and that is exactly what the Court of Appeals felt, too. 
    The -- if I may have just one sentence more, Your Honor, I hate to overindulge in this but under our theory, the scope of -- of election of remedies would wipe out any claim by the Government as to the statutory power to lease or this -- or the intention of the parties in drafting the lease. 
    And we say that because under the Illinois which is effective law and which is effective here, the condemnee concedes the full title of the condemnee -- the condemnor concedes the full title of the condemnee by merely filing the condemnation suit. 
    Thank you very much for the addition.
