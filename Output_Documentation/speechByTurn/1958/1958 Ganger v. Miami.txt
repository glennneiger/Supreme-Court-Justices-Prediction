Ganger v. Miami

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 153, Norton R. Ganger, et al., versus City of Miami. 
    Mr. Ferrell, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="13.976" stopTime="145.232">
    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I left off yesterday on the question of local improvements, while the legislature of a State, as in this case, enacted a statute and set forth exactly what assessments could be made and how the -- how the notice would be given and set forth very strict limitations as to these assessments. 
    Now, this Court has passed on that very question in the case of Browning versus Hooper, 269 U.S. 396. 
    That court -- the Court held in that case where a local improvement territory is selected and the burden is spread by the legislature or by a municipality to which the State has granted full legislative powers over the subject, the owners of the property in the district have no constitutional right to be heard on the question of benefits. 
    Now, in the case that I cited to you, the Supreme Court did hold that statute unconstitutional because they held the district in that case was not created by the legislature. 
    The taxing district there had been not been created by the legislature, but the next case on it is the case of Memphis &amp; C.R. Company versus Pace. 
    In this case, the state statute creating road districts and permitting the levy of taxes against property therein was attacked under the Due Process Cause of the Federal Constitution. 
    And in all of these cases, the proper attack was made and it was made on that point which, of course, is not the case here.

    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    No, sir. 
    It would have to be uniform, but naturally, in a city, some streets might need repair at times when others wouldn't. 
    But in due time, probably all of them will be done but this case holds this. 
    You have -- the Legislature of Florida could have written a statute where no notice would have been given and it wouldn't have been any federal question involved because that's what this Court holds.

    Then, you would have had to judge it by the face of the statute --
speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="191.954" stopTime="194.025">
    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    That's right, sir. 
    That's what this Court held. 
    This Court --

speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="195.175" stopTime="312.316">
    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    Yes, sir. 
    This Court said this in -- in regard to that. 
    This Court held that the district was created by the legislature, that this was a question in law -- of law and that the decision of the State on this question was controlling. 
    This Court held therein that property owners in districts created under the authority of the legislature and being legislatively created districts were not entitled to notice and hearing as to the benefits conferred. 
    They held and went on and said that it's a matter that rest in the discretion of the State and are not controlled by either the Due Process or the equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the validity of that statute was upheld by this Court. 
    And I say to you in this Court, if you had the proper attack in this case, which you don't, and I'll mention that again in a second. 
    If he had properly attacked, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't, under the rulings of this Court, be entitled to any relief because our statute in Florida goes further than your requirements because this very statute could have provided for no notice whatsoever. 
    Now, counsel, in his brief, my opponent, he tries to cite some state cases. 
    He cites a New Jersey case. 
    He doesn't cite any federal question -- cases on this question but he attempts to tell you that in cases where the legislature delegates the authority. 
    We don't have that in the Florida Act because the Florida Act sets forth what the city can do. 
    They don't give them any right to make any rules and regulations as to publication, as to what can be done. 
    They can only levy these assessments on the storm sewers, improvements to streets. 
    They don't have any power to do anything except what that legislative act is. 
    They haven't delegated anything. 
    They have --

    The -- the Act, in no case, in no State does a legislature sit as a legislature and determine whether there are any benefits under these things. 
    That would be impractical and you won't find any case where it's done. 
    They have just said, where storm sewers, unless three-day improvements are made, that is a benefit. 
    They have legislative --

    Then, after all that is done, they have a limited time to go into the Circuit Court on a very informal petition. 
    And in this case, they failed to avail themselves of that right.

speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="397.995" stopTime="398.836">

    Yes, sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="398.836" stopTime="399.346">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But --
speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="399.346" stopTime="580.649">
    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    If they don't get a personal notice, well, they don't have -- they haven't been personally notified, but what I'm saying now, in every one of these cases cited by the other side in here, they have no application to a proposition like this. 
    Why, you have written an opinion. 
    In every one of these cases he cited to you, you will find in each one of them is a question in a judicial proceeding where couldn't have said this by publication. 
    The first case he cited was this Mullane versus Central Bank -- Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Company, 339 U.S. 306. 
    That case involved the validity of a New York statute concerning trust companies which permitted the trustee to have a judicial settlement of its accounts by publication in a newspaper. 
    You, of course, held that unconstitutional. 
    The second case he cites and tells you, as a per curiam discussed yesterday, New York versus New York, New Hampshire &amp; Hartford Railroad Company, 344 U.S. 293. 
    That was a case where it was a bankruptcy question. 
    The creditor was notified by mail but by publication in the newspaper. 
    The creditor was the City of New York. 
    There was no question about the assessment. 
    The lean had been made and had been on there for some time. 
    They had never questioned the assessment. 
    It was a question of the claim being barred because they didn't file a claim. 
    They contended that was a judicial proceeding. 
    And I read you yesterday what this Court said that the District Judge didn't follow the statute -- the bankruptcy statute on that in requiring the proper notice. 
    That has nothing to do with assessments, other than the claim that was barred just happen to be one for an assessment. 
    It would have applied had it been anything. 
    Now, the only difference in the Court on that case was it didn't have anything to do with this question. 
    I think two justices said the fact that the city had a lean on a railroad -- specific railroad property, as in this case, is on specific property where the improvements were made, that they wouldn't be barred under the Bankruptcy Act anyway because they still had their liens on that specified property. 
    The next case he cited was Covey versus Town of Somers, 351 U.S. 141. 
    This case involved a foreclosure against an incompetent and whether or not he was properly certed. 
    In this case, the New York Court of Appeals certified that due process was raised and denied by it. 
    The next case he mentioned yesterday was the Walker versus the City of Hutchinson, 352 U.S. 112. 
    That case involved a condemnation proceeding in which process was obtained by publication in a newspaper. 
    He cites the case of Lambert versus --

    Well, that may make a difference because this Court has held it's one thing to levy against -- for special benefit against individuals as to whom each -- as to whom as -- a case must be made out in each instance and levying, for instance, against the whole county, however unfairly they have been levied by the State. 
    This Court has made that distinction, that if there's a mass, you couldn't expect to give individual notice.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Ferrell, at the -- just as you -- as we adjourned yesterday afternoon, you were about to come to that last argument that was made by counsel.
speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="1067.868" stopTime="1067.923">
    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1067.923" stopTime="1071.387">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It seems to me that that bares on --
speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="1071.387" stopTime="1071.417">
    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    All right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1071.417" stopTime="1090.332">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- this particular thing because, as I understood it, you said you had some similar proceedings as to some property farther down the street where they did not assess it against the -- against the owners of the property but that in this particular instance, they did.
speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="1090.332" stopTime="1328.359">
    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    Yes. 
    So, let me answer that, sir. 
    He told you yesterday that there was -- that he took a deposition and that he got leave of the lower court to do that. 
    He didn't tell you that he got that leave of the lower court some time after the lower court opinion was handed down the decree in February of 1955. 
    Now, he doesn't give you the date on his motion for leave to supplement the record that he read to you yesterday here, but he goes into a letter that he got on the deposition which is June 1st, 1956. 
    Now, he doesn't show you the dates on here when he filed in the Supreme Court of Florida a motion for leave to supplement record on appeal to show some discriminatory action. 
    He filed it, and again, he didn't put the order in here but it shows in his petition for rehearing that Supreme Court of Florida denied that motion for leave to supplement record on appeal. 
    And never having been in the lower court as a record, it wouldn't allow it in the Supreme Court but it was physically up there in the file and he printed it in this record, and it's not in the records of this Court. 
    It's not considered and put it in here and came up here yesterday and argued that to you. 
    That wasn't raised and I want to mention this to the Court while I'm on that subject. 
    Our file is directed by the Court this morning, as you directed me yesterday, a copy of the city's motion which resulted in the striking of their -- the brief of the appellants here on their rehearing where they raised, for the first time, the constitutional question. 
    And counsel answered Justice Harlan yesterday when you asked him that question, if they didn't strike it because it was raised for the first time. 
    Here's all the city said in their short motion, they said here once, number two, “The suggestion -- suggestions of appellees in their petition for rehearing and application to file brief confined solely to the federal constitutional question sought to be raised by appellees was not raised by the appellees in the Trial Court and now appears before this Court for the first time.” 
    We then have said, “Appellants respectfully submit that to permit the suggestion of a constitutional question objection not raised in the Trial Court nor included in the main briefs before this Court is contrary to the long lines of decisions enunciated by this Court.” 
    We cited on a case there and I want to make one more comment on -- counsel read to you yesterday, in his opening argument, a little conclusion from his brief where he said in his main brief before the rehearing question came up that he did mention the constitutional question. 
    He read you a sentence. 
    In this very motion that the city filed with the Supreme Court of Florida, and which was granted, we -- it says here, and here's what the Court said citing the case of Randall versus Miami Coin Club in 88 So.2d 293. 
    It says, “Only at the conclusion of the briefs is it suggested that the statute may be subject to a constitutional objection,” but this suggestion is neither properly briefed nor argued. 
    Consequently, it cannot be said to be raised -- be raised on this appeal. 
    But I'm willing, if counsel says his brief in the main cause touched upon these questions, I'm willing for him to file it before you and let you see how much of it he raised. 
    I have no objection to him putting --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1328.359" stopTime="1339.580">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I take it he, in the notice of motion that you're reading from, referred or claimed that he had not attacked the second notice at any stage of this proceeding?
speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="1339.580" stopTime="1394.508">
    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    Well, in our answer, and all the way through, sir, we showed -- we set out all of these notices and he didn't attack any notice all the way through this case. 
    You can look at his brief, other than by attempting in his petition for rehearing, what he got down to there was to try to properly raise this question by holding that any notices by publication would be insufficient, that they would be entitled to actual notice more than by publication, not constructive notice. 
    That's the question he attempts to raise and the Supreme Court of Florida, that's in the record, struck his brief as to the constitutional questions. 
    Now, he says to you, well, they considered his petition for rehearing. 
    They considered it because he had other grounds in it other than those constitutional questions, but my time is running out.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1394.508" stopTime="1397.537">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Ferrell, I'd still like to ask you --

    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    Yes, sir?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1397.811" stopTime="1412.335">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- about that last point that he made in his argument yesterday. 
    I'd like to ask you if it is a fact that on other proceedings on this same street, as I believe he said --
speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="1412.335" stopTime="1412.742">
    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    Yes, sir?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1412.742" stopTime="1428.705">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- where they were -- proceedings were started the same as they are here, that they did not assess the property owners but -- on his property and in this particular neighborhood, they did.
speaker="milton_m_ferrell" startTime="1428.705" stopTime="1461.476">
    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    What they did, sir -- yes, sir. 
    It wasn't on this same street but what they did in another district, the city, each time they -- they -- the place is a district, what they did, as a matter of fact, was pulled up the assessment on this. 
    And I might say, in connection with that, if you'll look, there has been a flood of litigation on this question. 
    There are many, many cases that have been pending and disposed of here recently, in the last six months, on this very assessment problem.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1461.476" stopTime="1461.802">

    Of course, I met counsel here in each one of them.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1464.766" stopTime="1468.021">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You mean, on some of those, the city has abandoned its claim to --

    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    No, sir.

    No, sir. 
    I dint think it was that they failed, but they did stop the assessment advertisement on some of them, on one of them that I know of, definitely, here --

    Mr. Milton M. Ferrell 
    Well, here, I think, in this case, I can read you from this letter that is in here will probably be the -- it says, Mr. Anderson writes this letter, “My attention has been called to the fact that the City Commission, at about the time this district was ordered,” and this is what the Supreme Court of Florida disallowed in the record, whether it will answer your question --

    I would like to read you just a paragraph here as to what the dissenting judge who wrote the opinion for the dissent which was at one time, the majority before the rehearing was granted and it was reversed, what he says. 
    It was no difference in all seven of the members of the Supreme Court on the notice, they all held the notice was sufficient under the law. 
    But the only thing they had a difference on was whether resurfacing and repaving were synonymous, and this question of whether they were estopped. 
    The dissenters held that under the state statute, not -- not any -- under the state statute, repaving wouldn't be allowed under that statute. 
    Now, here the -- the man who wrote the opinion that they depended on said this, and he is the one that went for him with the other two. 
    The appellees seem to have convinced the Circuit Court that there were five defects rendering the notice insufficient and he names them, which every one of them a state grant. 
    Then, he says this. 
    “It seems to us that an interpretation that a property owner who wished to object to the proceeding would not be sufficiently informed to be able to locate a meeting of the Commission of the City of Miami would be farfetched.” 
    Then, it goes on as to the others and said, “Our reaction to the next two so-called imperfections, lack of identity of the city in the sign of the notice is the same for the same reasons.”

    May it please the Court. 
    I had intended this morning to put this case in what I thought was a proper focus by emphasizing to the Court that basically, the question involved here was whether or not these property owners received a special benefit to their property different from that enjoyed by the rest of the people in the city because, without that foundation, there is no constitutional basis for imposing upon those people any different burden than that called upon the other people in the municipality. 
    It wouldn't make any difference if the City of Miami had given the property owners a notice in writing every day that they were going to levy the assessments and that had it served that notice upon them personally. 
    If the doing of the work had not conferred any benefit upon that abutting property, the City of Miami, and no other city, would have had any right to have the imposed cost upon those people. 
    And there isn't any serious doubt about that proposition in all the courts of this country, including this, which have considered that question.

    No, sir, but I would like to say this to the Court, if I may, that there is vast difference between a legislative determination of benefit which is made by the assembled people or legislators in a State and that made by a body to which that power has been delegated and the statements are well put in American jurisprudence, and if I may ask Your Honor's indulgence, I should read it to you. 
    Contrary to the view stated in the preceding paragraph which discusses the question concerning the legislative determination of benefits, it has been ruled that where the legislature of a State does not, itself, act in determining an improvement district or area or making a special or local assessment that delegates the power to do the same thing to some subordinate body. 
    Due process of law requires that in some stage of the proceedings before the assessment becomes irrevocably fixed, the property owner shall have an opportunity to be heard, of which, he must have notice, either personal or by publication or by a law fixing the time and place of hearing, the proceedings in such instance or in a natured judicial, in the sense that such right to notice and hearing exists.

    No, sir, that everybody in the City of Miami who were bearing the cost that they got out of a general fund should be paid for out of the general funds. 
    That's what that means. 
    Now, when the case went to the Supreme Court of Florida, one of the Justices who subsequently changed his opinion and run over to the other side said this in a specially concurring opinion. 
    “Here, the trial judge specifically found that the work was for the benefit of the general public and the abiding owners received no special benefit. 
    The record of balance in evidence more than adequate to sustain this conclusion.” 
    And one of the witnesses testified that he lived on a street near the intersection of a highway to Key West, which Justice Black referred to on yesterday, and that the passage of that traffic up and down that street had made his street worse and that he would pay the city double if they just hadn't done the work at all.

    Before you get to the issue below, you failed to point out as to where the question is presented in.

    Mr. Thomas H. Anderson 
    Well, perhaps we are not, but we put that into our brief as a means of showing the situation that had existed with respect to these property owners and for the information of the Court, if I may go this much further and explain our position to the Court. 
    It -- the matter is not as counsel represented to the Court, some hybrid piece of paper that has been brought to this Court. 
    It was raised in the Supreme Court of Florida in our petition for rehearing. 
    On page 67 of the record, we call the Court's attention to the fact that this motion to supplement this record had been filed and that the matter presented a case for discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause. 
    But the Court, at the time that it entered the order on the motion to -- for the brief, struck this or denied our motion to supplement the record, and that order is in this record contrary to statements -- to counsel's statement.

speaker="thomas_h_anderson" startTime="2698.416" stopTime="2720.929">
    Mr. Thomas H. Anderson 
    Well, I was just trying to explain to Your Honors that this was not a matter that we had dragged physically into this Court, that it had been presented to and decide by the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    And the order denying it, contrary to what counsel said, is in the record on page 70. 
    Now, on the question of this notice --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2720.929" stopTime="2722.690">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    On page 7?
speaker="thomas_h_anderson" startTime="2722.690" stopTime="2791.765">
    Mr. Thomas H. Anderson 
    70, Justice Black, the motion of appellees to amend the order denying petition to supplement record has been duly considered and is denied. 
    So -- so, the matter was in the record before the Supreme Court of Florida and it is in this record here. 
    Now, whether the Court thinks it should be considered under the jurisdictional statement that we filed is quite another matter, but it was presented to the Supreme Court of Florida for its consideration. 
    Now, I'm sure that my time must be running out and I have only very few minutes left and I shall like to ask Your Honors' indulgence for a few moments to consider this question of this notice. 
    This is an exhibit which was attached to the complaint in the case which went to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    It contains a little paragraph up here which contains the notice of the hearing on this original initiating assessment. 
    That is not quite as big as the pages o the Miami Herald, but it is a photostatic copy of the page from the paper in which this notice appeared and it's here among the original records of this Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2791.765" stopTime="2802.421">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Anderson, I don't mean to be facetious in the slightest, remotely, in asking you whether, if the notice had been on the front page, you would make the same argument.
speaker="thomas_h_anderson" startTime="2802.421" stopTime="2863.544">
    Mr. Thomas H. Anderson 
    Justice Frankfurter, I don't think that's a facetious question and I'm perfectly willing to answer Your Honor candidly. 
    I do not think it would have made a particle of difference as long as we are concerned with the situation regarding resident property owners. 
    But of course, and the reason we mention this among other things in our argument is that in one of the opinions of this Court, I think, in the Malaney case, I think it was that Justice Black in that opinion referred to a matter being tucked away upon an obscure page in the newspaper, a notice not directed to anybody in particular and which was not likely to come to the attention even of a person's friends. 
    And he says that the purpose of notice was to get information to a person, and of course, it follows, and I am not quoting his opinion there, of course it follows that the more inconspicuous the place is, if the notice is published, the least likely it is that it shall come to the attention of him who is to be affected by it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2863.544" stopTime="2882.094">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do you think there is no difference between notice to a fellow whether they've got some money in the bank or whether he doesn't file notice or a stockholder and the kind of publicity that is necessarily engendered by a piece of public work done in an -- in the line of Wade City?
speaker="thomas_h_anderson" startTime="2882.094" stopTime="2894.767">
    Mr. Thomas H. Anderson 
    I'm glad Your Honor mentioned that point because that question is dealt with in the -- in the -- depositions themselves. 
    Now, remember, all of these people did not live on all of these streets. 
    As a matter of fact, the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2894.767" stopTime="2896.339">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But the houses were there.
speaker="thomas_h_anderson" startTime="2896.339" stopTime="3113.580">
    Mr. Thomas H. Anderson 
    No, sir, Your Honor. 
    The DuPont building is on one corner, the Miami Herald building is on the other, the Ingraham building is on another. 
    There's a large department store on another, and one of the individuals in the case testified, and he was supported by the city engineer, that the matter of maintenance of these streets, because of these potholes that have been developing all the time, were so constant that they had to put him to do the work on Sundays. 
    And he said they never had made assessments against him before and why should he have thought that they were going to make assessments for street repairing, and it's a perfectly logical thing. 
    But to show, Your Honor, that they acted as promptly as they could and to correct the statement which was made by counsel yesterday, this case was not filed three years after this matter was instituted. 
    The assessment district in the Hamilton case, and by the way that may call for some explanation because some facetious comment was made by counsel regarding the fact that we tried the brief on one side and named it in the other, the case that we actually tried and we were solicited to participate in these proceedings by a group of property owners was the name of Hamilton. 
    The district was created before the Ganger District and we were ready and had taken our case -- or the city had taken our case to the Supreme Court of Florida before the Ganger case was ever filed. 
    And the Supreme Court of Florida held that the complaint was a valid -- or was attacked upon the ordinance and it had this notice in it. 
    So, the whole matter was tried on the assumption that we were trying the Hamilton case and the Ganger case, involving fewer streets in a much smaller district, sort of just came along with it. 
    When it got to the Supreme Court of Florida, for some unaccountable reason, the opinion was written in the Ganger case, but all the main briefs are dealing with these questions were entitled in the Hamilton case and that is why we have stressed the fact of Hamilton although, of course, the names make no difference. 
    But now, on the question of this timing, the confirming resolution in the Hamilton district was added on March 18th, 1953. 
    Then, the city sent bills to these people. 
    Counsel has said, “Well, we couldn't possibly have given them personal notice of the assessment because it would have been too expensive and the ownerships might have changed.” 
    But when they sent them the bills, they mailed it out to the right people and all of their names and addresses were on file with the city clerk, and they are in the records of this Court as represented by the assessment rule. 
    Now, within 48 days after that resolution was confirmed, we filed the Hamilton suit. 
    It was filed on May 5th, 1953. 
    It went to -- the judge ruled in our favor on the motion to dismiss that complaint in July and it was decided in our favor per curiam on the Supreme Court of Florida in the following September. 
    So, it was not any lapse of time, such as two or three years, or any period like that. 
    It failed between the time of the doing -- the happening of these events and the challenge to it. 
    And indeed, I do not see how the people could have gotten together and gotten into Court much more quickly than they did and are about the same amount of time lapsed in the Ganger case. 
    That suit was filed or the confirming resolution there was done in the year later, on February 18th, 1954, and the suit was filed on April 1st, fall. 
    So --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3113.580" stopTime="3124.007">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did the Act itself provide for any apportionment of the burden on the taxpayer's prescribing -- on the land owners prescribing exactly how it should be proportioned?
speaker="thomas_h_anderson" startTime="3124.007" stopTime="3138.823">
    Mr. Thomas H. Anderson 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The Act permits the city manager to make a recommendation to the city commission as to how the benefit shall be assessed and it specifies that it may be on the front-foot rule. 
    And the city manager made such a recommendation and the city commission adopted it.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3138.823" stopTime="3140.035">

    That was the -- there was no deviation from the procedure prescribed by the statute. 
    They followed the statute all the way through.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3160.003" stopTime="3171.680">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Let me just ask one basic question. 
    What was the prejudice that resulted from the lack of notice?
speaker="thomas_h_anderson" startTime="3171.680" stopTime="3196.392">
    Mr. Thomas H. Anderson 
    The city claims that by reason of our failure to object in the administrative proceedings and by our failure to take the 10-day appeal to the Circuit Court, we were thereafter precluded from objecting to any of the notices or any of the resolutions and thereby, we have become estopped to set up the fact that benefits did not accrue to us. 
    But the question was actually -- have I answered Your Honor's question?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3196.392" stopTime="3219.442">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No -- no, not entirely because was -- was the basic objection that this was the kind of an improvement that could not be levied against abiding property owners or was the basic -- or was there also an objection that even if an assessment against the abiding owners was proper that the equalization procedure, whatever you call it in Miami, the apportionment, as Justice Black has called it, was unfair?
speaker="thomas_h_anderson" startTime="3219.442" stopTime="3221.615">
    Mr. Thomas H. Anderson 
    No, sir, we do not challenge that.

    Mr. Thomas H. Anderson 
    The basis of the Court's decision was -- the basis of the Florida Supreme Court's final determination was that the property owners were estopped to set up a ward of benefits because they had failed to take the administrative proceedings that were required by the statute and to bring a proceeding in the Circuit Court of Dade County within 10 days after the final confirmation of the assessment.
