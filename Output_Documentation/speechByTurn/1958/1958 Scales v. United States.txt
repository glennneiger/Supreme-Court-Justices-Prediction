    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice. 
    When we arose for lunch, we were discussing the question of whether the statute should be construed to read the word membership as including an element of activity. 
    And I was having a little difficulty with the question from Mr. Justice Black about whether soliciting votes for a communist candidate could be considered activity. 
    And the obvious trouble that I get into one, this question is that soliciting votes or voting for -- for communist candidates, its obviously a protected right, constitutionally protected right. 
    And that I'm almost automatically in trouble if I argue that by proving that a man did something which is constitutionally protected in doing that he can subject himself to punishment.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="64.887" stopTime="75.435">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, at least if he had a constitutionally protected right to solicit votes for a party, how can you say that you can make it a crime into the law point?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="75.435" stopTime="152.996">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, I -- I think that to solicit votes for a regularly nominated candidate of a political party in the election campaign is a constitutionally protected right. 
    I think that there's no question about it. 
    If -- it is -- I think that it -- under any definition, it is activity and it is probably party activity. 
    But I don't believe that the Court would ever held -- hold that it is the kind of activity which would subject the man punishment. 
    That case isn't before us. 
    We -- we've -- I'm -- I'm glad to say. 
    And it would lead to that -- to that further difficulty. 
    The kind of activities that I am talking about however are not of particularly of that nature. 
    They are acts, not illegal acts. 
    I'm not suggesting that you have to prove illegal acts but they are affirmative acts which a man takes in order to -- as part of his membership. 
    And when you tie those in with knowledge as to the aims of the party and his intent that these aims shall be brought to provision then it seems to me that we try the man in with a -- with an -- with an offense which can be punished under the constitution.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Are you correct in saying emphatically, you do not have that question here in any way. 
    If it is a crime you shall be (Inaudible) this party, they solicit votes but is it a crime to belong to this party? 
    You have to a certain extent, you have to know, it outlaws it. 
    That outlaws it entirely. 
    That's a complete outlaw of the party which would in time, I would presume, I don't know. 
    I would presume it would outlaw the solicitation of votes.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, as a -- as a national political party, the Communist Party that they themselves in there and they're teaching of -- in their analysis, distinguish their activities into their legal activities and their illegal activities, if you please. 
    Mr. Foster writes that the purpose of the party is to achieve their aims through democracy and for five years they nominated candidates. 
    These were legal activities and the -- the party for -- for years did conduct this kind of -- of legal activity. 
    I don't think that insofar as an individual promoted, if it were possible, promoted only these legal activities, had no intention, no knowledge about the illegal activities, I don't --

    The first time they got enough to have -- have a revolution successfully. 
    They announced publicly that -- they put it in a platform, per se. 
    And then he solicited votes for them, would he not have committed a crime, as a part of the crime because (Inaudible)? 
    If --

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    I think then you've come down to the question of whether there's a clear and present danger in that kind of a -- in that kind of a situation. 
    I think that if there is a clear and present danger, then it can be a crime but I think under -- under the state, upon the facts that you give me.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="299.138" stopTime="316.961">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes. 
    Could be it a clear and present danger for a man to solicit votes for a party openly if he's going to do it? 
    Or even though if, some other who stands on the platform that eventually he wants to present -- to do something that would concede him winning, that's illegal?

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    I think there would be no clear and present danger if the Communist Party behaved, if you please, the way Karl Max behaved and said we believe in -- in -- overthrow the Government by force and violence. 
    We believe that the proletarian has to take over and (Inaudible) have to be thrown out and that's what we're going to do and that's our platform and we will -- and we want as much support as we can.

    If a group such as the Communist Party as today that teaches its members in school after school various violent methods of overthrow just because it conducts even if it did conduct as I've supposed, the Communist Party does too, some legal activities on the side. 
    Even though, let us say, one of those legal activities were and it isn't at the present time. 
    But even supposing one of those legal activities were the nomination and election and seeking to elect the president, I don't think that they can quote that they can get protection for their illegal activities because they have a legal side.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Davis, the De Jonge case illustrates what I was trying to get from you namely, that initially I was referring to, that it brings out what my problem, namely, what is the criteria to be applied not in this case but in the next case? 
    Now, the point about the De Jonge case was that in view of the indictment, in view of the speculation, most especially in view of the decision of this Oregon -- of the Oregon court, anybody who participate, anybody who participated in a meeting called by the Communist party would be within the trial of that statute. 
    It was immaterial that De Jonge himself was a member. 
    Because the way the Oregon courts construed that statute, you and I, if we were that meeting, could be within the statute and it was that that this Court found unconstitutional because they would have had to affirm or reverse the decision of the governing ruling of the Oregon court (Inaudible) that the facts of De Jonge was a communist was irrelevant. 
    He wasn't charged with that. 
    And the statute didn't make that a crime.

    Mr. John F. Davis

    I will come to that later (Inaudible). 
    On --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="telford_taylor" startTime="1357.335" stopTime="1658.078" flagged="true">
    Mr. Telford Taylor 
    Yes. 
    On Section 4 (f) and the statutory bar. 
    Mr. Davis mentioned Section 17 of the Internal Security Act which says that the foregoing provision shall be construed as being in addition to and not a modification of existing criminal statutes. 
    I don't believe that that provision cuts one way or the other on our point of disagreement here. 
    That is a general provision which I believe was on the statutory draft long before 4 (f) came in and started to get modified. 
    In any event I don't see how that general thing which is common to many other statutes could possibly prevail over this specific provisions in 4 (f), we talked about any other criminal statute. 
    It seems to me that the argument is not advanced one way or another by reference to that. 
    The other thing on 4 (f) that Mr. Davis spoke of that I do want to say something about, is his argument relating to 4 (a) and 4 (c) of the Internal Security Act? 
    If I understood him right, he is suggesting that if my point of view is correct that a communist can't be prosecuted as such under the membership clause that the same thing would apply under 4 (a) and 4 (c). 
    I do not believe that to be -- to be true. 
    We are not suggesting that communists and so communism would be read out of either the Smith Act or the Internal Security Act. 
    What we have in 4 (f) is two things. 
    You would have an evidentiary bar in the 2nd Section which is the second sentence which as Justice Frankfurter pointed out is under the Counselman rule, plainly insufficient. 
    And because of that, you would then have the interpolation of the first sentence which is not an evidentiary bar but is an immunity from prosecution provision and the question is what is it breadth? 
    That -- that is the question. 
    Now, under 4 (a) of the Internal Security Act, the crime is knowingly to combine, conspire or agree with any other person to perform an act which would substantially contribute the establishment of a total -- totalitarian dictatorship. 
    Would an indictment be valid which charged that the so and so combined, conspired and agreed to perform an act in that he became a member of the communist party? 
    No, the bar would apply. 
    I think it would also apply if it went to charge that if he became a member of the Communist Party knowing it's purposes, that still isn't enough to constitute a crime under 4 (a). 
    We have the word knowingly in there. 
    The bar in other words is a bar to indicting somebody under 4 (a), 4 (c), advocacy clause of the Smith Act, membership clause of Smith Act on the basis of office holding. 
    The differences that in 4 (a) and 4 (c) you have to accuse a person of some kind of conduct just as you do in the substantive provisions of the Smith Act whereas the bar is coextensive with the membership clause. 
    It isn't coextensive with the other provisions of the Smith Act. 
    It isn't coextensive with 4 (a) and 4 (c) but it is in our view coextensive with the membership clause and it also operates to bar prosecutions under 4 (a) or 4 (c) unless they go far enough to charge some conduct other than the office held in an election. 
    On activity, I must confess that I am left with the laws now on what kind of activity is enough. 
    Mr. Davis said, if I understood him right that he now agrees that there must be both intent and activity to validate the statute. 
    Is attendance at party meetings enough? 
    I understood him to say yes. 
    But I look at the Government's brief and I see at the top of page 25 that the -- if all that were involved were bear membership plus some attendance in party meetings, there would be more foundation to the argument if the De Jonge case applies. 
    This argument disappears when the requirement of activity is added and I construed that previously to mean that attendance at party meetings wouldn't be enough. 
    He said, I believe that paying dues is enough and mention is made of the Rowoldt case but I have here the swift opinion in the Rowoldt case and I gathered that there, although the petitioner pay dues, attended meetings and even worked in a communist bookstore -- bookstore that that was being not enough for purposes of that statute because there was not enough of a -- of a mental of tie with the party. 
    So that the --

    Mr. Telford Taylor 
    But I think when Mr. Davis is speaking of activity he's not speaking of the mind. 
    Its -- I think Justice Frankfurter, you pointed out, activity is something outside of the mind.

    Mr. Telford Taylor 
    True. 
    But if we then say he must also the acting -- I don't read the Rowoldt case is saying that this activity is indicative that much -- no way of a connection. 
    May I make one another point about it, Justice Frankfurter? 
    This talk about activities seems to me to utterly overlook the facts that the membership clause itself covers affiliates as well as members or becomes or is a member of or affiliates with any such society. 
    Now, in the (Inaudible) case in the Ninth Circuit, it was held that affiliation exist without activity. 
    If congress meant to cover affiliation which certainly is a lesser and looser degree connection than -- than membership, it was put in there to cover a lesser and looser degree of connection. 
    It seems to me the implication of that is clear that Congress did not need a particularly high standard of activity as a requisite of membership. 
    Because if they have they would not have extended the statute also to cover affiliates.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1751.421" stopTime="1759.283">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Affiliate, maybe -- maybe not less or more but different, it might be covered so-called front organization?
speaker="telford_taylor" startTime="1759.283" stopTime="1866.265">
    Mr. Telford Taylor 
    It could. 
    This Court has said that it means something less than membership and more of the sympathy. 
    Also, it certainly seems to me the implications of that word are less activity than -- than membership would apply. 
    And that is say what was held in the Ninth Circuit. 
    My time has expired. 
    If the Court desires, I'll be glad to comment on -- on what happened on that pamphlet. 
    Here, Mr. Justice Douglas made mention of. 
    When I do not have nothing else to say, (Inaudible) 
    Mr. Justice Douglas that pamphlet is one of three which was offered during the trial by the prosecution to prove incitement by the Communist Party. 
    It was offered specifically by -- for that purpose. 
    It was subjected to by the defense on the ground that it doesn't build an incitement, that it is indeed abusive, intemperant in its language, and all those things but as was observed by Judge Learned Hand of the Masses and Patten case, to be abusive is not necessarily to incitement to violent overthrown. 
    It was then held before the jury as -- and the jury was asked to find incitement on the basis of that particular pamphlet. 
    The defense then asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that they could not find incitement, unlawful action on the basis only of the -- of documents which criticized Government policy, I believe that was very severely. 
    So that document played a very nature share. 
    Indeed, it is one of the principal thing that the Government relied on to differentiate the evidence in this case from the evidence in the Yates case. 
    We say there is nothing in this case that isn't in the Yates case, the record is basically no different. 
    This is one of the major efforts to make it and I have argued in our supplemental brief the importance of that.
