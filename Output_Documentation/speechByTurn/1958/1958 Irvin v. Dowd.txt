    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    -- for recess, we're discussing the jurors. 
    Now, I would just again stress that we most strongly feel that it is necessary to examine the entire voir dire examination of the jurors who did serve and those jurors -- or the jurors who are questioned, I should say, and those jurors are set out in our brief starting at page 15 and thereafter. 
    And comments and citations to the direct comments upon and citations to the record concerning their voir dire examination are contained there.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    That's correct. 
    Now, we submit that after an examination of this record concerning the qualifications of these jurors, it would become evident to the Court that the jury or each member of the jury who actually sat in this case was qualified under the Indiana statute, that the Indiana statute is a statement in the Reynolds -- of the Reynolds case. 
    Actually, the reasoning is set out in the Reynolds case that -- that is a necessary view under our present civilization. 
    We -- it's impossible to keep things of this matter out of the newspapers. 
    I think it would be unadvisable to keep them out of the newspaper. 
    Now, we often know -- we all know of instances where newspapers may go too far and try to use their own influence, but as far as a factual reporting in what does occur, I think, is absolutely essential to the type of civilization which we live.

    Evansville is in southern tip of Indiana.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    And the -- and murders, although, occurring in Kentucky where in the same community actually, right across the river, and so -- although -- somewhere in Kentucky and somewhere in Evansville, this is actually a community episode. 
    There are series of episodes within a single community. 
    But -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter makes the -- an observation here that they don't always report it like they should and that's -- I think that's correct. 
    Now, that gets us to the point of the necessity of the statute as it exists here. 
    We know we can't control newspapers absolutely and maybe we don't want to but we have a faced with a factual situation, what does actually occur? 
    Now, we have to presume that those persons chosen for jury duty are literate person. 
    They -- they are persons who read and they listen to radio and watch television in a community. 
    We hope that they, at least, have that much intelligence to serve on a jury.

    The judge, despite that sort of sua sponte, he thought that the venue is not proper there because it's prejudiced. 
    Did he transfer the second time?
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="476.235" stopTime="551.707">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    Our Supreme Court has held not, Your Honor. 
    An attempt was made at that in State ex rel. Fox into Fourth Circuit Court and which was decided just prior to or while this case was really in process. 
    And in that case, it was held that the judge could not do that. 
    That's what he had in fact done. 
    He had made a finding that there was prejudice in the community and had ordered the venue and the Court said he could not do that and entered a prohibition against him doing such a thing. 
    But -- and there is a dissenting opinion by one of our best judges in many years, Judge Emmert on that subject. 
    He dissents to that. 
    And I would refer to his dissenting opinion and submit that that is not the situation here. 
    They -- they appear -- sought to attack the constitutionality of this statute on a change of venue. 
    And I would say that although Judge Emmert says that this is improper, he bases his decision on the ground that the judge in that case had found that there was prejudice in the community. 
    Therefore, it should have been taken out. 
    In the Irvin case, it -- the opposite was true. 
    The judge made an affirmative finding. 
    There was not prejudice in the community. 
    He refused to send it. 
    Well, he didn't -- that's not exactly true either. 
    He followed the statute, I should say, but he refused to put that one. 
    He refused to grant the writ.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="551.707" stopTime="554.296">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There is also a motion for a continuance of this refusal, wasn't it?
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="554.296" stopTime="557.183">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    Now, that gets us to the --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="557.183" stopTime="562.625">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Was there any opinion written by the trial courts, reasons for denying a continuance?
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="562.625" stopTime="638.673">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I would like to point out to the Court in relation to the continuance situation. 
    First of all, continuance in Indiana, as it is most place, is a discretionary matter, a -- an old case Walker versus State, which is cited in my brief at page 25 thereabouts so hold. 
    And I think that's a universal rule. 
    Now -- and it gets to be a matter then, did the Court abuse his discretion as to whether or not to grant his continuance in this community where possible prejudice exist? 
    Now, I would call the Court's attention to the dates involved here. 
    This crime was committed on December 23rd, 1954. 
    Publicity, of course, immediately started. 
    As you will note from the publications there and this is rather bizarre crime. 
    These people were methodically executed following a robbery, a think that was sort of terrifying to the community. 
    And they were publicized widely. 
    There's no question about that. 
    And that started on December 23rd, 1954. 
    Leslie Irvin was arrested on April 8, 1955 as a parole violator not for this crime.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="638.673" stopTime="644.096">

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    No, Your Honor, I don't believe that it was as far as the -- the occurrence is.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    I -- I couldn't tell you just to how -- for how -- what length of period this occurred. 
    But the -- the arrest of Leslie Irvin occurred on April 8, 1955. 
    He was arrested not for these murders but as a parole violator and so held in custody. 
    While he was being held as a parole violator, then he was interrogated concerning these murders because they knew him and so for certain things pointed to his guilt in this case, and they barked on interrogation. 
    Now, the voir dire examination in this case did not start until November the 14th, 1955. 
    And we see from those dates that it was four months from the time this Kerr murder was committed until Leslie Irvin was arrested. 
    It was seven more months from the time he was arrested and held in custody continuously. 
    It was seven more months before the -- they started to pick a jury to trial.

    (Inaudible) that was the publicity concerning the confessions.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    The publicity concerning the confessions was, Your Honor, around December or April the 14th of 1955. 
    And that was shortly after he was arrested on April 8th. 
    And on April 14th, I believe, he was -- he made his statements and that was when the -- the glaring headlines concerning confessed -- confession. 
    So and now -- of course, they carry the same theme. 
    Every time this would come up, they carry the same thing. 
    They did the same -- the same publicity more or less occurred when Judge Parkinson had it before him. 
    And I dare say the same publicity will appear in Evansville tomorrow after this hearing. 
    His -- this is something that comes up every time the man has heard.

    Because the -- the juror -- jury panel was there and then they -- the counsel for the defendant would methodically go through this whole business about these other murders.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    Yes, sir, this started in April was when -- his confession was in April. 
    Now, I think it's only fair to assume that these things were reiterated from time to time by news carrying agencies. 
    I don't think that we can say that -- it hasn't stopped yet, this -- the publicity will still, I -- I take it. 
    They all carry the same sort of thing, “Confessed Killer”, “Mad Dog Killer” and so forth. 
    I -- I take it that those -- that same terminology will still be used. 
    Now, that brings us to the confession. 
    We have had the statement made here that they were not permitted to have Leslie Irvin testify as to his side of this confession. 
    I submit to the Court that that is not the true picture. 
    That from the -- and it's set up in my -- the citations of the record are set out in my brief at page 29. 
    And if you start at the record of transcript, Volume 2, page 1306 and go to Volume 3 to page 13 or 1613, it's in my brief at page 29, citation. 
    If you start there and read, you will discover that there was a complete hearing as to all aspects of Leslie Irvin's arrest and his interrogation and the statements he made. 
    And those statements that he made were, I submit, given without any kind of coercion at all. 
    He -- I think this record is very clear that he had every opportunity, if he so chose, to testify. 
    Never -- no place. 
    Now, things were made, he was denied the right to testify. 
    I submit you will find nowhere in the record where he was denied the right to testify. 
    He certainly could have testified if he so desire but he did not choose to -- to testify. 
    Now, I submit that the -- the Court did laid -- they do quote language where the Court overruled the motion without having any hearing. 
    But he -- this was immediately following this exhaustive hearing on the admissibility of this confession. 
    And I submit that it would've been completely useless to have had that hearing over again.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    That was outside the hearing of the jury, yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, that brings us to Paul Wever and his part that he played in this confession. 
    Now, this confession was not heard alone by Paul Wever. 
    It was heard by the Chief of Detective Hudson and certain portions of it actually were wire recorded in many likewise appeared and it's -- and -- but that's here and there. 
    This time they were concerned with Paul Wever's testimony concerning the confession. 
    Paul Wever merely testified that he was call -- summoned by Leslie Irvin to tell him a story. 
    And it was roughly this, he said, “Are you going to try me in Kentucky or you're going to -- are you going to try me in Indiana, you're going send me back to Kentucky?” 
    Paul Wever said, “They don't have enough evidence to try you in Indiana at this time unless there is a weapon you need. 
    I need the gun for one thing, and he said, “Well, take me out and I'll show you where it was.” 
    Well, it's -- to be very brief about it, he took him out and they found the gun eventually where Leslie Irvin had indicated and so forth. 
    That was what Paul Wever testified too but this was also testified too by Chief of Detective Hudson. 
    And Paul Wever's testimony was just --

    It says here he was loyal and expertly defended at every point in the case, 415 specifications of allotted error are presented in motion for a new trial, 415 specifications.

    The State of Indiana asked for an extension of time to file their briefs and the Court gave them an extension of time to file their briefs and by virtue of that, under our laws, the Rules of the Supreme Court of Indiana, they waived any preliminary motions to dismiss or otherwise and that is Rule 2-16, set out on page 123 of our brief and that -- and that reads as follows, “The petition,” see, they filed -- the State of Indiana asked for an extension of time to file their brief. 
    When they did that they had to sign this petition which says in effect, “The petition shall state facts showing that the Court in which the cause is pending has jurisdiction and that the briefs will be on the merits and when filed by the appellee,” which is the State of Indiana's case, “the petition shall show that all motions to dismiss and all dilatory motions on behalf of the petitioner have been filed.”

    Mr. James D. Lopp 
    The appeal sets out assignment of error. 
    Ordinarily, the assignment of error is the overruling the motion for a new trial. 
    But once it gets to the Supreme Court of Indiana, the Supreme Court can search the record for any kind of error to determine the case whether or not there was error and that's exactly what they did in this case, and they did search this record.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    We -- Yes, sir. 
    We took the position that we were not trying to dismiss this case, that the assignment of error was that the Court overruled the appellant's motion for a new trial, and we were taking the position that he was justified in so doing, and we addressed our argument to that fact. 
    We -- this was -- we didn't take the position ever in this case that we were trying to have a -- an appeal dismissed.

    Mr. Richard M. Givan

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2340.271" stopTime="2349.636">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, how could the appeal be properly there if -- if the appellant didn't bring himself within the 30-day or whatever the rule is?
speaker="richard_m_givan" startTime="2349.636" stopTime="2369.026">
    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    This, Your Honor, we said that the Court did not err in overruling the motion for a new trial. 
    And we submitted that his reason for overruling the motion for a new trial was that the man was not there, that he never got to the merits, that he overrule it because the man was not within the jurisdiction of the Court, was not there. 
    We never --

    Mr. Richard M. Givan 
    That's right. 
    We -- that was the first point in our brief. 
    We just -- we didn't try to do this by a motion to dismiss. 
    We submitted this as the first part of our brief on the merits of the thing. 
    That was our first reason for stating to the Court that the trial court did not err in overruling motion for a new trial.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2397.284" stopTime="2415.184">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That -- that position of yours that you just stated shed some light on why the Supreme Court of Indiana went into the merit although it could have stopped yours if it has gone entirely on the question of no standing or whatever you call it.
