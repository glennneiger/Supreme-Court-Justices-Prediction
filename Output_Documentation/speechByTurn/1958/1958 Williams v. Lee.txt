    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices. 
    This case is a very simple one on the facts that has very complex, indeed very deep current certification. 
    Actually, it is an action for debt, originates an action for debt by a trader, Hugh Lee on the Lee Trading Post Ganado, Arizona, in the middle of the Navajo Reservation. 
    And the defendants are two Navajos, husband and wife whose flock of sheep was attached for the purpose of collecting a debt of $361.22. 
    After some delay in holding the sheep at the plaintiff's trading post where they were carried for and at a per diem charge, they were finally sold to sheriff's sale for a total sum including $2 in cash, but the plaintiff, for some reason, put up $272, the total cost of maintaining the sheep during their incarceration, shall we say, was $246.72. 
    So that had the plaintiff not paid in cash in his anxiety over this case the sum of $280, there would have been a net balance to credit on this debt of $27.28 and had the -- I cannot refrain from commenting in passing that had the jurisdiction of the Court in respect to this particular point then maintained, he could then have attached another flock of sheep and repeated the process calling up on the debt of this proof presumably at the rate of $27 or $30 in attachment. 
    Now, actually, with the payment of cash, the final judgment was $82.22 which is still standing against these -- these defendants and therefore other property can be -- be attached for reasons explained in the course of my discussion. 
    The Supreme Court of Arizona held that that attachment was invalid. 
    In fact, in the Superior Court proceedings below beginning there, the Superior Court judge, when the defendants challenged the jurisdiction of the Court proceeding this matter, held that having obtained the citizenship, they were subject to the state jurisdiction, I need not to spell out Superior Court's ruling anymore than that perhaps under the issues in the Supreme Court, where, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona sustained these views. 
    However, it reversed the District Court -- the -- the Superior Court on the -- in respect to the attachment on the grounds and for the reason that a specific regulation of the Bureau of -- of the Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs forbad the sale of livestock without a -- an expressed permit by the superintendent. 
    In this area, the federal regulations, the Supreme Court of Arizona held did in fact preempted appeal. 
    And therefore, the attachment was invalidated.

    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    To narrow the issues to those that are before this Court, the Supreme Court of Arizona, as I have said briefly, did say that the federal regulation respect to say livestock had preempted that field and invalidated the attachment. 
    On the broader ground that a regulation controlling the credits -- controlling the transaction between traders and Indians on the Reservation specifically provided that if credit is extended, it should be at the traders' own risk. 
    In respect to the contention of counsel for the defendants below that there was no jurisdiction in the Court by reason to construction of this regulation, one contention. 
    The other contention that there was a basic contention, there is no jurisdiction anyway over Indians on a transaction arising in the Navajo Reservation. 
    But on this narrower ground, that the credit provisions of the traders' regulations left the traders entirely at their own risk and made the transaction unenforceable. 
    The Court said that the only thing before it was the question of jurisdiction and that the effect of this regulation went to the merits. 
    It could be plead on the merits. 
    It did not go to the jurisdiction of the Court. 
    The court below had jurisdiction in the opinion of the Supreme Court, and this regulation could be plead if necessary on the merits but did not go to the jurisdiction. 
    The Court reviews the law of the situation as it considered to be, recognizes that there is preemption of the -- of regulations, but where Congress has not specifically prohibited and the State has the jurisdictions. 
    They quote some cases to this effect which are to some extent not correctly represented but in any event, on certiorari to these courts, out of the assignment of errors or points on appeal below, there emerged here two basic points which ought to be considered. 
    First, our main contention and the one consonant with a long line of decisions from Worcester against -- from the Worcester case in -- against Georgia in -- in 5 Peters down through many, many years that the Court -- that no jurisdiction of the persons but had by the state court because they are Navajo -- Navajo Indians residing on the Navajo Reservation and because the State does not, broadly speaking, have civil or criminal jurisdiction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="523.216" stopTime="535.146">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Your -- the immunity which you urged is the immunity of the person and not of the enclave of the -- of the Navajo Reservation, is that right? 
    They both --
speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="535.146" stopTime="545.755">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    Your Honor, I agree there's no immunity of the enclave for certain functions of the State arising from its jurisdiction of that territory.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="545.755" stopTime="550.686">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I meant immunity on the enclave as to Navajo Indian.
speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="550.686" stopTime="552.061">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    As to Navajo Indians, absolutely.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="552.061" stopTime="558.108">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But -- but your claim is broader than -- your claim is the immunity of the Navajos on or off the Reservation.
speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="558.108" stopTime="558.934">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    Not of the Reservation.

    Not off. 
    No.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="561.093" stopTime="565.482">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So it's a sort of a territorial immunity of the Navajos within the Reservation?
speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="565.482" stopTime="566.252">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    That's right.

    All right.
speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="569.104" stopTime="575.480">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    The second point is, and here, I must take a moment of explanation because in --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="575.480" stopTime="586.239">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Even if the Navajo Indian was off the Reservation or off the town or -- so on then he's -- then he maybe personally served?

    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    He is personally served, not for a transaction on this Reservation, not for this transaction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="592.379" stopTime="605.673">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Maybe -- maybe personally served, that isn't this case now.

    So therefore, it isn't merely the geography but it's also the immunity of the Indians with reference to transactions pertaining to the Reservation.

    Mr. Norman M. Littell

    But the Indian law is full of inferences where advantage is given to Indian and immunity is also given to him.
speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="852.560" stopTime="1078.972">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    Completely. 
    If I may submit it to Your Honor, in the emancipation of the Indian which is the process in which we are living and it's an advanced stage today. 
    If there were 10 points necessary to the emancipation of the Indian, let's assume a hypothetical 10 criteria, number five is citizenship. 
    My distinguished counsel and the courts that he is depending or shocked that the Indian could be a citizen and not be subjected to all the incidents of citizenship including liability for this suit. 
    I say that citizenship was number five on the list of 10, he hasn't attained upon yet. 
    And as Mr. Justice Frankfurter's comment indicates, there are all sorts of seemingly inconsistent immunities, inconsistent with the common law as we know it until that complete emancipation has arrived that we have thousands of them that have arrived at that State and they're living around in the country just as you and I can be sued and sue just like anybody else, that this immunity does not follow the infinite -- the Indian ad infinitum. 
    But it's perfectly clear by the doctrines of this Court, reviewed in our brief, that there is no civil or criminal jurisdiction until Congress has granted it, except, I must make a qualification as you think I'm painting a black and white picture and a ridiculous one, there are incidents to territorial sovereignty of the State. 
    There are sections to this vast reservation, the biggest in United States, 24,000 square miles within New Mexico and Utah and -- and a bit in Colorado and -- and Arizona. 
    It would be futile to put that into the territorial sovereignty of the State of Arizona if there weren't some incidents and your Court -- this Court has held. 
    If the Navajos had leased land to a white man on the Reservation and he was raising his sheep there or grazing livestock, he could be taxed by the State. 
    And I would not be so foolish as to say that that white man on the Reservation is exempt from process of the State, maybe because on the reservation of law. 
    He is subject to the jurisdiction. 
    All of the traders in this -- in this Reservation pay taxes to the State. 
    And I wouldn't say that their personal property could not be attached by a legal process served in the Reservation. 
    Although I reserve the qualification that if the Navajos, under Section 13 of their Treaty of 1868 were back any sheriff to enter the premises, I would reserved the right and let have anybody quote me in this argument to say that I have waived this forever. 
    I would there to contend the Navajos have denied access to this Reservation and you can't come on, but the general law is the contrary. 
    You asked against Fisher, oh I can -- in these cases in our brief. 
    So that -- that territorial jurisdiction has followed onto the Reservation as far as the commission of crimes by a white man, as far as the civil actions by white man against another, but why this legislative history, which I'm about to review which I think if I may suggest it would help Your Honor in this -- in this rather trying field. 
    Now, first, because we have changed our position from the petition below, I would account it below, I must spend a moment on the point that we contended below. 
    There is no jurisdiction because these traders' regulation said that the credit -- that extension of credit was at the traders' own risk and therefore no jurisdiction.

    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    The Solicitor should have stepped up on this issue and helped us backing our position. 
    He took this weak position, an untenable which we had abandoned. 
    We abandoned it below because we have found when we went to write our brief in this very case by consultation with the attorneys and the Department of the Interior that the traders had affected their reaffirmation of its regulation in 1937 which did two things. 
    It took out a provision that the federal employees -- it forbad -- it took out the provisions of federal employees were forbidden in the Indian Bureau, forbidden to help collect the debt. 
    They felt that they are to be the moral suasion of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to collect that debts. 
    It did something else. 
    It took out a prohibition against farms and pledgets and it put it in that they could put farms and pledgets. 
    That gave the traders a real grip, which they have used extensively, all jewelry and sheep and pinyon nuts and all sort of things are pledgets. 
    Furthermore, and this is the policy of the Solicitor's opinion. 
    In order to get around this broad jurisdictional point, and we are aware of your policy and judicial policy of trying to narrow its decision or not to amend the grounds rather a broad ground. 
    It would be superficial and untenable to do it upon the Solicitor's basis. 
    He states the blunt position that now, these debts are unenforceable.

    They have taken our position time and again and due to this day on legislation before Congress and I can't accept this. 
    Let's say this very casual presentation of their point of view.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1693.909" stopTime="1720.227">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And one more -- one more thing that maybe urged in behalf of the petitioner, namely, that it's protective of the Indians but would -- one would -- beyond the alertness the Indian office under some unfriendly administration and that does -- I mean of Indian affairs would take the position against the Indians.

speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="1726.161" stopTime="1784.780">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    It is protected, but their construction of it is not broad enough. 
    It still leaves open the door to sporadic raves under this Reservation by state jurisdiction as in this case. 
    Please have this physical perspective in mind that if the State has this power to send its processes into this batch reservation where there are now great reaches and discovery of oil and things of that sort, lots of things going on. 
    It has no correlative responsibility to extend the protection of its sheriffs and its courts, unless civil and criminal jurisdiction is extended in an orderly way. 
    They can't sit back and say, “Oh, we'll take this case. 
    We'll go get them on this one,” and yet extend no sheriff services of that Reservation of an entirely by the Navajo belief and no courts called entirely by the tribal courts.

    This is the way the camel get into the Arab's tent by these backdoor methods and the State should not be permitted to intrude into -- into the jurisdiction over these Indian affairs.

    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    With the -- with the exception of one, Your Honor, with artful skill, he downgrade the most important point in the argument by dropping the -- the consideration of -- of Section 9 of the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act to -- to a footnote. 
    But let me come to that in -- in an orderly way. 
    We now come to the main issue to the effect that -- that there is no jurisdiction whatsoever. 
    In other words, our reasonable condition -- our -- our contention throughout, counsel of the defendants below and here and in the petition and in our briefs throughout that the Court had no jurisdiction of the person because the Navajo Indians residing on the Navajo Reservation and as much the State does not have civil and criminal jurisdiction over the Reservation. 
    Now, skipping that long line of cases from Worcester against Georgia to which I referred, John Marshall, right on down through the decision of this Court, skipping that base which is adequately set forth in the briefs by looking at the legislation, Congress has carefully maintained the jurisdiction from the day, Your Honor, when we start from the sovereign character of the Indian nation, incredible as it seems today. 
    It was true with all of the immunities that are attached thereto or -- or most of them.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1967.541" stopTime="1969.444">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, that's the basis of Worcester against Georgia.
speaker="norman_m_littell" startTime="1969.444" stopTime="2135.854">
    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    It is. 
    And Congress has step by step stepped down from that partialling out the jurisdiction by expressed provisions. 
    Now, coming up to date on it, the New York statute of 1948, except for hunting and fishing which was preserved in its -- in its Indian right preserved from their reservoir granted a criminal jurisdiction over Indian Reservations in the State of New York. 
    That was amended in 1950 to extend it to criminal jurisdiction so that the courts of New York then had jurisdiction over all of this. 
    In 1953, there was the general -- a general act extending specifically to five States, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Wisconsin and California extending civil and criminal jurisdiction of those States over Indian reservations within those States over an Indian country. 
    Now, Section 6 and 7 of that Act is pertinent to our case because Section 6 and 7 said that consent is given to the people of any State to amend the Constitution or statutes to remove impediment to civil and criminal jurisdiction. 
    This impediment exists in Arizona in the Constitution. 
    It is submitted in the union under condition as quoted in our brief that as long as the Federal Government maintains this exclusive jurisdiction to these lands -- these lands until they release from Indian title or absolute jurisdiction of the Federal Government. 
    They have the power. 
    They have the power to get the jurisdiction which they're reaching for sporadically in this one case, under 6 -- Section 6 and 7. 
    So that anytime the people of Arizona want the jurisdiction which is artificially and unnaturally contended for here, they can get it by the legislative process by amending their constitution and amending their prohibition statutes, and they have it under consideration. 
    Out of chronology, I now mention in the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act, passed in 1949 to design to accomplish the rehabilitation of these two tribes of which Section 9 was added in 1949 to provide in all cases the jurisdiction of the State and the federal and tribal court shall become current. 
    That was vetoed by President Truman. 
    And the Act was passed in the next Congress without it. 
    So here is a clear legislative history. 
    Criminal and civil jurisdiction is not extended even concurrently.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2135.854" stopTime="2142.243">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker

    Oh, definitely. 
    Oh, no. 
    No question about it, Your Honor, I wouldn't be here. 
    It would be all settled. 
    It's -- and the reasons for the President's veto are set forth in our brief and especially, I referred to again in our -- in our reply. 
    Now, in the decision of the Arizona Supreme Court, Miller against Begay which is absolutely inconsistent with this present opinion which we are reviewing, the Supreme Court of Arizona, the same court held that there was no jurisdiction over a suit by your wife of a divorce -- in a divorce affair who'd been married under Arizona law, under Arizona license, divorced from the tribal court, the wife being unhappy, sued, went back to the Arizona court, she's unhappy about the tribal decision on alimony -- that's by the different concepts of those things. 
    And she sued in the state court and the same court. 
    Chief Justice -- Chief Justice Udall held there was no jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Arizona, precisely in point with this case and utterly inconsistent with the present holding that this Hugh Lee can maintain this jurisdiction. 
    Now, I find fault with my distinguished ally, the Solicitor in retiring to a footnote. 
    They all submit they can point at Section 9 of the Navajo-Hopi Act was dropped after the President's veto, which hits right in the middle of this case and not to our court on the broad grounds and not the narrow grounds and he should have said so. 
    Now, he speaks in his brief of the reserve powers of the State. 
    What reserve powers? 
    Are the reserve powers whose date over piece in ore, over foreign affairs or Indian affairs? 
    No. 
    The only reserve powers I know that are left to the States and these delegations of power to the Federal Government are in the Articles of Confederation. 
    I admit there's one there. 
    The Article of Confederation giving the power of peace and war reserved the power to the State to make war on Indian tribes that threatened with invasion. 
    Well, of course, the Court can take judicial notice of the -- that the Article of Confederation are no longer in full force and effect.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2315.417" stopTime="2318.464">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do you think that would be a strength, to take judicial notice of that?

    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    [Laughs]But that was the only legal example that I could find. 
    I don't know what the Solicitor is talking about reserve powers of the State. 
    Are we trying to change the philosophy of constitutional law? 
    The only thing he can refer to properly are the incidental powers of the State sustained by this Court in many decisions, criminal jurisdiction over the white men for crimes on the Reservation, similar jurisdiction as far as the white man's conducts are concerned, jurisdiction over tax cases. 
    The State is not negative in its proper jurisdiction but over Indians on the Reservation it out until this legislation in Arizona is passed pursuant to Section 6 -- Articles -- Sections 6 and 7 of the -- of the Act of 1953. 
    I'd like to save the rest of my time, Your Honor.

speaker="wm_w_stevenson" startTime="2532.174" stopTime="2691.849">
    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson 
    Now, Justice Whittaker, I believe you referred to or questioned the Denetclaw case, a very recent decision in the State of Arizona particularly with respect to the fact of whether or not the criminal offense occurred within state territory. 
    So there can be no question on that point. 
    The major portion of the Navajo Reservation lies within the exterior boundaries of the State of Arizona. 
    The offense, if any, that was committed -- was committed where a U.S. highway runs through the Reservation. 
    The arrest was made by a state officer and out of that came this Denetclaw case. 
    Gentlemen, the Navajo Reservation is approximately 24,000 square miles of the area. 
    The principle portion of it lies within the State of Arizona. 
    It's still, it's over into New Mexico and there are some in Utah and I am not certain but there maybe a little in the State of Colorado. 
    So that you have, when you stop and think about it, a vast, vast area involved. 
    Now, the Reservation was originally created by the Treaty of 1868, and either by executive order or congressional action, additions have been made to bring it up to the size that it presently contains. 
    That original treaty was signed by the agent of the United States, I believe at that time, was one of the generals that was having trouble in the west with these Indians. 
    That original treaty was also signed, born on behalf of the Navajo by approximately 20 headmen or chieftains. 
    I think it's important, later on, I -- I'll bringing it up here so that you'll have that picture.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2691.849" stopTime="2699.155">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Just a matter of interest, how many -- about how many Indians are there on this Reservation, Mr. Stevenson, do you know?
speaker="wm_w_stevenson" startTime="2699.155" stopTime="2833.563">
    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson 
    I can't tell you. 
    It's my understanding though that it's in the neighborhood of some 80,000 people, 75,000 to 80,000 people residing there. 
    Now, in 1868, Worcester versus Georgia was some 30 years old. 
    That case had been decided long in 1932. 
    But also at that time, in 1868, the principle intercourse between what we shall refer to as the white, the Indians was bartered, trade, that type of thing. 
    It hadn't reached any particular extent necessary that the Indian might want and that the trader could furnish. 
    Today, with modern means of travel and with modern means of communication and with an enlightened policy on the part of our Government with respect to the education of these people, we have an entirely different picture in the State of Arizona. 
    Witness the fact that the Navajo has insisted upon his right to vote that in one instance, in our State Supreme Court, a franchise to operate a trucking line was granted to a Navajo, a member of the tribe, the fact that they can, if they see fit and if they have the qualifications to run for public office in the State of Arizona. 
    In fact, in the most recent election, there was a gentleman from Window Rock who ran for state representative.

    But nonetheless, they are citizens and residents.

    Now, I don't cite those as benefits that the State of Arizona has given this tribe. 
    I merely cite them to indicate the economic change that has taken place in some 125 years since the days of Worcester verus Georgia. 
    These changes present new, different and very intriguing problems.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Stevenson, the -- these changes haven't affected the broad constitutional relation being the Federal Government and the States vis-à-vis Indians, that's it. 
    I mean -- Worcester against Georgia is still citable and still as it were the foundation of any consideration of power. 
    I'm not now talking about recognition, conscious recognition to legislation whether explicit or implied by Congress and supply the constitutional relationship between the Indians as -- as it were a people of -- of the denominated and aide of foreign people within the United States leaving the control that Congress chooses to exercise it and to the extent where it does choose wholly within the federal authority.

    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson 
    That is right. 
    Commercial intercourse and that is what we have here inevitably brings disputes and problems and legal questions that demand trial for a determination thereof. 
    The problem in this case was fairly simple. 
    It was the sale of merchandise between the trader on the Reservation operating a store on that Reservation and -- and then residing on that Reservation and buying from them was a fairly simple one. 
    But it's easy to conceive of a myriad of more difficult problems in the field of civil law that are bound to come along. 
    That is why we want to see it decided on the broad basis not on a narrow regulation. 
    At the outset, we were immediately confronted with this problem is that conceivable within the United States. 
    There is an area approximating the size of the State of Kentucky in which there's no civil law in search of a forum.

    Exactly, all right. 
    I just want to know what your position is. 
    That's it, is it?
speaker="wm_w_stevenson" startTime="3695.610" stopTime="3930.828">
    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson 
    That is it. 
    It is our position that jurisdiction is vested in the state courts of Arizona except where Congress has assumed jurisdiction or reserved the same pursuant to the Constitution of the United States. 
    The United States Constitution Amendment 10 provides that the Federal Government is one of delegated powers.Or power is not delegated to the United States nor prohibited by the Constitution or reserved to the States. 
    So looking at that law, we find nothing there that precludes us from assuming Arizona has jurisdiction. 
    The United States Constitution Article 1, Section 8 provides, “Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes.” 
    A question immediately arises but it's meant by commerce.That's been defined by this Court. 
    The U.S. versus Holliday, one of the older cases, 3 Wall. 
    407, defines it as traffic intercourse even more than that, the buying, selling and exchanging commodities. 
    Certainly, the -- the Congress of the United States might assume jurisdiction with respect to civil matters involving white Indians but it can't be implied from this that it automatically has it. 
    That's the Commerce Clause. 
    Now, our Enabling Act, Section 20 thereof provides and the people of Arizona covenant thereby that until the title shall have been extinguished, the same shall be in remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States. 
    I'm referring thereto lands. 
    Article 20 of the Constitution of the State provides that people disclaim all right entitled to the lands within the boundaries of the State which lands are owned or held by an Indian tribe until the title says tribes shall have been extinguished and that the same shall be in remain subject to a disposition and under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States. 
    Again, they are referring to the land not the peoples inhabiting those lands. 
    As I said a moment earlier, the Draper case, which is cited, I think, in both petitioner's and respondent's briefs interprets Montana's Enabling Act Clause as covering only land and not people. 
    Now, as of that moment having what I would refer to as the basic law, we -- we find nothing that would indicate that the State of Arizona does not have jurisdiction.

speaker="wm_w_stevenson" startTime="4023.058" stopTime="4215.412">
    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson 
    Now, then, for many years, there has been absolutely no question but that the United States -- the federal court system had jurisdiction with respect to criminal matters. 
    But if we take a glance back to these cases in history, we find 109 U.S. 556, Ex parte Crow Dog, in which case it was held that there was no federal jurisdiction to punish the murder of one Indian by another on an Indian reservation. 
    Now, after that, Congress came along and enacted effective legislation. 
    I think I maybe in error on this but I think it was 10 Major Crimes Act. 
    There was a major crimes act or whatever they call it at the time. 
    Now, then, that has been because of, again, economic influences developed and enlarged by virtue of the Assimilative Crimes Act which indicates or evidences an assumption by the United States all criminal jurisdiction. 
    With respect to civil jurisdiction, we have the one point in Arizona and that was Begay versus Miller and that case follows the decision in an old United States case, U.S.versus Quiver, 241 U.S. 602. 
    In that -- in the Begay case, the Court recognized the rights of tribal Indians to deal with their people amongst themselves on personal and domestic affairs. 
    Now, that was the -- that was the breadth, that was all that was covered in that. 
    It was a domestic affair, a divorce that was involved. 
    The husband or the wife whichever had gotten a divorce in the state court and the other has gone to a tribal court, and done the same thing. 
    The state court -- I guess, it was the wife who went to the state court. 
    The wife was granted alimony. 
    He didn't pay. 
    He was cited on a contempt charge and put in jail and that's the way this case came up. 
    The husband had a divorce from the tribal court that was considered bona fide and valid. 
    Our Supreme Court says in matters relating to domestic affairs, we recognize their right.

    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh, isn't the answer to that that either of the treaties -- the Treaty would be United States or congressional act or regulations of the Department of Interior to permit this?
speaker="wm_w_stevenson" startTime="5063.449" stopTime="5099.702">
    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson 
    Well, the regulations, the Interior Department regulation arise out of 19 Stat. 
    200, power to appoint traders with Indians, the permission of Indian Affairs shall have the sole power and authority to appoint traders to the Indian tribe and to make such rules and regulations that he deem just and proper, specifying the kind and quantity of goods. 
    The price of which (Inaudible) shall be sold to the Indians. 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5099.702" stopTime="5115.091">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But that subject also to the act of -- the act of Congress, is it not, which says that white traders shall not sue on obligations that -- incurred in the Reservation.
speaker="wm_w_stevenson" startTime="5115.091" stopTime="5383.085">
    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson 
    But now -- Chief Justice, you're not referring to the act of Congress, you're referring to see the regulations promulgated by the Commission of Indian Affairs on that point. 
    And the -- that when -- specifies that all trade shall be at the traders' risk. 
    Now, the -- the brief of the United States amplifies that or expand it into this type of thing, but that gives -- that takes away from the State any jurisdiction it had. 
    But when the regulation says that all trade shall be at the -- the traders' risk, all credit extended shall be at the traders' risk. 
    I failed to be able to interpret that as meaning that you're going to have to go into an entirely different set of courts. 
    I --I don't -- I -- it seems to me that's a strain and an unnatural interpretation of that small phrase. 
    I would think I should give one or two moments to this Worcester versus Georgia which is unquestionably the leading case on Indian law cited time again without end. 
    And in that case, Chief Justice Marshall's opinion was based on this type of finding. 
    This Treaty, Hopewell does explicitly recognize the national character of the Cherokee, their right to self-government and does guarantee their lands. 
    Cherokee nation is a distinct community occupying its own territory with boundaries accurately described in which the laws of Georgia can have no force, and which the citizens the Georgia have no right to enter but with the assent of the Cherokees themselves found that the Cherokee Nation was not a part of the State of Georgia. 
    They were attempting to extend their county limits to incorporate part of the State of Georgia but this decision is based on the fact that that was not a part of the State of Georgia. 
    Now, with this Reservation, the Navajo that we're talking about and that is our problem here, it is encompassed within the exterior boundaries of the State of Arizona. 
    Well, gentlemen, in summation, it is our position that the sovereignty of Arizona is plenary over its territory except where that sovereignty is reserved to the U.S. or has been relinquished and assumed by the Government. 
    But the Congress of the United States may assume jurisdiction as granted. 
    We -- I don't question that to the extent that such assumption of state courts would be the best of the jurisdiction and here is where it happened. 
    Neither our Enabling Act nor our constitution has divested the State of Arizona of jurisdiction either criminal or civil that came through legislation of this Congress. 
    We submit on the basis of foregoing that the decision of the Arizona Supreme Court should be affirmed.

    Mr. Stevenson, before you sit down, Mr. Stevenson, I have a couple of questions which -- from my own information of Ohio or even Sixth Circuit, we didn't have any Indian cases and I have a lot to learn on this subject. 
    But -- first of all, am I right that the Assimilative Crimes Act gives jurisdiction to the federal courts of criminal offenses committed by one Indian against another Indian within this Reservation, is that correct or not?

    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson 
    If the -- if the -- let me put it this way, if the penalty in the state act is broader than the penalty set up in the Federal Act then the penalty in the Federal Act applies for deciding that opinion.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, in the case of a civil and crimes act, you -- you haven't got any -- it's a rare case that you got a federal penalty for the commission of state offense, isn't it?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But generally, subject to, perhaps, qualifications, the federal courts have jurisdiction for criminal offenses by one Indian against another Indian committed within this Reservation because of federal legislation, you say. 
    And secondly, I didn't quite get the distinction that you made in cases of jurisdiction in civil cases of wrong or litigation between one Indian and -- and another Indian or within the Reservation. 
    You made a distinction between domestic relations and family cases on the one hand and all other types of civil cases on the other I thought and I wondered upon what that distinction was based.

speaker="wm_w_stevenson" startTime="5498.532" stopTime="5522.007">
    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson 
    That distinction was based on this, the fact that in the Begay case, that was the divorce case in the Arizona Supreme Court, they confined their opinion to that one narrow point recognizing the right of the Navajos to govern themselves with respect to personal and domestic affairs involving their tribes and their people.

    Mr. Wm. W. Stevenson 
    Our Supreme Court justify that this way looking at the code of federal regulations and the regulations promulgated by the Commission of Indian Affairs with respect to trading on the Navajo and Hopi Reservation, that Court said, “Well, the United States has assumed jurisdiction with respect to this type of property, sheep, therefore, the Sheriff of Apache county could not possibly have a test of ship and sold them.

    We went for in the petition and it was only on the revelation of the history of this regulation and its weakness that I, an associate counsel, could not conscientiously come before this Court as practitioners who hope to come again someday and makes so tenuous and superficial the contentions that these -- that these debts are therefore unenforceable so we drop this point.

    Mr. Norman M. Littell 
    Now, very quickly because my time is going -- is almost gone. 
    My distinguished opponent from Arizona has his shoe on the wrong foot. 
    The power of the Federal Government is plenary, our state, not over these Indian affairs.And we so contend. 
    Now, his attempt to -- his attempt to confine this language that the Constitution, taken over from the Enabling Act of Arizona, to effect on lands is a strange and unnatural concept which out of court with this Court's decisions. 
    Reading from page 25, Appendix A of our brief that people inhabiting this State do agree and declare that they forever disclaim all rights entitled to the unappropriated and ungranted public lands lying within the boundaries thereof and to all lands lying within said boundaries own or held by any Indian or Indian tribes the right or title to which shall be -- shall have been acquired through or from the United States or any prior sovereignty. 
    And that, here it is, “Until the title of such Indian or Indian tribe shall have been extinguished, the same shall be and remain subject to the disposition under the absolute disposition and control of the United States.” 
    Now, if counsel's petition was correct, why, Section 9 of the Hopi Act which was vetoed by President Truman extending civil and criminal jurisdiction, why, Section 6 and 7 of the Act of 1953 extending jurisdiction to five States very discriminatingly, you read the Act, you'll find they eliminated two tribes. 
    They concluded -- Congress concluded two tribes weren't ready for this. 
    Two tribes were eliminated but otherwise for those five States, civil and criminal jurisdiction is extended, why, Section 6 or 7 inviting the State of Arizona to come in through its legislature and to its people and amend its constitution and delete this. 
    It's an open invitation because Congress realizes that this is not a thing which can be handled by sporadic grabbing of jurisdiction as in this case because it does not carry with it this sporadic grabbing of jurisdiction and this case does not carry with it the extension of the concomitant civil services that go with civil and criminal jurisdiction. 
    How about courts? 
    How about the police? 
    Over 24,000 square miles is big as all of Virginia, is big as all of New England except Maine. 
    Do they just reach in and grab for jurisdiction when they want it?That's what counsel is contending for in the Supreme Court of Arizona.

    What is the jurisdiction except that? 
    The Draper case had nothing to do with that case. 
    The Draper case was a clear holding that a murder by a white man, a non-Indian on the Indian reservation could be punished in the state courts. 
    We admit it. 
    We admit they can be so protected.
