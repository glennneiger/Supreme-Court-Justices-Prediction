    Mr. J. Raburn Monroe 
    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    This proceeding was commenced by the City of Thibodaux filing a suit in the District Court of Lafourche Parish state court, relying solely on the authority of Act 111 of 1900, an act which had never been interpreted by any state decision or state court decision and as far as we know had never been invoked before as a basis for a condemnation proceeding. 
    The defendant, the Louisiana Power &amp; Light, removed the case to the Federal District Court. 
    After a -- after removal, the defendant filed answer in which it raised about eight of ten questions under state law involving the interpretation of the state act, the application of the state act, validity of the state act and its -- and several other questions of state law. 
    At the pre-trial conference, the District Judge concluded to hear the issues of law prior to going into the matter of compensation. 
    Argument was held at some great length in the District Court on these issues of law, and the District Court proceeded to exercise the questions of state law and grant a stay of proceedings until these questions should be decided by a Supreme Court of Louisiana interpretation. 
    His reasons for doing this is, he points out, that although the power of eminent domain is inhere in the sovereign, it is never delegated to subdivisions by implication and that it is a power that is brought with great peril, a possibility of abuse. 
    He then finds that there had been no state decisions interpreting this law, but that there has been an Attorney General's opinion in 1951 which is to the effect that municipalities do not have the power to condemn utilities. 
    He, therefore, granted the stay, pending that proceeding.

    Mr. J. Raburn Monroe 
    That was -- I was going to come to the specific answers, yes. 
    Well going -- I'll go back and fill in the facts. 
    Louisiana Power &amp; Light Company operates in about 44 parishes in the Louisiana and the property here involved in this condemnation suit was a property in the suburbs of the City of Thibodaux. 
    Thibodaux which operates a municipal plant expanded its city limits and then sought to bring this condemnation proceeding. 
    As I say Louisiana Power &amp; Light operates a general electric utility, it generates electricity at remote points from Thibodaux and Monroe, Louisiana and in New Orleans, Louisiana, transmits that by high power transmission lines and then distributes it in Thibodaux. 
    I bring this point out because part of the property involved here is not just a property within the city, new city limits of Thibodaux, but it is that portion that was built, that capacity that was built in all the way back to the power plant for the purpose of serving this area, which is one of the questions as to the applicability of this act. 
    Now this act of 1900 speaks of -- says that municipality can condemn a plant and it goes on to say that if the person owning the plant owns two or more utility plants such as water plant, gas plant at the city condemning this, condemn all of the plants. 
    And so the question or one of the questions state law arising here is whether the city would be required in this case to condemn the entire property of the Louisiana Power &amp; Light which would raise a question as to its state constitutionality, if it was so interpreted. 
    That is, courtesy of -- in one parish operate a general utility system throughout the state of Louisiana. 
    Going on to the -- I might add here also the city of, the city is seeking here also to condemn the right of the Louisiana Power &amp; Light to operate in this section of the city, that is its franchise. 
    Now Louisiana Power &amp; Light operates in that section by virtue of three franchises granted by the parish of Lafourche prior to the taking in of this territory by the city and the reason that the city wants to expropriate a portion of those franchise rights in this area is for the reason that the rates charged by the city to its inhabitants for residential service are approximately 55% higher than the rates charged by Louisiana Power &amp; Light company, so that the city couldn't -- would not long-haul to any customers if they took the property, if we still had the right to operate in that territory. 
    So -- and we -- we say that a careful examination of the statute will show that they are not specifically granted a right to acquire a franchise or a portion of the franchise. 
    Well as I say we raise about eight or nine different questions of state law in this proceeding and unless the Court wants to me, I won't go into them all, it took about an hour's argument before the District Court. 
    When the order of -- the sale order was entered by the District Court, the City of Thibodaux appealed and we filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order was an interlocutory order which is not appealable under the Judicial Code, Section 1291. 
    The Court of Appeal consolidated the appeal and the motion to dismiss, both argued the same time. 
    In argument on the – on the motion to dismiss, the City of Thibodaux argued that this was, this stay order was in effect an injunction setting the doctrine stemming from the (Inaudible) case. 
    In other words, that in granting a stay the District Court was acting as a chancellor in equity, staying a proceeding or enjoining a proceeding on the law side of the case -- we -- which if it was a in junction, would be one of the exceptions provided in Judicial Code Section 1292 Sub 1. 
    In the -- this doctrine has been (Inaudible), but in practically all the cases citing this doctrine it has differentiated the action of a court in granting the stay, acting as a chancellor in equity, enjoining a different proceeding and the action of the judge in the orderly process of trying a case. 
    In all the cases, I admit that a judge trying a case where that law in equity has the inherent power and has discretion in handling the ordinary progress of the case to grant a stay. 
    We claim that this is what this is. 
    This is a exercise of the judge in orderly conduct of the case, granting a stay and we cite in our brief number of cases which have recognized specifically right of a court at law as distinguished from equity, court at law to grant a stay as a matter of its inherent power. 
    Now if -- now in this particular case there was no equitable claim made. 
    The court simply, in the same action before it, after the hearing the evidence on the argument and deciding that in view of the general law that the – following Erie v. Tompkins, that the state interpretation of state statutes should be followed by the federal court and finding no guide of any sort in the state jurisprudence, exercise his prerogative as a court at law in the control of proceedings to stay that particular segment. 
    Now he did not -- he did not dismiss the suit and he still retained jurisdiction insofar as federal question is concerned, insofar as the compensation is concerned. 
    So we say if this is what it is, an exercise of indiscretion of the Court, by then this suit is not appealable, because it's interlocutory order clearly. 
    Now we come to the second question which we raise, which is the question of abusive discretion and that is, was the Court -- if the Court in granting the stay went so far beyond its discretion as a Court at law as to actually constitute this an injunction which makes the case appealable so that it gets here, then is his action nevertheless within his discretion as in granting such a injunction. 
    Now we rely principally in this connection on the case of Leiter Minerals, which we believe is the last pronouncement in this subject in controlling, and that was the case on which the District Court relied, that's Leiter Minerals Inc., versus United States, 352 U.S. 220. 
    In that case, if I can recall fact to you, the Leiter filed a predatory action in the State Court seeking to establish title, the suit was against the mineral lessee of the United States government and he sought to establish title under an interpretation of a 1940 Louisiana statute. 
    The United States government and the lessee went into the Federal Court and brought a suit to quite title, and also asked for an injunction staying proceedings in the state court. 
    The Court below granted the injunction and the Court of Appeals affirmed this and directed the District Court to go ahead and decide the case. 
    This Court, however, affirmed the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, affirmed the issuing of the injunction staying state proceedings, but then directed the district judge to stay further proceedings in the District Court until such time as a determination could be made of the state law, of interpretation of state statute, by the state courts of Louisiana and we say that this is precisely the same situation as in that case. 
    Now we also cite and rely on the Spector case, Spector Motor Company case, which involved an injunction to enjoin the collection of a tax on the ground that it pins down the communist power. 
    In that case also, this Court held that a stay should be granted until such time as the case could be determined or the statute interpreted by a Connecticut Court. 
    There are two leading cases which might be considered in conflict with this. 
    One of them is the case of Meredith versus Winter Haven, involving a suit to enjoin -- a suit involving a question of Florida law. 
    In that case the Federal District Court had decided the case under Florida law against the plaintiff. 
    The Court of Appeals decided, affirmed the dismissal, but made it without prejudice to the plaintiff proceeding in the Florida Court. 
    And the Supreme Court held that it was the -- that this thing, the diversity citizenship case, that it could not -- the Federal Court could not just relax all of its jurisdiction and dismiss a suit, it had -- and that is a case that has very frequently cited. 
    I think there are two differences or distinctions with that case. 
    In the first place here the Court has retained jurisdiction, the District Court has, and as to the compensation question and as to the questions, federal questions and had just temporarily stayed proceedings. 
    And furthermore in the Florida case, the Meredith versus Winter Haven, the Supreme Court of Florida had passed on this very point, which was -- which the Federal Court was asked to pass on. 
    The argument was simply that they would probably overrule this previous decision because a certain argument had not been made to them, so that there was a guide by which the Federal Court could go in an existing final interpretation of the law by Supreme Court of Florida.

    Mr. J. Raburn Monroe 
    The Act is printed in the appendix to the city's briefs, the bound -- Now we say this is an -- we have raised quite a number of questions under this, because since 1900 there have been a number of accidents which apparently conflict with this -- this Act. 
    For example there is an Act which says that no utility and utility is defined as any person, shall serve a customer of another utility without first obtaining permission of the Public Service Commission. 
    Now that apparently would -- and it's admitted here that they've got no permission, and there is another order of the Public Service Commission outstanding which is apparently valid, which says that no utility shall transfer any property which it owns, to another without getting its permission, so whether the necessary authority exists for the basis of this suit. 
    Now we also raise questions here considering obligation of contract. 
    The city of Thibodaux in 1948, this question arose with the City of Thibodaux. 
    The City of Thibodaux wanted an industrial customer, the Coca Cola Company and they wanted to serve a college was newly being built just outside their city limits and they proceeded to enter into a contract with Louisiana Power &amp; Light company which is printed in I think page 36 in the record, in which they agreed that if we would transfer this industrial customer and this college to them for service that they would recognize our rights to continue indefinitely to serve in a territory which was then served, which is the territory here in question. 
    So we say that is a valid contract plus the city contested that contract, we say it's a valid contract and reliance thereon we built (Inaudible) there and that any attempt to take our rights to serve in there would be a violation, particularly if we establish that it's a valid contract.

    Why did you remove this to federal court (Inaudible)?
speaker="j_raburn_monroe" startTime="1266.866" stopTime="1402.694">
    Mr. J. Raburn Monroe 
    Well this has sort of the Gilbert and Sullivan looked to it. 
    I must admit the statute which, under which this suit was brought we considered, gave a very, a cause of remedy which we considered very prejudicial to ourselves. 
    For example, it provides for the appointment of six commissioners by the court and these six commissioners are to go and view the property, appraise it and make a report within 15 days. 
    Well, suffice it to say I don't think you could possibly even inventory properly of this description of utility system within 15 days and of course these six commissioners, if you, the record will show, were appointed by the Judge the same day that the suit was filed, even before we were served. 
    The act makes no provision for giving evidence to these commissioners. 
    It makes no provision for hearings or for cross examining witnesses, it does say that after they have filed their report in the court that any party can object and the case will be tried out the usual manner. 
    But when you got – go into court and you have six so called impartial experts put in a testimony you then have a great burden if you are going to contest it. 
    And so -- in addition to that the act provides for a summary appeal with no, we call it suspended deal no supercilious. 
    So we considered that this procedure and this act would be very prejudicial to us and so we removed as we of course had the right to do.

    I would say that the controlling thing in this matter, I would like to quote from Mr. Justice Frankfurter's language, in the dissent in Propper versus Clark and that, because I think there is a issue in this case. 
    So here there are no constitutional issue is present with regard for the respective orbits of state and federal tribunal is the best of reasons as a matter of judicial administration for requiring a definitive adjudication in New York courts, rather than a proceeding in the basis of own counter guess. 
    I think the issue here in these various cases, various reasons have been assigned particularly for acquittal jurisdiction, diversity or something for either denying or granting. 
    But I think the overriding consideration here is the whether this thing should be decided in the state court or the federal court. 
    For instance in Propper versus Clark there is a significant statement by Justice Reed. 
    He says the congressional purpose to control of foreign assets in the hands of the President through the custodian so there might be a uniform national policy in the administration of the act edges strongly for federal determination of issues of rights in black assets. 
    In other words he felt that way that a consideration was the federal policy interest in that alien -- that -- trading with enemy act.

   Argument of Louis Fenner Claiborne

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Claiborne.
speaker="louis_fenner_claiborne" startTime="1876.743" stopTime="2109.210">
    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    The first question raised by the granting of the writ here, was the one of the power of the District Court to issue the stay order. 
    The question of appealability of that stay order, which has been discussed by opposing counsel, was expressly eliminated by the order of granting the writ, the order of this Court granting the writ. 
    As to the question whether the District Court had a right as a matter of power to grant the stay of proceedings before it, we had not anticipated that question. 
    In fact, we had conceded it before the District Court and before the Court of Appeal and only took it up at the invitation of this Court. 
    However, having once investigated it, we found that it was very doubtful, though not at all definite, whether this type of order, in this type of case was authorized, as distinct from the question of whether it was an abuse of discretion or not. 
    The jurisprudence of this Court, and that's all we've dealt with on this question, is to the effect that a court in an equitable proceeding, a court appealed to on the equity side, may grant such as a stay order. 
    It has been allowed also in cases involving admiralty, bankruptcy and even in a couple a law cases, strictly law cases as distinguished from admiralty or bankruptcy. 
    However, in those two cases, the only two law cases involved, the stay was found necessary only because of a necessary preliminary administrative ruling or because the statute involved directed that the preliminary determination be made by another agency before the question came before a court. 
    There is no ordinary civil case in which this Court has either authorized or directed a stay of proceedings. 
    There is, however, language in two cases to the affect that stay orders are authorized because of the inherent power of all courts to conduct their proceedings in orderly manner. 
    We invite this Court to a distinction here. 
    We grant the fact that every court is entitled to control the proceedings before it, whether it's sitting in law or sitting in equity, and of course to grant continues -- continuances to delay its decision in any case, for a reasonable time, for a proper cause. 
    And we don't think it makes any difference whether it delays its decision because it's curious to know what another tribunal in a similar case is going to do. 
    We think it would have been perfectly proper in this case, for the District Court to say there is another case pending in the Louisiana Supreme Court, which is going to pass on this question, it is only proper that we await that determination, which will not control ours, but which may guide ours and which may under the Erie versus Tompkins case, insofar as it's applicable to this case, even control this case. 
    But that is a very different thing from telling parties properly before the Court, we refuse to decide your case, go back to the State Court. 
    We'll leave it up to the State Court to decide this issue at least in your controversy.

    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    Well for several reasons. 
    First this suite unlike most of the suites in which this has -- this procedure has been authorized, does not in any way interfere with the administration of its own laws by the state. 
    This is not a proceeding to enjoin a state official from doing something. 
    It's not a proceeding to stop a pending state action. 
    It's not a proceeding to enjoin the collection of a tax. 
    There is no state action which is effected by this -- by a decision of the Federal District Court. 
    It's simply one of applying a local law to local circumstances, which is that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2369.521" stopTime="2371.782">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you have a question of construction?
speaker="louis_fenner_claiborne" startTime="2371.782" stopTime="2462.641">
    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    Well, as to whether or not its difficult to apply this law, it's alleged that this is an old law since 1900 and that it has never been interpreted in the last 59 years, that appears to be true, though no one knows whether the District Courts of Louisiana have applied this law many times or few times, it has never been appealed, that's all we can say. 
    However, it does not follow that because a law has not been interpreted, it's unclear. 
    We see nothing and clear about the law. 
    Furthermore we think it's easier for a court to determine the state law when there are no decisions then when there is a conflict, the confusion of decisions. 
    Here we have a law which as Your Honor said on its face is quite clear. 
    It reads very simply, the only pertinent thought of it is the first section which is quoted on Page 23 and 24 of the brief. 
    There are no serious questions that arise under it. 
    A lot has been manufactured as in every law case because they will be found or attempted to be found gaps, loopholes in the law. 
    All of those attacks on this, on the application of this particular law to the particular facts of this case were answered by memorandum filed in the District Court. 
    If this court is interested in the substance of those arguments, we'll be glad to furnish the court with copies.

    Your Honor the -- now I have to go somewhere out of the record, well this much is in the record here the city files its suit in State Court expecting to have the matter determined there. 
    The suit is removed to Federal Court, already one delay. 
    This is a condemnation suit, one that normally is handled speedily, concluded quickly. 
    It goes to the Federal Court, the judge takes a long time to decide whether he is going to decide it or not and finally decides that he is not going to decide which -- and tells us to go back to the State court and he tells us that we must obtain an interpretation by the Supreme Court of Louisiana of this particular statute before he will do another thing in the case.

    If we can obtained a declaratory judgment, which is what the District Judge suggest in the State court, suppose the declaration is in our favor, we can't appeal from the favorable ruling the company's attitudes throughout this whole proceeding, and I don't blame them for it, is to delay this expropriation as long as possible. 
    They quite legitimately would refuse to appeal it. 
    This Louisiana Supreme Court would have no occasion to pass on it.

    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    We appealed, the city appealed Your Honor, I believe simply on the question of whether the stay order was proper enough. 
    Now to get back to the practical considerations Your Honor the city has had to float a bond issue anticipating this expropriation. 
    It had to make commitments. 
    Now I am going outside of the record in this respect, but it is understandable that this would be involved in an expropriation by a municipality necessarily involved. 
    All of that has had to wait for over two years since this action was filed and the only reason for that delay has been because of the stay order entered in the District Court proceedings. 
    Now whether we could go back to State Court itself is a question, quite outside of getting to Louisiana Supreme Court to pass on it, there is a question whether the District Court would accept the case.

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2839.872" stopTime="2843.701">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, that wouldn't have prevented you asking the judge --
speaker="louis_fenner_claiborne" startTime="2843.701" stopTime="2977.150">
    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    Well, it's not so much a matter of the bond, Your Honor. 
    Here -- the situation is this in Thibodaux. 
    We have a municipality which has extended its boundaries. 
    In this new -- it furnishes electricity to the people in the old area. 
    It naturally wants to extend its municipal system to the new area. 
    It attempted to purchase and was unsuccessful. 
    The only solution is to expropriate. 
    In the meantime it's giving all the benefits of the city to these new residents and not getting it back from them the high electric rates which go to pay for the city service, so the city (Inaudible) money. 
    On the other hand the money that it got from its residents through the bond issue has been accruing interest, but they built a substation which they can't use until such time this matter is decided. 
    Now I wish to emphasize if I may the difference between this case and the two cases which have preceeded it on at least two grounds. 
    First here there is no as distinguished in the first case, no constitutional issue involved. 
    Any constitutional -- federal constitutional question, the only one that has been raised is the question of impairment of contract. 
    Well now that question was decided by this court in 1848 in the West River Bridge versus Dix case. 
    It was very clearly decided that a franchise was property and was subject to expropriation. 
    A few years later in the Water-Supply Company it was decided that a contract between the city and a company to furnish all power -- or water in that case was likewise property subject to expropriation. 
    There is no bonafide substantial federal constitutional question here. 
    So that there is no excuse to saying we will differ passing on the constitutional question because it maybe eliminated by a State Court interpretation of its own law.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2977.150" stopTime="2994.726">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But in gamut of obligation (Inaudible) depends so much on the conception of allegedly conflicting state laws and it's the state law (Inaudible)
speaker="louis_fenner_claiborne" startTime="2994.726" stopTime="2995.811">
    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    Well, Your Honor --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2995.811" stopTime="3004.919">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- strange, from my point of view, very strange construction as to what the state committed itself and they have got (Inaudible)
speaker="louis_fenner_claiborne" startTime="3004.919" stopTime="3120.319">
    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    Well, Your Honor here the only admitted claim of the company is a franchise which is a perfectly ordinary limited franchise to operate over the roads of the parish and put up their telephone poles and lines. 
    Now there is no question whatever in the jurisprudence of this Court but that that type of franchise even in this case, a limited franchise not an exclusive one, is subject to expropriation. 
    It was granted subject to the inherent right of the state and its municipality that delves into it to withdraw it and to inject that and say there's a constitutional question is possible in any case, but that is no excuse here for the refusal to decide the case. 
    Now also as distinguished for most of the cases and as distinguished from the two cases previously argued, there is here no conflict between state action and federal action. 
    This is not a suit to enjoin state officials of state action. 
    It is not a proceeding in equity. 
    It's a proceeding at law. 
    It is not -- the jurisdiction of the court is based on diversity. 
    Now, I know that federal jurisdiction should be a strong -- whether it's based on diversity or whether it's based on the existence of a federal question, but in a federal question case there is always the possibility that an interpretation of the state law involved will eliminate the federal question and therefore eliminate the federal jurisdiction while in a diversity case that possibility is impossible. 
    It doesn't exist for the reason that diversity jurisdiction was granted to federal courts after all to decide state law questions not federal questions. 
    Otherwise it would be unnecessary.

    Well I don't know that the distinction would have to be recognized by Louisiana law. 
    This Court in applying the doctrine of abstention in the Leiter case certainly recognized that the suit involved equitable relief at least insofar has it enjoined the state court proceeding then in progress. 
    Insofar as further more as Your Honor pointed out in the Leiter case there was a constitutional question which could be avoided under one interpretation of the statute and therefore it was appropriate to leave it to state courts to interpret it first.

    Unless we could find a – well, I think it would be safe to say that the city would have no claim to condemn the property if it goes, it must rely on statutory authority not being sovereign itself.

    Is there any case in which, that you know of, that you run into in which the district judge on his own motion did what this judge did?

    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    Well Your Honor it's difficult to tell from the -- some of the decisions whether the judge did it on his own motion or not but I had found none in which it is clear that the judge did on his own motion and I am persuaded that Judge Wright did it in this case because he had been reversed – finally reversed in the Leiter case. 
    In conclusion --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I thought that the question really should be decided by the state Supreme Court. 
    I would think that would be most likely (Inaudible) so I doubt if people decide (Inaudible)
speaker="louis_fenner_claiborne" startTime="3372.940" stopTime="3382.670">
    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    Well I think the judge was somewhat taken aback by the Leiter decision and quite understandably became less hesitant to decide state law questions thereafter.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible) I inferred what you said that he was -- that there was question in his mind in the construction --

    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    Well --

    -- a statute.
speaker="louis_fenner_claiborne" startTime="3393.033" stopTime="3432.645">
    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    Let me say this also, the judge's doubt was based partly on the opinion of the Attorney General which has been referred to, Louisiana Attorney General, which is cited in appendix in the brief of the petitioner. 
    Now the judge, and that was our fault in argument for the District Court, did not see the clear flaw in that opinion, that opinion makes no reference whatever to this particular act. 
    It is only to be assumed that the Attorney General or the Assistant Attorney General who signed the opinion did not find the statute when he advised another municipality in a similar case that it could not do what we are trying to do.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3432.645" stopTime="3443.397">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So he might, it is conceivable that even your Supreme Court might find might describe (Inaudible) that is conceivable isn't it?
speaker="louis_fenner_claiborne" startTime="3443.397" stopTime="3446.505">
    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    It is always conceivable, Your Honor but not very likely.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3446.505" stopTime="3449.758">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You mean you would never find a flaw in the decisions of lower court?
speaker="louis_fenner_claiborne" startTime="3449.758" stopTime="3537.755">
    Mr. Louis Fenner Claiborne 
    I wouldn't say that Your Honor, but in the opinion goes far beyond any flaw that our Supreme Court (Inaudible) If I may conclude with this quotation from public utilities commission of Ohio versus United Fuel Gas company an opinion written for a unanimous -- for the majority by Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointing out the times when you do, when the times when you don't issue these stay orders. 
    And in concluding in this particular case, Justice Frankfurter says the situation here is quite different from Railroad Commission versus Pullman Company, 312 U.S. 496, where the disposition of a doubtful question of local law might terminate the entire controversy and thus make it unnecessary to decide a substantial constitutional question considerations of equity justify a rule of abstention, but when as here, the litigation has already been in the Federal Court an inordinately long time which parenthetically is our situation, considerations of equity require that the litigation be brought to an end as quickly as possible. 
    Decree in this case --

    One last thought is that in considering this stay order, I think the Court should consider the reasonableness, assuming that it was proper at all in any sense to issue a stay order in such case.

    Mr. J. Raburn Monroe 
    First about the Declaratory Judgment Act, this Court held in the Leiter case that the Declaratory Judgment Act was an adequate remedy and I think a fair reading of it will show that it is, it's a model to the Declaratory Judgment Act. 
    The city cites a section which has to do with moot cases where the case is moot and the Court doesn't have to decide, well that's a usual rule, but I think a consideration of it will show that it's adequate.
