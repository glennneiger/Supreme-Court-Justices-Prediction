California v. Washington
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="13.521">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 12, Original, State of California, Plaintiff, versus the State of Washington. 
    Mr. Howland, had you completed your opening argument? 
    If not, you may proceed.
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="13.521" stopTime="166.565">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    No, Your Honor, I have not. 
    May it please the Court. 
    Last evening at the recess, I have just completed my demonstration of the manner in which Washington, the State of Washington in a discriminatory manner that does everything possible to destroy the economic incentive of the 4800 retail licensees in that State who are authorized to sell at California as well as the wines of other origins. 
    I turn now to the matter on which directly affects the interest of the State of California and the cause of action which the State of California has in its own right. 
    And this has to do with the discriminations practiced by the State of Washington in connection with sales promotion work, having to do, of course, with the sale of wine. 
    Now, if I may, I would like to define what I mean by sales promotion. 
    I am not talking about advertising. 
    By advertising, I mean the use of newspapers and other printed media, television, radio for advertising purposes. 
    By sales promotion, I mean essentially, personal contact work with prospective buyers. 
    I mean the dissemination of product information in such form that it can be used in retail stores. 
    This product information is sometimes known in this trade as point of sale material, graphic sales aids, posters, displays, bottle holders, racks for the display of merchandise. 
    It also -- wine being of the nature that it is, it also includes such things as wine selection charts, showing the proper use or the preferred use of various types of wine. 
    And it also because wine is -- is used to a large extent in cooking, it also includes recipe books and that sort of thing. 
    Now, so far as Washington wine is concerned, the State of Washington places no limitation on sales promotion activity on behalf of the sale of Washington wine. 
    But with respect to California wine, again, Washington law is completely merciless in the flatness of its prohibition against sales promotion work on behalf of California wine. 
    And again, because this discrimination is so apparent on the face of the statutes of the State and the regulations of the State Liquor Board, I should like to read a brief excerpt.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is there any conflict between you and the Attorney General of Washington that Washington in fact purposed discrimination against California wine? 
    Is that contested in this case? Or is the question merely whether Washington can promote its own wine industry?
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="187.163" stopTime="191.958">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    Well, the issue -- the -- our contention, sir, is that the State of Washington may not discriminate --

    Yes.

    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    Well, for purposes of this argument, the -- my friend, the Attorney General conceives that purposes of this argument, the allegations of the complaint must be taken to be true.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="209.206" stopTime="210.854">

    Yes.

    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    I don't think, Your Honor, that there is any substantial dispute concerning factual issues in this case.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you can start off from there, couldn't you?

    Very nearly.

    Very briefly, Your Honor.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="229.319" stopTime="232.795">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So what -- what constitutional provision do you rely on?
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="232.795" stopTime="247.019">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    We're -- we rely on the violation of Commerce Clause, the violation of the Privilege and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2 and we say that there is no sanction for those violations to be found in the Twenty-first Amendment.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="247.019" stopTime="247.860">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    No sanction?
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="247.860" stopTime="248.472">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    No, sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="248.472" stopTime="259.144">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, does the Twenty-first Amendment give Washington the right and power to dispose of liquors and wines that it sees fit? 
    Is that the issue between you?
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="259.144" stopTime="293.617">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    No, sir. 
    The -- the issue on that point is, as far as I'm concerned, the Twenty-first Amendment simply has no application to this case because we do not protest against any regulation or other Act of the State of Washington having to do with the transportation or the importation of liquor into the State of Washington. 
    And this, of course, is the entire subject matter of the Twenty-first Amendment. 
    The Twenty-first Amendment as Your Honor knows says that the transportation or importation of intoxicating liquor into a State in violation of its laws is prohibited.

speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="298.217" stopTime="308.081">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    This is true. 
    But the discriminations that we complain of, sir, occur only after California wine has been lawfully imported into Washington by the State Liquor Control Board.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="308.081" stopTime="319.472">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Does Washington keep it out altogether? 
    Keep -- keep out California wine and allow the vending, to sale, exclusively, of Washington wine?

    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    Well, sir that is not this case. 
    If it were this case, I would take the position that that was not authorized by the Congress --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why isn't it very near this case if -- if Washington has -- was granted power by the Twenty-first Amendment to have a liquor business as it saw fit without regard of the liquor from any other place or any other town, how could it not be limited to its own people, production or limited to production -- any production (Inaudible) if they're given exclusive power by that Amendment to control the liquor ban without regard with the Commerce Clause and the other clauses?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That s why, Mr. (Inaudible) you said you're going to address yourself to it briefly. 
    That implies that it's so obvious or so predominantly obvious that you don't have to pay much attention to it.
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="398.578" stopTime="442.874">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    Well, I think that the -- the -- we have referred to these matters in our -- in our opening brief. 
    But, so far as the -- as the substantive law of the case is concerned, I think we have demonstrated that on the language of the Amendment, in the light of the Court's decisions to date, that we have here presented the Court with an open question for which there is no precedent to be found in the decisions of this Court. 
    This is a question of -- of the utmost constitutional gravity. 
    As I shall demonstrate in a moment, it is of the utmost consequence to the State of California and its economy. 
    The matters cannot be summarily treated.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="442.874" stopTime="454.255">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But it's decisive, is it not, if it decided one more here, it disposes of any reason to go any further, was that not true?
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="454.255" stopTime="466.952">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    It -- in the broad sense of the word, that is correct. 
    And when I say in the broad sense of the word, there are a number of related questions. 
    It is not just one question. 
    The --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="466.952" stopTime="488.613">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But the question, so far as I'm concerned at this time in that -- on that Amendment, the question whether the -- the Twenty-first Amendment was designedly intended. 
    The -- it was -- whether it was intended to leave the States, free to handle liquor ban to keep the Federal Government out of it entirely on any -- any score on any basis.
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="488.613" stopTime="506.836">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    Well, I'm quite confident, sir, that that was not the intendment. 
    The intendment of the Twenty-first Amendment as -- was nicely -- it was concisely put in the brief of the State of New York was to make dry States dryer not wet States wetter. 
    The intendment of --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="506.836" stopTime="507.755">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Who said that?
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="507.755" stopTime="512.832">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    That's in the brief of the State of New York in describing the effect in the intendment of --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="512.832" stopTime="527.650">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did I recall that New York within the State was the most insistent that before that Amendment was adopted through the effect that everything that -- that should be able to appeal, everything should be left to the State to decide the matters if so fit.
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="527.650" stopTime="527.754">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    Well --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="527.754" stopTime="532.659">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- that State I think came to the main arguments in favor of that claim.
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="532.659" stopTime="623.084">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    In this case, may I say, the State of California makes no argument for any limitation on the power of any State to exclusively determine its own policy with respect to liquor, whether that be a policy of prohibition, of partial prohibition or of no prohibition. 
    Whatever policy a State sees fit to make, we will defend the right of the States to adopt their policy free from interference from other States and free from interference from the Federal Government. 
    The question about the Twenty-first Amendment very briefly is simply this, that for 60 years, this Court was confronted by a series of cases in which it appeared that the Commerce Clause, what this Court has called the immunity characteristic of the Commerce Clause was used to prevent dry States or States that were partially dry from preventing the influx of liquor from other States into their jurisdiction. 
    It was consistently held right down to the -- the adoption of The Webb-Kenyon Act in 1913. 
    Then, when the Twenty-first Amendment came along, the intendment of the Twenty-first Amendment, I don't think there's any question about this, the intendment of the Twenty-first Amendment was to assist dry States or States that had a policy of partial or total exclusion of liquor to aid them and to make that policy effective.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="623.084" stopTime="642.806">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Inaudible) a little more than that. 
    The intendment was to do away with prohibition as a national doctrine, and as a national law and to leave it up to the State to determine wholly for itself what would happen in its boundaries of reference to the sale of intoxicating liquors if anything.
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="642.806" stopTime="688.185">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    I would prefer to -- to state it this way Mr. Justice Black, the Twenty-first Amendment did not accept in its precise phraseology, in any way detract from the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. 
    The Twenty-first Amendment had to the peculiar effect of make it -- making it impossible for Congress to repeal its Webb-Kenyon Act. 
    The prohibition against Congress in 1913 had said that the transportation of liquor into a State in violation of the laws of that State shall be unlawful It said that in statute. 
    The Twenty-first Amendment elevated that to a constitutional status.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="688.185" stopTime="716.971">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But isn't that the essential nature of the -- isn't that the essence of the question namely, whether the Twenty-first Amendment limited itself to the old cases -- I'm doing the old cases In re Rahrer and so on or whether, and it's so often of a case, when Congress begins to deal with the subject either by statute or submission of an amendment, it goes beyond the cases of this Court which it seeks to affect. 
    Isn't that the real question in this case?
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="716.971" stopTime="718.473">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    That could be a question.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="718.473" stopTime="725.724">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, it -- not could be, isn't it? 
    I'm not saying -- I'm not suggesting the (Inaudible)

speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="740.397" stopTime="762.760">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    No, but then we have -- we have -- but that would raise the further problem of how far beyond those cases and in what respect it goes beyond those cases. 
    Take for example the -- it has been said that since the Twenty-first Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause no longer applies to liquor legislation. 
    Well, this is obviously not the law.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="762.760" stopTime="763.301">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why?
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="763.301" stopTime="788.456">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    Because this Court in Goesaert against Cleary debated and decided a question in which the sole issue was equal protection of the laws or the -- of the fourth -- the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to certain liquor regulations of the State of Michigan. 
    So that if your statute has to do that with the internal liquor administration of the State's laws, there is equal protection.

    It has no application to this case. 
    The decisions of this Court to date of the four cases, Young's Market, the Triner case, the retaliation cases, all have to do with state laws that directly regulated or prohibited the importation of liquor.

    What you're saying --

    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    -- through the Washington statute, that makes the Washington State Liquor Board the only lawful transporter or importer of liquor into that State.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="912.633" stopTime="932.728">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I am saying that the Twenty-first Amendment isn't so all-inclusive that no other provisions of Constitution, such as when treating New York and California different, in showing the preference from New York and against California is within the scope of the Twenty-first Amendment, that is your position?
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="932.728" stopTime="1183.013">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    That is my position. 
    Yes, sir. 
    The Washington wineries, if I may return to the matter of the sales promotion program, the Washington wineries not only promote the sale of their own respective brands of Washington wine, they also do institutional promotion. 
    And by institutional promotions, I mean, promoting the sale of Washington wine generically, without respect to any particular brand or trade name. 
    And the promotion work that is in fact done in the State of Washington, is done at the wholesale level through the 135 private wholesalers of Washington wine. 
    This actually is the only efficient way to conduct this type on operation. 
    There are only a 135 wholesalers as against 4800 retailers. 
    And the key to this type of promotional work, of course, is the manpower of the wholesaler's organizations, the personal and frequent contacts which the salesmen have are with the retailers. 
    And it's the economic existence of these Washington retailers that makes possible the kind of sales promotion that Washington does. 
    Now, that is precisely the kind of an activity that the State of California through its own official agencies has been carrying on for 20 years. 
    To date, the State has spent about $25,000,000 in this activity and its current activity is at the rate of about $2,700,000 a year. 
    California maintains representatives all over the United States, 19 of them outside the State of California. 
    We have an office in New York City, one in Chicago and in this promotion work, the State devices promotional programs to use a commercial term. 
    These are -- these are very frequently seasonal in their nature. 
    The State has a contract with -- with the advertising agency. 
    And these graphic sales aids, posters, colored photographs, store displays and so forth are all designed for a particular promotion. 
    When one of these comes on, the state representatives contact every wholesaler in their area. 
    They instruct the wholesaler's salesmen in the use of this particular promotional material and the wholesaler's salesmen then in the -- their routine contact with the retailers take this material around, distribute it, set it up in the stores and so on. 
    This is exactly what Washington wineries do in the State of Washington. 
    This is exactly what the State of California does all over the United States except in Washington. 
    And the reason we cannot do it in Washington is, of course, the practical effect of these Washington statutes which I have referred to yesterday. 
    It is this projection of the official functions of California beyond its borders. 
    This actual interstate activity or interstate intercourse in which California is engaged, is what gives California undeniable standing to sue in this case. 
    In the brief of the State of Washington, the point is made that while this activity is conducted actually by an agency of the State of California, that actually a -- the Washington position is that it is on behalf of -- of the -- the California wine industry. 
    And I should like to address myself to this point for a moment because that is not true. 
    The California sales promotion program is exclusively in aid of the State's own statewide policy.

    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    Well, I -- I was about to differentiate the difference between the State's own interest and the obvious benefits from the state program, which in your -- to the wine industry. 
    No one, it would be silly to deny that the wine industry benefits from this activity of the State. 
    But the State's motivation is not simply to help a few private businessmen. 
    The State's motivation principally, is to protect its own unique agricultural structure. 
    Agriculture is not only the biggest business in California. 
    It is peculiarly dependent upon free access to the markets of the country. 
    I think that there is no State in the United States that is so peculiarly dependent for -- for at least in the food stuffs in the kind of agricultural products that is directly consumed by humans. 
    There is no State comparable to California in its dependence upon free markets. 
    California produces a third of all the commercial fruits, a quarter of all the commercial vegetables. 
    It's quite true that in recent months, we in California, as well as our friends in Texas have had to take the back seat, statistically, so far as the size of a State is concerned. 
    Alaska has got us both (Inaudible)

    There may be some question arise to some of the lesser industries where if -- that whether or not that would be true. 
    In this case, it is not a question because of all the products that California raises, grapes are the largest and most valuable single crop produced for human consumption.

    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    -- a wide -- wide variation there.

    And that was a question of whether or not, a hypothetical question, of whether or not if a suit were brought by a different plaintiff, on a different cause of action, from a practical point of view, there would be some relief to the State of California. 
    This is a legal possibility. 
    Anything is possible. 
    The practical point of view, it is most unlikely, and I should like to briefly say why. 
    In all of the Court's prior decisions dealing with its original jurisdiction, the question has not been, “Can this plaintiff get relief at the instance of suit by another plaintiff?” 
    The question before that this Court has previously considered was whether or not there was an alternative for a different trial court for this particular plaintiff to take his cause of action to. 
    There are a great many situations in the law where an injury, a fact, results in common injury to many and simply because one injured party doesn't or hasn't sued, has never been considered to be a reason why an -- the -- another injured party could not sue on his own cause of action.

    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    The point -- the point I -- I should like to make is that there -- there -- that a California wine producer seeking to bring that action against the State of Washington has really got problems. 
    If he is a California wine producer, whose wine is now being sold in Washington, having disposed of his complete right, title and interest when he sells that wine to the Washington State Liquor Board, does he have any standing to sue as to what the State Liquor Board does with that wine after he has voluntarily committed it to them? 
    If the California winery was one of the many who does not have any of its wine sold in the State of Washington, then on what can it complain? 
    In what respect has it been injured? 
    I simply suggest that there are greater problems here in formulating a suit by a private litigant.

    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    I don't -- I don't think that there is any disputed question of fact in this case. 
    I think that this case if it couldn't be submitted on the pleadings that we would be able to stipulate with our friends from Washington upon facts. 
    And I should like to call the Court's attention to the opinion of the Court in the Pennsylvania Railroad case, Georgia against Pennsylvania Railroad, where in the dissenting opinion it was pointed out that the reason why this Court is concerned about its original jurisdiction, and the reason why a Court looks at the possibility of an alternative forum is because of the relatively heavy demands upon the time of this Court in cases where it must evaluate the evidence even if it's been referred out to (Inaudible) 
    And I simply suggest that in this case where there is no substantial issue of fact that that reason or -- or that line of reason has no application.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1834.091" stopTime="1845.347">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Howland, one -- one thing that bothers me is this that as you know, there are a tremendous number of trade barriers throughout the country.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And I suppose there are very few States that are not affected adversely by one or another or maybe many of those trade barriers or so. 
    Now, does your argument lead us to the conclusion that if any trade barrier raised by a State adversely affects any segment of the economy of another, does that gives the State the right to bring an original action against the other in this Court?
speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="1882.047" stopTime="1883.247">

    Not in all circumstances.

speaker="wallace_howland" startTime="1891.486" stopTime="1918.967">
    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    In -- well, in this – in this case, it can be drawn on the basis of the -- this extraordinary thing in the American economy of a State through its own official agencies going out and itself engaging in interstate commerce with its activities being intermeshed and intertwined with those of private industry. 
    So that in this case, we actually have the State's own cause of action. 
    Now, this does not occur very often.

    Mr. Wallace Howland 
    Certainly. 
    And this -- this Court has more than once rejected the -- the task of trying to definitively define its original jurisdiction. 
    There could be other cases. 
    But I say that -- that this is not opening up Pandora's box because this is the first time in the history of this Court that the case with the State's own cause of action built into it, that we have here, has never been submitted. 
    The -- that is where this case differs from the parens patriae cases. 
    This is a parens patriae case but we also have the State of California being denied its own constitutional rights because of the effect of the Washington statutes, the Washington discriminatory system upon the State's trade promotion program. 
    And this -- this is a fact in this case. 
    It's a situation of that -- well, I can say that it's never been presented to the Court before.

    It has been pointed out, California has 85% of the national market including wines from other countries. 
    There are four States that engage in some wine-producing activity, New York, Ohio, Michigan, Washington, roughly in that order. 
    California sells 45% of the wine consumed in the State of Washington. 
    The domestic winery sell 50%, other wine in the States and foreign wine from out of the United States comprise 5%. 
    The total consumption is slightly in excess of 2,000,000 million gallons per year.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2689.559" stopTime="2694.306">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you know what the dollar volume is Mr. Attorney General?
speaker="john_j_oconnell" startTime="2694.306" stopTime="3273.044">
    Mr. John J. O'Connell 
    I do not, Your Honor. 
    I have it some place but it isn't immediately available. 
    Washington by statute and regulations confined, first of all, it's a monopoly State. 
    All liquor is involved with the State of Washington. 
    Hard liquor, if I might use that expression, distilled spirits have to be sold through a state monopoly store. 
    Beer can be sold anywhere without regard to the state monopoly store. 
    The statutes make a distinction on domestic and non-domestic wine.Domestic wine can be sold directly through a wholesaler to a retail. 
    Non-domestic wine has to be sold through the State Monopoly Board. 
    The only purchaser directly of non-domestic wine in the State of Washington is the State Liquor Control Board. 
    In this instance, it buys California wine in California F.O.B. 
    It ships it to its warehouse within the State of Washington. 
    It disperses without further costs to its various retail store outlets around the State from which it is purchased by the eventual consumer. 
    The argument of California in regard to original jurisdiction is basically threefold. 
    Number one, they say that the pure governmental interest of the State of California is restrictive. 
    Number two, they say they have the responsibility by the declarations of their legislature to commence and initiate actions of this kind. 
    Number three, they say because of the possible damage to their private citizens by the activities of the State of Washington, they have the duty to bring suit in a quasi-sovereign capacity. 
    California urges that this case in regard to original jurisdiction is unique. 
    It's unique in its factual pattern as perhaps all cases are. 
    But it is certainly not unique to this Court in its question of original jurisdiction. 
    In answer to California's argument, number one, that they had a pure governmental interest involved in this case, it is our position that the agency of the State of California created through its agricultural code and a marketing order which sort of puts the State, if you please, in the wine business. 
    We contend that our statutes and our regulations have nothing to do with the official arm of the State of California. 
    All of our regulations are directed to manufacturers, seller, wholesalers. 
    They can't do this or that in regard to non-domestic wine. 
    California by its very constitution prohibits the State of California from being a manufacturer or a seller of wine. 
    How in the world then, if California contends that this arm of the State of California is the State of California in its sovereign capacity, how in the world then does the State of Washington restrict the activities of the State of California? 
    Of course, we do not. 
    Nor is this quibbling on our part. 
    We do believe if the State is suing in a purely proprietary or government capacity it must stand and fall as an individual, integral party plaintiff in that regard. 
    However, California alleges that because of the effect of our regulations on its private businessmen, they are somewhat affected because their whole program is disturbed by our specific regulations or statutes that refer to their private citizens. 
    We have cited to Your Honors to many cases in this regard specifically if California has any interest because of that indirect connection at all. 
    We have cited the Georgia versus Tennessee Copper case, where the State of Georgia claimed it had some interest because its rules were being eroded by the action of the noxious gases of the Tennessee Company. 
    This Court calls such interest to make way similarly, in Georgia versus Pennsylvania. 
    The interest of the State as the owner of a railroad or of many -- the owner of many institutions needing railroad services this Court also called such an alleged direct interest make way. 
    We have referred Your Honors to the case in this regard of Oklahoma versus Cook which we think somewhat directly parallels this instant case. 
    In the case of Oklahoma versus Cook, by the Oklahoma statutes, the State itself brought an action following the insolvency of a bank against the shareholders of the bank for the benefit of creditors. 
    California, in its briefs states this, the wine sales promotion activities of the State are those of a commercial or industrial organization promoting nationwide sales of its products. 
    In the Oklahoma case, the Court said the protection of depositors of insolvent state banks as a distinct economic policy of the State Oklahoma. 
    And our court said this, “We must look beyond the mere legal title of the complaining State to the cause of action asserted into the nature of the State's interest further. 
    But this principle does not go so far as to permit resort to our original jurisdiction in the name of the State, but in reality, for the benefit of particular individuals.” 
    Albeit, the State assert economic interest in the claims and declare their enforcement to be a matter of state policy. 
    California's second argument can be quickly disposed of, in our opinion. 
    The legislative declarations of the legislature of California have urged the proper officials of California and the Attorney General of California to bring actions to a limit -- to eliminate trade barriers with -- with specific reference to the wine industry, now under consideration. 
    Of course, this argument has been early answered and often answered by this Court. 
    An individual state legislature cannot give it state power of its state powers that would cause it to have an original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court. 
    This Court is the decider of that issue. 
    The early case was that of New Hampshire versus Louisiana, a case again similar was the case just cited the case of Oklahoma versus Cook. 
    California must have this power or this right of original jurisdiction directly in her own right and not because of anything, her legislature however, impelling that might be to the people of California. 
    The third argument of California is that it has original jurisdiction because of the economic interest of its citizens. 
    We have done a little mathematics in our brief in regard to the amount or the quantum of this interest affected. 
    And we assume but that by some wizardry, the State of California would gather in the entire Washington State wine market. 
    And we compared the amount that would be in comparison to the general farming economy of the State of California and the economic impact assuming this unlikely fact of total appropriation of the Washington wine industry or the Washington wine market is 18 thousands of 1%. 
    That is the impact on the farm economy of the State of California.

    California's rate of consumption, for example, is twice that of the State of Washington.

    In relation to the same question, the economic interest of the State of California, suing a quasi-sovereign capacity as parens patriae, there are many cases as the Court well knows. 
    These cases generally have three requirements Number one; the injury or threatened injury must be to all the, or a substantial portion of the State's citizens. 
    Number two the threat must be to the health, safety and general welfare of those citizens. 
    Number three; the invasion must be of serious magnitude. 
    The Court well knows that most of these cases divide themselves into three groups boundary, disputes, water diversion cases and cases of pollution or public nuisance. 
    In all of these of cases, the Court explored the facts thoroughly in order to find a genuine sovereign interest, a fact that would seem to be lacking in this case. 
    The two cases --

    Mr. John J. O'Connell 
    It might under some circumstances. 
    If I might point this out a little further, Your Honor, and take the two cases that are a little bit different than the standard, quasi-sovereign cases, that's Pennsylvania versus West Virginia and Georgia versus Pennsylvania. 
    In Pennsylvania versus West Virginia, West Virginia restricted the interstate transportation of its natural gas, to Pennsylvania and Ohio, States that had been using that natural gas in their industry and then their homes for many, many years. 
    And this is what this Court said about the magnitude or the impact of that invasion. 
    The private consumers in each State not only include most of the inhabitants of many urban communities but constitute a substantial portion of the State's population. 
    Their health, comfort and welfare are seriously jeopardized by the threatened withdrawal of the gas from the interstate stream. 
    This is a matter of grave public concern in which the State as the representative of the public has an interest apart from that of the individuals affected. 
    And in Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad, this is what the Court said in regard to the magnitude of the matter involved.Georgia as a representative of the public is complaining of her role which they have proven limits the opportunities of her people, shackles her industries, retards her development and relegates her to an inferior economic position among her sister States. 
    These are matters of grave public concern in which Georgia has an interest apart from that of the particular individuals who may be affected. 
    And indeed, in these two somewhat extensions of the basic quasi-sovereign cases, the Court can readily see how strong the impact of the invasion laws on those two cases. 
    In the instant case if I submit, this invasion -- this impact, this magnitude does not exist. 
    We say that the real parties and interest in this case is not the State of California. 
    The real party and interest is the private wine industry of California and I submit, perhaps only the larger or the most important, of these particular wine. 
    Finally --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3646.697" stopTime="3649.768">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think they would have standing in the New York or State Court?
speaker="john_j_oconnell" startTime="3649.768" stopTime="3782.530">
    Mr. John J. O'Connell 
    I do indeed, sir. 
    And in that regard, we argue that this Court is not the proper forum to decide the matters in this case. 
    In Louisiana versus Texas, this Court said jurisdictions, they gave original jurisdiction is a so delicate and grave in character that it was not contemplated that it would be exercised, save when the necessity was absolute. 
    The original jurisdiction of this Court is sparingly, carefully and gravely given. 
    I am not one to speak with authority on the dockets of this Court but may I say this, commodity commissions of the type involved here are a growing thing. 
    The number runs in my mind in the State of California in the amount of 47. 
    I don't claim that to be wholly accurate but I know that there are dozens of these commissions engaged in the trade promotion, advertising and research activities of the various products they are designed to promote. 
    These products are principally in interstate commerce particularly with respect to California. 
    These products in the main, will go outside the State of California. 
    I can speak for our State which is new in this commodity commission way of doing business. 
    We already, although we started much later than in California, have seven of these commissions. 
    I could imagine if jurisdiction were granted in this instance that any group of citizens engaged in the business of any kind can find a denying State to act in a so -- somewhat governmental capacity towards them. 
    And finding, thereby, some discrimination in some State of the Union to which they export, come to this Court and on the basis of finding an original jurisdiction, herein, ask the Court for an original jurisdiction.

   Argument of Thomas R. Garlington
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4089.390" stopTime="4090.672">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Garlington.
speaker="thomas_r_garlington" startTime="4090.672" stopTime="5014.801">
    Mr. Thomas R. Garlington 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I shall address myself to the question of whether or not California has stated the cause of action. 
    This assumes that somehow, the Court has determined there is original jurisdiction, so far as their capacity is concerned. 
    It is our position she has not stated the cause of action. 
    Now, of course, the complaint of the State of California is that the particular statutes and regulations, restricting her wine in our State, violate two constitutional provisions, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2 and the Commerce Clause. 
    If I may first briefly address myself to the first of these points the Privileges and Immunities Clause. 
    So as far as we can see, this clause is -- or provision is simply not available to the State of California. 
    As Your Honors know, the Eleventh Amendment prohibits all suits against the State by or for citizens of other States, New Hampshire versus Louisiana. 
    Therefore, California has been put in a position of bringing this action in a quasi-sovereign capacity. 
    Now, this is important and material to the question of privileges and immunities because we have to examine the capacity in which California brings this suit to see if it's a person or a citizen within the protection of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. 
    What is the capacity, that of California? 
    She has likened her capacity to that of Georgia. 
    In Georgia versus Tennessee Copper Company where -- Mr. Justice Holmes described it, in that capacity the State has an interest independent of and behind the title of its citizens in all the air, earth and within its domain. 
    And again and again, the Court has defined this quasi-sovereign interest as being an interest apart from that of the individual's concern. 
    So clearly, California, as a sovereign State, is bringing this as a State, not as a group of citizens. 
    Now, accordingly, the Privileges and Immunities Clause is not applicable to this suit. 
    It is a protection afforded only natural persons. 
    I think an interesting case in this regard is Bank of Augusta versus Earle. 
    There, the Bank of Georgia Corporation was seeking to sustain its right to exercise corporate powers in another State, namely Alabama. 
    And that right to exercise these corporate powers outside its own State was challenged. 
    It invoked the Privileges and Immunities Clause. 
    And it was there held -- well first, the argument on behalf of the bank was that if all it's members of the corporation were rather than of Georgia and they were within the protection of the Privileges and Immunities Clause then the corporation should be, too. 
    That was rejected and it was held there that the corporation, not being a natural person was not within the protection of the clause. 
    And excellent discussion of the nature of the clause is contained against Paul versus Virginia, decided in 1868 where the Court said, “The term citizens as used applies only to natural persons, members of the body politic owing allegiance to the State, not to artificial persons created by the legislature possessing only the attribute -- attributes which the legislature has prescribed.” 
    In Blake against McClung, a case involving an insolvency statute where residents of the State were preferred over non-residents. 
    The Court held that it -- there was a violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause with respect to natural persons residing out of Tennessee but the foreign corporation could not avail itself of that provision. 
    Accordingly, it would seem that through this clear line of authority, California, not being a natural person, may not invoke the Privileges and Immunities Clause. 
    And on authority of Hill versus District of Columbia which we have cited in our brief, we would suggest that she cannot invoke it, invoke this provision since she is not within the class of persons with respect to whom the alleged acts of Washington are unconstitutional. 
    Now, I will discuss the Twenty-first Amendment. 
    I wish only to add before leaving the Privileges and Immunities Clause that what I shall say of the Twenty-first Amendment with respect to the Commerce Clause, applies equally to the Privileges and Immunities Clause namely the Twenty-first Amendment has taken the restrictive and regulatory acts of a State with respect to imported liquor outside these provisions of the Constitution. 
    Now, with respect to the Commerce Clause, it is said that not only is our legislation and regulations a burden but it is discriminatory with respect to California wine which squarely presents the question of the effect of the Twenty-first Amendment. 
    In it's brief, and as I understand it today, California has contended that the true meaning of the Twenty-first Amendment is still in doubt. 
    Suggested that what courts -- what this Court has said in the past with respect to the Twenty-first Amendment is mostly dicta. 
    It implied that this Court has never adequately considered the Twenty-first Amendment or it's economic significance. 
    Well, this is certainly not so. 
    The Amendment has been carefully and fully considered by this Court. 
    The arguments of California in this case, as many of Your Honors know, are mere repetitions of ones that have been made many times before. 
    In the course of its brief, California has contended, as I understand its contentions, that the Twenty-first Amendment should apply only to imports into dry States. 
    That the Amendment prohibits imports of liquor into a State only when, in violation of proper or reasonable state laws, rather than state laws, as the Amendment reads. 
    That finally, that somehow the Webb-Kenyon Act was overlooked by this Court when it first construed the Twenty-first Amendment. 
    Now, I find the complete answer to all of these contentions in the State Border of Equalization of California versus Young's Market Company. 
    Therein, Justice Brandeis did a remarkable thing in that he set up each of these contentions in concise language and answered each in concise, clear, understandable language. 
    I can't improve on his language and if the Court will indulge me, I should like to refer to some of it because it is so completely applicable to this case. 
    There, the Court held -- what the plaintiff's complaint of is the refusal to let them import beer. 
    Now, of course, this case involved a license fee for the privilege of importing beer into the State of California. 
    It squarely presented the meaning of the Twenty-first Amendment to the Court. 
    The Court held, what the plaintiff's complaint of is the refusal to let them import beer without paying for the privilege of importation. 
    Prior to the Twenty-first Amendment, it would obviously been unconstitutional to impose a fee for that privilege. 
    The position would have been -- would have been void, not because it resulted in discrimination but -- but because that he was a direct burden on commerce. 
    The Amendment which prohibited the transportation or importation of intoxicating liquors into any State in violation of the laws ,thereof, abrogated the right to import free, so far as concerns intoxicating liquor. 
    Now, Justice Brandeis gave the basic construction to the Amendment. 
    He said, “The words used are apt to confer upon the State the power to forbid all importations which do not comply with the conditions which it prescribes.” 
    I think the word, “conditions” are important. 
    Then, he analyzed the contentions of the plaintiff. 
    He said the plaintiffs asked us to limit this broad command. 
    They request us to construe the Amendment, they're saying in effect, the State may prohibit the importation of liquors, providing it prohibits the manufacture and stay within its borders. 
    That's one of the contentions that I understand, of California. 
    It only applies to the dry States. 
    But if it permits such manufacture and sale, then it must compete on equal terms with the domestic intoxicants. 
    To say this would involve not a construction of the Amendment but a rewriting of it. 
    Then he answers the question that the -- the contention that the state regulation must be reasonable. 
    Plaintiff argued that, despite the Amendment, the State may not regulate importations except for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety or morals. 
    The importer's license fee was not imposed to that end. 
    Same contention that California has made here. 
    Surely, the State may adopt the lesser degree of regulations said Justice Brandeis, than total prohibition. 
    Can it be doubted that a State might establish a state monopoly of the manufacture and sale of beer and either prohibit all competing importations or discourage importation by levying a heavy impost or channelize desired importations by confining them to a single consignee. 
    And in that last language, of course, he identified the practices of the State of Washington in confining our imports to the single consignee, of namely, the State Liquor Board. 
    Then with respect to the charge that the Court had overlooked the Webb-Kenyon Act, Justice Brandeis said, “As we think the language of the Amendment is clear, we do not discuss these matters.” 
    Referring to the prior interpretations given the Webb-Kenyon Act which being an Act of Congress, was not subject to the same rules of construction as the constitutional amendment. 
    He said, the claim that the statutory provisions and the regulations are void under the Equal Protection Clause may be briefly disposed of, classification recognized by the Twenty-first Amendment cannot be deemed forbidden by the Fourteenth. 
    Well, since this case, Young's Market case, involved and required the construction of the meaning of the Twenty-first Amendment, it did not constitute dicta, merely because the principles announced in construing this Amendment governed other fact patterns certainly does not mean that it was dicta. 
    These determinations were given in response to contentions made in the case and were necessary to the case. 
    And the principles laid down there by Justice Brandeis are the law and not dicta. 
    Now, California in the face of Young's Market case says our case is different in that it involved discrimination whereas Young's Market case did not. 
    But California has, in this respect, overlooked Indianapolis Brewing Company versus the Liquor Control Commission. 
    That case involved a Michigan Act which prohibited local dealers from selling beer manufactured in another State that discriminated against Michigan. 
    This was clearly a discrimination type law and the very worst type with respect to the Commerce Clause. 
    It was a clear burden and a discrimination on interstate commerce. 
    It was contended that it did violate the Commerce Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The Court held for whatever its character, the law is valid. 
    Since the Twenty-first Amendment was held in the Young's Market Company case, the right of a State to prohibit or regulate the importation of intoxicating liquor is not limited by the Commerce Clause. 
    Another clear case of discrimination was that involved in Joseph S. Finch and Co. versus McKittrick, also decided in 1939 by District Justice Brandeis, involving the Michigan's and Missouri's statute, which is similar to the other -- at which I described prohibited imports from States that discriminated against Missouri. 
    Again, it was attacked on the basis of violating the Commerce Clause and the several clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The Court said, “The claim for the unconstitutionality has rested in this Court, substantially on the contention that the statute violates the Commerce Clause.” 
    It's urged that the Missouri law does not relate to the protection of health, safety, and morality or the promotion of their social welfare, but it is merely an economic weapon of retaliation. 
    And hence, the Twenty-first Amendment should not be interpreted as granting power to enact it.” 
    Since that Amendment, the right of a State to prohibit or regulate the importation of intoxicating liquor is not limited by the Commerce Clause, and it was citing Young's Market case.

speaker="thomas_r_garlington" startTime="5037.320" stopTime="5509.555">
    Mr. Thomas R. Garlington 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    I think this is a noble contention raised for the first time in this case by the State of California. 
    Of course, as Your Honor will readily apprehend, the language and the scope of the language as it has referred to the Commerce Clause and to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, can -- is indistinguishable from its operations upon the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and that is our second contention with respect to that clause which you cannot distinguish the protection of that Privileges and Immunities Clause over the Protection of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for these purposes. 
    And the case in point, which particularly discussed the matter of the Equal Protection Clause is Mahoney versus Joseph Triner Corporation decided in 1938, again, by Justice Brandeis. 
    In that case, the State of Minnesota passed a clearly discriminatory law which prevented the -- the sale of liquor in Minnesota if it contained more than 25% alcohol, unless it would register with the Patent Office. 
    The particular economic purpose of the status at the time, but it obviously had no relationship to any police power purpose. 
    It was challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment and with particular emphasis on the Equal Protection Clause. 
    The Court held the statute clearly discriminates in favor of liquor process within the State as against liquor process (Inaudible) 
    But only the locally processed may be sold regardless of whether the brand has been registered, that under the Amendment, discrimination against imported liquor is permissible, although it is not an incident of reasonable regulation of the liquor traffic, was settled by State Board of Equalization versus Young's Market case. 
    Now, California has made another contention in its reply brief which I feel must answered. 
    And that is that, and again, in the argument today, that the Twenty-first Amendment applies only to incidents of regulations at the border apparently, at the importation. 
    So -- as soon as that liquor is within the State, the Twenty-first Amendment is no longer applicable. 
    Well, first of all, let us understand the operation of the Washington statutes as set out. 
    It does prohibit the importation of wine into the State of Washington, except that purchased by the Liquor Board. 
    The wine purchased by the State Liquor Control Board is purchased pursuant to statutes, which governs its sale and distribution and so forth inside the State of Washington. 
    And that is the condition upon which any California wine comes into the State. 
    And it is a condition which is rightfully imposed by the State of Washington under the Twenty-first Amendment. 
    Now, this Court, I am sure, has never understood the operation of the Twenty-first Amendment to apply only to the act of importation, but ceasing to have effect after the liquor became -- came inside the territory of the State. 
    The understanding of Mr. Justice Black is set out in United States versus Frankfort Distilleries, decided in 1945. 
    This case, you may recall, involved the application of the Sherman Act against price conspiracy by liquor companies. 
    It was contended by the defendants that since the Sherman Act derived its power from the Commerce Clause, the Commerce Clause no longer operated with respect to liquor that they had a defense. 
    And, of course, the Court decided that that was true only if the States had indicated they approved of the price regulation. 
    But for our purposes here, as to whether or not the Twenty-first Amendment applies to the control of liquor within a State, Mr. Justice Black said, it is argued, the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution bars its prosecution. 
    That Amendment bestowed upon the States broad regulatory power over the liquor traffic within their territories. 
    It has not given the States plenary and exclusive power to regulate the conduct of persons doing an interstate liquor business outside their boundaries. 
    Granting the States -- this is the important language, granting the State's full authority to determine the conditions upon which liquor can come into its territory and what will be done with it after it gets there, it does not follow from this the fact that the United States is without power to regulate the conduct of those engaged in interstate trade outside the jurisdiction of the State of Colorado. 
    And, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in his concurring opinion, indicated his understanding in this respect, if a State, for its own sufficient reasons, deems that the desirable policy to standardize the price of liquor within its borders, either by direct price fixing statute or by permissive sanction, the Twenty-first Amendment gives it the power and the Commerce Clause as not being said. 
    The understanding being that this applied equally to regulation within the State after the liquor had arrived as well as the act of importation. 
    And I think the case of Ziffrin versus Reeves, decided in 1939, wherein the Court speaking through Mr. Justice McReynolds held that the Twenty-first Amendment actually freed the States of restrictions on the export of liquor as well as the import, again, an activity that was commencing within the State. 
    There is no basis, of course, for the proposition that it must -- that the Twenty-first Amendment applies only to the act of passing the liquor across the border. 
    It does apply, of course, with respect to regulations within the border. 
    Now, the interpretation placed upon the Twenty-first Amendment by this Court has been criticized by some as being unrealistic, permitting trade discrimination and yet, it's been praised by many, too. 
    And certainly, there are very sound policy reasons as well as simply interpreting the Amendment as it was written or interpreting it as it has been. 
    Those are contained in Carter versus Virginia and had been written in the concurring opinion of Justice Frankfurter. 
    I see it had (Inaudible)

    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I -- Justice Frankfurter more or less disposed of the point with his question. 
    Well, certainly the interpretation, by this Court, of the Twenty First Amendment is reasonable. 
    And it stemmed from a history of very great difficulty in trying to adjust the extensive and admitted police powers of a State in regulating liquor with the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. 
    And so this language is asked by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Carter versus Virginia. 
    It is now suggested that a State must keep within the limits of reasonable necessity and this Court must judge whether or not Virginia has adopted regulations reasonably necessary to enforce its local liquor laws. 
    Such canons of adjudication open wide the door of conflict and confusion, which have in the past characterized the liquor controversies in this Court and in no small measure form part of the unedifying history which led first to the Eighteenth and then to the Twenty-first Amendment. 
    Less than six years ago, this Court rejected the impossible task of deciding instead of leaving it for legislatures to decide what constitutes a reasonable regulation of the liquor traffic. 
    The issue was fairly presented in Mahoney-Triner Corporation, and that was the holding. 
    Therefore, the State of Washington first, because California has not demonstrated a capacity to maintain this action, secondly, because she has not stated the cause of action in view of the Twenty-first Amendment. 
    I respectfully ask this Court that her -- her petition to file her original complaint be denied.
