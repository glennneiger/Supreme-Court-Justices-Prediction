    Thank you. 
    May it please the Court? 
    At the recess, I had indicated that -- at the stage of the proceedings where the petitioner was put on the stand by the district judge over the objection and the questions have been put to him, he refused to answer – answer them, he had been directed to answer them and he had refused, all on the ground of self-incrimination. 
    He was asked two more questions by the district judge. 
    Question number 1, was whether he would maintain his refusal to answer, if he was sent back to the grand jury room and the other was whether he believed that his answers to those questions would really incriminate him? 
    To both those questions, objections were made and the petitioner refused to answer.

    The -- the Government indicated in the argument on sentence that its position was that a substantial sentence could be – should be imposed because the petitioner was not only obstructing this investigation, but also the investigations by the other grand juries in which he had appeared.

speaker="myron_l_shapiro" startTime="132.253" stopTime="159.025">
    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    No, sir. 
    The – the only reference that the Government made to the right to claim the privilege in the other grand jury investigations was on the sentence when the Assistant U.S. Attorney argued that his refusal here to answer in face of the purported immunity statute, indicated that his claim of privilege in the other investigations was not made in good faith.

    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    No, sir. 
    As a matter of fact, when I argued that were – that what the U.S. Attorney was asking for was punishment for what he had done in the other investigations, the district judge, I believe, said that that didn't matter here, that he was concerned only with this investigation.

    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    On the first time that we appeared before the Court, after the petitioner had refused to answer in the grand jury room and after arguing was had on the question of whether immunity applied, the judge, in his ruling on April 8th, which appears on page 34, 35 of the record, stated that in his opinion, there was immunity and that therefore, the petitioner was obligated to answer and therefore, he advised him that he had immunity.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="254.589" stopTime="256.767">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    That he actually refused to answer.
speaker="myron_l_shapiro" startTime="256.767" stopTime="491.128">
    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    That's right Your Honor. 
    The basic question on the immunity point here is whether Section 305 (d), which appears at page 33 of petitioner's brief, extends the immunity of Section 46 of the original Interstate Commerce Act to investigations before the – before a grand jury investigating violations or offenses under Section 322 of the Motor Carriers Act. 
    Section 305 (d), it has two clauses and the – at the beginning of the section, it says that, “So far as maybe necessary for the purposes of this chapter” and then it goes on to say that, “The Commission and the members and the examiners in the joint boards shall have the powers to subpoena witnesses to require the production of documents and to take testimony by a deposition relating to any matter under investigation as the Commission has in the matter arising under Chapter 1 of this title.” 
    This first clause was separated from the second clause by a semicolon and it goes on to say, “And any person subpoenaed or testifying in connection with any matter under investigation, under this chapter, shall have the same rights, privileges and immunities and be subject to the same duties, liabilities and penalties as though such matter arose under Chapter 1 of this title, unless otherwise provided in this chapter.” 
    It is it is our contention that before an immunity statute can be deemed to extend to a particular tribunal, authorization must be found in the statute for that body to give immunity. 
    In Section 46, which also appears at page 33, it is the language in any cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise, which this Court in Hale versus Henkel sufficed to extend the immunity power to the grand jury, because it was there held that the -- a grand jury inquiry was equivalent to a criminal case or the same as in the criminal case and that Congress, by the use of this language, extended the immunity power to grand juries. 
    The question here is whether the language of incorporation in 305 (d) took into that section the language “or in any cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise.” 
    It is our position that the Congress here was dealing with the power of Congress and that -- power of the Commission and that it was dealing with its powers to take testimony to require the -- the appearance of witness and -- witnesses and the production of papers and documents and that it was not concerned with the power of the grand jury. 
    Congress need not or did not have to give the grand jury power to investigate because the grand jury, I believe, would have the inherent power to investigate the possible violations under the Motor Carriers Act.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's clear as in your argument, they're only suggestion, but it's the Commission that is giving the immunity. 
    Is that a wrong impression of mine?
speaker="myron_l_shapiro" startTime="500.385" stopTime="514.823">
    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    No, I'm not suggesting that. 
    What I am suggesting, Your Honor is that under 305 (d), only the Commission in one of its investigations under the Motor Carrier's part of the Interstate Commerce Act could give immunity.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="514.823" stopTime="518.837">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well the Commission never gives immunity. 
    The Commission doesn't give immunity.

    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    Well, by subpoenaing a witness in an investigation under the Motor Carriers Act, you would thereby give immunity because --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="527.204" stopTime="549.509">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And the Commission elicits information and that -- and the court in for whom -- the refusal to answer is brought upon the insistence of the Commission, they then decide whether it could be held. 
    The Commission has no -- the Commission is not an immunity-giving agency.

    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    I understand Your Honor's point, but it's the initial act of the Commission. 
    If the Commission subpoenas a person to testify what remains for the Court deter -- to determine as whether, it was the compulsory process of the Commission and whether this man testified pursuant to this compulsory process and therefore, achieved the statutory immunity. 
    But there must be the initial act of the Commission.

    That, in essence, is my position because there -- because the -- first of all, the language of Section 305 (d) in my view, is not sufficient to extend the -- the Act or the power to commit an act to admit -- giving immunity to a grand jury.

    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    Yes, it does. 
    It has separate criminal offenses. 
    It -- the difference between it and the original Interstate Commerce Act is that in the original Act, they carry jail penalties as well as fines, while in the Motor Carriers Act, except for some violations affecting commission personnel, I believe, they carry only fines. 
    The violations, for which this man was being investigated, would carry only fines.

    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    By a grand jury under the Motor Carriers Act. 
    Now, there is -- there is a difference between the original Interstate Commerce Act and the Motor Carriers Act in that in Section 12, which describes the power of the -- of the Commission. 
    There's also a provision that it shall be the duty of the United States Attorney of a particular district to conduct enforcement proceedings upon the request of the Commission. 
    There is somewhat different statutory scheme, as I see it, in the original Act, than there is in the Motor Carriers Act. 
    While it might be said that the first clause of the Section 305 (d) carries over some of the provisions of Section 12, this particular part of the -- of Section 12 is not carried over into the -- into the Motor Carriers Act. 
    Incidentally, Section 12 appears at page 20 -- a footnote in page 22 of the brief for United States.

speaker="myron_l_shapiro" startTime="802.505" stopTime="876.713">
    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    Yes, Your Honor, but there are, for example, there's an omission of the civil sanction which is in the original Act, which is not in the Motor Carriers Act. 
    That is where one carrier diverts revenue or traffic from another carrier, there is a private remedy for damages which accrues to the injured carrier, which does not accrue in the Motor Carriers Act. 
    There are differences in penalties. 
    There are differences based – not basic, but specific differences between all four parts of the -- of the Interstate Commerce Act as now embodied in Title 49. 
    The basic regulatory scheme that the Commission at the top and the prohibitions against discrimination and so forth, continue in all four chapters, four parts, but as far as the specific different enforcement provisions, there are differences. 
    For example in one part, I think it is the freight forwarders part, there is an amnesty provision for giving all that has been done by any of the parties subject to it, prior to the enactment and there's no such provision in any of the other three parts.

    I think one reason is the -- the omission to incorporate the provision of Section 12 of the original Act that it shall be the duty of the United States Attorney in their respective districts to prosecute or enforce the Act upon the request of the Commission. 
    There, the pattern was and the idea was as it is in the securities acts that there would be no grand jury investigations throughout the United States, without the Commission doing -- having some part in it, so that where the Commission might be contemplating some kind of an investigation on a major matter, in some district in the remote part of the country, some United States Attorney could start a grand jury proceeding and give immunity and prevent the Commission from coming to the natural conclusion of its investigation perhaps, that is of the criminal prosecutions.

    Now, under that, passing the question of whether this is obligatory or not, that is whether a prosecution or investigation could be started with -- under this provision without the request to the Commission, the scheme of the Act is that there is not going to be anything done unless the Commission has a hand in it and that as far as immunity is concerned, it maybe that this language is not strong enough to take away the power of the grand jury to investigate a particular offense, but we're not dealing with the power of the Commission -- of the grand jury to investigate, we're dealing with the question of immunity. 
    And the statutory scheme in the original Act shows that as far as the Congress was concerned, it had in mind its protection in Section 12, that there would not be any investigations unless the Commission went along with it and was -- had some control over them. 
    Now, I say in answer to this question about what the policy is, I say that the draftsmen perhaps, had in mind that they were not taking in this provision of Section 12 into Section 305 or any other part of the Motor Carriers Act, and therefore, did not want to have any immunity power in the grand jury in the sense that the grand jury could do an act which would give a possible subject of the Commission investigation immunity in a subsequent criminal proceeding.

    But it says under investigation, under this chapter, what do you make of that phrase, under this chapter? 
    Does that chapter create criminal offenses which it is the primary duty of the U.S. Attorneys throughout the country to investigate, if the matter is properly brought to their attention and the investigation by U.S. Attorneys is before a grand jury, normally?

speaker="myron_l_shapiro" startTime="1343.793" stopTime="1399.109">
    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    Because in the prior clause, if Your Honor please, it says relating to any matter under investigation, so that we really have in the second clause merely a repetition of the language relating to any matter under investigation. 
    Now, this is not new language in the Interstate Commerce Act referring again to Section 12, dealing solely with the power of the Commission. 
    Congress also used the language, to any matter under investigation. 
    Now, in Section 46, when Congress wanted to extend the immunity power to the grand jury, they didn't say to any matter under investigation. 
    They said in any cause, in any case or proceeding, criminal or otherwise and these are commonly the words of art that are used to extend the power of grand juries to include immunity and this does not appear in Section 305 (d).

    Some times the Commission has been spoken of as the (Inaudible) committee of the Congress regarding not only existing legislation, but desirable future legislation.

    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    Then I agree with Your Honor, but the grand jury through the process of the Court may do an act which would entitle a man to immunity under specific statute. 
    And before that, the impact that he'll have, there must be a specific statute which extends to that point.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    As far as this phase of the immunity is concerned, that is the case, Your Honor. 
    Now, the second phase of an immunity questions is whether the immunity granted is coextensive with the privilege. 
    It is also our position, referring again to Section 305 (d) in page 33 of our brief, that since it starts with the language, so far as maybe necessary for the purposes of this chapter, that this serves to whittle down the immunity. 
    That this does not make it as extensive as the privilege, because there maybe many things asked in the course of this inquiry, which are not necessary for the purposes of an investigation under this chapter of this part of the Interstate Commerce Act, namely, the Motor Carriers Act, and therefore, under the specific provision of this Act, he may not -- the petitioner may not obtain immunity.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1586.383" stopTime="1599.897">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that limiting clause doesn't belong to the second -- that limiting phrase -- that qualifying phrase, also must be implied into the second clause. 
    It isn't there.

    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1600.088" stopTime="1613.661">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It simply equates the second clause and equates rights, privileges and immunity to those defined by Congress in Chapter 1 of this title.
speaker="myron_l_shapiro" startTime="1613.661" stopTime="1890.634">
    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    Well, I -- I read it definitely, Your Honor, because I believe that starting so far as maybe necessary for the purposes of this chapter with a comma, it then goes on the Commission and the members will have these powers. 
    I don't think that in the matter of statutory construction that the semicolon plays any role here and that the limiting clause -- the limiting phrase at the beginning, limits the latter part, the second clause of the statute. 
    That's our position in any event. 
    Now, with -- like in the minutes that remain, to get to the procedural point that is involved here and that is what transpired in the courtroom which resulted in this petitioner being convicted of criminal contempt. 
    The question basically there is whether Rule 42 (b) means anything in the administration of contempts involving the recalcitrant grand jury witnesses or Rule 42 (a) which provides for the summary punishment of the grand -- recalcitrant grand jury witness, as -- for something theoretically done in the presence of the Court, should -- should govern. 
    The Rule 42, both (a) and (b) appear at page 37 of my brief. 
    The Court of Appeals took the position that the position that the proceedings in the court on April 8 were ancillary to the grand jury investigation and that the judge was merely being advised as to what transpired in the grand jury room and insofar as the petitioner being compelled to take the stand in the courtroom, Judge Lumbard said, “It made no difference” and Brown remained mute, page 62 of the record and refused to speak at all, the result that would have been the same. 
    In other words, the Court of Appeals considered that the petitioner was convicted of criminal contempt for refusing to answer the questions before the grand jury and this is evident from his statement and that also at page 53, the very -- the very beginning of his opinion, page 53 of the record, “The Government now, however -- however, now takes the position that if petitioner were to be convicted for what went on in the grand jury room after he has been directed to return there and answer, that there would have had to be a proceeding under Rule 42 (b), that is there would have to be notice, specification of charges and the description of the nature of the criminal contempt and an opportunity to prepare and defend -- and the right to bail and so forth, that's provided in Section 42 (b).” 
    The Government, however, still seeks to sustain this conviction under Rule 42 (a) and it therefore reverts to the theory of the District Court that this was a continuance of a grand jury proceeding. 
    That is now -- we now have in the Southern District, a judge grand jury tribunal and although you have the judge there, you have the clerk of the court and all the requirements of Section -- Rule 6 of the Criminal Procedure are violated to have a valid grand jury proceeding continuing before the court and that the petitioner could have been compelled before the court to answer these questions. 
    And that for his refusing to answer these questions before the court and the grand jury is judged grand jury tribunal, he is to be held in contempt under Rule 42 (a) of Criminal Procedure.

    Assuming that that were notice, there was no opportunity to do anything because we were not at the position where the contempt was charged. 
    The point here is that there is no contempt in the Southern District until the judges put the questions to him on the second time and what it was merely a request by the grand jury for the aid and assistance of a court in obtaining answers, automatically becomes a contempt when the man refuses to answer those questions which the court is seeking to get answers for the aid and assistance of the grand jury.

    And what did he do when he was brought back?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="2640.549" stopTime="2692.351">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    When he was brought back on the second occasion, the -- the court -- the proceedings when he was brought back were that the court had the minutes read so that it could tell what took place in the grand jury meeting room itself. 
    And then the court undertook to direct the questions to the respond – to the petitioner directly, the same questions which he had refused to answer and he again refused to answer them to the court. 
    He was not sworn again. 
    There was that interim of that question about whether he had already been sworn and it was assumed that he had and the questions were put to him under his prior oath. 
    He refused to answer on the grounds of self-incrimination and the court said to him then, “And do I understand that if I return you, if I'd send you back to the grand jury room, you will --

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Yes, “that you will still refuse to answer there” and he said, “Yes.” 
    That particular language is on page 43 or 44 of the record. 
    His answer is, yes, which means, “Yes, I would refuse to answer if I went back.” 
    The judge asked him the second question about whether he believed that the answers would incriminate him and he refused to answer that question.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2718.262" stopTime="2719.885">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And what took place after that?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="2719.885" stopTime="2822.915">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    After that, the Court says, “By reason of your refusal to answer in the actual presence of the court, I'm forced to act upon the matter and I will hear from counsel” and he heard from counsel again and then he sentenced him for contempt in the presence of the court. 
    On this question of construction as to whether Congress intended the immunity provision of the Motor Carrier Act, to apply to proceedings before a grand jury, it would be strange indeed, if Congress did not so intend. 
    A great deal of the history of the immunity provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and indeed that's the history of the immunity provisions in our -- in our jurisprudence, actually occurred before grand juries, rather than in administrative proceedings. 
    Counselman against Hitchcock, Brown against Walker, Hale against Henkel, all of these cases are landmark cases in this immunity provision with grand jury proceedings. 
    And I -- I say this then, that it would be -- it would be a strange thing in view of this history, if Congress in making applicable to the Motor Carrier Act, these same provisions which had previously been construed by this Court in connection with the railroads could suddenly have withdrawn the protection and made it apply only in case of commission proceedings.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2822.915" stopTime="2837.528">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Indeed, there was powerful argument by some of the ablest lawyers of the day that to require testimony before the Commission makes the court an adjunct of an administrative agency.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="2837.528" stopTime="3359.656">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Yes. 
    Yes, indeed. 
    There's another -- another feature too and that is not only do we have the prior history with respect to the Interstate Commerce Act, but we have the subsequent history because in 1940 and again in 1942, Congress passed additional provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act applying it first to motor carriers and second to freight forwarders. 
    In both of these cases, they again incorporated the application of the Section 46, the immunity provision applying the railroads. 
    And in this -- these cases, there's never been any question that it applies to grand juries, as well as to administrative proceedings. 
    And so I say that it's a -- it would be a strange thing if Congress had carved out this particular section of the Act and made only the administrative proceedings subject to the immunity provisions. 
    Certainly, it doesn't appear from the language of this section. 
    The language of this section is, “Any person subpoenaed or testifying in connection with any matter under investigation shall have the same immunities as those any matter arose under Chapter 1 of the Act. 
    The -- the only reason -- the only reason that it can be implied if this is limited is because it is connected in the same section. 
    Indeed, it's in the same sentence with this provision with respect to the power of the Commission to conduct investigations. 
    And petitioner would have us believe that since the first part of this section deals solely with -- with commission investigations, the second part must to do so also. 
    Well, the truth of the matter is the first part of this section deals with investigations by the Commission because it's necessary to give that power specifically to the Commission in connection with motor carriers. 
    It wouldn't have it, unless it give -- gave it. 
    So, it incorporated by reference Section 12 of the -- of the Interstate Commerce Act, but section -- the second part of the section is not necessarily of -- if there's no reason why it should be limited to the -- to the investigative proceedings only and Congress in nowise implied that it should be. 
    I can think of only one possible excuse for construing this section in the limited way that petitioner suggest. 
    And that is on the mistaken thought that this is a criminal statute since there can be a possibility of construing it, one of two ways, we must construe it in a way which will give protection to a defendant. 
    And that's a -- that's a valid argument in connection with criminal statutes. 
    But I would point out that this particular statute is not a statute establishing a crime, defining a crime. 
    It's a statute defining immunity. 
    And this question of interpretation might well come before the court in a different context. 
    It might come up in the case of a criminal prosecution against an individual who claimed that he had obtained immunity on the ground that he had testified before a grand jury. 
    And in that case, it's perfectly apparent that it would be to the advantage of that defendant, if we construed the statute so that he was given immunity on the basis of his -- of his testimony before a grand jury. 
    Yet the question of construction is the same and it is perfectly apparent that there is no really strict interpretation, it's a question of rather determining what Congress had in mind in enacting this particular provision. 
    It seems fair to us, at least, that Congress intended to adopt the immunity provisions which it had found satisfactory from the comparable provisions of dealing with railroads and in the way which this Court has construed them. 
    Now, the -- the second question of construction deals with whether or not, the immunity granted by this section is sufficient so as to make it unnecessary, make it impossible for the petitioner to claim his privilege against self-incrimination. 
    This too seems to be concluded by prior decisions of this Court. 
    What was -- the immunity which is given in this case, is the very immunity which was passed upon by this Court in Brown against Walker in dealing with the immunity granted to individuals testifying with respect to the first portion of the Act. 
    And in Brown against Walker, this Court, after very careful consideration, found that the immunity was coextensive with the liability and as -- as recently as in 1955, this Court has reaffirmed that -- that position in Ullman against the United States. 
    Petitioner's argument is that the immunity is not complete because of the fact that the section begins with the words, “So far as maybe necessary for the purposes of this chapter.” 
    These words, however, in that context, clearly state -- clearly mean the circumstances under which the Commission may conduct investigations. 
    The Commission itself may conduct administrative proceedings. 
    If the petitioner is right that these words must be read for the entire section, this is really no more than a repetition of his first argument that we're dealing only with -- with Commission -- with proceedings before the Commission and therefore, we don't need to reach this argument here. 
    He's proved his -- he's proved his first case that -- that it applies -- that does not apply to grand jury proceedings. 
    Therefore, this really adds nothing to his prior argument. 
    Now, with respect to procedure, the petitioner has raised three questions. 
    The first question is whether it was proper for this Court to proceed under Rule 42 (a) of the Rules for Criminal Procedure, for a contempt committed in the presence of the Court rather than to proceed on notice under Section 42 (b). 
    And the second question on procedure was -- is whether the petitioner was unlawfully required to testify against himself when he was put on the stand and ask questions. 
    And his third question is whether he was deprived the due process by reason of the court's action in the clearing the court at the commencement of the proceeding and not thereafter, inviting the public back in. 
    But with that, it attacked first the question of whether this procedure was proper under Section -- under Rule 42 (a) of the Rules for Criminal Procedure. 
    Rule 42 (a) provides that when a contempt is committed in the very presence, in the sight of the -- of the court, the court may act summarily in dealing with that contempt. 
    Section 22 (b) deals with the situations where a contempt occurs outside of the presence of the court and it's necessary for the court to learn from some other source what went on. 
    In this particular situation, I think it is true that there was contempt of court, when the petitioner refused in the grand jury room to answer questions which the court had ordered him to answer. 
    And I think that that was a contempt which was out of the presence of the court and that one could have proceeded therefore, under Section 42 (b) on notice and would have had to, if you had proceeded on that contempt.

    It is -- that's the basis -- that's the fundamental document for the contempt, which is here under review. 
    Now, the antecedents, of course, this is -- this is a continuing affair, but what is -- what the court clamped down on was that when he's (Inaudible) the questions and he said, “I stand (Inaudible) I refuse to answer” and the judge says therefore, I find under Rule 42 (a) that in my presence, maybe to my patience certainly, you don't care about the court's order, you're going disobey it.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Yes. 
    Well, I -- I want to go to the secrecy point and I also want to go to the question of whether it was -- whether he was compelled to testify against himself. 
    The secrecy point is -- is an important one in this respect only. 
    This Court neither -- neither the Department of Justice nor this Court should give any competence to the thought that in a conviction for contempt that it can be done behind closed doors, that is not a proper way to try contempt. 
    It should be done in open court and the man had a right to have it done in open court. 
    Now, the question is how did that apply to the facts of these cases and this case? 
    And as we see this case, this complaint is not because it was actually done in secret, but it's -- again it's the case of careful lawyers going over a -- a record and finding what maybe a -- an error on appeal. 
    When the -- when the first of these proceedings was started on -- on bringing before the judge, the courtroom was clear that because they were going to ask the questions over again. 
    And when the court came around, came to the question of actually passing upon the contempt, there was no change -- there was no affirmative order inviting people in. 
    However, this was a public courtroom. 
    This is in a public -- in the criminal section of the -- of the District Court in New York and it is ordinarily open to the public, unless the public is excluded and there is no evidence in this case in fact that the public was excluded. 
    In fact, the most important person present from the defendant's point of view was his own counsel, who, of course, is not permitted in -- in a grand jury proceeding. 
    His own counsel is present and --

    Counsel did not bring this to the attention of the court, raised no objection. 
    If -- if it turned out -- if the evidence was that people were actually excluded from the courtroom during this period, I think that that was an improper proceeding and he was denied due process.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Oh! 
    No. 
    He wasn't proceeding under -- under the 42 (b). 
    He was following the language of 42 (a) as I think that he was entitled to that. 
    The -- there's also the allegation made and this was objected to at the time of the -- of the proceeding, there was the allegation that was improper to put this man on the stand and ask him these questions in -- for the judge to do so. 
    It said that he was being asked to testify against himself. 
    And this, I think, also -- the answer to this, I think, also depends upon an understanding of the nature of these proceedings. 
    If we are right that this was a proceeding in which the court was still attempting to get this witness to answer these questions which would give him immunity, then he was not being asked to testify against himself. 
    He was merely being asked to do the kind of act that citizens are required to do in order to carry out the procedure to justice, namely, to testify. 
    Now, when he refused to testify, to be sure that redounds to his -- to his detriment, but that is so in -- in any case where a witness is called to testify and -- and defies the court or -- or purges himself. 
    In that sense, of course, what he -- what he says is against himself, but this is not what historically we think of as being -- being called upon to testify against oneself and I come finally to the question of the -- of its sentence. 
    The court sentenced this man to 15 months and I'm -- in connection with whether or not, this involved sentencing him for claiming his privilege properly before the other grand juries, the court itself, said on page 49 that he wasn't concerned with that. 
    He was concerned only with the -- with the current preceding, so that we do have a situation of the 15-month penalty for this -- this particular contempt of the court. 
    I do not think that it is important that the Motor Carrier Act has lesser penalty for violations of that Act. 
    This is not an attempt by indirection to punish this man for a violation of the Motor Carrier Act. 
    I do not know that -- I do not know that the United States Attorney had any belief that this man had in any way, violated the Motor Carrier Act. 
    They were making investigation of racketeering in connection with the Teamsters Union and the garment industry. 
    They were trying to find out the background of the blinding of Victor Riesel. 
    And in connection with that, this man had had of -- the United States Attorney thought that he had had close relationships, business relationships with people that were involved in those proceedings and they were trying to get information from him. 
    They weren't trying to pin a crime on him. 
    So the relationship between the punishment for contempt and the punishment for the crimes involved in the Motor -- Motor Vehicle Act, really have no -- no relation to this case. 
    Here, he -- it was defiance of the court in a serious and important grand jury investigation.

   Rebuttal of Myron L. Shapiro
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5412.359" stopTime="5414.791">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Shapiro.
speaker="myron_l_shapiro" startTime="5414.791" stopTime="5591.196">
    Mr. Myron L. Shapiro 
    May it please the Court? 
    I might point out on the question of sentence. 
    Now that all the cases cited by the Government in its brief on so-called comparable sentences, only one deals with a witness and that's with Lopiparo versus United States, referred to on page 14 of my reply brief, where he received 18 months, but this involved the credibility and good faith of the witness, testified that he wasn't a -- was been unable to find certain books he was ordered to produce. 
    Actually, in the Second Circuit from where this case comes, cases involved in the same investigation that is the same broad investigation not this particular grand jury, U.S. against Gordon, 236 F.2d 916 at page 31 of my main brief, six months, Courtney case, three months, Trock which was before this investigation, but was reversed by this Court, four months, Curcio which was before this Court last year, six months with a purge clause, and U.S. against Weinberg in the prohibition days or near-prohibition days, 60 days. 
    The other cases cited by the Government in -- on the sentence involved for example, fixing the juror, fixing the criminal case, corrupting a trial juror, contempt of decreeing the case, not the same as this. 
    Now, on the objection on secrecy, if anybody was involved here, well, Mr. Davis referred to the Government being involved because there was no specific objection and then that this is called out of the record when we're working on the appeal. 
    We brought down before the court on April 8, in which although -- no, this no contempt proceeding. 
    You're not here -- we're not dealing with contempt here. 
    We're seeking the aid and assistance of the Court. 
    We don't want to have anything here to happen here. 
    We just want to have this aid and assistance to the Court. 
    Nobody is guaranteed that this is going to windup in the contempt proceeding because everybody is trying to get this man to testify. 
    There is nothing -- no objection made at that time because we're not told that this is a contempt proceeding. 
    We're not told that this is a contempt proceeding until the man is in contempt. 
    At the same time that he's in contempt, he has a contempt proceeding. 
    So how can the -- how can anybody make an objection that this proceeding is secret, because we're not in a contempt proceeding when (Inaudible) the problem district, until he commits the contempt, then -- then the contempt proceeding is over and all you get is a (Inaudible)

    Well -- what I know in my brief provision, Mr. Justice Black, I said that I did not believe that it could be factually disputed that the courtroom was cleared at that time. 
    It is now factually disputed by the Government who was -- who was taking some kind of a statement and the Assistant United States Attorney is now with him, is not with the Government anymore and he said that the courtroom was not cleared, but there were no spectators there. 
    I -- I don't know whether I can be in a position to match my recollection what this meant, this Assistant United States Attorney, but I'm willing to say to the Court that the courtroom was clear. 
    And it is my recollection that it was clear and that as a matter of fact, the marshal or deputy marshal or the bailiff who has the grand jury in charge, stood outside the courtroom door to keep the people out. 
    There were strangers into the courtroom that were strangers to the grand jury proceeding, namely, the court clerk, who was not an officer of the grand jury, the judge who was an intruder, if this is in a continuing for the grand jury proceeding then judge was an intruder, I was an intruder and the -- the court's (Inaudible) was an intruder and also, there was another bailiff of the court inside.
