Felter v. Southern Pacific Company
speaker="harry_e_wilmarth" startTime="0.000" stopTime="212.733">
    Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth 
    -- the point which I was addressing myself -- the agreement itself, in and of itself didn't become applicable to the craft as a whole. 
    Now that point is made clear at the bottom of page 3 of the appendix, the last few lines in which it says that “no agreement made pursuant to subparagraph (b)” which is the check off paragraph, “shall provide for deductions and payments to the union of dues other than that in which he holds membership.” 
    Now that particular section is important because it's involved in this case. 
    In this case, the employee had terminated his membership in the union. 
    The union in the carrier insisted, however, that unless he followed certain conditions in the collective agreement, they would continue to deduct dues and pay them over to the union even though he had terminated his membership, which we claim is invalid under the Railway Labor Act. 
    Now in addition on page 4 as a last proviso guarantees to the employee that he may change membership from one union to another, and that nothing in the act or in the agreement shall prevent him from having that right of change. 
    At the top of page 3 of the appendix, we would like to emphasis this fact; a head of the proviso, that is section b of 11, which begins at the bottom of page 2 and the top of page 3, “a head of the proviso deals with action between the carrier and the union.” 
    In other words, the carrier and the union are permitted and authorized to sit down and negotiate a check off agreement. 
    The proviso, however, doesn't deal with any action by the union. 
    It deals with action as between the individual employee and the carrier in a sense it's so directly involved in this case, I will read it. 
    The proviso provides, “provided that no such agreement shall be effective with respect to any individual employee until he shall have furnished the employer with a written assignment to the labor organization of such membership dues, initiation fees and assessments which shall be revocable in writing after the expiration of one year.” 
    And the point that I am emphasizing is that the -- that the act doesn't authorize the union to negotiate in the check off agreement anything regarding the authorization that the employee signs to make a check off agreement effective to him. 
    That is he signs the authorization, he files it with his employer, he is guaranteed the right to revoke it in writing after one year. 
    Now in our brief, we have set forth, in addition to emphasizing these points, some of the legislative history of this act with particular reference to the proviso.

    Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth 
    Well in our judgment Mr. Justice they would have had to promptly discontinue dues deductions. 
    Since you've asked the question, I will say at this point, in the lower courts and in the Court of Appeals and up to the time of this Court, the respondents took the position that they would not recognize his revocation unless he did it according to the agreement or conditions imposed and that they would continue to deduct the dues even though he had terminated his membership. 
    Now for the first time in this Court they have changed that position. 
    I was going to advert to it later. 
    They now say that if he had sent a letter to the carrier advising the carrier that he had terminated his membership, they would have stopped dues deductions immediately or respectively (Inaudible)

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What did he do here Mr. Wilmarth?
speaker="harry_e_wilmarth" startTime="287.307" stopTime="404.532">
    Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth 
    Very well, he submitted a revocation in writing in the exact form provided by the dues deduction agreement, sent that form both to the carrier and the union saying I revoke my dues deduction. 
    The carrier at first recognized that it's valid and transmitted to the union to be noted. 
    The union however stated that it did not comply with the provisions of the dues deduction agreement, that the form that he had submitted had not been printed by the union and that he must come to the union, obtain a form that has been printed by it and submit that form. 
    The union -- the agreement itself appears at page 74 of the record, the first paragraph just states that it's a check off relating to members, paragraph B states that the signed authorization maybe revoked in writing at any time after the expiration of the year. 
    At the end of the agreement, there are forms set forth both for authorization and for revocation and in this case we have not challenged the forms themselves. 
    It's not before the court, probably the man could write a letter in unequivocal terms and obtain the same result, but he did file the forms and that's undisputed.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now what I'd like to ask is, how does that vary from what you say the respondents now say at this point they will be willing to accept?
speaker="harry_e_wilmarth" startTime="414.181" stopTime="444.073">
    Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth 
    I think I can make it clear by pointing to subparagraph C of page 75 of the record. 
    He submitted that in the form, the text here, the identical form. 
    They said pointing to this paragraph C, that the form hadn't been printed by them and he must come back to them or take one of their forms or get a form that they had printed and that they wouldn't recognize --

    Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth 
    And on page 75 they pointed to the provision in the agreement that said both the authorization forms and the revocation of authorization forms shall be reproduced and furnished as necessary by the organization without cost to the company. 
    And they pointed that the language reproduced and furnished and said this is a form that wasn't reproduced and furnished by the organization. 
    Now that's obviously a ridiculous requirement.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Was there anything to keep him from getting it?
speaker="harry_e_wilmarth" startTime="493.905" stopTime="510.357">
    Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth 
    No they sent him one and he was -- it would have amounted to delaying him a month as priors dues were concerned. 
    However, I think it has a little more significance and it appears to have on the surface Mr. Justice.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="510.357" stopTime="511.348">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    That's what I was interested in.
speaker="harry_e_wilmarth" startTime="511.348" stopTime="677.127">
    Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth 
    Yes and I will come to that. 
    They argued to the Trial Court although there was nothing in the record, it was an argument of statutory construction rather than any record support that their reason for asking him to take a form printed by the union and coming to the union and asking it for the form was it would help them in book keeping procedures. 
    Now it sir, no one has ever explained just what book keeping procedures would be helped by them having the form in front of them which he did send them to the carrier and him coming first and getting a form printed by them and then submitting the same form. 
    On page 11 of their brief to this Court they give what we deem the real significance of the provision. 
    And they are referring this on the first full paragraph of page 11 of the respondent's brief of the BRT, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, the yellow brief, referring to this requirement C which we've just read they say if this requirement is held invalid, it will remove the lock from the door and leave the house wide open for ransack. 
    Sometimes as a practical matter as well as -- sometimes as a practical matter an employee needs protection against himself, as well as from outside undue influence. 
    And the procedure set up in the agreement in question affords that protection by requiring both the authorization and revocation deduction to be made in writing on the proper form. 
    Now it's obvious this man is a conductor, he works in the craft of conductors, of course he can work in either craft. 
    The Order of Railway Conductors represents the conductor craft's and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen represents the craft of trainmen or brakemen. 
    At the time, however, he was a conductor. 
    He had terminated membership in this union. 
    There will be a psychological factor if nothing more against a man when he sends in a revocation in writing if he has to go and ask the union for the grace of furnishing of some form which they have printed and their statement as to what it really intents that they will be enabled to furnish him protection against himself.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="harry_e_wilmarth" startTime="679.401" stopTime="976.955">
    Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth 
    I don't know what that statement might encumber Mr. Justice. 
    It might be more than just talking him out of it. 
    I assume the very statement as they put it, protection against himself, might indicate more. 
    In this record there is this fact of record while Mr. Felter was furnished the forms. 
    I suppose Mr. Felter as a railroad man who is and will be all his life has an interest in knowing whether the next one he signs will have a lock on the door stronger than this lock. 
    In this particular record, he brought this action for himself and others similarly situated, there were approximately two dozen which he listed similarly situated who had sent him revocations as he had. 
    Before the case was over, some half dozen or so of them, not denying that they had set in the revocations, however came in and executed letters to the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen that they had never been contacted as part of this case, didn't want to be a part of it and wanted to keep their membership in the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. 
    Now I assume they received some of the protection against themselves which cost them because they didn't deny it at point that they had originally sent in revocations or their dues deductions. 
    They just said we weren't contacted. 
    We don't want to be a part of this lawsuit, and we want to remain part of the trainmen. 
    I think the realities of the fact that the statute recognized -- Congress recognized that if carriers and unions could sit down and negotiate check on agreements, both of the parties might have reasons which would be inimical to the individual man. 
    In this sense the union of course seeks self perpetuation. 
    The carrier may seek to favor one union over another, so that if the two of them can sit down and as they say here in their brief, negotiate a lock on the door, which -- then the man's freedom of choice guaranteed doing the act is to that extent effective. 
    Now whether it is here severe or whether it's slight, it's to some degree effective. 
    We say that the act, its legislative history all are directed to one thing, the man shall have free exercise of choice. 
    Even as a member of the union he is granted that, he can choose or not to choose to come under the check off agreement. 
    He is guaranteed the right to revoke it in writing and in the legislative history in the debates before the committees, it was said that if at the end of year he doesn't like it, he can revoke it in writing, that's his discretion. 
    So that when they negotiate we say that the act in the proviso relates only his choice alone and that there is no authorization and in fact it's prohibited to negotiate any form of restriction on it. 
    Now the Trial Court and the Court of Appeals affirming it thought that you could imply that you could negotiate reasonable restrictions on his right of revocation. 
    Well, that means this then if they can negotiate reasonable or unreasonable restriction, then each case will stand by itself if there are -- you'll have to come to court to find out whether they're reasonable or unreasonable lines. 
    We say they were prohibited and to that extent, this agreement which endeavored to negotiate some type of restrictions violated the act. 
    Now we also of course I remember of opinions under the comparable provision of the National Labor Relations Act which have struck down any attempt by unions to -- and we'll urge on the specific terms that act with reference to the mans' right to comply with check off or union shop agreements. 
    In other words, the terms of the act had been strictly construed in one they have tried to enlarge them in any way they have been struck down.

    Now specifically, their admission appears on page 15 and at the bottom of that page in the second paragraph under the letter E, they say had petitioner notified the Southern Pacific Company of his change of unions, no more dues deductions would have been made regardless of a revocation.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Hildebrand
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="1760.785" stopTime="1981.575">
    Mr. Mr. Attorney General 
    The issue is just as narrow as Mr. Justice Black stated, that's all there's to the case and this is the way it arises. 
    The dues deduction arrangement came in affect, the men voted in a referendum they wanted dues deduction. 
    So then the Brotherhood representatives got together with the carrier and they said how are we going to go about this. 
    Well the man had to be a member before he could have dues deduction. 
    So he paid his membership let's say this thing started here in these letters March 30, so he paid his membership for the month of April and he was paid up then for the month of April out of his own pocket, but in order to make dues deduction effective, the company pointed out to the -- to the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood had to readily agree, well the dues deduction then has to be for the next month, that's what they ignore and where they get this whole thing haywire and not looking at the time element. 
    And they try to make it look as if we are collecting for money after the man had passed out of the organization. 
    From the very start to dues had to be deducted and the arrangement was and it's right in the agreement that was executed between the Brotherhood and the Railroad under which this man himself subscribed and it read and admittedly read and knew all about and agreed to that in the first two weeks of this first month, he pays for the first month and then on the first two weeks of the month where he is already paid, the dues are deducted for the following month which starts this thing going. 
    So you've got the man paid up for two months to start with and then you just continue along with that and when he finally gets out he is still paid up after he submits his resignation for another month. 
    And of course that I don't know any these organizations that don't recognize that a man is a member while he is paid up, the issue arises when he ceases to be paid up as to whether he is a member and he didn't ask for any refund, and so the whole thing revolves around a very simple proposition. 
    There has to be time limits to something. 
    The brotherhood and the railroad get together and they say, how are we going to handle this thing. 
    I don't know how the other side had set it up, because there -- you got a railroad spread out over several thousand miles, it's a thousand miles from San Francisco to El Paso and if these dues are sent in by a treasurer in El Paso, it takes several days to get to the railroad and it takes several days for the railroad to make up its payroll, so they worked it out on this instance, this happened to be in Eugene. 
    And in Eugene which is about 200 odd miles from Portland, it was worked out that the secretary would submit the list to the railroad on the 3rd date, send his list in on the 3rd of the month, the railroad had to get the list by the 5th, the railroad made the deduction by the 15th which gave everybody a timely method of going about this arrangement. 
    Then by the 15th the dues were deducted for the following month. 
    The man was always being paid up for the current month because he is paid up to start with, this is where all that confusion arises. 
    They got him resigned, the minute he sends the resignation in, when he is paid up for the month of April they have got him resigning at the first of April.

    Mr. Mr. Attorney General 
    Alright. 
    The agreement says and he signed that he would be bound by this agreement when he authorized the deduction from the very beginning. 
    He signed and he said that he assigned his wages to pay union dues as reported to the SP by the treasurer, (Inaudible) monthly statements as provided under the deduction agreement so he knows all about the deduction agreement. 
    It's undisputed that he has been given a copy of the deduction agreement. 
    The secretary testifies that this is a summary judgment procedure. 
    Every member is furnished a copy of the above agreement and is explained to him when he signs the authorization for dues deduction. 
    So he knows exactly what this agreement says. 
    Now this agreement says and the Brotherhood is bound by it, so is the railroad and so is this man, he signed authorizing this himself, there is nothing that's put over on him at all. 
    Both the authorization forms and the revocation of authorization forms shall be reproduced and furnished as necessary by the organization without cost to the company.

    Now who is complaining? 
    It shows clearly from the record that the rating organization, the rival organization, the Order of Railroad Conductors is complaining. 
    Mr. Felter is just a puppet here as far as this suit is concerned, and the record shows the letters along the correspondence, the Order of Railroad Conductors is behind this. 
    Now why are they complaining, they are complaining because they don't like the idea that this man who has had to belong to the Brotherhood for a year, he has had to stay in there on his own authorization, doesn't want to conform to the precise requirement to windup his membership, not membership his dues deduction with him. 
    Now the dues deduction is distinct from membership. 
    He doesn't have to resign if these -- revoking his dues deduction and the other side repeatedly confused dues deduction and changed the membership.

    It would depend probably on things that are not in evidence here. 
    There are constitutional provisions that these brotherhoods have, the man's dues are paid up, suppose he wants to resign April 1st and his dues are paid up till April 30th, now we are not enlightened on that as to what the constitutional provision or the setup of the brotherhood would be. 
    Ordinarily I think the reasonable interpretation would be that the man would be a member until April 30th

    You have to go further and ask the Justice Burns question in order to -- I think you have to go beyond the answer you have given. 
    You have to say that what the statute says, that is assignment, his personal assignment shall be revocable in writing as to the expiration of year that means that Congress has said any oral writing will do and not a writing to which he agreed as a member, you have to go that far.

    And the testimony is undisputed by the treasurer of his lodge; that, that dues deduction agreement at that time was given to him a copy of it and was explained to him and he understood it and agreed to it.

    The next sentence may help us, it says the organization shall assume full responsibility for the procurement and execution of the forms by employees and for the delivery of such forms to the company. 
    Now if they have had responsibility, why shouldn't they be able to use their own forms and be sure that they are not spurious, that some organizer hasn't got the -- put his name on there and which the man they repudiate, and so that they are positive and clear that the man signs it.

    The forms are readily to him, there is no reason why he couldn't get one.

    I caught that as I was reading it the other day and I noticed it was that mistake, but we don't concede that anything should be done, except in accordance with the wage deduction agreement and if he had notified the brotherhood and got this form and filled it out, that's all he had to do. 
    No compulsion was on him otherwise. 
    There is no record in this -- there is no evidence in this case and there is no record at all of any coercion being exerted on this man and as to this man the thing was an unfortunate timing, because the list had to go in on the 3rd, so as to reach Portland on the 5th, so the company could deduct on the 15th. 
    Now the man writes this letter, March 3rd it's postmarked the 1st, it gets to the Secretary on the 2nd, and the Secretary says well we haven't got the proper form, I don't know if this is a rating or if this is what you really want or not, and I'm sending you a proper form, sign the proper form and I'll send it in, unfortunately that delayed the things so that he couldn't get the thing in the mail until the following month, which is in accordance with the agreement.

    Well I think the statute contemplates an agreement, because the statute to start with says in 45 USC 15211, that the dues deduction agreement is allowed. 
    Now that dues deduction agreement is between the carrier and the brotherhood and that's what they made. 
    Now the whole question is what are reasonable provisions in the dues deduction agreement?

    Mr. Mr. Attorney General 
    The only question is, does the reasonable arrangement of this kind having in mind the timeliness and the dates and that people have to act in accordance with a schedule, does that violate the statute? 
    And we don't think it does, because we have it into -- the only kind of -- I don't know what sort of agreement they would want. 
    You couldn't have the resignation effective right now, because the man has paid up for a month. 
    I don't know when his membership should cease. 
    If he has paid up for a month and I don't think it should cease until the end of his paid up period, and so you have to have some sort of timeliness in the whole setup, so the brotherhood and railroad get together and they setup a timely schedule for handling these things.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3305.455" stopTime="3323.234">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    All I understood the question was, and I maybe entirely wrong about this, was that petitioner contends that the parties had no right to bargain away the right of revocation which Congress gave him by the proviso of subsection 11(b).
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="3323.234" stopTime="3324.685">
    Mr. Mr. Attorney General 
    That's right, if they didn't bargain it that way.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3324.685" stopTime="3335.359">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Provided that Section 11(b) by servicing a notice in writing, in all respects like the notice that you provide, upon the employer as to it wasn't recognized.
speaker="attorney_general" startTime="3335.359" stopTime="3394.561">
    Mr. Mr. Attorney General 
    Well all that the section says, the law says, provided that no such agreement shall be effective with respect to any individual employer until he shall have furnished the employer with a written assignment to the labor organization of such membership dues, initiation fees and assessments, which shall be revocable in writing after the expiration of one year, but it doesn't say how you're going to do it. 
    Now the earlier sections that say that you're going to have a dues deduction agreement, obviously contemplate that there's going to be some procedures setup of by the railroad and the brotherhood to handle these things, and that there has got to be some time setup, outlined and the way it started out was that the man paid a month in advance and paid for the first month and then the dues deduction would be for the second month. 
    So in terminating it you have to have some reference to this agreement unless it's an reasonable agreement.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3394.561" stopTime="3404.805">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker

    Mr. Mr. Attorney General 
    Was that wrong for us to do it, that's all and should this Court pass on that, that's the whole thing in the case? 
    Is this Court going to say that the brotherhood and the railroad can't pass on a little matter like that and that that they can make such an arrangement? 
    Should the case ever come here on an issue like that? 
    Shouldn't the brotherhood and the railroad and the man himself agreeing to it, be allowed to decide such things? 
    Is this is the denial of the man's rights and is this depriving him of a right of revocation on such a silly trumped up (Inaudible) and I think that the Court never realized the time element in this thing, and you would never granted certiorari on it.

    Counsel served upon us a supplemental brief today, and one of my associates looked at the case, this is served 11:30 today, supplemental brief for petitioner and this case is cited on 69 Fd. Supp. 
    The right of the case itself, the Court says citing the Felter case, this one that we're arguing today, the case is not in point as the question for a decision, and the case at bar was not involved. 
    So I don't know that we need to pay any attention to this supplemental brief. 
    I'd assume that with that stated by the Court we hardly need to answer, but there it is, I suppose my time is up Your Honor.

    Oh I don't -- I think that the one issue in this case as Mr. Justice Black picked out quickly, is whether an authentic card requirement is reasonable and whether the brotherhood and this man and the carrier can agree to an authentic card requirement, that's the whole thing, it all boils down to that. 
    Now is that denying this man right to terminate when it's admitted that no question was put on him when he was offered an authentic card to sign, when the brotherhood has the responsibility of seeing to it that this thing is properly administered, that the money is sent and this treasury has the responsibility and this man himself in two different places has agreed to this, and it's read to him when he understands it. 
    It reduces the chances of unauthorized requests. 
    It helps prevent organizers from getting unauthorized signatures and sending them in. 
    It can only help a rating organization is all it can help if it's decided by this Court, that that small issue was going to decide this case. 
    The Trial Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals went along with this on the idea, once they understood it and it seems to me that now that this Court understands the issue that, the case should certainly be affirmed.
