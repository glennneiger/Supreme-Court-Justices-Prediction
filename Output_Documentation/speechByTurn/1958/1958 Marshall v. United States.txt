Marshall v. United States

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 383, Howard R. Marshall, Petitioner, versus United States of America. 
    Mr. Knapp, you may proceed.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I believe I stated last night or last afternoon that the statement by the petitioner was accurate. 
    However, I do not believe that he brought to the Court's attention the questions which the Court put to the jurors on voir dire to ascertain whether or not they could try the case fairly, impartially and without influence. 
    The Court of every one of these jurors asked three basic questions. 
    One, did the newspaper article raised any prejudice in the juror's mind? 
    Was there anything in the article that would influence the juror in considering the case and in rendering his verdict? 
    And lastly, he asked the juror if he was sure that he could try the case, make up his mind on what should be done from the evidence which he heard from the witness stand, and give no consideration whatsoever to the newspaper articles. 
    The answers to these questions satisfied the Court. 
    I believe --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Voice Overlap) would have been a very extraordinary and unusual human being that would have answered yes to any of those questions.
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="117.159" stopTime="253.139">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, there was -- we have in our brief the case of United States versus Montgomery which indicates that it isn't necessarily the answers or the responses which the Court gets but it get -- but that -- it is -- it's the opportunity to observe these jurors to see them as they answer the questions, to hear how they answer them that is important. 
    And in that case, Judge (Inaudible) concluded that although all of the answers had been more or less -- had been favorable there, he nevertheless granted a mistrial. 
    It's a District Court case and it's found in our brief. 
    The citation is 42 F.2d 254. 
    In this -- this newspaper article identified the defendant with another accused, swindler. 
    Described the defendant as a swindler, a jailbird, a disbarred attorney, an ex-convict and a fugitive from justice and gave other damaging details about his career. 
    And three or four of the jurors had read the article. 
    The -- the Court said that, one, the three of the four who read the article stated that they could deal with the case on the evidence but the other one seemed to answer uncertainly and inconclusively. 
    And since one juror had asked another if he had read the article, the judge had the uneasy feeling that the others might also read it. 
    He got that impression from -- from seeing and observing these people. 
    And he said the motion cannot therefore be answered by basing the decision on the letter of the juror's answers to my questions. 
    I must consider the impression which the jurors made on me when they answered these questions and also the nature of the malignancy and infection to which the jurors have been exposed thus taking into account the article itself.

    Would it be -- would it be unfair or unreasonable to suggest that Judge (Inaudible) might have been a more skeptical nature as the trial judge of this case? 
    He was of skeptical nature.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, I'm -- I -- I couldn't say that, Your Honor.

speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="300.706" stopTime="380.170">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, I think here, Your Honor that there were -- remember all of the jurors were interrogated separately and apart from each other. 
    Now, several of them said they had seen the article. 
    They said, “I didn't (Inaudible). 
    I didn't read it too good. 
    I just scanned over it but I did see the article.” 
    Another juror said the same thing, “I glanced at the headline and scanned it as I sometimes do and that was all I saw.” 
    Another juror said, “I didn't really digest either one of them very thoroughly.” 
    And Mrs. (Inaudible) said, “I scanned it over but I couldn't tell you now what the details were.” 
    And some of the jurors also answered indicating that they knew it was their duty to decide this case from the evidence which they received in court and not from outside. 
    And Mrs. (Inaudible) said, “The only thing he told me was that the jury had been selected and so many women and so many men said,” and he said, “I suppose this means you. 
    That is the case you're on and he didn't tell me anything further.” 
    She discussed it with her husband.

    Well, of course that isn't the thing that his complaining about here. 
    It's the real gravamen of those articles. 
    May I ask you this Mr. Knapp, can you, in the case of this kind where a man is accused of illegally dispensing prescription drugs, can you imagine anything that would be more harmful to him than to have -- have it paraded before the jury, that he was a two-time ex-convict, and that he had admitted that he had practiced medicine without a license and had dispensed illegally prescription goods. 
    Can you imagine anything that would be more likely to influence a juror in determining whether a man was guilty in that particular kind of a case?

    Well, accepting a confession --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, the -- one of them was tantamount to it because I understand that one of the articles said that he had admitted, that he had practiced medicine without a license which in itself is practically the same crime with his choice with here.

speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="483.037" stopTime="510.532">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Now, we can't get away from the fact that this type of an article would be bound to affect the person. 
    That has to be admitted, it goes without saying except that these jurors, say they can set it aside. 
    And I think that if a person makes a conscious effort to do that and if he has given his word on it then we have to take his word for it. 
    He's the only one who can tell us.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="510.532" stopTime="559.546">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But these are disciplined minds in -- in this particular field, they're disciplined in other fields to be sure as -- but as jurors, they're not disciplined in keeping such matters after their -- out of their minds when they get into those, into that jury box and I -- it's very difficult for me to imagine anything that would be more prejudicial to a man than to have such statements, read to him or having read them themselves in a case of this kind or maybe if he was charged of something else, there would be a matter of discretion there but this is the very kind of a case that it would be most prejudicial.
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="559.546" stopTime="633.313">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, Your Honor, please, I beg to disagree with you about that because I think that the jury has faith in the jurors. 
    The man who is out there, they take what he says. 
    They take the law from him, they understand that. 
    And they understand when he tells them that you will put this aside, you are not to consider it in determining the guilt or innocence of this man, and can you do this? 
    Can you do this fairly and impartially and tell them that they are to consider only the evidence which they hear from the lips of the witnesses. 
    I think that the average intelligent, honest juror that we have would do just that. 
    As a matter of fact, I would think that he would be inclined to lean over backwards to try to be fair to them. 
    Most jurors are fair people and they do take the instructions of the court to heart. 
    We have cases where they come back and I ask for further instruction because they need to be enlightened. 
    And I -- I think that every fair American juror does his best to abide by the rulings of the court and to put aside things of this nature.

    And if we are not disciplined to do a thing of that kind, there is assurance that we will do it and in this case, you have -- you have practically the testimony of one man on which to convict this defendant. 
    And then in addition to that, you have these newspaper articles and I'm just wondering how it can be said that they wouldn't affect the jury when you yourself say that they are highly prejudicial.
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="677.369" stopTime="686.234">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    We can't get away from that that if considered by the jury, there would be prejudicial. 
    There is no question about that, Your Honor. 
    I admit that.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, I think in one case, this Reistroffer case, Your Honor which is found at 258 F.2d 379. 
    One of the witnesses in testifying said about the defendant. 
    He testified through telephone conversation. 
    I says you're nothing but a damn ex-convict. 
    The court promptly constructed the jury to disregard it and admonish the jury there is no proof of the claims made apparently in anger and in argument over the phone. 
    It also stated in the absence of the jury that the court had heard the whole thing, saw the jury and that they regarded the witness with tolerant amusement. 
    The court said that it was one of the inadvertent statements which come in occasionally and there will be no mistrial. 
    The Circuit Court held there was no abuse of discretion by the court in its treatment of what was actually a mere rudeness on the part of the witness. 
    Now we have some other cases which I would --

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Now, I submit that this Court in Remmer versus the United States followed essentially this -- this procedure. 
    In that case, if the Court recalls, the cases came up in 1953. 
    During the trial an unnamed person communicated with the juror and remarked that he could profit by bringing in a verdict favorable to the petitioner. 
    The incident was reported to the judge and discussed it with the prosecutor. 
    An FBI investigation was set on for the bureau did investigate and the judge and the prosecutor concluded that the remark was made in just and nothing further was done. 
    Defense counsel learned of this after the verdict and move for a new trial contending that they would have requested a replacement of the juror had they been aware of this occurrence. 
    This Court held that any private communication or contact or tampering directly or indirectly with the juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is deemed presumptively prejudicial if not made in pursuance of known rules and instructions and directions of the court with full knowledge of the parties. 
    From the record, the court -- this Court could not know what transpire the sending of an FBI agent into the midst of the trial to investigate a juror was considered conduct which was bound to impress the juror and apt to do so unduly. 
    The trial court -- this Court held that the trial court should not decide and take final action ex parte on such information but should determine the circumstances of the impact thereof upon the juror and whether or not it was prejudicial in a hearing with all interested parties permitted to participate. 
    It was remanded. 
    The trail court held such a hearing but restricted it to whether or not what effect the FBI inquiry would have on the jury. 
    This Court found that the trial courts interpretation of the mandate was too narrow. 
    However, they concluded there was sufficient evidence to permit this Court to decide the issue. 
    Now, in this case, the facts showed that the juror felt that money was involved otherwise why would have the question have been put to him by his acquaintance and a friend of the defendant. 
    The FBI had told him they were interviewing relative to the conversation to see whether there was anything to it or not. 
    He had mentioned to two other jurors that there was a question as to whether he'd been approached and said he had been under a terrific pressure. 
    Now, in applying these facts, the Court remanded it for a new trial. 
    It said it was quite evident from the evidence that he was a disturbed and troubled man from the date of the contact until after the trial and that proper concern for protecting the integrity of the jury system dictated against speculating that the FBI interview dispersed the cloud created by the communication. 
    Moreover, the juror was never certain or never aware of the Government's interpretation of the events to which he was a party. 
    And therefore, they felt that he had been subjected to extraneous influences to which no juror should be subjected. 
    Now, I submit that in this case, this Court has done exactly what we are contending and send it back to the trial judge to find the facts and to get his interpretation. 
    The trial judge miss -- unfortunately misinterpreted the court's mandate. 
    But there were sufficient facts from which this Court then itself could apply the law to the question --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1529.515" stopTime="1543.914">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What bearing do you think the entrapment offense has on your case? 
    Or let me put it more specifically, assuming once you come to conclusion that there was an issue here as to entrapment that was properly submitted to the jury, what would you say then as to your case?
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="1543.914" stopTime="1936.844">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, I -- I would think there that even in such case it made no difference, Your Honor because of the instruction on entrapment. 
    In order for this to have operated on the minds of the jury, there would have been something in the instruction concerning the predisposition of the party to commit -- of the defendant to commit the offense. 
    Now, in that instruction -- the entrapment instruction, there was no such instruction with regard to the disposition of the party to commit the offense and in this respect, I would respectfully request the Court to compare the instruction on the entrapment in this case with the instruction which was given in the Sherman case last year, Number 87 at the 1957 term and with the instruction given in the Masciale case. 
    In both of those cases, they went into the question of whether an instructive or whether the defendant was ready and willing without persuasion, was he weighing a promiscuous opportunity to -- to commit the offense. 
    Now, here, no such instruction was given because of the fact that there was no evidence in the case of prior offenses or prior disposition to commit the crime. 
    And so therefore, the Court got the -- the jury got the charge without any charge concerning predisposition and therefore there is nothing upon which this could operate they didn't know about that rule. 
    That's our position with respect to that of course we argue -- we feel that the facts in this case clearly showed that there was no entrapment as a matter of law and that the issue should have been taken away from the jury and never submit it to it. 
    So that therefore he isn't injured in anyway because he couldn't take advantage of an instruction to which he was not entitled. 
    Now, in this case, we have a clear record of questioning of the jurors. 
    We have the juror's own impressions, their own statements of their own as to their mind as to their ability to try this case fairly and impartial. 
    We have the judge's observation of those jurors which he concluded that they would be able to do that. 
    He said all of them satisfied me that they would not be influenced in any way about the item. 
    It should proceed and render a fair and impartial verdict from the evidence and the law in the case. 
    I think the concerns of the jurors was very apparent form their answers and their demeanor while they were here. 
    And I feel very confident in my own mind that the matter having been called to their attention that they will lean over backwards as a matter of fact in consideration of the case and stay away from any extraneous matter they have -- may have read or heard or anything else. 
    He further stated, of course, I propose when the instructions come to reiterate that they should not give any consideration to anything they have read or heard or anything else and should confine their consideration solely to the evidence. 
    Now, we have printed in our brief on page 7, the charge of the jury in its -- to the jury in the court's final instructions. 
    Now, the court said, “Now the arguments of counsel and the remarks of court, the court has made during the course of the trial are not evidence and should not be considered by you as evidence. 
    The evidence that you are to consider in this case is the testimony you have heard from the witness stand and the exhibits which have been admitted into evidence by the court and your deliberation should consider no other circumstances whatsoever and should not go beyond the consideration of the evidence that you have actually heard and the exhibits that you will have opportunity to examine. 
    So they were cautioned again at the end of case about what they were to consider. 
    Now, Your Honor please, this is only one of the numerous incidents in which we have to apply the question of whether there will be prejudice. 
    It may come in at the point when you are picking a jury pretrial publicity. 
    You may have prejudicial publicity at that point. 
    And yet jurors are not automatically withdrawn for cost where they have read or heard pretrial publicity. 
    It's not an automatic rule. 
    They question the jurors. 
    They've argue the jurors to find out whether they can be unbiased and impartial and if voir dire here shows that they can put aside what they have heard, put aside what they read, render a verdict on the basis of what they hear from the lips of the witness, they are acceptable as jurors. 
    We have cases -- we're doing the trial of the case, evidence is improperly admitted and later stricken from the record in all of those cases proper admonition to the jury is considered sufficient particularly where the judge and even there, you don't even voir dire the jurors to find out whether they'd be affected by the -- by what came out in the court.

    This case no one would have imagined -- the jury -- the court said that he had no idea that this case would ever in gender any publicity. 
    He was amazed at it. 
    What could we do? 
    The -- we can try cases of notoriety over and over and over again if jurors are to be excluded merely because they see something prejudicial in the newspapers. 
    Newspaper people are not lawyers. 
    They don't know what is going to be considered as prejudicial and harmful. 
    They are interested in selling news and newspapers.

    There is nothing to show that the Government has any excuse on the part other than just the only question that the the Government induced it as I get it from this instruction.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, my recollection is that when a government agent makes the approach to a citizen and himself suggest the illegal act that the question of predisposition to comply with such request is an element in the case.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, it is if the Government raises the issue. 
    It then becomes -- if the jury finds that there was that inducement then the further question depends upon whether the Government meets the issue and brings in the issue of predisposition then the evidence becomes if he did -- defendant was ready and willing -- it becomes incumbent upon the Government to show predisposition. 
    The Government doesn't show predisposition, we meet right on the issue of inducement and that's where we met here.

    Would it be improper for the -- for the defendant to point out that there is nothing in the record of the case to indicate any predisposition on the part of his client to commit a crime of this and all you got is the unsupported word of the undercover agent who did such and such a thing. 
    Isn't that legitimate argument?

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Wouldn't that be what the defense counsel would be arguing namely the absence of evidence saying to the jury in the absence of evidence you have to assume or may assume that he would not have acted from any (Inaudible) of his own.
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="2671.030" stopTime="2753.009">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, I don't quite see how that is admissible on the question of entrapment here. 
    As the case -- at the time it went to the jury, I just don't see and cannot understand how it would be admissible -- permissible argument. 
    I don't say that he might not have made it and that the Government may not have objected. 
    But I think if they did, they would have some basis for objecting to that argument. 
    There was no evidence on it. 
    So that I feel that -- the Government feels that he has not been prejudiced on the entrapment certainly for two reasons, one that there was nothing in the instructions upon which this information could operate. 
    Secondly, that we feel there was no entrapment at all as a matter of law. 
    And under that posture, we feel that he wasn't hurt at all on the entrapment issue, he could have not been hurt. 
    I have argued the points involved here, Your Honor and I believe I have some more time but I don't think unless there are some questions the Court has. 
   
   
   
   Argument of George J. Francis
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2753.009" stopTime="2758.075">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you -- thank you Mr. Knapp. 
    Mr. Francis.
speaker="george_j_francis" startTime="2758.075" stopTime="2940.519">
    Mr. George J. Francis 
    Mr. Chief Justice Warren, if the Court please. 
    I would like to make a brief reply to several points that the counsel of the Government raised. 
    The counsel for the Government indicates in his statements that the article is prejudicial in itself. 
    Now, on the face of it, now it's hard to examine the mind of a jury especially from a record as brief as this. 
    I've tried to go into that yesterday evening, I would like to call the Court's attention to what the Government counsel referred to as one of the three questions as an indication of how agreeable the jury was to give any answer that would not show that they had prejudiced in their mind. 
    The purpose of that is to show in one instance how ridiculous their position was. 
    The Court asked, most of those who read this one question, was there anything in that articles that would prejudice you against the defendant? 
    Well it would seem to me the obvious answer is yes there is something in that article that would prejudice but I am not prejudiced. 
    But all of them, very flat-footedly said why there is nothing in that article that would prejudice mean. 
    On the face of it, that's an impossible position because reading the article, no person could fail but to see that the article in its very nature was of a prejudicial sort. 
    As to how reliable the jury is again we only have a very brief record. 
    But the Government counsel refers to one party who didn't read the newspaper at all and he is not counted as one of the six who read because her statement was, I scanned it, and therefore in the petitioner's count hypnosis she was omitted. 
    But listen to how reliable the jury is herself at page 44 of the record. 
    Mrs. (Inaudible), the only thing he told me was that the jury has been selected and so many women and so many men and he said I suppose this means you, this is the case you are on and he didn't tell me anything further than that and he knew that I'm not suppose to read newspaper pieces and I glanced at the headlines of it and scanned it. 
    Here, the lady admits that she knows that something is improper and then goes on to state that despite that I went ahead and scanned it. 
    It's her own admission.
