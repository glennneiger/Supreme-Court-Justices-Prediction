    -- to appoint but I think Mr. Spritzer gave a wrong impression about the second suit, the independent suit filed by the Government on the -- the identical cause of action, the identical words, was brought before, the set off was pleaded in this case. 
    And that suit still is going on to -- to the issue and testimony has been taken but the Government doesn't proceed with it because they're waiting to hear how this case comes out. 
    So we have the result that the identical words appeal on two pieces of paper, one of them is called an answer in this suit and the other is called a libel in the independent suit that's still pending and they will be decided before the same judges and the merits of the case will be determined. 
    And that also satisfies the -- the requirement of Section 227 that you spoke of, Mr. Justice Whittaker because that only requires a new suit to be brought by the Government in case a judgment is recovered against the Government on the -- respondents claim here.

    Well, our -- our client gains exactly the thing that I think is one of the reasons that the Government doesn't want this to happen. 
    If the Government -- if we obtain the decree or hold the decree which we now have, then the Government is required to either accept our claim or to assert its -- or prosecute its suit, its independent suit to a conclusion. 
    And if it fails to do so, then we are entitled successfully, then the statute expressly provides Section 227 of Title 31 that as compensation for the delay, our client is entitled to interest. 
    Congress has so provided and that's the remedy that they were entitled to have of what -- they get to this set off voice, why of course, that's a different sort of situation.

speaker="clement_c_rinehart" startTime="210.578" stopTime="267.335">
    Mr. Clement C. Rinehart 
    Well, I think that that is probably so except that within the violation of the Admiralty Rule and that is -- that's in this particular case was because I think that the cross claim that the Government has set up is within admiralty jurisdiction but the moment you -- you depart from the rule, you get into all the troubles that you have in Admiralty where you have limited jurisdiction over the subject matter. 
    You have actions in rem and you -- and all sorts of complications that would arise and that's one reason why I think that it would be wrong for the Court, on the basis of the facts in one particular litigation to make a change in the general rule which has existed for nearly a century and a half and presumably with good reason. 
    And it -- it should be done by independent rule making if it is to be done when all the pros and cons can properly be considered, but not on the basis of the record of particular facts in the particular case.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    No, it says a little more. 
    It says that, “If there's are judgment against the United States and the United States has a claim against the judgment creditor, the controller must withhold payment. 
    And if the Government's claim is not in suit, then he must put it in suit and continue to withhold until the Government claim is liquidated and then off set.”

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Now -- now that I don't quite understand if that's -- if that's a rule of substantive law, then why wouldn't that supersede these local rules of practice which the District Court was authorized to promulgate and did under the names -- numbers of 16 and 17.

    Well, I don't understand that that entitles the -- the Section 227 entitles the United States to prosecute the suit that's called for, in a way, was in violation of the rules of practice of the particular Court. 
    And this would be in violation of the rules of admiralty to permit the set off of an unrelated counterclaim, was in the same suit. 
    I don't understand that Section 227 is intended to overrule the practice that exist and which another statute, the suits in Admiralty Act requires to be observed in the case.

    This independency will be a cross-libel. 
    If it arises out of the same transaction as the original libel, now the -- that's what the -- the rule of this Court says too, Rule 44 which is quoted in the brief.

    Two weeks later or a month later, there's another petition, fully independent party, totally different party. 
    And this Court consolidates those two cases in argument, fused within one case in argument, dividing time appropriately, dispose of it in one opinion. 
    Now, why -- just tell me what rule, either explicit rule or what practice in admiralty and the reason for it that disabled the District Courts from granting a libel that's filed by -- is -- by -- is -- by Isthmian Steamship Company against the United States in a totally separate libel filed on a separate day by Uncle Sam against the Isthmian Company. 
    What is there in rules, either of the local, of the -- the Southern District or this Court or admiralty practice with bars consolidating those two proceedings and having them heard by a single judge. 
    Assuming both -- assuming further that they're both plain admiralty cases, not raising questions of jury trial, I don't see why I have to -- I like to disclose my mind to counsel.

    Well, it isn't anything that the Second Circuit has adopted, Your Honor. 
    This is the -- the rule in admiralty has existed from the beginning.

    Mr. Clement C. Rinehart 
    Whether the reasons for a rule applies or not, it's another point. 
    But the point is that Congress has passed the law which says that the rules that govern private litigation shall govern suits against the Government. 
    And the first thing the Government does in this suit is to ask for a special rule, an exception to be made in favor of the Government when Congress says that -- that the ground rules that apply to the other litigants also apply to the Government.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1000.707" stopTime="1006.607">

    Well, apart from the -- the interest question which I have already spoken of, I don't -- the -- and that doesn't necessarily mean that we would lose but under Section 227, we have a clear right to the interest. 
    Now, if the case is reversed and it goes back for trial on the setoff, then of course it's in the discretion of the trial judge as to whether or not, assuming the Government is unsuccessful, he allows interest on our claim.

    Mr. Clement C. Rinehart 
    No. 
    Then -- then there's another thing that I would like to mention before my time is up and that is if the rule is changed, where you come to suits by the Government against private parties so as to permit the Government to interpose the setoffs. 
    They're going to be left with a very incongruous situation because by statute, under the Public Vessels Act, when the Government is the actor and sues the private party in admiralty, you may not by statutory rule, Section 3 of the Public Vessels Act assert against the Government any setoff unless that -- these are words arising out of the subject matter for cause of action contained in the Government's libel. 
    In other words, the private party, when he sues the Government, has to observe the Admiralty Rule and will have to no matter what the Court does about any rule in this case because no decisional rule could change that statute and the Government would have the Admiralty Rule applicable in cases where it was the litigant or of in the libel.

    As you well know, the courts have done all sorts of things under that phrase, “Arising out of.”
