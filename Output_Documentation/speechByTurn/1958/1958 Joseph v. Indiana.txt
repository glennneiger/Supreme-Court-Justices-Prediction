    Mr. William S. Isham 
    -- members of the Court. 
    This case covers on here as a result of a partial certiorari being granted on petition resulting from a conviction for murder in the Supreme Court of Indiana. 
    I have been appointed attorney in forma pauperis by the court. 
    I think in fairness to all of us and particularly in light of my peculiar employment, I should say this. 
    Before I start in on some particular aspects of this case, that I am in a truly unique position. 
    I think I am in a position here representing these men and I -- I apprehend it's my duty to do the best thing for them. 
    I am in a position where if I succeeded in having this Court today, hold with me, on the proposition that these confessions were improperly admitted because of violating the Due Process Clause, that I would, in effect, defeat the very quickest and most sure way from my clients to get out of prison. 
    I would simply prolong their long trip there where they've already been for 25 years, because I apprehend the Court would reverse the judgment of the Indiana Supreme Court and remanded for trial again. 
    Trial again is not going to help these men. 
    They have been through the trial again, time and again. 
    I would like, if I may, to briefly give the Court a little outline of the historical facts in this case, which I feel are very pertinent in discussing the question of the confession at a little later stage. 
    These two men --

    Your Honor, they don't want a new trial. 
    They didn't -- they didn't want a new trial. 
    They filed a motion for new trial, as I shall point out here, in Indiana because it was the only procedural method to have an exhaustion of their state remedies in order to get under the federal court on a matter of habeas corpus. 
    And what do the Indiana court do behold? 
    It granted a new trial. 
    A judge who had never heard the case, 14 years later, granted a new trial. 
    Now, the only reason the motion was filed, as I shall point out, is because that is the only way in Indiana that one may have an appellate review of most of his conviction. 
    Anything relating to the trial itself must be done through the implementation of a motion for a new trial. 
    Behold the court granted a new trial. 
    They were then in the dilemma of having to go through a new trial, go through a new trial 17 years after the facts occurred in this.

    Mr. William S. Isham 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I'm -- I'm not saying that. 
    Permit me to start at the beginning and I think it will clarify itself with it. 
    To begin with, these men were -- were in an apartment in Indianapolis on February 22nd, a significant day --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="259.625" stopTime="260.773">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What year?
speaker="william_s_isham" startTime="260.773" stopTime="498.524">
    Mr. William S. Isham 
    1935. 
    No, no. 
    They weren't -- in 1935, they're -- in December 7th, 1935 they're in an apartment in Indianapolis. 
    Both of these men were fugitives from justice. 
    They'd escape from the Indiana penitentiary. 
    They were young men at the time. 
    They were fugitives from justice. 
    Too plainclothes policemen came there without warrant, rap on the door, the door was opened and in a semi-lit room, there was a lot of shooting occurred. 
    Now, one of the men, the -- or the plainclothesman, one of the men was shot in the belly and died on the 18th of December, that's 11 days afterward. 
    Both of the two defendants Pierce and -- and Joseph were shot. 
    Pierce was shot through the chest the bullet going in one side that coming out the other. 
    David was shot under his left arm and the bullet coming out in his back. 
    Now that they got away from the police and on the 10th of December at 2:30 a.m., the state police apprehended them. 
    They were in their underwear. 
    They were pulled out of bed and were taken to the state police barracks in Indianapolis on the 10th. 
    They have had no medical attention in the meantime. 
    They had attempted to put some mercurochrome on their wounds themselves. 
    Naturally, they were afraid to go to a doctor and -- and exhibit bullet wounds. 
    So, then on the 10th of December at about 10 o'clock in the morning, after being there all night, they were turned over to the city police of Indianapolis. 
    Now, the city police -- the city policeman, was a policeman who got shot and who ultimately dies. 
    They were turned over to his cohorts, his pals in the same police force for questioning. 
    Now -- now, after a time which I shall go into a more detail in a minute, they signed two writings purporting to be confessions, detailing some factors which laded on them for -- for first degree murder instead of at most, a manslaughter, or assault and battery with intent. 
    Now -- now then, this case was ultimately tried in -- on February 22nd, 1936 and they were convicted that day of first degree murder. 
    Immediately they were taken to the Indiana penitentiary. 
    In Indiana, we have a -- a right to appeal. 
    Every man has a right to appeal from a criminal conviction as a matter of right. 
    To appeal, he has to file first a motion for a new trial within 30 days. 
    At the time this occurrence in 1936, the courts had held if you do not file a motion for a new trial in 30 days, you're out of luck. 
    You both waived it and the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to do anything about it to correct it. 
    Now, that's in 1936. 
    These men were taken after the prison. 
    They were put in a solitary confinement up here, the day after they were convicted. 
    And they went along for a period of days which ate up the 30 days. 
    They had no opportunity to communicate with anybody. 
    They were held completely incommunicado --

    The case of -- of Walker against State was decided, which held that under certain circumstances, one might petition the court where the case had been tried at a later date and have a belated motion for a new trial filed which could then be processed into an appeal.

    Yes, it's case law and basically, the ground for getting a belated motion for a new trial is the allegation of facts under oath which would constitute a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, either the Due Process Clause or the denial of equal protection.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="729.143" stopTime="730.730">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That was 1948, did you say?
speaker="william_s_isham" startTime="730.730" stopTime="894.701">
    Mr. William S. Isham 
    1948. 
    Within three months after that case was decided, Your Honor, in this case, a -- a petition was filed for leave to file a belated motion for a new trial in the court below. 
    The State of Indiana demurred to the petition and the lower court overruled the demurrer. 
    Then the State of Indiana brought an original action in the Supreme Court of Indiana seeking to get a writ of prohibition, prohibiting that court from passing upon the validity of this petition for filling a belated motion. 
    That was denied. 
    Prohibition was denied. 
    Then the State of Indiana came in after its demurrer to the -- the petition had been ruled upon and asked leave to amend its demurrer which was granted. 
    They amended the demurrer and the lower court sustained the demurrer. 
    There was an appeal taken by Joseph in that case to the Supreme Court of Indiana. 
    And the Court there held, that the demurrer -- that they -- he reversed the case. 
    And in that case, he cited -- the Supreme Court cited the case of Cochran against Kansas, which was the -- where the appeal papers of a prisoner were suppressed by the State and also cited the case of Dowd, Warden against Cook, which I argued in this Court some seven or eight years ago, involving the same sort of question. 
    So the thing was sent back to the court again. 
    And that time the court granted the petition for leave to file a belated motion for a new trial. 
    Now, that occurred -- that's along 1953. 
    Now, they've been in there since -- they've been there 18 years. 
    So, the petition was then -- the motion for a new trial and the belated motion was filed. 
    Now, it was a formal -- little formal motion and the court sustained the motion granting a new trial on June 29th, 1953. 
    Now that was -- you see three and 15, that's 18 years after this shooting occurred. 
    They are then granted the right to have a trial in a State that has a constitutional and statutory requirement that every man has a right to speedy justice, 18 years.

    And they've tried to and tried to, until the time it expired and then it was a pure knowledge.

    Mr. William S. Isham 
    It's our contention -- it's our contention here that this confession was the type of confession that was talked about in the Watts case. 
    As a matter of fact, the coat of many colors, the issue of fact, the coat of many colors. 
    We even have -- we even have one of the parties here, his name is Joseph. 
    Now, in this case, it must be remembered that these witnesses were testifying as to events which occurred 18 years before they testified. 
    There was no record made of the first trial at all. 
    That was not available to them. 
    It was that kind of evidence. 
    You have police detectives interrogating, separately, men who were injured, who would have no medical attention for at least three days, who certainly had infected wounds, there's no denial of that. 
    There's no dispute about that or a shot clear through. 
    They were being interrogated by the associates of the man who was shot. 
    Now, it does seem to me that that's a place where the Court could qualify the language of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Watts case, that we can't deny, as judges, things we know as men. 
    Now, I don't care how beautiful the language was about the little Pollyanna talk that they testified they had with these prisoners, but here are associates of the man who was shot along with each of these men separately, both of them wounded, both -- and each instance they -- they had no attorney. 
    They were not taken before the magistrate as the -- as the Indiana law requires. 
    They never did get there. 
    They didn't see a lawyer until after this man died 11 days. 
    They were held locked up. 
    They were taken to the hospital immediately after they signed a confession, immediately after. 
    Now, the evidence shows that the -- the police officers said in interrogating them that they never asked for a lawyer. 
    That they never complained to me that they were suffering and so forth, they never looked at a wound. 
    That's the undisputed evidence here. 
    The police officers never examined one of their wounds. 
    They know they were shot. 
    They knew it. 
    They knew the bullets had gone clear through them. 
    They said they couldn't do anything about it, so they didn't even look at the wounds. 
    They stated --

    Whether it's true or not, I don't know. 
    Were they paying for him?
speaker="william_s_isham" startTime="1819.896" stopTime="2017.921">
    Mr. William S. Isham 
    No, I'm talking about -- maybe you misunderstood me. 
    I'm talking about the detectives at the detective bureau. 
    At that time, while they had him they did -- they don't need any doctor there, until he'd signed the confession. 
    Then they took him over to the hospital immediately after. 
    Now, there is evidence, Your Honor, that at the state police headquarters, a doctor had looked at these wounds. 
    That doctor, of course, didn't testify and -- but that's -- that's a disputed question, we'll throw that out. 
    But the -- the -- the man in charge of the interrogation did not look at the wounds to see how severe they were. 
    They said they couldn't do anything about it anyway. 
    They said that they never asked for an attorney, but they also said that they wouldn't have gotten one, if he had asked until they got through their questioning. 
    Meaning, he'd sign his confession. 
    They said his parents had never been there to see him and that they could have been if they'd come after they got through interrogating. 
    And after they got through interrogating, the courts as when they signed the confession. 
    Now, all that's in the record and is undisputed, and with the picture, the background -- the background of plainclothesman interrogating two men charged for shooting one of their fellow plainclothesman on the Indianapolis police force. 
    And with these men in the physical condition they were admittedly in, it does seem to me that you have a background where the Court should look into this thing and weigh some of this evidence as it has done in other cases regardless of what the Court is saying. 
    Now, one of the things here in this case which -- and -- and one of the things which points to the danger of having a trial 18 years afterwards, as this was, all of this is evidence that occurred 18 years after the fact. 
    Here were men, 75 years old, retired from the police force, testifying about who was there and what the fellow said and what he didn't say 18 years before. 
    Now, another thing, both of the defendants in that -- that case charged that the -- that the -- the confession was made the following day rather than the day that the police said. 
    This is admitted that immediately after the confession was signed, they were taken to the hospital, the city hospital, city police city hospital, they were taken over there. 
    But when this case came for trial, the record of that hospital showing when they were admitted for that treatment, it would seem to me would be rather conclusive about how long they'd have them under surveillance and how long they'd have them under questioning, but that was not brought out. 
    I assume it was because the long lapse of time had meant disappearance and destruction of the hospital record. 
    That's just one of the things, some of the guns were missing, no ballistics was available at all and after 18 years, I don't care what you try to do, you can't have anything that bears semblance to a fair trial. 
    It isn't a trial at all, it's just a mockery. 
    And that's what these men had.

    Mr. William S. Isham 
    And that is the purpose I -- I don't want to correct the feel that -- that I have any positive idea that, of course, that these men were tried again in Indiana they'd be convicted. 
    I don't think that but -- but I do -- I do mean that when you attempt to evaluate the risk, hear -- hear, a man -- hear a man when they take the witness stand. 
    They're not men who were just charged with crime, they're men who spent 18 years in the federal -- in the -- in the state penitentiary, which is enough of itself to put a blast on anything they might say. 
    It's anything they say why it's -- it would have no credence whatever. 
    And your records lost -- this hospital records. 
    Now, I think that would be a very important item of evidence to know the day that those men were treated in the hospital because that was the day the confession was signed. 
    And there is, or was, certainly a -- a hospital record which very clearly indicated that, but it wasn't at the trial and it probably was lost along with things that get lost after so long a period of time. 
    It just stopped and think back, 18 years ago today, Pearl Harbor, 1941. 
    What the -- what does -- what does one remember about episodes back in 1941, except things that were just tremendously outstanding? 
    And -- and that is the -- that's the test that these men are all put to and it does seem to me, Your Honors, that -- that in this -- in this sort of settlement where the evidence is coming 18 years after the fact, and the -- the whole picture taking into consideration that we know how policemen treat men who shoot policemen.

    I think it would go the other way. 
    It seems to me it would be the duty of the State to come in and say, "Well, even if we were (Inaudible) for all of these 18 years, still he didn't get hurt, that's virtually what was done of the Cook case. 
    And in the Cook case, if the -- if they had been able to give him a -- an appeal 18 years afterward of his original conviction, and the Supreme Court affirmed it, why he wasn't hurt because they would've affirmed it one year after his conviction. 
    But when he was granted a new trial that cast a whole new light on it because other men are entitled to new trials within less than 18 years after the crime of which they're charged. 
    And that's my feeling about that.

    Mr.O'Mahoney.
speaker="robert_m_omahoney" startTime="2428.702" stopTime="2516.048">
    Mr. Robert M. O'Mahoney 
    May it please the Honorable Court. 
    I think I should add my tribute to that of the courts to Mr. Isham's appearance here. 
    I know that during the course of this proceeding he's had a serious personal loss in his family and yet he has continued his perseverance in this cause and I think that the sincerity and principles are beyond question. 
    I submit, however, that the essence of his dilemma in his action really is that the question before this Court has already been resolved against him. 
    The record conclusively resolves it against him and the fact is that these petitioners were not denied their constitutional rights in the courts of the -- of the State of Indiana. 
    They were not convicted on the basis of coerced confessions. 
    The confessions that were admitted at their trial in Hancock County, Indiana were not coerced. 
    Now, Mr. Isham made most of his argument on other points and for that reason I shall, as soon as I can, devote a good deal of time to those points since I think the Court is interested in -- in them, but I think first of all that we should discuss the question which the Court has before it which is the admissibility of the confessions either written or oral.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2516.048" stopTime="2519.280">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you think that's all we're interested in, Mr.O'Mahoney?
speaker="robert_m_omahoney" startTime="2519.280" stopTime="2597.457">
    Mr. Robert M. O'Mahoney 
    Now, first of all, there are three points or four points rather that perhaps we didn't bring out this sufficient clarity in our brief in this cause and I'd like to point those out and the first one is important, I think, particularly because the emphasis of Mr. Isham put on the situation which existed in 1935 in Indiana when these two petitioners where apprehended after having been in a shooting scrape with Indianapolis Police Department officers. 
    First of all, the officer who was later dead was not dead at any time during these -- when the statements were taken. 
    Now, that doesn't mean that it wasn't possible for coercion or duress have been used on them because the police officers who were interrogating them were fellow officers of an officer who had been wounded. 
    But I think it's important because there was not a reason for the hysteria that a death of a fellow officer might have generated, at the time. 
    Well, this was December the 10th. 
    The officer was very much alive. 
    And in fact on December 13th, as the record shows, he identified these petitioners from his hospial bed. 
    He was in sufficiently good health at that time. 
    Now, what happened --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2597.457" stopTime="2598.703">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    When did he die, Mr.O'Mahoney?
speaker="robert_m_omahoney" startTime="2598.703" stopTime="2604.528">
    Mr. Robert M. O'Mahoney 
    He died 8th -- December the 18th. 
    This was five days after he identified --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2604.528" stopTime="2604.865">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="robert_m_omahoney" startTime="2604.865" stopTime="2707.426">
    Mr. Robert M. O'Mahoney 
    -- the petitioners and it was either and I say either, it was either six days or it was eight days after their confessions. 
    Now, there are some things that are undisputed in this record and there are other things that are disputed and I take issue with my fellow counsel on what those things are. 
    So, I'm going to start from the beginning. 
    These two individuals escaped from Michigan City Penitentiary together. 
    They were in the penitentiary on a 10-year sentences for auto banditry and they are approximately had served half of their sentences. 
    They were -- they rented an apartment in Indianapolis and on December the 7th, two Indianapolis police officers went to that apartment, knocked on the door and gained entrance. 
    Now, their dispute is to how they gained entrance, but they did gain entrance and there was a gun battle. 
    After the gun battle, in which all four participants were wounded, these petitioners made their escape by running out of a backdoor, down a stairway, through an alley and intercepting an automobile being driven by a doctor. 
    They relieved the doctor of his automobile and drove with his car which included his medical kit to a town near Rushville, Indiana, approximately 50 miles distant from the City of Indianapolis. 
    There, they remained from December 7th until early on the morning of December 10th, when a squad of State police officers surrounded the house and succeeded in capturing them without any further bloodshed or gun battles. 
    They were taken from their place of capture to the Rushville State Police Post. 
    The record doesn't say how long they remained there. 
    They went from there to the State --

    Mr. Robert M. O'Mahoney 
    Two days and about a half as they were there the afternoon of December the 7th. 
    It took -- it takes about an hour, I'd say, an hour and a half. 
    And they were all -- they're all of the 8th and all of the 9th until the morning of the 10th. 
    Now, they were taken from the Rushville post to the Indianapolis State Police Headquarters which at that time were located in the basement of the Statehouse. 
    And there, according to the State's version of what happened, they were held without being talked to by any police officers except the captain who was in charge of the state police until they were attended by the state police physician, Dr. Byrd (ph). 
    Now, their version is they weren't, but these -- these two versions are directly contradictory. 
    Dr. Byrd (ph) treated them an hour according to State's version of the case and was paid by them out of money they had on their person when they were captured. 
    About 8, 8:30 or 9 o'clock that morning, they were turned over by the Indiana State Police to the Indianapolis Police Departmet and were taken then to Indianapolis Police Headquarters. 
    Now, here the story is diverged diametrically. 
    According to the State's version of the events, they talked freely about what happened at all times when they came from the Rushville post to the state police headquarters. 
    There are statements in the record. 
    There is testimony that they admitted the crime at that time.In fact, were boastful about it, proud of it. 
    There are statements between the Indianapolis Police Department Headquarters and the Indianapolis State Police Headquarters. 
    According to the State's version of the events, within a matter of two hours or less, after their arrival on the morning of December 10th at Indianapolis Police Headquarters, they had signed their confessions. 
    They were then and here we agree, immediately taken to the city hospital. 
    Now, Mr. Isham raises a question and I think it's a good one as to why weren't the hospital records introduced at this time to show just exactly what the date was. 
    And I don't think we have to wonder very long about that reason. 
    The reason that they weren't introduced is because if they had been introduced, they would not have confirmed the petitioner's story. 
    More than that, why wasn't the testimony of say the attending physician at the city hospital introduced by the petitioners who were well aware, in advance, that they would raise this issue at the trial and who did raised it and who would have a hearing outside the presence of a jury on the question of the admissibility of these confessions and introduced only their own statements at that hearing? 
    The reason that they didn't introduce it appears in the testimony of the individual concerned. 
    He did testify as a witness at the trial and he did testify as to this question. 
    Now, his testimony appears at page 192 or 193 of the printed record. 
    And I think it pretty well shows why those records weren't introduced. 
    And apparently, although this is only surmised, they were in existence at the time of this trial. 
    This is the testimony of Dr. (Inaudible) and he testified that he was the superintendent or the assistant superintendent of the city hospital when these men were brought in the hospital. 
    He further testified that he was the attending physician when they were brought in the hospital. 
    He testified that they were brought in the hospital sometime around the morning of December 10th and he testified further and I think this is extremely important, that it was his opinion and this appears at the middle of page 195. 
    That the physical condition of these two men -- now, this is on December 10th, did not warrant their hospitalization. 
    They were examined and treated as outpatients at the city hospital. 
    Now, I submit to you that's the State's version. 
    Their version is that they were held for all of the 10th, all of the 11th, without proper medical treatment that they were in serious condition, that they were held in cells overnight without food and without water. 
    That's their version. 
    There's not a single bit of evidence in the whole record to verify any statement they make along that line.

    And it's -- that Supreme Court judgment for this --
speaker="robert_m_omahoney" startTime="3305.693" stopTime="3462.612">
    Mr. Robert M. O'Mahoney 
    This petition for a certiorari has been granted. 
    Now, they raised this issue concerning the -- what would happen to them. 
    The -- the proposition which, I think, if I understand Mr. Isham correctly, is what he would like to contend here but it's for -- gone from contending because of the ruling of the court on the petition for certiorari, they raised the issue of this denial of a right to an appeal. 
    Because Mr. Isham seems to feel that if that had been -- if that they gone up through the Supreme Court of Indiana, they might somehow rather have gotten to federal court and filed a writ of habeas corpus having then exhausted their state remedy. 
    And Mr. Isham, I submit, is entranced with that system because it worked for Lawrence Cook, who was a good friend of these two petitioners and has helped them as far as these proceedings are concerned, a great deal. 
    But, I submit that Mr. Isham misunderstands what this Court did in the Cook case and I don't think -- he doesn't misunderstand the result, but he understands how it was -- misunderstands how it was achieved. 
    This was raised in that Cook case and I'll -- I'll read just a -- a moment from my reply to the petition for certiorari originally granted or made. 
    I say in an earlier part of their petition under the heading of questions presented for review, petitioner cites Dowd versus United States ex rel.Cook, which is in 340 U.S.206. 
    And I say that petitioner seemed to cite the Cook case in support of the contention that unless they were granted an appellate review of their original conviction, they were under the language of the Cook case. 
    Now this is Mr. Isham's contention, as I understand it here, entitled to an absolute discharge. 
    This is not the holding of the Cook case and I submit it is not. 
    The last paragraph of that case as it's decided by this Court is as follows and I quote at page 46 of -- I'm sorry. 
    I don't -- I don't have the exact page of that citing. 
    But anyway, the quotation is this, “On remand, the District Court should enter such orders as are appropriate to allow the State, a reasonable time, in which to afford respondent the full appellate review he would have received, but for the suppression of his papers, failing which he shall be discharged.” 
    What happened was they failed. 
    They didn't --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Robert M. O'Mahoney

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3464.095" stopTime="3467.688">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Robert M. O'Mahoney 
    They were fellow inmates --

speaker="robert_m_omahoney" startTime="3471.080" stopTime="3490.544">
    Mr. Robert M. O'Mahoney 
    No, not in the same crime. 
    But that's -- that did achieve Cook's discharge because of the Supreme Court of Indiana didn't review his case and the ultimate result of it in compliance with the court's order was that he had to be discharged, but had they reviewed his case, the only thing he could have achieved was a new trial.

    Mr. Robert M. O'Mahoney 
    I don't know, Mr. Justice Black, why they didn't. 
    Now, I want to say something else in regard to this constitutional issue that they've raised here and I think it's very important and it's this. 
    Paul Pierce took the witness stand in this case. 
    Now, I regret we haven't got that in the printed record, but we -- through our own inadvertence didn't do it, but I think Mr. Isham will conceive this is true. 
    He took the witness stand and admitted that he shot Orville Quinnette, the police officer. 
    There isn't any question, whatever, about him shooting the man. 
    And we do have in his printed record his own admission in the statements made in the hearing on the admissibility of his confession that he did shoot Orville Quinnette. 
    He says that and that appears in here. 
    Now, the difference between his version of the events and the confession to which these people object and which they say was coerced is the slight one and it's only this. 
    He says that Quinnette came in the door, pulled a gun and started shooting and that he shot back. 
    It would seem to mean self-defense. 
    Now, of course, admittedly at the time these two men were fugitives from justice and escaped prisoners from Indiana State Prison and I don't think his version of the story was believed. 
    But he admits shooting the man. 
    There isn't any question about him shooting the man. 
    And his version from the so-called coerced confession is a slight one, a very slight one.

    So that's -- it hardly matters. 
    I want to say just one other thing and I think that I'm done -- or two other things. 
    There's been some comment here that leaves inference that there is something defective in the post-conviction remedies in the State of Indiana, and it was said earlier in this Court in another case, the earlier case which was here last week. 
    While this is not an issue here, I think I should point out that we have post-conviction remedies in Indiana that we believe are adequate. 
    And that they're available to these petitioners as they are to any others and we are not forced to adopt the Due Process Clause. 
    We have a Due Process Clause in our own Constitution, which we enforce, I hope, in most cases.

    Now, there's one other thing. 
    The comment was made as to parole and what possibilities a parole are. 
    Now, I can't speak for the parole authority of the State of Indiana, but I have dealt with the -- our criminal institutions for the past three years. 
    And it is true that it is a policy while matters are pending in court, that they do not parole men. 
    Now, this policy is a sound one. 
    I think if you contemplate it. 
    And it's sound for this reason, if a man files a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Federal Court of the Northern District of Indiana alleging that he's being held unconstitutional in one way, the end of the proceeding summarily as far as the State is concerned would be paroling. 
    Then whatever the question was, it wouldn't come up. 
    We don't do that. 
    If he wants to prosecute a writ and says that he's being held unconstitutional, let him prosecute his writ and settle -- settle the issue in court.
