speaker="edward_s_greenbaum" startTime="0.000" stopTime="293.420">
    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    -- this was required to run in North Dakota, I understood your question was how many votes. 
    There is no primary at this filing of a petition there. 
    And I could say I haven't done well and I have a little trouble hearing so I apologize for that. 
    As we were indicating a moment ago the situation in this case is that in 1927, this statute was passed and this is the first time nearly a third of a century that this case has come before this Court. 
    The act at that time when the statute was passed had no such thing as television, radio we might say just been born, television had been conceived but wasn't born and then the intervening period of time we've had various cases that have come up. 
    And just very briefly to give the Court a picture of what's happened. 
    The statutes that are quoted in our brief on pages 2 and 3 and pages 2, it's the statute 315 which is presently before you. 
    The big purpose of this statute was of course to give equal time to the opposing candidate. 
    A new concept had entered into the American field and as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said for this Court in the case of NBC against FCC, we had a unique situation where the time was limited, and therefore for the first time and as far as I can see in our history we did have a need and rightly so for control. 
    So 315 sir in the early days there that if any licensee shall permit a political opponent to have the right to use of the station, the other time, the other candidate must be granted equal time and that is the question before us now, that -- into that statute has been read the provision that the equal time allows immunity to the station. 
    It is our contention that what Congress was saying was, you do not have to give equal time to anybody but if you do then you must let the opponent or in this case the opponents have equal opportunities to answer. 
    At the same time the statute contained two other provisions. 
    You will notice on page 2 of our brief that proviso provided that such licensee shall have no power censorship over the material broadcast. 
    And on the following page, page 3, it is stated in the Section 326 at the top of the page that nothing in the act shall interfere with -- I am sorry, 414 that nothing in the act shall in anyway abridge or alter the remedies now existing either at common law or by statute. 
    The fact is, if the Court please, that in spite of these provisions, the court in South Dakota has granted immunity to the television station and has said that there is no responsibility on its part. 
    It is our contention going back to the question that Mr. Justice Black indicated before lunch that whether or not Congress could have done this, whether it had the statutory power and as our opponents say it could have done it by the stroke of the pen, the fact is that it never took that stroke of that pen. 
    Indeed when the first section was passed by the United States Senate, I am talking now of 315, it did include an immunity provision. 
    There was considerable debate about that in the Senate and then in conference it was stricken out. 
    And since that time 16 different times, Congress has been asked to and 16 different times Congress has refused to grant this immunity. 
    Very briefly the history of the section and what's happened on it since then is this. 
    In 1932, that's the period of five years the first case arose, this in Nebraska, the case was Sorenson against Wood and that court held that there is no immunity there and therefore it held in favor of the plaintiff and held the television station libel.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Immunity under the Federal statute or immunity under the state law?
speaker="edward_s_greenbaum" startTime="296.983" stopTime="589.514">
    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    It would always be under the state law Your Honor but as far as we can see the argument presently made, one of the arguments is that the federal statute gives what is called, if I may use the language there, a federal immunity which means the federal -- and as the field of libel which of course is definitely a state function and by entering that field, immunity is granted. 
    So I am unable to answer your question. 
    I leave better than by saying immunity is granted under the federal statute of 315. 
    In other words, the state law has been infringed upon by the Congress on that. 
    Things went along, what I would call, rather quietly on this particular front to 1932 till, when the Sorenson case was decided, till 1948. 
    In fact we could add the prior five years to that and say from '37 to '48 a period of 21 years when this question was more or less quiet. 
    Then in 1948 after the commission, Federal Communications Commission held that case to two-and-a-half years, it decided that the statute of 315 granted not only immunity, but deferred and prevented the stations from deleting or excluding exercising libelous matter. 
    That case arose in connection with a station that was up, for its three year renewal license. 
    As we indicated before every three years a station has to ask for permission to go on. 
    The station was rather forcibly we might say slapped on the wrist due to the fact that the station in a campaign before had refused to give political campaign time to any candidate. 
    So we might say and completely over to dicta if you can use that expression for the commission, it granted a renewal even though it scolded the station and said two important things, the station is not permitted to delete a libel, and two it said the station is granted immunity. 
    I don't think it would take the commission two-and-a-half years to decide that case, but it was a very split decision. 
    The dissenting commissioner Jones called the decision unnecessary and he also said the language about immunity was extremely dangerous. 
    He said and predicted that unscrupulous candidates could use this statute as thus construed as a weapon to bait labor and capital and dispense subversive division in the southern states, he didn't say the southern states, and elsewhere. 
    A few decades later after this case came up, there was an action brought by another station in Texas. 
    The question there was as to whether or not the FCC could be restrained from enforcing this action. 
    The FCC, if I may use the expression, turned turtle and ran away from its own decision. 
    It said that it wasn't any official ruling. 
    This was an interpretation in an opinion that was given. 
    And the Supreme Court in Houston, Texas said that it had no jurisdiction in the case, no power in the case because the ruling of the FCC was as the commission itself said not a binding ruling. 
    Very shortly after I believe, a few days after, the Houston Post case the question came before Congress. 
    There was appointed a special committee to investigate the Federal Communications Commission. 
    At that time the chairman of FCC was Mr. Wayne Coy who also ran away from this decision on the Port Huron case before the Congressional Committee. 
    He said that no one will have any trouble who denies a candidate the right to what anyone would hold debate a defamatory statement. 
    Congress then reported or this committee of congress reported to the Congress that FCC is not planning to enforce this and the whole matter should be looked into further, 1948 that was. 
    Things went along, I can't say this time rather quietly a little bit hectically, until 1951. 
    Then in the case of WDSU --

    Yes Your Honor they did and indicated as I said in the report, indicated that the matter they had received assurances from Wayne Coy and the reference to it is referred to in our brief where it was stated by Mr. Coy and I'm referring now to page 17. 
    You will it at the bottom of 16 and then 17. 
    The Chairman of the Committee said we expect you to enforce the laws laid down by the Congress in protecting the rights of political candidates, but on the other hand we're a little bit concerned, and I might say deeply concerned --

    I'm reading our brief at page 16, on the lower left hand corner. 
    I might say deeply concerned in the light of this Port Huron case that some broadcasters may fear the loss of their licenses if they deny a candidate the right to make what anyone would construe is a libelous statement and he asks for assurance that, that would be done and as you will see on the top of 17 the assurance came from the Chairman Mr. Coy and the report to Congress indicated Mr. Justice Frankfurter that they did have a feeling, not only a feeling, the assurance that no immediate action would be taken.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I started to read, I haven't hope to read all of his testimony, it's fairly long, Mr. Coy, but he was very emphatic and unqualified in his then view that reasons, the proper construction of 315 involved or led to imply immunity and a displacement of all state law, even though unequivocally in his testimony, at least as far as I've read.

    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    Well if Your Honor, please I think the decision in the case that he was taking about part sure on was doing it, whether you call it capricious or not, if a station was to take action, by broadcasting something, by taking out something that is libelous, that was to be condemned by FCC. 
    I think that's what he meant by the word capricious. 
    In other words Huston, not Houston, the Port Huron case had said specifically that no station may delete and if they do we will deny them the right to have a license.

    And the Court there reported the question of -- there is in 1948, on 19 if you see in the middle of the page, that's the reference that we have to it there. 
    The question of immunity of broadcasters from liability was the principle subject matter of those hearings and no legislation was recommended. 
    There is no --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="968.427" stopTime="972.220">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible) legislation would recommend it, they rejected what the Senate proposed.
speaker="edward_s_greenbaum" startTime="972.220" stopTime="1057.786">
    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    That's right, at that time. 
    I have no specific reference that I can give you, other than the action there as to what they did. 
    They got the assurance, they heard it wasn't capricious and they did nothing. 
    In other words we say that, that is action. 
    That is taking the action before the Court by the Senate saying no, we will not grant this amendment, we will not give this. 
    The next case that came on, which was before the Federal Communication Commission Your Honor was WDSU in 1951 and in that case the Court repeated what it had said three years before under 1948 case and it said that if a commission, if the commission finds as it had the right to find in cases, that there was such action taken, then in that event the station would be denied it's renewal, and that's on the three-year statute and that was pleaded in our present case as the ground for this to defendant, this radio, television station for its right, as it claims, both to reject the script on this case and in its defense to get to immunity for the action that was subsequently brought. 
    Now the action of this --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1057.786" stopTime="1072.305">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Does your argument mean that the statute, that the radio stations and televisions stations are left free to sensor things that are said insofar as they believe they are libelous?
speaker="edward_s_greenbaum" startTime="1072.305" stopTime="1076.597">
    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    Our argument is that they should be, yes Your Honor but not that they have been.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1076.597" stopTime="1078.284">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Your argument is that they can.
speaker="edward_s_greenbaum" startTime="1078.284" stopTime="1306.514">
    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    Yes. 
    But that has been directly held against in the cases I said, including the 1951 WDSU case and was pleaded by this defendant as an answer. 
    The consequence of this is this defendant WDAY, which is one of the oldest radio and now television station, has said that we regret that our facilities have been forced to become the subject of a libel suit and may again be under the law, and then they say however that, that is our defense that the commission FCC says that, that is the consequence of this Section 315 and accordingly we are not responsible. 
    The language I've quoted from this on in their brief, in which they refer to this and it is our contention. 
    Well I may put it this way, that the very attitude of this station indicates what will be the future of this whole tremendously broad program. 
    Here you have a medium, first radio and now television which means it can reach as you all know many millions, in the last year speech of President Roosevelt was said to have reached a limit of over 60 million people at one time, this vast powerful huge medium is now placed from the position whereby the irresponsible person, the speaker was worthless, who has no interest in any financial responsibility is given the absolute right to get on this radio, get on this television, as this defendant did in this case. 
    Now the defendant I mean the individual defendant Townley who was sued, as well as the radio station. 
    What he does in this case, he virtually walks into the station and he says I want to be -- the speech televised. 
    The station says this is libel and we can't do it. 
    He says, “I am candidate for others. 
    I have my 300 signatures and I am entitled to have my rights protected under 315.” 
    So he said that all he can do is – he sits there, gets himself photographed, has himself put on television and just leaves, he wasn't even there when the broadcast was given. 
    And this speech of his, this commercial of his is played in the morning, in the afternoon and the evening of October 29th and he says you can't do anything about it. 
    It is our contention that any such interpretation of 315 is extreme. 
    It attacks the rights of the individual who is not a candidate as far as the individual who has, including in our case the Farmers Educational who is the petitioner in this case. 
    They are called, as you saw before, a communist organization who are suppressive to the right, to the people of the State of North Dakota whom they're representing in the sense that they are getting membership from them and that station not a candidate, no right to reply, not even mentioned in 315 that station can be libel with immunity by this huge new giant medium of communication that we've created since 1926 when this statute was drawn up. 
    And our contention would be --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1306.514" stopTime="1313.748">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would you have enjoined the newspaper in that state and its law publishing that same speech?
speaker="edward_s_greenbaum" startTime="1313.748" stopTime="1500.319">
    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    Well we couldn't have enjoined them. 
    We could have sued them. 
    They certainly couldn't claim immunity and the comparison with the newspaper goes back to – we were talking about before lunch on a constitutional point that if a radio station, this particular one, WDSY, had printed as it did this broadcast and suppose the statute requires for some reason or another that a newspaper must publish this. 
    Would the newspaper be exempt from libel? 
    The question here would be, we submit, a pertinent illustration of the inequity of a provision if it wouldn't print. 
    But if it could be held that section 315 is a very unusual and a very unique concept, it makes, it compels a station to give equal time to the other side, equal opportunity. 
    Now that concept sounds now after a third of a century, it's only the way we are used to, we have nothing like that, Your Honor, in the newspaper world, we have nothing like that in any field of written communication. 
    And we say that such a statute couldn't conceivably have given the right to a newspaper or as in this case we have here a television station to be exempt from liability. 
    Why not, why should it be because this new man, the third person, the candidate, he might be the second candidate comes in and he says we want the right to speak. 
    Here is my speech and I want to talk about it, anything I want and you can't exercise the power of censorship. 
    It is our contention that any such interpretation of the statute is a misinterpretation. 
    The defendant in this case or the respondent in this case has associated with it several amici curiae. 
    One of them in this case we will hear from shortly is a National Association of Broadcasters. 
    They took a position before this situation arose in which they say that there was no right on the part of any station to be compelled to issue a broadcast because a candidate walked into the station and asked for it. 
    They contended in the case of Port Huron and later on before the Federal Communications Commission, and later on before the Congress that the statute said just what we say it said. 
    Now they are sitting here today and they will tell you that the position we take is wrong. 
    They will tell you that the station is given immunity and they will tell you that the station can delete from its publication -- cannot delete from its publication anything that's libel.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1500.319" stopTime="1551.246">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Am I wrong -- am I wrong in feeling that there is a -- before you decide, before one determines whether there is or isn't immunity from responsibility setting out to the word libel, you must first decide whether it has any power of choice about it. 
    Certainly as a human, as a human proposition, it makes a lot of effort if I have no choice to disseminate something and then sued for it than if I do have choice and exercise the choice so as to be the instrument of defamation. 
    So don't you have to argue first whether a station is compelled to emit whatever any candidate is asking to emit? 
    Isn't that a preliminary --

    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum

    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    That's the question of what the word censor means coming from the roman language, censor, a government official. 
    Now the Congress has very rightly put into 315 you can't do certain thing, and one of the things you can't do is to censor. 
    Now what does the word censor mean? 
    You can't give this man, what this Congress wants to do, the equal opportunity on the radio if you are saying, no you can't say that, oh no, nothing to do with this. 
    And therefore as it was decided in the Sorenson case in the five years after the statute passed, no censorship means the trend of his ideas on social, economic, religious and other questions but not on the question of libelous, not on the question --

    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    I think we got the beginning of the answer there. 
    It's very unusual to use the word ‘censor' to someone else and Congress maybe had a difficult time in deciding how to phrase this, but the meaning is clear. 
    It was -- it couldn't have anything libelous, and it couldn't have anything obscene, couldn't have anything blasphemous for provisions in the Communications Act that specially says that?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1673.412" stopTime="1681.053">

    What it is being urged before us is that they couldn't even censor anything obscene, subversive, whatever that may mean or anything else?
speaker="edward_s_greenbaum" startTime="1681.053" stopTime="1695.676">
    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    The statute says that elsewhere. 
    It says that you cannot say a thing. 
    Suppose one of the candidate said, if I am elected President of the United States I will come down to Washington and do this, that and other thing to the President, there's specific provision in the statute.

    Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum 
    There wasn't, the word wasn't in the statute about blasphemous. 
    I am familiar I think with the cases Your Honor has in mind, just one word in closing if I may sir? 
    We are not against a broad use of television or radio in the field of communications of a campaign. 
    It is our contention that this statute as construed by the defendants in this case does not lend to that construction. 
    It is our belief that this -- if this judgment is affirmed it will restrict and not narrow the field for these two versions, first restricted at the station like WDAY, fear the public opinion as well as they fear and rightly so, that a monetary damage too. 
    And the other reason is that we feel that they would not be deterred by feelings of that kind, that they want to carry out the honest intention of giving everybody his right to say things, but not defamatory things as they themselves say they regretted here. 
    And we think this statute if affirmed would open up the doors for a field day for the future Hitlers and Stalins that will arise in this country. 
    They will get free from any liability, except on their own part and they have none, stations such as this one and 4,000 others throughout the country, we contend that the case should be reversed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Harold W. Bangert
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1879.084" stopTime="1882.466">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Bangert.
speaker="harold_w_bangert" startTime="1882.466" stopTime="2438.918">
    Mr. Harold W. Bangert 
    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    As the Court is aware half of our time will be shared by the National Association of Broadcasters, as amicus. 
    The respondent is a member of the National Association of Broadcasters and as such shares views largely that will express -- be expressed amicus. 
    We, however, must limit our arguments essentially to the narrow framework of the case. 
    And it leads us directly to Sorensen against Wood which we feel is the foundation of the confusion that has brought on this litigation today. 
    In 1932, the Nebraska Court, in a dicta, the defendant in the action was not a candidate, in a pure dicta, had this to say. 
    The defendant company like most radio broadcasters is to a large extent engaged in the business of commercial advertising for pay. 
    It maybe assumed that this is sufficient not only to carry, it's necessary large overhead, but to make at least a fair return on its investment. 
    Or it appears that the opportunities are so attractive to investors and the available airwave would be greatly overcrowded by broadcasting stations, were it not for restrictions of a number of licensees under the Federal Authority. 
    Such commercial advertising is strongly competitive with newspaper advertising, because it performs a similar office between those having wares to advertise and those who are potential users of those wares. 
    Radio advertising is one of the most powerful agencies to promote the principles of religion and politics. 
    It competes with newspapers, magazines and publications of every nature. 
    The fundamental principles of law involved in publication by a newspaper and by a radio station seem to be alike. 
    There is no legal reason why one should be favored over another, nor why a broadcasting station should be granted special favors as against one who maybe a victim of a libelous publication. 
    It must be remembered that in the 1927 the broadcasting industry as we know it today was about four years old. 
    The respondent went into business in 1923 and is one of the oldest stations in the United States. 
    It must be remembered too, that in writing in the provisions of the Radio Act, which became Section 315, the writers of the provisions, that is to say the members of Congress were particularly experts in the matter about which they legislate, the matter of that broadcast of non-censored material by political candidates. 
    Therefore in one section of the Communications Act, the Congress said there shall be no censorship by government, Section 315, 316, and in another section, Section 315, it said that there shall be no interposition of a screen of public opinion by a licensee, a broadcaster in what field only where there was a candidate for office, and no other field. 
    This is the limitations imposed in 1927. 
    And this matter was considered in Nebraska, in case of Sorensen against Wood. 
    In most distinguished amicus Lawrence Gold did a great deal of work and I am conceived, we argue upon the basis of this factual situation, that there is an equity, an equitable matter to be adjusted between broadcasters and the newspapers. 
    That it would be inequitable and unfair to have a different rule of law for the two at the two advertising mediums, that were then in Professor Wowl's concepts vying with each other. 
    Consequently Sorensen against Wood simply destroys the usual concept of the word sensor. 
    Sorensen against Wood says that the words and there shall be no power of censorship means that the broadcaster is obligated to sensor. 
    And this must of necessity be the petitioner's position here, that the broadcaster is obligated to sensor in all matters except in Sorensen against Wood, matters having political -- matters of political influence. 
    Now this certainly does violence to the concept of censorship and the word censorship, and it precipitated 16 as General Greenbaum has said said, 16 different attempts by the same Congress, the continuing body, 16 different attempts to solve the problem. 
    I would be less than candid if I did not say that I think that all Congress has done in these 16 times, is to fail to face the problem and arrive at a thought out conclusion. 
    Because my preparation of this case must of necessity be away from the congressional record of the debates, I am not as familiar with that as I should like to be, but it does seem to me that it maybe said fairly in the brevity of moral argument, that Congress has arrived at nothing, there has been an argument here and an argument there. 
    Now I understand that amicus, Mr. Anello will argue with you that there is something to be spelled out in Congress, and from the lack of congressional action, as the respondent has argued and the petitioner has argued, that there is something to be spelled out, but we most be respectfully assert that the Congress has failed to face up to the problem. 
    Now where is television today, and this I think is the gravamen of our argument. 
    Television, radio, electronic communication, was said by this Court to be a dynamic industry in the Pottsville case. 
    The fact of it's dynamism is evidenced by the fact of our being here and by the truth of General Greenbaum's arguments, that it is a deplorable situation so far as this petitioner is concerned, that we a respectable licensed broadcaster attempting to discharge our obligations as a licensee, of the government licensing, are faced with the problem of presenting a deliberate libel under circumstances such as this. 
    I should amplify the statement of fact made by General Greenbaum just to this extent and this is in the record. 
    When Mr. Townley presented his case, his proposed writ to the broadcaster, the broadcaster examined it, advised him that it was in its opinion libelous and untrue and advised him to believe it to be untrue, refused to broadcast it unless a written demand was made, which was made under the provisions of Section 315, a demand under the mandate, as broadcaster understood it, and then instead of putting Townley on the air live, as could have been done, required Mr. Townley to film his telecast, so there could be no question of an ad lib remark, the (Inaudible), required him to film his telecast and then film, and then published it once, and I most respectfully correct to, published it once in accordance with its contract with Mr. Tommy and under the mandate of 315. 
    This was the action that the broadcaster was forced to take under the provisions of the court here on decision and under the provisions of the WDSU warning, which came after, the only two things in my view, the only two concrete definite things that the commission has done, regardless of the arguments pro and con in the debates and before the committees, the only two things that the broadcaster is entitled and may look to for guidance.

    You very frankly say that in your view Congress had nothing on this subject to indicate on the immunity phase to give any light one way or the other, the statute certainly is completely silent on it. 
    Where do we go from there, under your view, where should we go?
speaker="harold_w_bangert" startTime="2571.591" stopTime="2575.283">
    Mr. Harold W. Bangert 
    I think that leads right into the point I was about to make Mr. Justice --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2575.283" stopTime="2576.661">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Oh I didn't mean to anticipate.
speaker="harold_w_bangert" startTime="2576.661" stopTime="2761.012">
    Mr. Harold W. Bangert 
    I -- where television is today, we are now going from 1932 to 1959, this is now the mass method of communication. 
    I am always, I am close to this industry as you gather, because I have been the lawyer for this industry for 20 some years and I am always shocked at the lack of understanding of the massive effect to this industry not withstanding the effect, the way we protest the effect, but I am shocked at the lack of understanding that by people who otherwise I would think were well informed. 
    For instance, in the leading article, in a leading article in the January issue of the Harvard Law Review, a very exhaustive study of the effect of 315, which had been cited by all parties, the -- demonstrating a study of the problem, a surveying of the industry, not casual comments at all, the authors start off with this language and I quote, “Radio and television have played an ever-increasing role in the conduct of election campaigns. 
    In the 1956 campaign, the purchase of radio and television at time was the single greatest item of expense. 
    The amount spent by the two major parties constituted more than 30% of their combined total cost.” 
    This is the point. 
    Although it is unclear whether political broadcast efficiently influenced the election result to justify such high expenditures there can be no doubt that the potential listening audience which a candidate may now reach is far in excess of what it has ever been in the past. 
    This -- here the product of years of study by men of great capability presumably by a distinguished journal and yet an un – a lack of acceptance of the concept that this medium, and this is where I think we should go to (Inaudible), this medium is unlike any other art we have had by way of communication. 
    This is, this is near the ultimate. 
    This is entitled then to the consideration of this Court as a new medium, going back to Sorenson. 
    It is not another extension of newspapers. 
    This is -- we are not -- the government is not inhibited by the First Amendment. 
    The newspapers are not licensed. 
    We are licensed. 
    This is the need that we face today. 
    We need, I submit, we need a clear adjudication of the functions and the position of the Congressional statement, a clear interpretation of what Congress meant when it announced 315, this is what we need. 
    Now I am aware I anticipate.

    Mr. Harold W. Bangert 
    Yes, yes perhaps. 
    I think, I think that the statute clearly says there shall be no power of censorship and I think that the court below, the North Dakota court in a qualified way said that there must be a federal immune -- must be a flow of immunity from -- I mean it -- a correlative rising of a immunity flowing from this prohibition, otherwise the respondent would be in a position, the respondent yes would be in a position argued by the petitioner that Section 315 as applied to the respondent violates the Fifth Amendment. 
    We are in a position of being required to subject ourselves to an action for libel and the -- and unable to protect ourselves.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2833.712" stopTime="2855.282">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What would you say about a different approach namely that if Congress has not indicated anything on the subject at all as to what the consequences would be, that the consequences are left to state law and state law applies with whatever consequences are attached to the federal prohibition against censorship?
speaker="harold_w_bangert" startTime="2855.282" stopTime="2900.833">
    Mr. Harold W. Bangert 
    I understand the course of that argument. 
    I think that it would be unfortunate if the 48 states or the 50 states now were to determine in a peculiarly interstate art what below are libelous. 
    For instance, we can perform, publish a libel in North Dakota and we reach North Dakota and we reach Minnesota, South Dakota, we reach all of these jurisdictions. 
    The obligation to require the broadcaster to respond in every one of these jurisdictions where it could be reached or under the (Inaudible) receivership would be impossible.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Anello.
speaker="douglas_a_anello" startTime="3700.329" stopTime="3803.495">
    Mr. Douglas A. Anello 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may I first address myself to Mr. Justice Frankfurter and add that is not the position of the National Association of Broadcasters, assuming sir, assuming the constitutionality for the moment of Section 315, that the broadcaster may delete anything, including obscenity. 
    May I also sir, clarify something that I believe General Greenspan – General Greenbaum left a little bit up in the air, not concerned what chairman Coy really did say and on page 27 of our brief there is a colloquy between Mr. Coy and Mr. O'Hara of the Congress of the United States. 
    Mr. Coy says the commission's interpretation of Section 315, where it say there shall be no censorship is that there shall be no censorship. 
    If the stations in the various states of the country are censoring political broadcast for defamatory and libelous material, because under state law, they believe that they are libel for libel and defamation. 
    The commission's position is that the federal enactment of the Section 315 has clearly invaded the field and that's the state's statute fall before the federal enactment. 
    Then Mr. O'Hara, the thing that I want to know is does Section 315 repeals the laws of the libel and defamation Mr. Coy our contention is that it is does.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Would you be good enough to tell me what you think, why you -- what do you think the committee headed by Mr. Johannes in its first interim report that was out of that investigation meant when it said that it received Mr. Coy's insurance with great satisfaction, what kind of satisfaction. 
    What satisfaction did he get --
speaker="douglas_a_anello" startTime="3830.419" stopTime="3850.834">
    Mr. Douglas A. Anello 
    That the station would be put upon notice before their license would be withdrawn and this was done in WDSU several years later when the commission said from now on, we will not listen to any excuses, but that the law to us is clear and Your Honors --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3850.834" stopTime="3886.618">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That is what I get from reading their report as a result of our examination that the court – you were on decision, your committee has received assurances from the commission that and I quote, (Inaudible) Mr. Coy who incidentally I respect, an old friend (Inaudible) for the time being at least until the matter is settled, the honest and conscientious broadcaster who uses ordinary common sense in trying to prevent obscene and slander statements from going out over the air. 
    That's the assurance he gave him.
speaker="douglas_a_anello" startTime="3886.618" stopTime="3931.028">
    Mr. Douglas A. Anello 
    What they mean there sir is what the question that you directed to Mr. Bangert with respect to the scripts. 
    There is nothing in the law that requires the submission of a script. 
    However, every decent broadcaster would like to see or hear in advance what the candidate is going to say, or anyone else for that matter, hence he asked for a script. 
    He doesn't demand it. 
    And he tries to talk the candidate out of saying things that might be libelous or defamatory or obscene. 
    And I believe Justice Frankfurter that is what the commission meant because certainly in WDSU several years later they left no room for doubt that they would add.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3931.028" stopTime="3945.642">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, to me it is kind of a - if were asked by a – if I were asked to make a broadcast and had unqualified power to say what I wanted to say, I don't want the station to argue with me that I should leave out something. 
    That's also form of a censorship.

    Any such action would entail censorship which is expressly prohibited by Section 315 of the Communications Act.

    Mr. Douglas A. Anello 
    Yes it had the no censorship by government, no censorship by the licensee. 
    I believe that it also contained a provision that whoever shall utter any obscene or indecent remark over radio shall be subject to a fine of $1,000 or a year in jail. 
    I believe that, that was in the original 1927 Act, I know it was in the 1934 Communications Act, but then I believe in 1948 it was deleted and removed to the Criminal Code. 
    But I say that there again that is not significant, because it also says whoever shall utter, meaning or implying to me at least that the man may utter and then suffer for his consequences. 
    Now here again, the petitioner has stated they have no remedy, but they do have a remedy, they have a remedy against the speaker. 
    The speaker is under no compulsion to speak, the station licensee is under compulsion to put him on. 
    I indicated earlier that, we had some reservation as to the constitutionality as Section 315. 
    They are based upon two factors. 
    One the no censorship carries with it immunity and if this isn't so, I then respectfully submit that 315 is unconstitutional as being a deprivation of due process, because it imposes absolute liability without any control whatsoever, and this is a theory unique, it would be alone in our system of American jurisprudence.

    Newspapers may print what they please, they may excise, they may edit. 
    They have no regulatory body to whom they must account every three years, nor any Section 315 telling them what they may or may not do. 
    Equality with newspapers operating under the same conditions with the same complete freedom, responsible only to the bar of public opinions is a consummation devoutly to be wished by every broadcaster in the United States and maybe the time has come when this Honorable Court should take a look at Section 315 from that perspective.

speaker="douglas_a_anello" startTime="4748.764" stopTime="4874.983">
    Mr. Douglas A. Anello 
    Very much so. 
    But I would like to analogize this newspaper, radio station position a little more closely. 
    Let us examine the situation in 1927, when the Radio Act was first promulgated. 
    At that time as you all know there was chaos because stations encroaching upon each other, and so the Congress established a Federal Radio Commission, at that time there were some 600 stations on the air. 
    The Congress enacted comprehensive legislation, because it felt that is -- that the radio spectrum was limited, so the number of stations would never be too many, but what do we have? 
    We have today over 4,800 radio and television stations in the United States. 
    Now what's happened to newspapers in the same time? 
    In 1930 there were roughly 1,900 daily newspapers, today there are 1,800 daily newspapers. 
    Now the argument has been made that it is competition that causes a newspaper to either prosper or wither. 
    It serves its readers and that is why apart from any First Amendment you need no regulation, assumedly you might because it's interstate commerce if a newspaper sends editions in the various states, you might concededly issue a regulation there, but no, the First Amendment protection. 
    Well, the same thing might be said of radio stations. 
    With 4,800 stations on the air, I believe that competition will determine which survives, which will program in the public interest and which don't, I am confident that the American people may make the judgment, that those that do not serve the public interest by their programming, without regard to the FCC or any other legislative or regulatory body will fall by the wayside.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4874.983" stopTime="4881.918">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you suggesting, I suppose you are -- that if newspapers are regulated, you might get more competition?
speaker="douglas_a_anello" startTime="4881.918" stopTime="4998.641">
    Mr. Douglas A. Anello 
    I am not sir. 
    I am saying that I believe that one of the reasons for not regulating newspapers apart from traditional freedom of the First Amendment is that the ordinary competitive forces will force the newspaper to cater to the public taste, because it is said anybody can start a newspaper. 
    That means anybody who can buy a printing press, ergo if you build a better newspaper, you will get readers, and if you don't you will lose readers and your circulation and your advertising revenue, but both of us, both newspapers and radio stations live by their advertisers, which in turn means that we must have readers in order to secure revenues. 
    In summation, I would like to say that our position is this. 
    Section 315 as we view it, both in the light of congressional intent, historic decisional law and that law is applied by the Federal Communications Commission, prohibits censorship by broadcast licensees of political candidates for the same office, and this means no prior restraint. 
    By the same token at the very least, the principles of fairness and justice, administrative interpretation, congressional acquiescence and congressional failure to amend the law in view of their knowledge of the administrative interpretations indicate that automatic immunity must flow and if such is not the case, we believe the section is unconstitutional as being violative of the First Amendment and that it would take the broadcaster's property without due process, the property which he would be powerless to protect.

   Argument of Harriet F. Pilpel
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5141.128" stopTime="5144.248">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mrs. Pilpel.
speaker="harriet_f_pilpel" startTime="5144.248" stopTime="5702.552">
    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I think that some of the sessions have gotten away from the central issue in this case, which is whether under Section 315, Station WDAY, the respondent in this case is immune from damages for broadcasting material which was admittedly libelous about our client, the Farmers Educational and Cooperative Union of North Dakota. 
    As Mr. Bangert said in his argument, Congress has not conferred any immunity from such a suit as this, and as Mr. Justice Harlan indicated in his question, over and over again Congress has been asked to legislate this immunity and over and over again Congress has refused so to legislate. 
    Mr. Anello who immediately preceded me, gave reasons why he did not think the Congress could be said to have acted against immunity in this situation, but in a brief filed by his own association, a little over ten years ago, which I have in my hands and which was submitted to the Congress in connection with the hearings on the Port Huron case, he said it seems equally certain that they did not -- that Congress determined to say out of the field of defamation and to leave the state laws on libel and slander untouched. 
    There is no provision in Section 315, which confers any immunity on a radio or television station for broadcasting libelous remarks. 
    There is another provision in the Federal Communication Act, namely Section 414 which states specifically that the Act shall not be construed in such a way as to abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter shall be in addition to such remedy. 
    By arguing as we found that Mr. Anello does, it seems to us that they totally over list the existence of Section 414 and read into Section 315, words which are obviously not there. 
    I say obviously not there because as has been apparent in the course of this argument, there have been repeated efforts to put them there. 
    This is not a case of Congress having not acted. 
    It's a case in which Congress acted by refusing to legislate immunity. 
    No one had even made any contention that broadcasters were immune from liability, until 1948 in the famous Port Huron case which we've already discussed. 
    As a matter of fact, some three years before that, the commission itself had expressed great doubt as to whether or not an immunity existed in the Bellingham case and had specifically tabled that question and said we are not called upon to decide whether there is an immunity under state law or not. 
    When the Port Huron case came along there followed the congressional hearing which we have already discussed, then the case of WDSU reiterated Port Huron about the meaning of censorship, but did not categorically assert that there was an immunity. 
    As I recall the words of the commission in the WDSU, there was something like whatever maybe the rule as to immunity we hope such and such as the censorship. 
    Shortly after the decision in the Port Huron case, there were further considerations of the matter in Congress and the house tax and immunity amendment which was rejected again in 1952 by the Conference Committee, and this time in report number 2426 82d Cong., 2d session, which is cited on page ten of our reply brief, the Committee of Conference stated very definitely what it thought it was doing. 
    And I quote what they said, “The committee of conference agreed to omit the provision with respect to liability of licensees in civil or criminal actions because these subjects had not been adequately studied by the Committees on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
    The proposal was adopted in the House after the bill had been reported from the House Committee. 
    The proposal involves many difficult problems and it is the judgment of the Committee of Conference that it should be acted on only after full hearing has been held.” 
    Since that time identical bills have been introduced into Congress on either six or seven occasions and on each such occasion Congress has expressly refused to legislate the immunity which the Supreme Court of North Dakota held existed in this case. 
    Apparently no one seriously denied this Congressional history but the allegation is that you can infer immunity from the no censorship provision of Section 315 in the teeth of Congressional refusal to declare immunity. 
    I would like very briefly to address myself to a few questions which came out in the course of the discussions that preceded my getting up. 
    One was Mr. Bangert's statement about the (Inaudible) of having 48 or now 50 different laws of libel. 
    I am sure it's not necessary to call to the attention of this Court that in all of broadcasting, except possibly under section 315, there are 48 or 50 different state laws of libel which apply. 
    Mr. Bangert argues the case as if he were pleading for a federal law of defamation applicable to all television and radio broadcasting. 
    There is no such federal law. 
    Congress has not chosen to act, even assuming it had the power to act. 
    What the licensee does everyday is to act with reference to the laws of 48 or 50 different states? 
    Furthermore as to whether the prohibition of Section 315 on censorship is absolute, which some of Your Honors have asked, I would like to call your attention to the fact that the Supreme Court of North Dakota in two instances acknowledged that it was not absolute. 
    In the first place it quoted with approval and we cite that -- this appears on page 37 of the record, the statement of the Federal Communications Commission itself indicating that the censorship -- the no censorship provision is not absolute. 
    The commission said and I quote here on, “Nothing in this opinion is intended to indicate that a licensee is necessarily without power to present to broadcast of statements or utterances in violation of the provisions of the Communications Act or any other federal law on broadcast coming within the requirement of Section 315 of the Communications Act.” 
    I don't believe the commission has ever retreated from that position. 
    The second thing that the North Dakota Supreme Court did by way of I think revolt against its own apparently absolute standard was to say in its judgment on (Inaudible) not that the station could not -- was immune for all statements but only that the stations were immune from liability for defamatory statements made by candidates, and the exact words of the court, the judgments are “where such statements are germane to the political issues discussed by such candidates,” this appears at the top of the page 52 of the record. 
    We submit that the standard of germaness which apparently was used by the court below is a standard which would clearly be in violation of the no censorship provisions of Section 315. 
    We do not believe that that is true of any standard which would permit a licensee to continue to function in accordance with state law that is to refuse to aid and abet the commission of an act in the state which would violate either the civil or the criminal law of the state.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5702.552" stopTime="5734.169">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mrs. Pilpel, suppose the court came to the conclusion that under 315 this station was compelled to take -- take the script of any candidate and suppose it was also of the opinion that it had absolutely no power to censor that script, would it still be you position that the station is libel?
speaker="harriet_f_pilpel" startTime="5734.169" stopTime="5831.522">
    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    Your Honor it would definitely still be our position that the station is libel because we believe that the two of -- the innocence of the station totally overlooks the innocence of the third party plaintiff which is whom we are representing. 
    If we take -- if the Congress has created a situation in which the station is impudent to delete libels then we are faced with two innocent third parties. 
    The station is one innocent third party and the innocent bystander is the other innocent third party. 
    Now the station is in my opinion far more likely -- should be the one on whom liability is accessed as between the two for many reasons. 
    In the first place no one has mentioned that Section 315 specifically states that no station shall be under any obligation to take any political candidates' broadcast. 
    So if it does not wish to be riddled with liability in such a situation. 
    It can simply refuse to accept any political candidates' broadcast. 
    In the second place, we believe that the station is in a position where it could protect itself in a variety of ways in a situation in which Your Honor mentioned. 
    For example it could ask the candidate to set -- to put up a bond, an indemnity bond so that if the station would have libel, it would have some protection on the indemnity bond of the candidate. 
    The third party can't possibly do that because he doesn't know it's going to be this third party.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5831.522" stopTime="5844.412">

speaker="harriet_f_pilpel" startTime="5844.412" stopTime="5883.106">
    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    I believe Your Honor that the purpose of Section 315 was to create equal opportunities among political candidates, and therefore my answer to your question is that if there were no discrimination in this requirement, if the station elected to take political broadcast, political candidate's broadcast and said to all political candidates still on Your Honor's assumption that they can't take out libel. 
    This puts us in a position where we maybe responsible in damages. 
    I see no reason why I could not equally say to all such candidates we will ask you for the indemnity bonds.

    There would be nothing, there would be nothing in the Communications Act, in any federal statute to prevent that?
speaker="harriet_f_pilpel" startTime="5891.103" stopTime="5997.252">
    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    We don't believe there's anything in the act. 
    We are aware of the fact that in somewhat seem to us rather unclear expressions of opinion on the part of the commission, there has been some doubt expressed as to whether this would be equal treatment of candidates with all other speakers. 
    But we feel that every statute must be given a reasonable interpretation that if Your Honors should feel that no censorship means no right to delete the libel and since as we submit there is no immunity, it would not be unreasonable if all candidates were equally required to put up a bond, but even if we are wrong on that, the station could still protect itself in a third way namely by taking out insurance. 
    The fact is that many stations are presently covered with insurance and while it is true that if Your Honors would hold the way you've indicated it might be that the insurance would get more expensive. 
    The fact we have ended, it's quite inexpensive now and even if it become more expressive political candidate business is a very profitable business. 
    Our brief points out that in the 1956 campaign, the radio and television stations made about $10 million on political candidates' broadcast. 
    And we would think that if you are in a position where you have to choose between a broadcaster who knows that he is assuming a risk and who deliberately assumes it and who has (Inaudible) of protecting himself, it would be left unreasonable to impose liability on him than it would be to impose liability as has been done by the court in this case on the innocent bystander, namely the plaintiff.

    Did I understand you to say that some of the stations do take out insurance against libel in the political campaigns?
speaker="harriet_f_pilpel" startTime="6008.047" stopTime="6017.605">
    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    We understand that the stations have a general form of coverage which would cover their liability for defamation in all situations.

    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    I am not aware that there is any distinction in the policies between political campaign and any other kind of broadcasters.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6026.073" stopTime="6031.537">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    There might have been lot of difference; practically they don't have to take everything, do they?
speaker="harriet_f_pilpel" startTime="6031.537" stopTime="6054.293">
    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    They don't have to take political candidates, that's all there is. 
    As I said Section 315 specifically says no obligation is imposed to accept any broadcast on behalf of any political candidate, but if you accept any then you must give equal opportunity to all other candidates for the same office. 
    So it is strictly matter of their own decision whether they want it or not.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You speak very confident and I am not surprised you do, in construing that statute as disallowing, it leaving a station free to accept no candidate, but as I understand that that is within the operating etiquette of the commission. 
    They have refused renewals where a station has exercised that right on the ground that it's against public policy for them to exercise that right.

    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    I would like to say with respect to that, they -- the commission has somewhat vacuolated in its ruling that whether -- as to whether a refusal to accept candidate's broadcast is to count against it when the question whether they are operating in the public interest as is said. 
    There is no question but the Section 315 says they have no obligation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6111.732" stopTime="6169.777">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That is to say -- to use the word you used nobody else has referred it up to now that seem to be very important, it's bearing on the kind of obligation that rests on station. 
    If my reading of English would not obscure by the interpretation that the commission has placed upon it, I should think the sentence is pretty clear that they can keep hands off and not accept any political fraudulence. 
    So I think that's -- not only as a commission -- you call it vacuolating -- vacuolating as it is -- not only has it acted on the opposite attitude, but generally meaning through the reach you are looking at them, there is wise good assumption that's all right. 
    In fact it's one more illustration that this case involves the problem in it have more darkness shed upon the question before us --

speaker="harriet_f_pilpel" startTime="6185.171" stopTime="6202.593">
    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    I question although that's not involved in this case, whether the commission by holding that the public interest criterion requires political candidate's broadcast, has gone against Section 315, which specifically holds that they are not required to carry such –-
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="6202.593" stopTime="6203.864">

    But there are such –
speaker="harriet_f_pilpel" startTime="6203.864" stopTime="6219.312">
    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    -- there are such rulings. 
    To the best of my knowledge Your Honor no station has been denied a renewal of a license on that ground but I think that the commission has warned them from time to time if they will consider that as part of appraising their overall --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="6219.312" stopTime="6221.757">

    So there maybe a practical pressure --
speaker="harriet_f_pilpel" startTime="6221.757" stopTime="6247.132">
    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    There maybe unless that -- it was clarified in a decision for example in this Court which would state that no obligation to carry political candidates' broadcast, which is a specific position. 
    It cannot be used -- the opposite of that cannot be used in terms of the general criterion of the public interest, because to that extent the commission has whittled down the words of Section 315 as to no obligation.

    Ms. Harriet F. Pilpel 
    We believe that's so and Your Honor also just mentioned something which I think points to another important factor and that is that we are not a political candidate. 
    And therefore if you were to hold some rule of non immunity or something with reference to political candidate we would still urge that you hold with the dissenting judge in the court below then when it comes to a client like ours who is an innocent third party, who has no right of reply, who under the statute has no right to equal opportunity that that person must be given a remedy or he is totally without recourse. 
    Thank you Your Honors.
