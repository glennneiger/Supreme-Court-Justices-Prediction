    Mr. Robert H. Roberts 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I will conclude argument for the respondents in this manner. 
    I would like to call the Court's attention to an article written by Professor Charles Allen Wright in connection with speech to be delivered on Vanderbilt University campus on October 1969 entitled “The Constitution on the Campus.” 
    This is one of the Oliver Womble Holm series and I think that it is one of the best written articles I have ever read and I recommend it to the Court if they haven't already seen it. 
    In it though, Professor Wright basically wound up by saying that expression can be restrictive, if at any time, if material substantially interferes with a normal procedures of the university or with the wraps of other. 
    Now, it is our contention that the basic issue involved here is just the action that this student has been accused and found guilty of committing based primarily under his First Amendment rights. 
    Yesterday --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    There were additional findings of the violation for regulations?
speaker="robert_h_roberts" startTime="97.263" stopTime="315.917">
    Mr. Robert H. Roberts 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    There was a finding that he had committed a misdemeanor and found guilty in court in violation of the student handbook which had been a specific charge against him in addition. 
    They also found that he lied to the committee while before ti and openly before it and I might say this, it is not only just, he just told the president of the effect that he was lying in front of this outstanding faculty group and other students and even the press was present when this happened which compounded the disrespect that he showed to president on this occasion. 
    Yesterday, I had the feeling that there was some question in the mind of perhaps Associate Justice Marshall in regard to why this action on the leafleting or the boycott literature didn't result in any kind of a serious incident. 
    I didn't called the Court's attention to this but I would like to do it this time. 
    Mr. Jones at the time that he passed out this leaflet had already been temporarily suspended from school. 
    He was not on the campus at that time as a student. 
    When he passed out this literature he was awaiting his hearing to see whether or not he would be admitted in the full term or not. 
    This literature was passed out on August 18, 1967 which according to the calendar which you have in the appendix in the student handbook part of it which begins on page 175 of the joint appendix, a calendar of the school. 
    Here, you'll find that this was the last day of final examinations for the last term of the summer quarter. 
    When he did this, the baccalaureate services follow that by two days and school was out then until the following term started. 
    That is the reason there was no more commotion following it. 
    However, I direct your attention to the fact that this was followed -- itself following by just a couple of weeks or so, arrived on the campus and tensions were high. 
    Now admittedly, the faculty hasn't in it's findings written out that as a result of this literature been passed out on the final examination day that John Smith came to him and said, “Well, that bothers me and I couldn't correctly answer one of the questions on the examination” or anything like that, but they found it as a matter of their interpretation. 
    They were there on the campus. 
    We're not talking about some rural constable or something like that that might be found in my home county of Pickett. 
    We're talking about nine of the outstanding members of the faculty on Tennessee State University's campus. 
    We're talking about the vice president Maritus (ph), who was the Chairman of the Faculty Advisory Committee with 30 some years of experience there as a school administrator. 
    We are talking about Dr. J.A. Payne who acted because of Dr. Boswell's poor health as the presiding officer over this faculty advisory meeting with the great many years of experience on the campus and as being the students. 
    We're talking about the dean of women and the dean of men. 
    School administrators, practically all if not all of them hold doctorate degrees and had the combined experience of well and in excess of 100 years there on the campus, that's who we're talking about, substituting the judgment on as to what --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Supposing this temperate document that had been passed around speaks exactly about diversity. 
    What would you say about that?

    Mr. Robert H. Roberts 
    I should call the events --

    Mr. Robert H. Roberts 
    Yes sir and I think it would be all together a different situation. 
    I think you could perhaps of even gone across the street a little ways to centennial park and got up on a bench and maybe made a speech on it and it would have been somewhat different. 
    Here, it is calculated to do one thing, calls unrest and tried to prevail his ideas and his desires on to the student body there. 
    He had already been suspended. 
    He -- it wasn't a matter for him not to register. 
    He was trying to ask everybody else to join with him because his conduct had caused him to be suspended where he wasn't permitted to continue during the summer quarter and was called on them to do so. 
    Now as to the type of thing that was in this makes very important. 
    There was really more to it than just boycott. 
    So far as it being designed to create unrest and we got to keep in mind now that this was fall on a period of great deal of disturbance on the campus where property was destroyed and people were injured. 
    Some of the things that he says for example anything that give the puppets, I'm talking about school administrators now. 
    That's a reference that he makes to them. 
    He calls them puppets throughout this. 
    I want to adapt civilized tactics used by the man and that sort of thing. 
    Then he goes on with words like “does the campus will become a concentration camp controlled and contained by the legislation of the raciest dogs' downtown.” 
    The acts of the puppet administrators here at the end referring to these people for whom he had already been advised that he was going and have to come and clearance have with before he could be re-enrolled. 
    The Billy clubs and guns of Nashville's raciest cops and ultimately the gestapo tactics of the honorable National Guard whose pale faces have already been seen in Memphis, Nashville. 
    We as intelligent black students will not be guarded by trampling parialist idiots who call themselves administrators. 
    Now that's what he's saying about the school administrators. 
    He said earlier that he came down to Tennessee to go to school because he investigate and found that it was a great school and he wanted to go down there. 
    Yet in his first year there an 18-year-old boy, he conducts himself in such a way and has the all that has come out with something like this and talking this very school administrators whom he had chosen to go to earn an education. 
    And he closed it then with this article and counts and brought and bribed heavy counts. 
    Cast your vote for student power. 
    Boycott registration, September 23 and for as long as the puppet administration refuses to acknowledge that this is our university.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Suppose in the -- they have forgotten to urge these boys and girls not to register, just used the childish, foolish, silly names but respectable people, what would you say about that?
speaker="robert_h_roberts" startTime="556.801" stopTime="666.587">
    Mr. Robert H. Roberts 
    May it please the Court, I think that it was to be serious enough about urging the boycott, but you can't separate it. 
    It was all one article. 
    He did all of it for design for one purpose that the administrators found that it was for the purpose of disrupting the school, and that didn't entitle him to remain on the campus any longer as a result of it. 
    Now, if the judicial branch is going to substitute its judgment for people of a character that I have described of this Faculty Advisory Committee, on this question of fact and really it is a question of fact of whether or not these things, these acts committed were tapped that would be disruptive on the school campus or were just playing free expression or not, and they found otherwise. 
    Now if we're going to get into this field, where are we going to stop? 
    Wouldn't the next logical place be to examine the examination papers given to a student and the time of whether the professor you've given him a passing mark or not? 
    After all, you can effectively expel in that way. 
    If he doesn't, then any practical any university in the country if he doesn't make his grades, he's not entitled to enroll the next quarter. 
    You could eliminate him in that manner. 
    I just respectfully urge the Court to give some support and some credit to these men of outstanding ability and making the determination that it involves a factual matter and if you do so, I feel that the Court will affirm the action in it and I thank you for your kind attention.

    Mr. Reber F. Boult, Jr. 
    Possibly so. 
    They were half a dozen charges against him and of the three students involved in the whole thing, there were about 18 charges and there were only findings of shall we said guilt on a smaller number of these charges. 
    We assumed, it has been assumed up to this level always with the case that if Faculty Advisory Committee did not make a finding that a student had done what -- on a particular charge, then, they were not disciplining him for it.

    Mr. Reber F. Boult, Jr. 
    As I recall the facts of the case, there are not of record, it was an argument with a police officer, leaves us vagrancy and disorderly conduct.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="894.732" stopTime="896.483">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Just an argument?
speaker="reber_f_boult_jr" startTime="896.483" stopTime="985.386">
    Mr. Reber F. Boult, Jr. 
    Just an argument. 
    He's coming out of his house. 
    He was well-known around town, was unpopular. 
    He was arrested on one of these general dragnet laws and I'm talking outside the record because this was -- this point would have developed, had it been in the case at the time but was not. 
    The vagrancy statute in Tennessee in which he was arrested has since been declared unconstitutional. 
    And that disorderly conduct statute is similar to the one under consideration by this Court in the case of Gunn versus the University Committee. 
    So this particular conviction would probably be unconstitutional. 
    Mr. Roberts says -- he mentioned that the handing out of this leaflet falls around by couple of weeks; that is not true. 
    He mentioned that Mr. Jones had already been suspended at the time he handed out the offending leaflet. 
    The suspension was clearly unconstitutional on any of the lower court decisions on student's rights and with no notice, no hearing, no nothing, and ultimately, it was rescinded. 
    He was suspended on three vague charges, none of which were pressed later on in these proceedings.

    The object of the school I would suppose is try to get the students who learn, take part in a regular business and I wouldn't suppose at least in the schools I went to, they were compelled to give me formal charges of anything if they want to get me up and they came to move me without formal charges, I would think. 
    You don't think so?

    Starting with Dixon versus Alabama State Board of Education, Knight versus State Board of Education. 
    Probably, I would say 30 or 40 disciplinary cases in the meantime ending most recently or more recently was Cagen versus Lincoln Memorial University, Western District of Wisconsin.

    May I ask if that sentence of 31 is at the hearing, he demonstrated this indifference to the two by denying that he passed up such literature despite positive statements by cafeteria personal and the president of the university. 
    Maybe he'd done so and my question is did the cafeteria personnel and the president of the university testify at his hearing in his presence that he had done so?

    Mr. Reber F. Boult, Jr. 
    Yes, and he was brought out that she was testifying that the leaflet was handed out three months before it was prepared, so that the testimony was rendered wholly incredible.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, then I don't quite understand your point that the charge was not or the fact of his lying or allegation that he would have lied. 
    As I gather, your point is that that was not a basis for the discipline that was imposed.

    Mr. Reber F. Boult, Jr. 
    He had never -- it was not a basis for the discipline to anyone's knowledge until the findings came out some 10 days after period.

    Mr. Reber F. Boult, Jr. 
    Your Honor, the next event at the hearing after the president testified was Mr. Jones' testimony. 
    His testimony contradicted that of the president and it simply Mr. Jones, we presumed thought he was telling the truth. 
    He asserted --

    Mr. Reber F. Boult, Jr.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, but the finding -- the finding of the committee was that we have no doubt that the student did not tell the truth. 
    So, as between his testimony and that of the president and the cafeteria worker, at least this committee resolved the question against the Jones, didn't they?
speaker="reber_f_boult_jr" startTime="1418.255" stopTime="1420.345">
    Mr. Reber F. Boult, Jr.
