    Number 399, Rowan doing Business as American Book Service against the United States. 
    Mr. Taback, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.

    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The appeal here before this Court, is from a judgment of the three-judge court of the United States District Court with the Central District of California. 
    The jurisdiction of the Court is grounded upon Section 1253 of the Title 28 of United States Codes. 
    The appellants are in the mail order business. 
    They are distributors and disseminators of books, pamphlets, various matters and materials that traffic and conduct its way through the mail. 
    The law which is brought here on focus by this appeal is Section 301 of the Public Law 90206 or is codified 39 US Code 4009. 
    The action below was that for declaratory relief and seeking an injunction against the enforcement, implementation, and administration of the statute. 
    The result in the court below was a verdict of three to nothing, upholding the constitutionality of the statute and denying the relief sought. 
    Upon this appeal, it does seem that the issues are made much clear then they were even in the court below. 
    This is come to be because a statute which reportedly was not an ambiguous has now received the same interpretation by the Government as well as the appellants herein. 
    Well, interpretation is contrary to the construction inter -- and the interpretation given by the US District Court. 
    This is a new twist, if you will, a matter which is occurred at the time of this appeal.

    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    I say this is a matter which is now occurred at the time of appeal. 
    Part of that Mr. Justice Harlan, the Government and more particularly at the time of their motion to affirm, attempted to adopt the view and interpretation of the US District Court which incidentally was by way of two votes for one interpretation and other vote for another construction.

    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, in answer to your question, the Government did take the view that they take here today, in the District Court. 
    However, upon examination by one of the three judges, the Government did become somewhat, took a dual role if you will, but I would have to answer that they did adopt the view which they adopt today in the District Court.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In fact do will you mean alternative positions or is that --
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="208.835" stopTime="209.243">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    In answer to your question --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="209.243" stopTime="210.568">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Correct adaptation?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="210.568" stopTime="326.716">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    -- in answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, I feel that the Government took a very strongly position in their argument and therefore, I could not feel that it was an alternative position per se. 
    I think that would be my distinction. 
    They were quite positive in what this legislation meant. 
    They were quite conscious to the legislative history and the plain meaning of the statute. 
    The statute itself, involves the mailing of materials or advertising which maybe turned off by a recipient, if that recipient in his sole discretion determines that it is a erotically arousing or sexually provocative. 
    Upon making such a discretionary determination, the recipient may obtain a prohibitory order from the Post Office Department issued against the mailer, his assigns or his agents. 
    That order or the contents of the order are set forth in the statute. 
    Three things must be placed in the order, and we say must in the mandatory sense because the statute calls for shall, the Postmaster General shall and he shall order the mailer, “Do not mail anything further to such a complaining recipient.” 
    He shall direct the mailer to remove from any list in his possession or under his control or the under the control of his agents or assigns the name of such a complaining addressee. 
    And thirdly, this order shall direct the mailer, “Do not sell, transfer, exchange or rent any list containing the name of the complaining addressee.” 
    This order then is served upon the mailer. 
    The difficulty –-

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Before this is an accurate form in the back of the -- of your opening brief, right?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="333.061" stopTime="385.026">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    Mr. Justice Stewart that is Exhibit A to the appellant's opening brief is an exact order and it is the order arising out of the case reference in the appendix of Lee Jay Winkler which appears at page 22 of the appendix and is in connection with the matters set forth there. 
    The first principal problem as same relates to the First Amendment, appellants contend that to repose within an addressee the discretionary power to say, “I do not want anything that you send to me, any mail,” appellants submit is a direct violation and in complete derogation of the First Amendment.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="385.026" stopTime="387.745">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That's the case, isn't it right there, the while case?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="387.745" stopTime="416.907">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    That is -- Mr. Chief Justice that is certainly one of the principal issues. 
    I think in conjunction therewith, we have a secondary aspect of the First Amendment and that is namely, the further mailing of any materials which in that aspect becomes a prior restraint, it not only as prohibition but it is an inhibition depending on which interpretation this Court might involve itself with or look at for the statutory construction.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="416.907" stopTime="425.448">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, is it your view that the statute is broad enough so that if it could reach Sears Roebuck catlog or Montgomery word “catalog”.
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="425.448" stopTime="437.414">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    Mr. Chief Justice, it has reached the Sears Roebuck catlog, it has reached the Family Heritage bible, it has reached various organizations and I think that what is the subject of one of the -- on the amicus briefs here before this Court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="437.414" stopTime="447.330">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And you think a citizen has no right to say the Sears Roebuck or Montgomery Word, I don't want your catalog and don't send it to me?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="447.330" stopTime="523.871">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    That certainly is one of the principal issues in this case and an answer to that Mr. Chief Justice, I believe there are several of facets. 
    I believe that the under First Amendment, the free expression through the mails is of more paramount right, the more fundamental right within the society. 
    So hence, if we must create polarity between what has been termed as the right of privacy which I believe you elude to, the answer of appellants is that the free speech is far more paramount and must override that aspect of the recipient saying, “I do not want or I have a right not to receive.” 
    In addition, we submit however and I think this is more fundamental, that assuming arguendo that a recipient does has have such a right, this statute goes too far, too fast and hence we are never met by the issue. 
    I submit that this is an issue created by the Government in saying that right of privacy has now being polarized with free speech, but I believe that there are too many pitfalls before we arrive at that point.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="523.871" stopTime="533.801">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you place this on a higher claims or more preferred position than the right to address oral communications?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="533.801" stopTime="568.204">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    I don't believe Mr. Chief Justice that there are any claims. 
    I don't believe that there is a latter within the First Amendment. 
    I believe that each mode of communication as this Court has said, in a sense spins upon its own peculiarly or on its own way and must be looked at. 
    I believe in this complex, urban society in which we reside, the mails are a very important vehicle. 
    So, I do not in anyway determine which is the higher form of communication. 
    I think communication is protected by the First Amendment per se.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="568.204" stopTime="584.030">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Then it would follow that your clients could stand outside of the mailbox or on the premises and make a speech, and require the occupant to listen to it, there are no difference in the claims.
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="584.030" stopTime="607.965">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    This particular aspect again goes back to the annunciations that have been made previously that each mode of expression, each form of expression rather pivots upon its own. 
    The situation of standing outside of one's home and making the speech has the element of a helpless inescapable recipient.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="607.965" stopTime="611.104">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But there's a little bit of trespass in there, isn't there?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="611.104" stopTime="635.294">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    There could well be. 
    There could well be, but then again, there is always trespass whenever we have speech in a sense there is always someone who does not want to hear what the other person says and I suppose that there is trespass when they sound of one's voice or the wave lengths bounce off his ears but in the society which has preferred free speech that trespass must give way to the greater right embodied within the Constitution.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, assuming that as a citizen who does not like certain kinds of literature and doesn't want it in his house and is appalled by just a presence of it in his house. 
    How can you stop him finding that literature through his mail slot in his house. 
    How can he stop that? 
    How can he protect his “privacy”?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="664.108" stopTime="683.897">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I believe that inherit in that question would be -- would have to be the concession that there is right of privacy involved at that juncture. 
    It is appellant's position that under this statute and under that question, there is no right of privacy. 
    The right --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="683.897" stopTime="691.659">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You mean, I have no right to keep that type of literature out of my house?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="691.659" stopTime="695.382">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    I would say, under this statute, there is no right.

    Under this statute there is no right to keep it out?

    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    I am attempting to limit my answer to the statute. 
    I believe the statute goes too far in its encroachment to give that right in answer to the question.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="708.427" stopTime="718.193">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, my question was how can that citizen prevent that literature from coming through his mail slot into his house, how?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="718.193" stopTime="762.722">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    There is only one -- there is only one way that I know of Mr. Justice Marshall that a citizen may prevent the transmission of third class mail to his home and that is under the post office regulation which I believe this 39 CFR 44.1, I believe I am quoting it correctly. 
    As far as picking and choosing mail per se that he does not want or as the statute does in its second aspect, “any mail regardless of its content, the second mailing whether it'd be political, religious or that type of speech which has been time honored by this Court, that a citizen should not the right to exclude without determining what the content of the material is because the right of free speech is greater. 
    There is no right --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, his mail is out of privacy is already gone, is that your position?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="766.849" stopTime="779.389">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    Mr. Justice Marshall, my position is that under these circumstances, there never has been a right of privacy or in the alternative if I must, that right of privacy under those circumstances in the face of a statute is drawn and the First Amendment must give way.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="779.389" stopTime="788.466">

    In this place, who has a real conscientious feeling about it with just -- there's no way out?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="788.466" stopTime="799.272">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    I think the answer of Judge Frankel in the District Court probably states it more eloquently. 
    The distance from the mailbox to the ash can is a short distance in the light of the First Amendment.

    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    I think there are several aspects to that answer. 
    Pragmatically, I think one of the problems to be candid is that there is a tremendous burden. 
    There is an onerous burden within this commercial realm of distribution of removing these names from the lists. 
    The burden was spelled out in appellant's opening brief as well as in the amicus brief. 
    It is a real --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="905.730" stopTime="910.964">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You say what tasked have – one of the facets is financial burden?

    It is a financial and business burden that is only one facet.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And if hasn't to much to do with speech, on commercial communication --
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="919.443" stopTime="934.083">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    Well, that is certainly the position of the Government Mr. Justice White. 
    I do not believe that commercial communications deserve a lower rung if there be a latter on the First Amendment than any other form of speech.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="934.083" stopTime="960.044">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that is the point. 
    This is the point right -- certain act to this step but that give you protecting is impossible to determine that had any -- not have to take name off rather than being able to communicate because you go to communicate any way with these people because they do not accept the communication?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="960.044" stopTime="981.260">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    That may well be but as I pre-phrase my answer, there are several aspects to that. 
    I think the second aspect, probably the most troublesome aspect of the statute I might add, is a fact that no further mailing of any kind whatsoever, maybe made by a mailer. 
    Regardless of content, therein lies --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="981.260" stopTime="1004.882">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume that the -- let assume that is included to be leaving -- if only similar of the very kind that simple out of us that the adversely the appellee, he is going to be asking, would he?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="1004.882" stopTime="1036.853">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    The -- if the statute were so construed in spite of a fact that the legislative history is contrary to that construction and that was the construction of the court below, the problem would become certainly clearer. 
    It would become more in the realm of constitutional regulation, but I would then submit to the Court, that any type of regulation of speech must be carefully scrutinized and I believe this particular avenue is one that should left open.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Taback, I gather you see no relevance of Valentine and Chrestensen to this problem?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="1044.790" stopTime="1075.669">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    Valentine versus Chrestensen gave me a great deal of trouble Mr. Justice Brennan. However, I just define and I review the matter in this fashion. 
    One, I think the subsequent pronouncements of this Court, Time versus Hill, Times versus Sullivan have swept the Valentine case aside on reflection. 
    The Valentine case I say is too broad. 
    Secondarily, the Valentine case dealt with --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1075.669" stopTime="1089.722">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I thought -- I thought that in Times and Sullivan opinion, am I wrong, we made some references to indicate that Valentine and Chrestensen was not, at least as of that time disapproved, is it?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="1089.722" stopTime="1125.345">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    I believe it did but it went on to note that the fact of commercialism itself will not take speech out of the First Amendment. 
    Secondarily, I believe that the Valentine case like so many of the other speech regulation cases dealt with a situation of the public streets within a confines of local government. 
    I think under these circumstances weight was given to that local regulation keeping the streets open which is there as important in many senses as that particular speech involved. 
    So, I do not -- I am not at this point burdened by Valentine.

    Do you see a connection between what the Court had to say in Ginzburg about the pandering aspect and the limitations here?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="1134.361" stopTime="1189.659">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I do not and I do not because of this reason. 
    I believe this Court in the Ginzburg case, addressed itself to a completely different problem and that was problem of whether the advertisement connected with the actual material could be used as evidence in determining whether the material itself was obscene. 
    The connection if I do find one, under the words of several of the justices on this Court said, “That possibly pandering statutes could be created if they were ambiguous, the illusions of the fact that it would be a very difficult item by which to regulate and a very troublesome one.” 
    But again, the defining of pandering within that context as it was done, I feel related only to this ultimate issue of whether that material for the first time, could be used in discerning and determining whether the material itself was obscene.

    Mr. Joseph Taback

    The mail is so basic and so critical that that mail must be delivered.

    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    To this point and Mr. Justice Harlan, I disagree for the following reasons. 
    It is the Government that issues the prohibitory order. 
    It is the Government who lays down what cannot be done. 
    It is the Government that picks up the schedule for a second hearing in the event of the second mailing regardless of content. 
    It is the Government that conducts that hearing. 
    It is the Government who had set down the rules and regulations for conduct about the hearing and it is the Government who will enforce.

    Indeed, and I think when we begin to swift according to word of this Court, we find that there is much governmental action and therefore it does become a governmental intrusion. 
    It is the Government who empowered and directed if they so find to sentence or cite the individual for contempt. 
    We start off with what an individual triggering but the involvement, the participation is governmental participation as with the --

    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    Under this statute and within this context, I submit it is not. 
    One of the more telling points with regard to this again is the plain meaning of the statute, legislative history of the statute, the reports of the committee before the Senate and House as to what the statute meant. 
    I emphasize again, that the Congressmen involved, Senators in hearing the matter clearly demonstrated that they wanted no administrative participation or as little as possible. 
    No judicial review and in fact within the statute, they eliminate judicial review and they remove the matter from the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    People testifying before the Senate, former Attorney General questioned its constitutionality. 
    General counsel for post office asked that the statute not be passed. 
    The American Mailers' Association, the American Publicists' Association, the list goes on all asking of the matter not be passed, including the American Bar Association pleading that we are retrograding, we are going back towards by removing a procedure so critical from the Administrative Procedure Act, the statute was passed. 
    It was clear that the sole discretion of the individual was to be the target.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are you suggesting the American Bar Association took a position on a substantive merit through the statute itself or just the procedural aspect?
speaker="joseph_taback" startTime="1550.050" stopTime="1762.421">
    Mr. Joseph Taback 
    The American Bar Association took a primary and I believe, singular position with only with regard to the procedural aspects, and that was the fact what had been removed from the Administrative Procedures Act. 
    The legislative history again clearly calls for what the Government interprets the statute to be. 
    The individual is to reign free, it is his discretion and we are somewhat surprised to find that the Government retreats to a position if in fact they cannot save of the constitutionality by its interpretation to appoint -- let us, then examine and review the addressee, let us determine whether he has acted in good faith. 
    This flies in a face of the governmental or the legislative history and intent. 
    Time is splitting and at this juncture I merely wish to comment and point to the Court that the procedures embodied in the hearing that is involved in the statute falls of a far distance from the Fifth Amendment. 
    There is no right to confront your complainant. 
    There is no adversary procedure and constitutional issues cannot be raised. 
    I have attempted on numerous occasions, it is a subject of an affidavit within the appendix starting at page 22 and all affidavits, the record below were un-controverted, nothing was forwarded, nothing came in contravention to those affidavits. 
    One comment, the amicus brief of the Direct Mail Advertising Association clearly says that, unless you can interpret this matter our way which is namely a finding or administrative procedure ex parte, if you will, that the material is pandering, the law is too broad, it is too sweeping. 
    The court below “Judge Hufstedler said, we can only salvage the statute by meticulously construing it and shrinking it down to constitutional size and the interpretation given by that court below in salvaging is contrary to the position taken by the Government, contrary to the legislative history and hence it must fall. 
    It is contrary to the appellants view.” 
    It was clearly the view of Congress that this matter be a subjective determination unfettered and uncontrolled and in the face of the First Amendment this cannot go in that fashion. 
    The right of privacy, one the last note on that, has always or more traditionally involved the Government attempting to discover something about some one else. 
    We do not have it here. 
    We have merely an envelop going to someone. 
    I call to the Court's attention Exhibit D attached to the affidavit filed at page 22 of the appendix which entered into the evidence and was un-controverted, a notice to a recipient that if you do want this just hand it back to your Postmaster. 
    This is what has been done and yet the statute went far a field and found it necessary to build in a contempt proceeding ultimate jail sentence if necessary and we say taking the entire matter together, like it's -- if will assist your statutes 4008, 4006 is as unconstitutional as those prior statutes.

    There is a method by which it can be taken off the list at a more reduced cost and this is what we mean, Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    If the envelope with the label is returned, there is a better chance of doing it because the label usually in commercial distribution has a code. 
    The lists themselves are not alphabetized, there is no way to go through to the A's or B's. 
    If you have the coded label at least you are given a reference point to a commercial mailing list.

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Since that the -- now that there seems to be some concern about just precisely what the Government's position is, either below or in our motion to affirm in our brief, let me make it perfectly clear, precisely what the Government's position is. 
    It's our position that Congress has said, when an individual in our society receives through the mail material which in his sole discretion, he believes to be a pandering advertising and he again finds in his sole discretion this material to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative, he can tell the sender, “Don't send me anymore material!” 
    And he lists, the addressee a list -- enlist to support of the Post Office in informing the sender of his desires and if the sender persist, after one prohibiting from the post office, he maybe enjoined from continuing to send the material to an unwilling recipient. 
    If he still persists, he maybe held in contempt by that Court which has issued the injunction for violating the Court's order. 
    We believe that Congress has sought to protect a man in his own home. 
    Congress knew, I think it is clear from the legislative history --

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, I would take it that the alternative to attempting to limit this to a man's home, would be extremely difficult if not being easily discernible where a man would live, for instance or where he could object to this kind of thing or anything coming into his home. 
    We think that the purpose of the statute obviously was to protect a man his own home and if there was language in the statute which extended that purpose, it was necessary under the circumstances.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2012.029" stopTime="2026.602">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I take of then if it was something just addressed to General Motors Corporation, Detroit, Michigan, and General Motors didn't want to receive it, it's not just to an individual, just the General Motors Corporation, the statute would fall?
speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="2026.602" stopTime="2061.029">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    I -- under the broadest possible interpretation, I assume that it could but it was obviously aimed at an individual, although if you send it, the statute that it says if you send it an address, listed only to occupant that that is a violation of prohibitory order against that address. 
    So, I imagine the same thing would apply. 
    We think that Congress said that a man in his own home has the right to be unreasonable and they also sought to protect the unreasonable man in his own home. 
    And I think that --

    And in it terms only pandering advertisements which the addressee believes to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative, but as I understand your point is that and your construction of the statute that is if the addressee, John Smith thinks that an advertisement from a furniture store is a erotic or sexually arousing, he can prevent any further mailings to him from that furniture store. 
    It is absolute none further discretion, is that correct?

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Yes, but assuming again that it has some relation to a pandering advertisement as far as the individual was concerned, I think that given the purpose of the statute which was due rule number one to leave it in his discretion as to what he should refuse to receive and secondly, to get the administrative branch and the courts out business to determine whether he was rational in that exercise. 
    It's necessary for him took also be able to say, this is in my own home as far I'm concerned, I don't want to receive this.

    The Post Office has to issue an order at my request to Safeway not to deliver anymore advertisements for the Maine potatoes to my house, is that right?

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, I think the significance is that this language is as evidenced by the pamphlet that the Post Office itself has put out the language was to tell the individual this what we're trying to get -- give you a chance to refuse to receive in your home.

speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="2292.156" stopTime="2351.625">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, I think Mr. Justice Brennan it was to tell the individual in his home that this is what Congress intended was to allow you to get pandering material out of your home. 
    And in spite of the brief of the Direct Mail Advertisers in amicus brief, there is nothing before this Court that the purpose of the statute is being widely abused by individuals in their home. 
    And we have as we've noted in our brief some 368,000 complaints in the Post Office and the Justice Department. 
    At the end of last month, we had filed some 21,000 complaints. 
    We do not -- we have not filed any complaints and off in an effort to enforce the prohibitory order that have -- not having to do with the some sexual orientation. 
    Now, that I think what Congress was recognizing that if they're going to get the courts and administrative branch out they have to give this discretion to the individual that even to be unreasonable in his own home.

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    There is a regulation that the Post Office now has which under -- in a footnote to the Lamont case and in the regulation itself has been so interpreted an individual could notify the Post Office and say, “I don't want to receive anymore mail.”

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Precisely the same argument. 
    I think the reason that the pandering advertisement is in the statute even in this context is to notify the individual, this is what we meant and not to have that individual use his power to prohibit somebody from coming into his home and communicating with him indiscriminately and unreasonably. 
    And that really what we have here is very analogous to the right of an individual has to turn off the television set, to turn the radio if he's listening to a speech in a park to simply walk from the speech.

speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="2819.892" stopTime="3000.020">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, I think that the principle itself is it has to be delineated on case-by-case basis, but I think the principle itself as suggested in the amicus brief that the right of privacy is only the right control knowledge about oneself is and will become a considerably broader concept and the way they would attempt to limit it in that case. 
    Now, as far as the First Amendment provision itself is concerned, I think that we have a basic distinction in what the Congress sought to do in this statute and the exercise of First Amendment rights that have been upheld in previous mail cases and the previous cases in this Court. 
    And that is that here, where individual decides he wants no further communication from a mailer, his decision affects only himself and I think this is the prism through which the First Amendment claim here has to be viewed. 
    In all other cases, where an individual, or an agency, or a governmental unit decided that they did not like what was being communicated, their attempt to stop the communication did not affect even a single individual or the majority, it affected everyone and that there is a great distinction between this case and those kind of cases. 
    We're not talking about a case where the Post Master General would say, you can't send anymore mail through the -- or anymore of this kind of material or magazines, or books through the mail to anyone. 
    Now, he simply saying this individual in the society has told me, I don't want to be communicated from the sender anymore and he is notifying the sender of that individual's desire. 
    It has nothing to do with the sender's right to communicate to everyone else within the society.” 
    If you're talking about a chill on the First Amendment rights, there's no evidence in this case that anyone else has been inhibited from receiving of that material if that's their desire and nor is there any evidence that there's any change in the material that is being send out, it is precisely the same kind of thing that is being distributed. 
    And I think about the same token in the Bynum Books case where we have a Censorship Board, where what the Censorship Board did to an individual book distributors in Rhode Island is now the same situation as we have here, because it's then affected everyone and here it only affects an individual. 
    And I think the reason for the difficulties in the other cases is that decision of a majority or a single could affect what every man wanted to receive and that situation does not happen it here. 
    We have a situation where we simply turning off speech and as has been suggested, I think that the right to receive has the corollary right of not to receive.

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, I think if that claim of expense is there because in the past there was no concern as far as the senders were concern about the sensibilities of the addressees. 
    And what Congress said, is this going to have to have to be a cost of your business. 
    When an addressee is offended by material that you send him he has the right to tell you not to send him anymore?

    Well, General there is a very great, big difference though between turning off the radio or television and writing to some sender of mail and saying please, never send me anything again ever through the mail, and this statute because in the first examples, the Government is not implicated whatsoever. 
    This is purely an individual personal action, we have exercise of free choice. 
    Here, the Government of the United States is implicated, that's only reason this case is here?

    I think it's right but the only reason the Government is not implicated as a sensor or has an inhibitor or prohibiter of First Amendment rights, they're implicated simply because this is the only way it can be turned off and that what Congress has done in any implicating government and I agree that's why I agree with you that is why it is here -- is simply used him as the hand that turns off the radio and television.

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    There is a great deal of testimony to that effect in the congressional record and then in legislative history of the statute.

    There is no evidence in this record that this is what these plaintiffs or appellants here were doing or the direct mail orders. 
    As Congressman Waldie, I think said on the floor of the House, the man who gave the shape to this present statute, he said, I am the Supreme Court in the particular household in which my children reside, and from my decision there is no appeal. 
    And I would take it that this is what the Congress was attempting to do. 
    To say that a man in his own home can refuse to receive material because it might have a deleterious effect on his children as far as he was concerned and this was his decision in his own home and there is -- and that legislative history is replete with this kind of testimony.

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Yes, and I think the Post Master General is equally concerned about having that onus upon his shoulders and he in the administrative pamphlet which has been put out in the order that sense out, he sees this statute as meaning precisely what Congress itself saw its meaning and that is that he had no discretion to determine what was, and what was not a pandering?

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Because, Mr. Justice Black, the legislative history shows that isn't what they trying to do. 
    They tried to do two things. 
    They tried to give the individual the right to decide in his own discretion, what was and what was not pandering or what was sexually --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3362.799" stopTime="3372.275">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="3372.275" stopTime="3388.395">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, I think if you read Section (a) as having pandering advertisement being modified also by in his sole discretion and which -- in a way in which it can be read, it is clear that this is what Congress intended. 
    So, legislative history shows that it's clear, this is what the Congress --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3388.395" stopTime="3397.760">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But then attempted to find it pandering but it left it that he could decide what company should send him mail, I could understand him.
speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="3397.760" stopTime="3410.507">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, I think the reason they did not want to do that was because there is a lot of controversy within Congress over the merits or demerits of so-called junk mail.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3410.507" stopTime="3435.394">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But if it's junk mail for the sender, as I understand it that theory as it that somebody was recipient, has the right to determine whether he wants it or not and so why not let him determine and just say that, he can't get anymore mail to those people. 
    Why did mixed it up with a definition of pandering, that I do not understand.
speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="3435.394" stopTime="3466.384">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Because they did -- the evil, at which Congress was attempting to direct itself, was the mailing into the individual's home of material that was pornographic, or was obscene, or whatever you want to call it. 
    And Congress had a second purpose which was to get the administrative branch and the Courts out of the business of making this determination. 
    And therefore, they put pandering advertisement in the statute and left it to the sole discretion of the individual to decide it. 
    Hoping that not --

    I thought the Post Master General had to determine that?

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    This is not the Post Master General's interpretation. 
    It is not our interpretation. 
    We don't believe it's what the Congress intended from the legislative history, and I think the statute can be rationally read as meaning that all further mail was to be prohibited and that only discretion that the Post Master General had was to decide, whether there had been a mailing that was objected to by an addressee, that was an advertisement. 
    And then what he sends this information back to the sender and says, “No further mailings are to be sent” which is precisely what his order says as reprinted at the back of appellant;s opening brief.

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus

    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    -- Mr. Justice White and if it does, I think that given this structures of the statute --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    No, but you're going to have -- you would have a lot of cases where the sender would say, this is a pandering advertisement and does the court have to decide whether it's a pandering advertisement?
speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="3703.437" stopTime="3713.591">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    It does not. 
    I don't think that this is exactly what Congress wanted to keep the courts from having to do was to make this determination again in this instance --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3713.591" stopTime="3717.265">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, take the potato advertisement, would the court issue the order?
speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="3717.265" stopTime="3721.731">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Assuming that the Attorney General brought such a case. 
    I think that the Court --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3721.731" stopTime="3728.322">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if the Attorney General doesn't bring it, he's deciding in his mind then, that this is not a pandering advertisement?
speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="3728.322" stopTime="3732.121">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, it's says he's authorized to bring the case, it doesn't shall --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3732.121" stopTime="3734.531">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So there is some administrative discretion with that various --
speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="3734.531" stopTime="3738.693">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    But its way off on one end Mr. Justice White, in terms of --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3738.693" stopTime="3743.073">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And that so, I don't know the Department of Justice is in the way off on one end?
speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="3743.073" stopTime="3743.869">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, I mean [Attempt to Laughter] --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3743.869" stopTime="3747.435">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    But in terms of literature, it might not be way off on one end?
speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="3747.435" stopTime="3815.400">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    Well, I think if there was an abuse -- of an obvious abuse of a lower court's decision in issuing which is basically an equitable proceeding and injunction that -- there might be some grounds for an appeal from that decision. 
    But the -- we have used the standard in our brief as a suggested standard of a good faith standard. 
    Any standard that you use, you have difficulty with it because how can you determine good faith to the addressees not a present in court and he may will not be present in court if he is at the other end of the country. 
    So, that I think that to the extent that a court would received one of these things that obviously what wasn't advertisement, they had no relation whatsoever the pandering our sexually oriented material that a court couldn't in its equity power refused to exercise its discretion in entering an order. 
    Just as the Attorney General where it says he's authorized to bring such a case and where it says, in the second stage the Post Master General is authorized to request the Attorney General.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But I take it that you would say that the District Court when it asked to enter that order, it would look at that potato advertisement. 
    It could issue the injunction in its discretion and you're saying that the statute apparently would authorize the District Court to issue that injunction and that it would be no violation of the statute to order a person to quit sending potato advertisement.
speaker="william_d_ruckelshaus" startTime="3838.810" stopTime="3853.551">
    Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus 
    I don't think that we need to go that far. 
    I think it may well be if it's potatoes that the court on the appeal could it be said to have abused its discretion.
