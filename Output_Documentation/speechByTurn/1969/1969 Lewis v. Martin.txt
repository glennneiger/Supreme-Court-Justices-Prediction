    Number 829. 
    Mr. Beytagh, you may proceed.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="17.094" stopTime="142.483">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    In view of the few minutes remaining to me, I'd like to turn first to the substance of the position of the Government which in essence says that the court below improperly determined that that the HEW regulation in question here conflicted with the statute. 
    If time permits, I should like then to have an opportunity to respond further to the jurisdictional point that Mr. Justice Stewart raised yesterday. 
    The statute that is in question here is Section 402 (a) 7. 
    It's reprinted in the Government's -- the appendix to the Government's brief in pertinent part, it provides that a state plan for aid and services to needy families with children must provide that the state agency shall in determining need take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative claiming aid to families with dependent children. 
    The HEW regulation construes that critical language any other income and resources as meaning actual income, actual contributions made by stepfather or a MARS. 
    California's approach is to the contrary. 
    They assumed that where there is a stepfather or a MARS that his income is attributable and is a resource of the child without any actual proof. 
    That's the essence of the controversy here. 
    Now, California agrees and the court below agreed that if HEW's regulation is valid, as a proper implementation of the act, that California's conflicting statute must necessarily fall in the sense that California can no longer continue to be entitled to receive benefits should the secretary determine to cut them off.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="142.483" stopTime="165.754">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Under the Federal regulation, so I understand it, it would be incumbent upon California to prove or to show or to ascertain to its own satisfaction perhaps, how much in fact your stepfather or the man assuming the role of spouse actually does contribute.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="165.754" stopTime="174.176">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    That's -- that's correct Your Honor. 
    I think there are three positions that you could take, one is California which is essentially an irrebuttable presumption of support --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="174.176" stopTime="174.429">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="174.429" stopTime="175.179">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    From the very fact --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="175.179" stopTime="178.738">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's an attribution of support by what [Voice Overlap].
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="178.738" stopTime="192.122">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    The other is an approach that could be regarded as consistent with the HEW regulation but I don't think it is, that is if the burden of proof is on the recipients to show that the income was not actually received.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="192.122" stopTime="193.326">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that's what I was --
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="193.326" stopTime="217.049">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    But -- but our view is that the regulation -- the language of the regulation speaks in terms of actual contributions and income actually received and attempts to track King versus Smith in this respect, so I think that it's the third category which is that the burden of proof is on the state to show that the income was in fact received so as to reduce -- in extreme cases --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="217.049" stopTime="222.829">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose this might vary from months to months and even from week to week or even from day to day.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="222.829" stopTime="230.575">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Yes, and California has raised the question that we think is reasonable question here about seriousness of the administrative burden.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="230.575" stopTime="231.287">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="231.287" stopTime="255.294">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Now, we have checked as best we can, HEW has checked on my behalf determined that some 40 states have programs that do exactly this, to track the HEW regulation. 
    I have attempted to ascertain whether the feeling of these states and their administrators is that that's a practicable way to proceed, and the answer has been yes. 
    It's not a complete survey but as best we could sample it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="255.294" stopTime="270.439">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, how do they deal with the fact this maybe a changing pattern? 
    I mean, the stepfather may have all good intentions and one month might contribute, the next month he might stop at bar and grill and drink up or gamble away all the money and not contribute that month. 
    What is the --
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="270.439" stopTime="319.692">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Most of them proceed as we proceed in the income tax context, they require self disclosure and self reporting. 
    Perhaps to the surprise of some, they've found that in most cases this works. 
    That people receiving welfare benefits are prepared and do disclose honestly what income they do receive from other sources. 
    This is the basic trust of President Nixon's welfare message, the notion of self reporting and self disclosure. 
    Besides that there are case workers that proceed to investigate and talk to these people. 
    They talk to the man and they talk to the women, whatever. 
    The problem there is very significant, there's no doubt about it but most of the states have not thought that they are insurmountable.

    The state doesn't have to do it. 
    The state can decline to do it and the Government can decline to that amount of money.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="401.317" stopTime="445.727">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, the state can theoretically decline a debt but California like virtually every state has a specific statute that says that if any of their statutes and rules and regulations in the welfare context are inconsistent with Federal rules and regulations, the Federal rules and regulations shall prevail. 
    So, while theoretically California may be in a position to simply remove itself from the Federal program however impractical as a practical matter, they have made this judgment. 
    Their statute Section 11003 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code says exactly this. 
    We've checked other states statutes. 
    New York has even more explicit statute that says --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="445.727" stopTime="454.451">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But with reference to everyone out there. 
    The Government can settle it by not letting them have any money.

    On its own. 
    Why should this Court with all the burdens it has multitudinous cases that are becoming before, undertake a case of controversy when there is not a case of controversy between the two main persons who are interested in this, namely the state and the Government.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, Your Honor with all respect I don't think that the federal approach is changed the thing and so long as the Court establishes that the federal construction of the Act is the appropriate one in this area, then the state will necessary have to abide by it. 
    And I think California and New York and the other states have already made this judgment.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="610.066" stopTime="616.813">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    We will have to abide by it, and if we don't the Government has its relief in its own hand. 
    It can decline to let him have the money.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="616.813" stopTime="627.024">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    That's correct but that's circular because they've already made this judgment unless California resends the statute, it's made a judgment that it will exceed to the Federal rules and regulations.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="627.024" stopTime="630.943">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And the Federal Government can at this moment withdraw its funds.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Correct. 
    And that's correct they can but whether that's a reasonable or practical courses would carry not just --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="638.413" stopTime="647.678">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Probably more reasonable and to get this Court mixed status in every welfare case that arises in the whole range of this Court.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="647.678" stopTime="667.228">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    But the approach you suggest would carry over to every Federal matching grant program Your Honor and would simply say that there's no justiciable controversy here and that the way to proceed is for the Federal Government always to cut off funds and I don't think the Court has proceeded that way in the past and I don't think that it's a reason.

    No, I'm suggesting Your Honor that if the Court clarifies the questions raised in this case and other cases that there's no reason to expect that the Court will continue to be involved year after year in these disputes over the welfare law. 
    Once the secretary has his authority made clear, I think that it's reasonable for the Court to expect that he allied.

    Thank you, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="879.359" stopTime="880.650">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We can trade on that.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="880.650" stopTime="1101.905">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    We think that the regulation is valid for a number of reasons. 
    First, we think that the presumption of validity always attaches and as this Court has said a number of times to the administrative interpretation by a Government official charged with the responsibility for administering a particular act. 
    As Mr. Amsterdam indicated yesterday, the same approach, the approach of requiring proof of actual income before reduction of benefits has been applied across the board in other categorical public assistance programs by HEW. 
    Moreover, we think that in 1967 Congress at least implicitly approved the HEW regulation when it reenacted the Act and in an act of certain amendments to these provisions knowing what HEW's construction had been and not seeking to change it. 
    Moreover, we think that it's quite clear in King versus Smith, the Court specifically referred to predecessor regulation and said regulations of HEW, this is in footnote 16 of King versus Smith, regulations of HEW which clearly comport with the statute, restrict the resources which are to be taken into account under Section 602 to those that, "are in fact available to an applicant or recipient for current use on a regular basis." 
    This regulation properly excludes from consideration resources which are merely assumed to be available to the needy individual. 
    Moreover, the Court earlier this term summarily affirmed the decision by the Court -- the District Court in Connecticut in Salman versus Shapiro which is reported at 396 US file which held the HEW regulation valid and an inconsistent Connecticut practice to be invalid. 
    Moreover, we think that the HEW's approach is consistent with the purpose of the act which is to provide economic security to the five million plus children that are covered by this act. 
    It's a massive act. 
    This regulation is an important part of it. 
    The -- the whole program involves expenditure of over $2 billion by the Federal Government each year, a total expenditure close to $4 billion. 
    California statute we think conflicts with this regulation and since California has a statute that I already have referred to which says that when it's rules and regulations conflict the federal rules shall prevail, we think whatever the relevance of this supremacy clause that in this context the District Court improperly struck down the HEW regulation and improperly upheld the California approach. 
    California's approach of assuming support simply is contrary to fact in most cases. 
    Moreover, it is inconsistent with King versus Smith for the reasons that I've indicated earlier. 
    There's some language in that opinion that counsel might prefer to but that language is always accompanied by the reference to support in fact and while the Court referred to a legal obligation, it also referred to support in fact as coupled therewith. 
    The Court was referring King versus Smith, we think to a legal obligation of general applicability not the strange sort of thing that California sought to carve out. 
    Indeed, if California is right, Alabama could have avoided the decision there by just enacting a statute which said “Okay, substitute fathers have a legal obligation of support whether it was enforceable or not what difference it would have complied.” 
    Now, we don't think the Court intend to that King versus Smith. 
    We don't think that makes good sense.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You mean it would be the same as the situation in King and Smith.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    That -- well --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1118.107" stopTime="1123.059">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Because the families are eligible only if one parent is dead or absent.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1123.059" stopTime="1163.220">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    If you pressed it to the ultimate they are making these people parents and by definition they're not eligible -- but California doesn't want that of course, because the statute we're talking about here is specifically tailored to AFDC and relates only to that context. 
    So, they are simply trying to reduce the benefits that people receive by assumed support they get from these men without any acts of proof of it, and I think that if California were pressed too, there are some state -- a couple of states have adopted statutes that at least as the stepfathers place a general obligation. 
    As to those we --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1163.220" stopTime="1164.232">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that makes the family --

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I couldn't really conceive one applied to MARS but stepfathers is a reason -- I think is a feasible thing as I indicated some states too. 
    And that makes the stepfather -- the regulation itself, the first part which I didn't read specifically provides that. 
    It says that born relation to a child's stepparent who is ceremonially married to the child's natural or adopted parent and is legally obligated to support the child under state law of general applicability which requires stepparents to support stepchildren to the same extent that natural or adopted are required to support their children.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, I think the judgment is that you have then a real and enforceable obligation that's analogues to the obligation of a natural or an adoptive parent.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1229.194" stopTime="1250.567">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if the state can substantiate the fact that there's a legal obligation to support the children in the house, his living in the house there's a legal obligation under the state law to support those children and if it's enforceable you would say the state regulation is alright?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1250.567" stopTime="1272.807">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, it has to be one that meets all the criteria that this regulation spells out which is one of general -- the person becomes just as natural or adoptive father or stepfather. 
    Now, most of these people simply don't want to be put in that position and I don't think most states are going to adopt --

    Well no, but when you say that that would be alright, what you are really doing is assuming income.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I think that that's a necessary conclusion, that's the way the regulation reads and for good or for bad, we have to support the regulation. 
    But I think that it coincides with the common sense.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, I think that the idea is that when you have a man that's willing to do this much but then you have a more or less stable family unit that does not fit under the category --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1332.865" stopTime="1341.021">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But the experience would show that in the MARS situation it's just contrary to the reality assumingly.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1341.021" stopTime="1366.725">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I think so, I think that as soon as you try to put an obligation, a real obligation of support on these MARS people at least, their alternative is simply to get out and that California's statute both as to stepfathers and as to MARS provides that they have an obligation of support only when they're in the home, if they leave then they don't have an obligation, it evaporates.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1366.725" stopTime="1378.506">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Sure, sure well that's the result of this regulation has been to -- that some MARS have left.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1384.143" stopTime="1389.840">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It must be that the California regulation has some real teeth in the thing.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, it has real teeth when it deprives people that need support of.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1392.738" stopTime="1400.137">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know that it deprives MARS out of the family must be because there's a real obligation as long as they stay there, then why isn't the statute --
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1400.137" stopTime="1421.712">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    No, the reason they don't stay there is because the money is cut off and since their income is assumed to be available but it is not really available because they have other children to support or whatever, then they move out because they are not in fact able to provide support.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1421.712" stopTime="1440.511">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But I think there is another hypothesis for their moving out too and wasn't it one of the considerations in the development of the scheme namely that when they aid to dependent children stopped, the free boarder left because the income stopped.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1440.511" stopTime="1440.837">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.

speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1445.231" stopTime="1461.261">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I think it shows up in the early legislative history. 
    In King versus Smith, I think the Court made clear that the notion of punishing the kids by seeking to legislate morality for the mother had been abandoned by Congress in subsequent amendments.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1461.261" stopTime="1474.094">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I'm talking about the punishment of the children aspect, I'm talking about what you were addressing yourself to the reasons for the departure of this putative --
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1474.094" stopTime="1531.740">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    But to the extent that there is a notion of having stable family units, it seems to me that HEW's approach and not California fosters that because HEW's approach allows the reduction in the amount of benefit payments only when there is proof of actual income and therefore, when there is not actual income the MARS or the stepfather I assume will continue to reside with the children. 
    Now, to the extent that that's a value worth preserving, HEW's approach preserves, the California's does not. 
    California forces the man to move out of the house when he doesn't have income that helps support the children so that they won't receive the reduction, it won't be cutoff as to some of the people on this case were. 
    The reasons that we submitted and the reason stated in the brief, we think the District Court erred and the judgment should be reversed and remanded for further --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1531.740" stopTime="1535.351">

    Yeah, but the Supreme Court of California has a chance --

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Alright. 
    Your Honor, my understanding is that Supreme Court of California has not had a chance to pass squarely on this. 
    There's some lower California Appellate Court --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1545.451" stopTime="1550.664">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You don't know how they would construe their law on the later amendment to it.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1550.664" stopTime="1607.099">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    That correct but I don't think that really the law needs too much construction perhaps counsel from California will illuminate us on this but the intermediate appellate court decision are quite ambiguous. 
    Frankly, they speak in terms of the obligation of support not being a general one that applies across the board but one tailored to AFDC. 
    Well, that's quite right it is one tailored to AFDC. 
    There was a case where one of these people said that this law was a deprivation of his right of property. 
    California couldn't do this and the Court said no that's not right, he is not being deprived of anything. 
    He simply -- his income is simply being assumed to have been transferred to the support of the children. 
    So, to the extent that this California authority, it's confusing and ambiguous but it at least raises questions as to whether the duty of support is anything more than a loser one. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I might -- I might start Mr. Justice Black in trying to answer your question regarding a determination by the Secretary of HEW of whether California is in compliance and if not, why not cut California off. 
    When this litigation started in the District Court, California officials were in the process then of trying to determine from HEW whether in fact, HEW felt that the California statute and regulations were in conflict and we were unable to even receive a definitive statement from HEW whether or not the secretary considered California to be in compliance or not. 
    And we urge the various correspondents on this subject was attached to our motion to dismiss filed in the District Court and we urge the District Court at that time that there is a procedure in the Social Security Act for resolving disputes between the states and HEW as to whether a state plan does or does not comply. 
    The secretary makes a determination of noncompliance. 
    The state is given the authority to petition the Court of Appeals for the particular circuit for determination of that specific issue.

    But this is an aspect of their lawsuit also as the Equal Protection problem which assuming that California were running its own welfare program, not receiving federal matching funds presumably the same constitutional limitations are going to have to apply.

    But you'd manage to do something somehow?
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="2414.446" stopTime="2435.735">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    Yes. 
    The HEW regulation has two parts to it. 
    The first one is the secretary's definition of who maybe a parent which of course goes to the question of is the child a dependent child and eligible or not eligible for assistance.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2435.735" stopTime="2440.745">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    At all but that doesn't go to the question of the amount of money, it goes to the question of eligibility at all.
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="2440.745" stopTime="2450.623">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    At all. 
    If the person is determined to be a parent, there is no eligibility with the exception of the unemployed parent and the optional AFDC --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2450.623" stopTime="2456.350">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, with some if you have a chance but generally speaking if both parents are in the house ineligibility.
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="2456.350" stopTime="2556.280">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    By definition, Social Security Act sets up AFDC eligibility for a child who is deprived of parental support because on the absence of a parent. 
    HEW in subsection A of its regulation 203.1 says that, the only person who can be a parent is a natural father, an adopted father or a stepfather who is legally obligated to support the child to the same extent as a natural or adoptive father. 
    If that's correct -- now California is not attempting to define children living with a MARS or stepfather as non-dependent children. 
    We are not trying to call the stepfather or the MARS a parent. 
    But under HEW's definition, the only thing California did wrong was to limit the stepparent liability to a stepparent in a welfare home. 
    If California had imposed an obligation on all stepfathers to support their children, then it seems to me that under the HEW regulation, California could determine all needy children in a home with a stepfather totally ineligible for aid and it certainly escapes me how the child -- the needy child in a welfare home derives anymore economic protection from the extension of the stepfather liability to a stepfather in a non-welfare home.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2556.280" stopTime="2568.176">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But if you're right then you are violating the Federal law in a different way because you're spending federal money that you're not authorized to spend because you're giving it to children who are ineligible under the federal statute.
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="2568.176" stopTime="2579.153">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    But we can easily remedy the situation Mr. Justice Stewart by simply exchanging our support obligation statute and making all stepfathers liable for the support of their children.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2579.153" stopTime="2592.729">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As I say if you do that, then if you give any money to a family of the stepfather then you're making an unauthorized expenditure of federal money and you're violating the federal law.
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="2592.729" stopTime="2634.177">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    Which to me would be frustrative of the purposes of AFDC which is to impose a support obligation on a stepfather in a relatively affluent family. 
    Certainly, it gives no economic protection to the child with a stepfather in a poor family. 
    It makes no sense but if the HEW regulation is valid, I think I can state with relative certainty that California will just extend its stepfather liability statute and cut off all children in stepfather homes.

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    Some children living with stepfathers are still receiving aid because the stepfather's net income is insufficient to bring the family up to the states' maximum budget for the family. 
    But if we extend the stepfather liability to non AFDC family stepfathers, then the children in the AFDC family with the stepfathers are going to be totally cutoff. 
    There are now children in the AFDC stepfather family who are still receiving aid, all be it less aid because of the obligation of support on the --

    Under the Social Security Act as interpreted by this Court in King versus Smith. 
    That Congress expects that when there is a breadwinner in the home that the breadwinner will support the child and the Social Security Act says that the state has to -- the second part of this is that the state has to determine the extent of need of the children in the home and the child is deemed less needy because of the resource which is assumed by Congress in view to the benefit of the child because of the support obligation.

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    I appreciate that problem but it's not any different than the child living with a natural father who may not support it. 
    The child or his mother has to sue the man not the state. 
    The state doesn't pay aid and then pursue the man. 
    The child has to get the money from the man.

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    Unemployed fathers, not that I know of Your Honor. 
    There are statistics that would indicate how many families we're talking about which contain -- the figures are July 1968 and at that time there were roughly 191,000 families -- AFDC families in California and of that there were 6,700 families with the stepfather and 2,800 families with the MARS. 
    A total of roughly 9,500 families out of 191,000 families but of the 191,000, I am not familiar with the statistics on how many of those are unemployed fathers. 
    I could easily obtain them and supply them to the Court if you will.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3170.216" stopTime="3188.192">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I'm not sure if that's necessary unless someone else wants it. 
    What I'm trying to get at is that this assumption that you are talking about is based on further assumption of the enforceability against this man.
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="3188.192" stopTime="3196.263">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    That's correct and it's the same assumption as applies with a natural father in the home and it's an assumption that there is an enforceability.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3196.263" stopTime="3211.231">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But wouldn't you concede that it is easier to enforce that claim against the natural father by the usual traditional processes that it is against these transient men in the house.
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="3211.231" stopTime="3215.308">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman

    By whose definition?
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="3216.881" stopTime="3271.092">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    By the state definition before the application of the rule even can begin the person -- the man in the house by definition is living in the home and is, in stepfather case, ceremonially married to the mother or in the MARS case is living in the home and has either assumed financial obligations on behalf of the family or comports himself in the community as husband and wife. 
    And one of the crucial criteria of determining who is the MARS is that he has no other alternative place of residence. 
    Just as his family and to the extent that he is a trencher the moment he leaves the home the child is restored the eligibility.

    Even if the wife applies for relief?
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="3347.918" stopTime="3359.772">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    If the wife applies for relief in the natural father case and he is living in the home, relief is denied, they are ineligible by definition.

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    If they can find it. 
    But with MARS, the state does not pursue it because there's no more obligation and the state pays aid at that point in time. 
    The other one important resource which I think is unique in the West, particularly in California, in the case of the stepfather is that under California community property law, the earnings of the stepfather are community property in which the wife, the welfare mother has a vested present one-half interest. 
    Half of his earnings are hers.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3409.623" stopTime="3411.559">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That's with the ceremonial marriage.
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="3411.559" stopTime="3494.663">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    That's what the stepfather only. 
    Yes, after the ceremonial marriage, there is no community property in a putative marriage. 
    There is in a meretricious -- in the putative there is, in a meretricious there is not. 
    In other words, these people know they are not married, the MARS and the mother and there is no community property there. 
    If one of them harbors the mistake and belief that they are married, there can be community property there. 
    But I'm talking about the situation where the mother has ceremonially married the man. 
    Community property then attaches to his earnings, and half of his earnings are hers. 
    I would submit that if there is anything that is a resource which the Social Security Act commands California to consider in determining need, that is a resource. 
    Again, the mother may have to take legal action to protect her half interest, but that's no different than the mother living with the natural father of her children. 
    She also may have to take legal recourse but the obligation is clearly enforceable.

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    I read the language. 
    The place is the first page of the appendix in the Government's brief. 
    This is Section 602(a)(7). 
    It's one of the series of requirements of the Social Security Act as to what state plan must provide and says that a state plan for aid and services to needy families with children must, underscore must, provide that the state shall in determining need take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative claiming aid.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3582.833" stopTime="3585.501">

    Yes.

    Exactly.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3599.643" stopTime="3605.369">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That the statute requires that you assume that was Social Security?
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="3605.369" stopTime="3609.785">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    Not assumed.

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    Yes, of the child or the mother.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3622.764" stopTime="3624.165">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And who's claiming aid?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you've got to say that income don't have to assume the availability of income from the MARS and stepfather. 
    Either to the mother of the child. 
    You said that Act requires that. 
    Whether it's a MARS in the house or stepfather in the house and the state has legal obligation that this Act requires that you assume that that income is available to the child.
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="3665.371" stopTime="3671.781">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    Assume that it is available because it is a resource.

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    As this Court pointed out in King versus Smith, if there is a legal obligation of support, proof of actual contribution cannot be determinative.

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    Yes, because it defines a child in California to be resourceless. 
    The child can have nothing other than the income that the state through some administrative miracle can --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    As far as regularly and definitely, that would be the excuse to contribute anything to the support the child regardless of the legal obligation for him imposed by the state, is that what you were saying?

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman

    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    I think it is Mr. Justice White. 
    It's a weapon. 
    It's a method of enforcement of the obligation that the state is reducing the grant and the mother can say with real meaning support me or get out. 
    And the facts of this case, the complaints in this case despite their protestations that the men are not supporting the children in the house. 
    The complainants themselves admit that due to the emergency as the language that the plaintiff appellant used that due to the emergency caused by this state statute, the men are supporting the children until the statute is declared invalid. 
    The statute does work, it is enforceable and the men are supporting the children at least some of the names plaintiffs are and the record will show that. 
    The other fact is that in the case of the stepfather and presumably in the MARS as well. 
    It's literally impossible for them not to support them at least in some of these cases where the man has taken the welfare mother and her children into his home. 
    He has put a roof over their head which is the case in several of the named plaintiffs in this appeal. 
    The man has brought the children into his home. 
    Now, certainly to some extent, he is putting a roof over their head which is a lessened need for public expense to support that family.

    There is a maximum amount of shelter need. 
    Although, there is another case in California on that issue, that the state law and the Social Security Act although the argument is compelled the state pay actual shelter needs. 
    But the -- the current system is that there are allocated specific amounts for each of the various needs, shelter, food, clothing, and so on.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would it be fair to say that part of the problem or at least -- or part of the problem as to what extent leverage may be used against the children to enforce obligations against the adults?
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="4020.718" stopTime="4024.962">

    I think that is somewhat fair.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would you -- would you state it in your own way?
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="4028.597" stopTime="4181.357">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    I think the question is how much -- taking King versus Smith as the starting point of what it is and what is not allowable. 
    The child in a home where there is a legally obligated man -- a support obligated man, a burden may fall on that child because the person, the man may not be performing his duty. 
    To that extent, inherent in the Social Security Act, in the AFDC program is that the child may be harmed because of a delinquent father. 
    But so long as he remains in the house, the burden is the child's and our essential argument is that the support obligation which California imposes on MARS or stepfather in the house may put a burden on the child. 
    Although, we question that factually that does happen that often as we think the record in this case will show that it is not as absurd as the appellants would argue to expect that a man will support someone other than his own children. 
    But to the extent that there is a support obligation, the Social Security Act resubmit, makes that child either a non-dependent child because it's a natural parent or a less needy child because of a perhaps lesser support obligation, clearly enforceable but the extent of the obligation on the man may be less in terms of dollar amount. 
    The support obligation on natural father is without limitation. 
    The support obligation on the MARS and the stepfather, as the state computes the amount of the obligation may turn out to be a lesser amount than the amount the natural father would have to pay.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4181.357" stopTime="4202.046">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, if you have a natural working father, if you let me put this hypothetically to you, a natural father who is working but who more or less regularly drinks up half of his earnings. 
    Then, we have deprived children then as a result, can they get aid to the dependent children while he is living in the house gainfully employed.

    So that you have children who suffer as consequence of the conduct of the adults which is beyond the reach of Government.
speaker="jay_s_linderman" startTime="4212.738" stopTime="4274.117">
    Mr. Jay S. Linderman 
    The Social Security Act is only one of many programs to try alleviate poverty. 
    But to the -- it's limited, it is to provide support for children who do not have some breadwinner to look to. 
    It's not essentially that the breadwinner perform his duty of supporting the children. 
    Congress expected that the bread winner would support the children in his home. 
    California expects the same thing but the natural father or the MARS or the stepfather may spend his earnings on wine, women or so or whatever, the children may suffer but the social -- but the AFDC program is not the way that you solve that problem.
