    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    This case involves the question of what procedural rights are to be afforded to the most dependent members of our society: the aged, the disabled, the blind, and the children of the poor. 
    The basic issue presented by this case is whether welfare recipients, after being found eligible, after full and vigorous investigation, are to have their benefits terminated without an opportunity for a full and fair adjudicative hearing. 
    In California, at the present time, there is a hearing which comports with the requirements of due process after the termination of welfare benefits. 
    Under the regulations adopted by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, this hearing takes place-- should take place within 60 days from the date of termination of benefits. 
    In point of fact, the hearing takes place long after that 60-day period, as has been conceded by appellees of this case.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is this a federally part-- federally funded program?
speaker="peter_e_sitkin" startTime="133.516" stopTime="241.632">
    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    Yes, it is. 
    The appellants who I’m representing specifically are old age security recipients who are recipients under the Categorical Aid Program funded by the Social Security Act. 
    The regulation at issue in this case concerns all of the categorical aid programs, that is, the Aid to Families with Independent Children, Aid to the Blind, Aid to the Disabled, as well as Old Age Security. 
    Prior to termination of benefits, a welfare recipient is not afforded an adjudicative hearing to contest the reasons upon which the department has based its decision to terminate. 
    A welfare recipient is only provided with an opportunity to confer informally, usually with the very individual who has made the initial decision to terminate at a conference which can take place at a minimum of three days before a check will be terminated or a check will be withheld. 
    There is no opportunity within this short period of time to adequately prepare for this conference, nor is there an opportunity at the conference to have an opportunity to fairly and fully adjudicate the questions which might involve continuing eligibility. 
    Questions, for example, such as whether an individual has intended to transfer property to remain on public assistance, questions which are traditionally been decided in adjudicative hearings with the procedural protections usually connected with such hearings.

    Mr. Sitkin, you said that a person becomes eligible after a full investigation. 
    What is the procedure? 
    That’s not a trial type hearing, is it?

    There’s no trial type hearing before he’s found to be eligible, is there?

    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    An individual applies to the Welfare Department and information is provided by that individual. 
    The regulations of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare indicate that the recipient himself is to be the primary source of the information regarding his eligibility. 
    The department obtains consents from the individual and, if necessary, investigates the individual’s eligibility by contacting collateral sources with respect to the income that the individual might have or with respect to other particulars that concern his eligibility.

    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    There is no hearing. 
    There is a full investigation with respect to the individual and, I might add, that as an individual remains on public assistance, he is periodically reinvestigated and is required to provide the department with information to maintain his eligibility.

    The County Welfare Department in the particular-- in California, the welfare programs are administered locally by County Welfare Departments, although the overall supervision of the program rests with the State Department of Social Welfare, but it is the individual County Welfare Department, usually in the person of the social worker or the social work supervisor who initially approves the application for eligibility. 
    If there is a dispute with respect to eligibility, the individual is afforded an opportunity for a hearing to contest the reasons why the department has refused to grant assistance in the first instance.

    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    Yes, it is our position that once a person is found eligible for public assistance, if he is not afforded opportunity to be heard with respect to the reasons for discontinuance, then his rights in the Due Process Clause would be violated since he is not being afforded a fair opportunity to contest the very reasons upon which the governmental agency has made its decision to terminate benefit.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Is it your answer then that there was no trial type procedure in these cases?
speaker="peter_e_sitkin" startTime="483.198" stopTime="487.510">
    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    There is no trial type procedure when an individual applies to welfare. 
    When he--
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="487.510" stopTime="497.238">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    He is ineligible without any trial type of procedure, and you’re argument is that it’s unconstitutional to cut him off without a trial type procedure.
speaker="peter_e_sitkin" startTime="497.238" stopTime="658.816">
    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    That is our position. 
    Unless an individual is able to convince the very individual who made the initial determination that a person is ineligible, unless he is able to convince that person that this informal conference held, as I mentioned, three days prior to the date that it should be held, he has no opportunity to have his aid continue until the state administrative hearing is provided at least 60 days after the termination of his benefits. 
    In determining the extent to which procedural protection should be afforded to a welfare recipient, this Court in numerous occasions has indicated that one must examine the system in which the procedural protections will operate, examine the interest of the individual concerned, and examine the interest of the state or the governmental agency involved. 
    The one overwhelming and unique factor which is present in the welfare programs, which is present in no other government program is that maintenance of the welfare grant is the difference between survival, between starvation and continuation of some type of sustenance. 
    It is this fundamental interest on the part of the individual that, we assert, must be protected by those procedures which this Court has considered to be appropriate in adjudicative hearings. 
    Protections such as the right to cross-examine and confront where appropriate, the opportunity to have a decision made by at least a relatively impartial arbiter, not the very individual who made the initial determination, to withhold benefits, that an individual be afforded a reasonable opportunity to prepare for the hearing, a hearing which might, in the many instances, involve the preparation of some interpretation. 
    For example, in the case of Mrs. Wheeler, the appellant in this case, Mrs. Wheeler had to submit one or two affidavits to the Welfare Department. 
    This would take some time. 
    She’s given just a three-day period. 
    She must, in many instances, retain a representative or counsel. 
    Mrs. Wheeler was 77 years of age when her benefits were terminated and did need the assistance, first, of a lay representative and, ultimately, of an attorney.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The real issue between you and your adversary, I-- unless I’m mistaken, is when this hearing need be given, isn’t it?
speaker="peter_e_sitkin" startTime="665.532" stopTime="667.074">
    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    That is the basic issue in the case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="667.074" stopTime="674.655">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Because the hearing of the kind and quality that you’re talking about is ultimately given under the law, isn’t it?
speaker="peter_e_sitkin" startTime="674.655" stopTime="674.796">
    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    Yes, it is.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="674.796" stopTime="675.934">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That’s ultimately given.
speaker="peter_e_sitkin" startTime="675.934" stopTime="779.208">
    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    The hearing is ultimately given, but it is our contention that given the injury that occurs to an individual when benefits are withdrawn, that in those relatively few cases, and I underscore that, the relatively few cases where the question of ineligibility is contested, an individual should be given an opportunity to have this type of hearing prior to the withdrawal of benefits. 
    We are not talking about a hearing procedure which is going to be available for all one million welfare recipients in California nor the 23,000 old aged security recipients who have been discontinued from assistance, for the figures bear out that it is a relatively few number of welfare recipients that appeal the determination of the Welfare Department. 
    In many instances, there is agreement. 
    An individual obtains employment and is no longer eligible for assistance. 
    His income now exceeds the welfare limitations. 
    In another instance, an individual may have remarried and may no longer be in need of additional public assistance. 
    So that, we are only concerned about those issues we are-- those situations where serious questions of fact have arisen between the welfare recipient and the County Welfare Department, and it is to that issue that we search an adjudicative hearing having basic protections is necessary. 
    We--

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    With the second, suppose California said after this three-day hearing, we will continue, but if you don’t successfully meet the appeal procedure within 60 days, you’re out.

    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    That-- if that administrative decision was made by the State of California that would be satisfactory to the appellants in this case. 
    The problem about--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="805.467" stopTime="812.077">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So, to make it final, your real criticism is to cut off the money for two months.
speaker="peter_e_sitkin" startTime="812.077" stopTime="815.986">
    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    Yes, if in fact California was adhering to the 60-day requirement.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="815.986" stopTime="828.107">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Suppose California said you lose in the first instance and you win in the second instance and so, we give you the two months if you win.
speaker="peter_e_sitkin" startTime="828.107" stopTime="875.183">
    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    If-- you’re saying that if we lose in the first instance and we win in the second instance and then we get retroactive benefits, that is not sufficient to fully make whole, if you will, the individuals who were terminated from assistance. 
    As this Court has noted in a case decided last term, in Nash versus the Florida Industrial Welfare Commission, the fact that an individual ultimately can recoup through retroactive payments is not a satisfactory answer when the funds are necessary to provide the difference between continuing subsistence and possible starvation.

    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    The citation to the case is 389 US 235. 
    In addition, if the Court would review particularly the affidavit of Henry Fraser which is contained at the rec-- in the record, not in the appendix, in the record at pages 137 through 140, the Court will graphically appreciate the circumstances that individuals are placed when benefits are withheld even for a period of 60 days. 
    In the situation of a number of the interveners in this case, the individuals were reduced to a diet of potatoes to not having the ability to purchase any type of clothing and to severe injury, but it must be made plane that in California, at the present time, not even the 60-day requirement is being met. 
    One would assume, however, that if the hearing preceded termination that the 60-day requirement would be met, indeed, the experience in a number of states who have instituted a continuation pending the hearing has resulted in a situation where hearing decisions are rendered within two weeks, so that when there is the additional interest on the part of the state, both to rapidly adjudicate the decision so that additional moneys are not paid out in some instances to potentially ineligible persons, the hearings are held expeditiously and rapidly. 
    This flexibility is available within the administrative agencies involved and the individual, the recipient, can be afforded those rights which are traditionally associated.

    I’d like the answer to be clear about this part of your argument. 
    Is it your position that when Congress or a state enacts a gratuity piece of legislation, giving somebody something out of the treasury and declares that issue be found eligible by agencies, that they can never be declared ineligible without going through a tri-- a type of trial procedure?
speaker="peter_e_sitkin" startTime="1519.559" stopTime="1538.861">
    Mr. Peter E. Sitkin 
    Not at all. 
    Our position is that an individual can be found initially ineligible by the Welfare Department, but he must be notified of that fact and, if he contests that determination, then should be entitled to a hearing which affords him basic procedural safeguards when such a vital interest is involved.

    Is it your position that when there’s a gratuity given, such as has been given in many wars, after many wars, bread, meat, gratuity of various kind, somebody is found eligible by an agency, that the government cannot deprive that person of that gratuity without going through a trial type procedure?

    In that case, it was a question of the government providing to individuals Indian lands, and Mr. Goldsby in that case was initially found eligible for an allotment of this land provided by the federal government and the Court held in that case that the action of the Secretary in removing Mr. Goldsby from the roles of the individuals who were entitled to that land without affording Mr. Goldsby an opportunity to be heard and notice was a violation of due process.

    Yes, I think I will conclude at this particular point. 
    I would just like to make clear to the Court that what we are dealing with here is not a large mass number of individuals who will be continuing aid. 
    It is only in those situations where there are serious issues of fact involved that we are asserting that there is a right to continuation of assistance and, given the vital interest of the individuals who were involved here and given the fact that administrative procedures have already been developed by the state, it is our position that due process requires the procedural protections which we assert are required in this case. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Elizabeth Palmer
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1819.388" stopTime="1823.257">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you, Mr. Sitkin. 
    Mrs. Palmer.

    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    Yes, Mr. Justice. 
    May it please the Court. 
    If I may directly rebut what my colleague has brought to the Court’s attention in Goldsby, the Goldsby case there was a hearing prior to the determination of eligibility to being placed on the list for the allotment of land. 
    Now, the Secretary struck the name from the list without any hearing, and that is not comparable to the situation that is before this Court. 
    I ask the Court to take a close look at the pre-withholding termination of aid procedures. 
    It isn’t a three-day notice. 
    Just there we are, “three-day notice you are going to be cut off aid.” 
    It is preceded by an investigation, discussion where a case worker, as soon as there is any hint of ineligibility, the recipient is the primary source of information. 
    Collateral resources are only consulted with the consent of the recipient who has also explained why we want to see Mr. X or whoever, the reasons for that. 
    If the notice does go out of withholding or contemplated withholding, it is only sent out when the evidence of ineligibility is both substantial in nature and reliable in source. 
    It’s not hearsay on hearsay on hearsay or gossip, rumor, or surmise. 
    It must be substantial in nature and reliable in source.

    No, I mean, what is the recipient handed that tells the recipient this is what is-- you were wrong about.
speaker="elizabeth_palmer" startTime="2051.900" stopTime="2147.971">
    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    Alright. 
    The notice says “must include,” according to the resolution, “must include the grounds for the contemplated withholding of the aid, what information is needed to maintain eligibility.” 
    Now, no longer can there be the cryptic notice of “essential information is lacking,” because the “what essential information” has to be put right there in the notice, plus the fact that they are advised that they may have counsel, they are advised that they may come in at a specified time at a specified place for a conference with a case worker, eligibility worker, or other county representative. 
    That, in the event, no agreement can be reached between the case worker, and I must say that, in the large counties, the interview would not normally be with a case worker because there is a special complaint and review unit that is set up that the interview would be, in partial, referee. 
    But, you must realize that the California’s 58 counties vary greatly in size. 
    Alpine County has a welfare caseload of 84. 
    Los Angeles County has well-over half-a-million. 
    There is a-- the availability of staff for these interviews.

    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    11,500 welfare workers in Los Angeles County and over-half-a million welfare recipients. 
    So, California cannot blank it and that’s why Mr. Montgomery, in promulgating regulations, has to consider the varying problems of these counties. 
    Regulations of the Department of Social Welfare are not-- they are only adopted after public hearing, where interested individuals, organizations, and including the welfare directors who don’t always get together on what they want, as you can very plainly see because of their different problems. 
    Consequently, the regulation that is being attacked here is a result of compromise, as most legislation is.

    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    Well, if it’s a factual situation, Your Honor, then it is a difficult question.

    The policy is already set.

    It’s not like the policy is not satisfied, it’s just the plain issue of that.

    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    Your Honor, in-- the Wheeler case is a perfect example of conflicting evidence, but if the State Department had been consulted, there was a misapplication of regulations to the facts even with the dispute. 
    Did she get rid of this money to remain eligible on aid? 
    The regulation said it felt that you have to consider her purpose. 
    She is the primary source of whether she did or did not get rid of this money to remain eligible for welfare. 
    Consequently, on the very same facts, the referee held that she was eligible for aid. 
    So normally, in factual disputes, surely they say “I did,” somebody else says “you don’t,” and someone has to decide and the review unit of the county is the one who decides at this initial stage.

    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    And with the obligation to report these funds and not having done so despite conferences with her-- interviews with her case worker, I presume that that had some human element of doubting the story. Getting to the fair hearing and the link of time that it takes for the fair hearing, in appellant’s reply brief, there is set forth a table that I found shocking of the case’s fair hearings that have been pending from one to two years. 
    I immediately called the Chief Referee of the department and he, with very little time, went through the ones that were over year old, and he found that in most of them, if not all of them, should have been closed out due to being unable to find the claimant, that the matter had been settled at the department level, that the claimant had asked for an indefinite continuance, and so on. 
    But, most of these-- but due to the terrific increase in fair hearing requests from 500 normal requests a month to 700 now, in July, August, and September, that they felt that they should try to meet the 60-day requirement, try to meet the state regulation that the hearing must be held within 17 days of the request for the hearing, and not bother because they haven’t had a commiserate increase in clerical staff or referees. 
    Consequently, they have also adopted the position that when the referee hears it, and that the claimant is right, that’s going to be the referee’s decision, that decision goes out immediately, less harm to the recipient whose hearing decision is going to be unfavorable to the claimant. 
    Now, that isn’t ideal, but at least it’s the best thing that the department feels that they can do under the circumstances. 
    So, I ask you when you would look at that chart to please do not be as shocked as I was when I looked at it, that there are reasonable explanations for that link of time. 
    In another table of statistics, the same series as this table 62, is table 60 which may give the Court some idea of the number of fair hearings that are filed. 
    Last fiscal year, there was 6,218. 
    This is 2,000 more than the preceding year. 
    That 5,915 appeals were closed last year. 
    That’s 2,769 more than the preceding year. 
    So, all I can say is that the State of California is working at it.

    Is there anything in this record, Mrs. Palmer, about what success the State of California has had in recouping of payments improperly made to recipients who were determined not to be eligible?
speaker="elizabeth_palmer" startTime="2636.730" stopTime="2716.958">
    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    No. 
    I don’t know of any statistics, Your Honor. 
    I have-- I understand that it’s not too successful. California does not take liens on property as some other states do. 
    California-- I must also, and I’m sorry I forgot to bring to the Court’s attention that in California, one of the peculiarities of California I guess, the counties on general assistance or home relief, whatever you want to call it, it is solely county financed with solely county standards. 
    We are here talking only about the so-called categorical aids, the federal state finance programs which the counties also participate in California. 
    So, you can have as wide a range in what benefits are received under general assistance as there are 58 counties. 
    As a matter of fact, I assume, and I’m pretty sure of that, there are some gross inadequacies in this program, perhaps equal to $35 a month for a family of four on the average grant in Mississippi.

    I beg your pardon, Your Honor, it isn’t a charge.

    Your Honor, I can’t defend the welfare system, and I don’t think anyone can. 
    It is indefensible. 
    No one is happy with it. 
    Certainly, the poor are not happy with it and the taxpayer is less happy than because of the enormous amount of money that goes into it. 
    I’m not defending the system. 
    I’m merely saying that the procedure that California has adopted does satisfy, at this stage of the proceedings, due process.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2918.895" stopTime="2932.042">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mrs. Palmer, does the federal law permit a state to terminate benefits pending a full trial type hearing?

    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    Yes, Your Honor, they do. 
    They--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2934.165" stopTime="2937.148">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Although the federal law requires a fair hearing?
speaker="elizabeth_palmer" startTime="2937.148" stopTime="2938.959">
    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    That requires a fair hearing and--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2938.959" stopTime="2945.428">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It’s enough to satisfy the federal law if you grant the fair hearing after the determination of benefits?
speaker="elizabeth_palmer" startTime="2945.428" stopTime="2946.700">
    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    That is correct, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2946.700" stopTime="2959.274">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But, at the same time, I suppose the federal law would continue to support the state program if the state didn’t terminate pending the--
speaker="elizabeth_palmer" startTime="2959.274" stopTime="2963.353">
    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    That is true, Your Honor. 
    The option is there for the state.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2963.353" stopTime="2980.732">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    If California wanted to, after the informal conference where termination was decided on, if California wanted to continue benefits pending a full trial type hearing, the federal government would contribute?
speaker="elizabeth_palmer" startTime="2980.732" stopTime="2982.056">
    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    That is correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2982.056" stopTime="2987.035">

    But, also, if California doesn’t want to do that, which it doesn’t, the federal law--

    That is the auction of the state.

    So, under the federal statute, the federal authorities construe the fair hearing provision, I take it, to be satisfied by California system?
speaker="elizabeth_palmer" startTime="3000.732" stopTime="3009.440">
    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    Yes, that is correct, Your Honor, and the brief of the Solicitor General confirms that.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mrs. Palmer, as I understand it, the state’s position is that what is now provided before actual termination satisfies due process?

    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    That- yes, Your Honor. 
    That was admitted at the very early stages, and that is why the appellee promulgated these regulations to strengthen the procedure.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That being so, I gather the issue for us, if that concession states constitutionally the requirement is simply whether what you do provide does satisfy the constitutional conflict--
speaker="elizabeth_palmer" startTime="3074.733" stopTime="3108.761">
    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    That is the conflict. 
    It’s really, do we satisfy due process with the procedure we have? 
    And, may I point out to the Court that, in many instances, Court judgments are based on just affidavits. 
    That, preliminary injunctions, temporary restraining orders, arrest warrants, and so on are just affidavits and this is more than just affidavits.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3108.761" stopTime="3118.640">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mrs. Palmer, I draw that if the recipient says “I need more than these three days to get these affidavits,” they would give them that extra time?

    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    I can’t answer that, Your Honor. I’m sorry.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3121.134" stopTime="3122.422">

    I imagine it would vary, wouldn’t it?
speaker="elizabeth_palmer" startTime="3122.422" stopTime="3123.429">
    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    It would vary.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3123.429" stopTime="3129.118">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But there’s nothing in the matter before us that says it has its way on it. 
    There’s nothing in this record?
speaker="elizabeth_palmer" startTime="3129.118" stopTime="3302.019">
    Ms. Elizabeth Palmer 
    No, there’s nothing in the record about it, and I was interested in counsel stating that the only time they want the full fair hearing prior to termination is when there are “factual conflicts,” I believe was the statement. 
    That isn’t the prior that was asked for. 
    The prior asked for the full fair hearing whenever a county is contemplating suspending, terminating of ai-- or withholding of aid. 
    This was the position that counsel took at the public hearing on the regulation. 
    This was our understanding of counsel’s position. 
    I am surprised that that, apparently, is not their position before this Court. 
    In California, one can file for a fair hearing within any-- within one year. 
    However, Under the Macola order, and you have heard about the Macola order which was a somewhat unusual order, which ordered when the preorder hearing conference to be held, just as I’ve outlined to you. 
    That if the Court-- if the department was satisfied that aid should be terminated, there was-- the recipient was so advised. 
    Then if the recipient requested a fair hearing accompanied by an affidavit which specifically negated the reasons given by the county for ineligibility, then aid must be resumed pending the fair hearing. 
    In the briefs, it’s pointed out that this has not been used very much that-- or not that it has not been used, but it hasn’t crossed state very much, and I contend it’s because it hasn’t been used very much. 
    There were only three restorations of aid from Los Angeles County where there are over half-a-million welfare cases. 
    So, whether this is being one of the most, well-kept secrets, I don’t know, but at least it has not been used. 
    It’s a cumbersome procedure. 
    It’s one that takes quite a bit of county time but, regardless of that, it’s-- it hasn’t created much of a stir. 
    Thank you.
