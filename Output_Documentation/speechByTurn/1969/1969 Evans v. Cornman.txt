    Number 236, Evans against Tillye Cornman and others. 
    Mr. Sweeney, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.

    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    It is not without some regret that the State of Maryland arises this morning as the appellant in this case because we are not without sympathy for the plight in which the appellees have found themselves. 
    They are citizens of the United States of America. 
    They reside within the geographical boundaries of the State of Maryland. 
    They pay certain taxes to the State of Maryland and most understandably, they are desirous of having the right to vote. 
    I might also say that where there’s a matter of personal discretion, for the Attorney General of Maryland before the Governor of Maryland with whom I have discussed this, we, out of sympathy will extend that right to vote to them. 
    But we also submit to the Court, that in a government of laws and not of men, that this question is one that should not and cannot be decided out of sympathy for the plaintiffs or the appellees’ position but it is a question to which the laws of the United States, the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Maryland must be applied and a decision rendered after consideration of those laws. 
    I further suggest to the Court that the opinion of the District Court below, a District Court which we believe is one of the finest District Courts in the United States, notwithstanding its occasional err as in the instant case. 
    That the opinion of the District Court below was decided from an overabundance of sympathy for the plaintiffs and that that opinion, we respectfully submit is mistaken in fact and erroneous in law. 
    At the outset, let me state that appellants and appellees alike concede that the land in question here is that over which the Government of the United States has exclusive legislative jurisdiction. 
    It was not the policy of the State of Maryland in ceding jurisdiction to the federal government on any of the many federal reservations scattered throughout our state to reserve to ourselves concurrent jurisdiction, except that reservation which has become almost standard, the reservation as to serving process. 
    The question as to whether or not a resident of a federal enclave over which the United States exercised exclusive legislative jurisdiction, whether those individuals were entitled to vote was considered by the Court of Appeals of Maryland as recently as 1963 when some residents of the Perry Point Naval Hospital in Cecil County in Maryland applied for the right to register, were refused that right and appealed to the court. 
    In the Court of Appeals decision in that case, Royer versus the Board of Election Supervisors, the Maryland Court of Appeals, carefully considered the long line of cases in which the courts throughout this nation have considered this same question and after consideration of those cases and after review of what we believe to be the pertinent federal law on this question concluded that these individuals residing on these reservations were not in fact residents of the state of Maryland. 
    It appears to us from our study of the law that dating from almost -- from 1811 down to as recently as six months ago in New Mexico, the courts throughout the United States have held that persons residing on federal reservations over which there is exclusive legislative jurisdiction vested in the Congress by virtue of Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution, those persons are not residents of the state. 
    They are not -- do not have the same political right as to the residents of the state which surrounds them and that the sovereignty and the authority and the dominion of those states, of the state surrounding these reservations does not exist over the individuals residing therein. 
    In this long line of cases considered by the courts throughout the country, there are but three representing a minority view or there were but three representing a minority view until the decision of the District Court. 
    Two of those three are not really applicable to the case at hand because one of those involved a state which had reserved to itself concurrent jurisdiction. 
    Another involved a state which -- a state statute and only one, the decision of the -- an Intermediate Court of Appeals in California followed the line of reasoning which was adopted by the District Court in this case. 
    May it please the Court, the arguments which we present today would appear to be, the first arguments addressed to this Court on this specific question, on the question of whether or not the residents of these enclaves must be granted the right to vote. 
    But the question itself is not a question of first impression to this Court. 
    It is not a question of which this Court has not taken notice on prior occasions. 
    Because the Court in surplus trading in 1930, in holding that certain blankets in the hands of a traitor on the federal reservation were not subject to state taxation. 
    This Court, set out at great length in this opinion and adopted, we believe the language of some of the state courts which had held and quoted the language of the state courts which had held that the residents of these federal enclaves were not entitled to vote, to be treated for voting purposes like the citizens of the states surrounding them. 
    The District Court decision from which we have appealed starts out by restating the premise that where the United States exercises this exclusive legislative jurisdiction over land within the state that the persons residing thereon are not, are not residents and need not be granted the vote. 
    Then having, we believe, correctly stated the law, the Court goes on to examine the so-called retrocession statutes, various statutes by which the Congress of the United States, from 1928 on, has purportedly retroceded to the states certain jurisdiction over the inhabitants of these reservations and the Court after review of these statutes then concludes that the United States in fact having retroceded its jurisdiction in what it says is all or substantially all of the important matters of state sovereignty and authority that this jurisdiction is not exclusively federal but is concurrent between the state and the federal government and it being concurrent to state, the District Court said is required to extend that most precious right of all, it says the right to vote to the petitioners. 
    We submit, Your Honor, first of all that an examination of these retrocession statutes will quickly reveal that they do not retrocede to the State of Maryland or to any other state the all or substantially all of the state sovereignty over these areas nor do they give to the state concurrent jurisdiction with the federal government in the important areas of sovereignty. 
    What do they do, quickly stated, one extends to the residents of these enclaves, the benefits and the detriments of the State of Maryland’s wrongful death statute. 
    Another extends to them the benefits and the detriments of our workmen's compensation laws and of our unemployment insurance laws, the two that seem to be a third dealt with the right of the state to tax the lessee’s interest in commercial properties, rented by the Government to entrepreneurs within the reservation. 
    The two retrocession statutes that were --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    How about state income and sales and gasoline taxes?
speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="598.690" stopTime="830.864">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    I was just about to say, Mr. Justice Marshall that two that were of most interest to the District Court were the Buck Act and the Lee Act which gave to the states the right to exact income and sales taxes, that's the Buck Act and the Lea Act which gave to the states the right to levy taxes on motor fuel sold in the enclave. 
    These obviously were of great interest to the District Court and I submit to Your Honors, it is because of the application of the Buck Act and the application of the Lea Act that the District Court reached its conclusion. 
    The Buck Act gave to the State of Maryland the right to levy certain taxes on the residents of these enclaves. 
    It gave the state the right to levy income taxes and it gave the state the right to levy sales and use taxes. 
    Further, the District Court noted that although the State of Maryland has absolutely no jurisdiction of any kind to try one situated in a federal reservation for any crime, any criminal violation of the state law, the District Court noted that the Congress had enacted as long ago as 1825 the Assimilative Crimes Act and the Court says then, this substantially means that the state criminal laws are enforced on the reservation and it was really because of these, because we exact income and sales taxes and because of the Assimilative Crimes Act that I believe the District Court found that we had all or substantially all of the sovereignty over these individuals as we do our residents of the state. 
    And it is in this, Mr. Justice Marshall that we say that the Court has been mistaken in the facts. 
    First of all, I think this Court can take judicial notice of the fact that the income taxes and the sales taxes of any state are levied for the purpose of providing the moneys which are used for such public projects as highways, schools, colleges, libraries and we believe that enacting the Buck Act, giving us the right to impose sales and income taxes on these residents, the Congress of the United States was merely saying to the State of Maryland and to the other states that we recognize that these individuals who were employed by us within the geographical borders of your states are utilizing certain state services and we recognize the inequity of your proving these services for them without any return on your part and so we believe, Your Honors, that the passage of the Buck Act was merely an exercise in congressional equity giving to the state that which the state was already entitled from the services which we supply to the appellees and I might also point out, as the District Court did not, that when the Congress of the United States enacted the Buck Act, they appended to that Act a phrase which said, that nothing contained herein shall be held to have surrendered the exclusive legislative jurisdiction that the Congress of the United States exercises under Article I, Section 8 over the lands here in question. 
    I believe that this, may it please the Court, is strongly persuasive of the fact that the District Court erred when it held to the contrary.

speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="867.444" stopTime="976.524">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    The simple fact that it is unjust and discriminatory to the other citizens of Maryland, those who reside within our geographical borders but off the reservation. 
    It is unjust to them to extend, for us to extend the vote to persons living on the reservation over whom we have absolutely no sovereignty, over whom we have absolutely no authority and no dominion, accepting that authority and sovereignty granted to us which we hold at the sufferance of another sovereign. 
    We can do absolutely nothing on this reservation and that's the interest, the state interest in this question. 
    Are we to be required by the District Court or by the courts of the United States to give the right to vote to people who are completely immune from a state criminal prosecution of any kind while on the land on which they reside? 
    The Assimilative Crimes Act that my brother in his brief says as the District Court, that substantially the same end is achieved, that the federal government, under the Act of 1825 and as amended will enforce on the reservation the laws of the state and we say that there is a material difference between having the laws of the State of Maryland enforced on that reservation by the United States attorney, that first of all, it means that the State of Maryland does not decide whom it shall prosecute. 
    A state prosecuting officer does not decide, shall I now process this case.

    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    In the traditional phrase, thank you for asking that question, Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    We believe that an examination of the laws of Maryland will reveal that there are substantial burdens which are carried by the people of Maryland from which the defendants, from which the appellees are exempted. 
    First of all and this Court will know as students of the law and as men versed in government, that a substantial body of law of every government is contained in the regulations and rules of the governmental agencies aside from that which appears on the statute books. 
    The persons living on federal reservations within the State of Maryland are totally and completely exempt from the regulatory authority of the 220 various agencies, boards and commissions of state government and from an unknown number of county governments in the county or municipal governments in the county in which they are situation. 
    Now, are these mere words or are these matters of substance? 
    Let me, if I may point out several instances which I believe will show that this is a question of substance.

    Mr. Sweeney, you may pick up where you left off.
speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="1108.206" stopTime="1213.009">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    May it please the Court. 
    Just prior to luncheon recess, Mr. Justice Marshall had asked me what authority the state could not exercise over the residents of federal enclaves. 
    Just to hit the highlights of some of that authority, I mentioned that they are completely exempt from the regulatory authority of the 220 odd boards, agencies and commissions of the state and of all similar county agencies which means that for example the State of Maryland is completely without power to enforce within the boundaries of the federal enclave the liquor control statutes of the state or of the county. 
    The State of Maryland is completely without authority to enforce within the confines of the enclave such state health department regulations as those which require compulsory vaccination obviously of paramount concern to the health of all in the vicinity, on or off the enclave. 
    The doctors who practice their profession on the National Institute of Health and the attorneys who practice there are free to do so without being required to subject themselves for licensing or examination by the State Board of Medical Examiners or by the State Board of Law Examiners and are not subject to the authority of the lawyers for example, not subject to the rules and procedure laid down by the Maryland Court of Appeals.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    So there's a lawyer, are there any lawyers on the enclave that is practicing law, just taking drop-in clients from the public --

    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    Yes, they are sir and I mentioned these merely to show that these are the areas over which we have no authority. 
    We have no dominion, not that these specific instances operate to the --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1243.784" stopTime="1261.909">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if it were a crime to practice law without a license in Maryland and someone on the federal enclave was permitted by the federal government to open a law office there and just engage in practice, would you say that Maryland couldn’t stop him?
speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="1261.909" stopTime="1316.149">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    I say this, Mr. Justice White, that there is a total absence of authority for the proposition that the federal government may prosecute on a federal reservation under the Assimilative Crimes Act for violation of a state regulation even with that regulatory measure has criminal sanction attached to it. 
    So in the instance that you gave, perhaps, it would fall within the area of a substantial crime but in the great majority of regulatory measures, even though our statutes might provide that violations of any of the regulations of the Health Department or the Department of Natural Resources amount to a misdemeanor, if it is in fact a regulatory agency and I am citing the interdepartmental report on the status of federal enclaves, there is absolutely no authority for the proposition that the federal government may prosecute under the Assimilative Crimes Act.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1316.149" stopTime="1327.462">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because there are a lot of legislative acts of the legislature of Maryland that have to be obeyed on the enclave?

    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1331.260" stopTime="1336.369">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, so you do have some legislative authority over the residents of the enclave?

    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    Beyond dispute and I think I --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1337.997" stopTime="1354.527">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And quite a few enclaves, as a matter of facts, have quite a few powers over the residents so as a pure thought that you say the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction even though they’ve ceded a good deal of it back to the state?

    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1365.205" stopTime="1372.564">

    How can it be exclusive if several, if substantial blocks of the Maryland laws apply to enclave residents?
speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="1384.843" stopTime="1409.136">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    Because one, Article I, Section 8 says it’s exclusive and two, that which we exercise, we exercise by virtue of the federal congressional enactment. 
    We are exercising their powers and not our own. 
    In that sense, it is not concurrent so it's a question of semantics but the powers we exercise are saved by their sufferance.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1409.136" stopTime="1421.048">

    But when you, now, one passes or amends its murder statutes or its burglary statute or something else, that applies to enclave residents.
speaker="robert_f_sweeney" startTime="1421.048" stopTime="1434.626">
    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    It does, under the Assimilative Crimes Act.

    Then, then we say we will have concurrent jurisdiction, not exclusive but concurrent and if it is in fact, truly concurrent, then I think under the weight of the cases throughout the United States, they would be entitled to the franchise.

    I know of none, Mr. Justice Harlan and it's a point that I wanted to make.

    The people who work at the next laboratory desk next to them, however and who don't have those same quarters live off the reservation and are subject to all of Maryland’s authority and to those, we have freely given every incidence of citizenship. 
    May I say a word about the question of property taxes? 
    Again because the District Court and because this Court obviously is so interested in the question of taxation, that we do not and cannot collect property taxes from these individuals on this. 
    Under no circumstances could we assume the federal government retains title to it.

    Mr. Robert F. Sweeney 
    No, sir.

    But the District Court makes much of the fact that we collect income tax on these residents and if we collect sales tax from it, it says therefore they pay their cost of government and they are in substantially the same position as one who lives off the reservation. 
    They even go on to cite in there that although they don't pay the county taxes which are primarily real estate taxes that the federal government through the impacted areas school assistance program makes up the deficit through impacted area funds.

    The basic issue as focused on very early in the argument by Justice Harlan is the contention of the plaintiffs that the action of the State of Maryland in classifying these plaintiffs as nonresidents of the state constitutes an arbitrary unreasonable classification in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.

    I believe, Your Honor that we can assert our right on both tests and in that connection, I would like to point us that it might be usable for us to focus on the specific facts surrounding the acquisition of exclusive jurisdiction by the United States over the track of an issue here. 
    The track in which we are dealing is a track lying in Montgomery County to which the United States acquired title in the 1930s and then built national institutes of health on them. 
    The plaintiffs in this case moved on to the track in the 1940s, became registered voters, some around 1950 and later. 
    Others moved onto the track in the 1950s. 
    It was only in 1953 that the legislature of the State of Maryland ceded jurisdiction and thus created the exclusive jurisdiction right of the United States to this area under the Forts and Dock-yards Clause of the Constitution.

    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    Constitute? 
    No, certainly not. 
    And that therefore can only be done by asserting a right under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The position of the State of Maryland is basically that we're dealing here with a geographic area which is not part of the State of Maryland, the Doctrine of Extraterritoriality which was first enunciated by the State Courts in the 19th century particularly by Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1841 in the opinion of the Justices and thereafter in Sinks versus Reese, 1869 by the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
    It is very significant to note that at both instances in the case of the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and again the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio, a great deal of emphasis was placed on the fact that the residents of the enclave, as they existed then, had no obligations whatever toward the states in question, Massachusetts and Ohio and both Courts, placed the thrust of the decisions of the decision of both of these Courts was that because there was no obligation owed by an enclave resident to the state, it was for that reason that there was no concurrent or no right arising out of it to vote in that particular state. 
    As the District Court, three-judge court in this particular case pointed out, the situation was abruptly changed when a federal government in the late 1920s and 30s, enacted a series of statues which in effect extended the jurisdiction of the State of Maryland over the enclave and enclave residents for practically all purposes other than criminal jurisdiction and this is really what we are down to. 
    It is only as far as the enforcement of the criminal laws is concerned that there is a continuing, exclusive authority vested in the United States Government for all the rest of it in terms of the daily lives of the residents of the enclaves. 
    We are dealing with people who are in every other way subject to the laws and duties of citizens of Maryland.

    Yes, Mr. Justice Harlan, there has been and it has failed. 
    It also, it was proposed as a provision of the -- proposed new constitution in the State of Maryland voted on in 1968 and the proposed new constitution failed too. 
    I would have to go outside the record.

    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    Why the legislation is not going through.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2664.781" stopTime="2670.446">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But suppose the theory behind that is that their people without a permanent attachment to the State of Maryland?
speaker="richard_schifter" startTime="2670.446" stopTime="2815.946">
    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    Mr. Chief Justice, the issue that I would like to press home here is that that is not the point that we are making. 
    The State of Maryland retains the full power to define residents in terms of the bona fides of a particular persons living in a particular locality. 
    In the case of an Annapolis for example, the State of Maryland could perfectly well hold that a midshipman entering the academy for four years is not a bona fide resident of Maryland. 
    However, a member of the faculty who plans to spend his entire life there and lives on the enclave should be considered a permanent resident of Maryland. 
    The same is true at Fort Meade, somebody who is there on a temporary tour of duty can very well be denied his right to vote but somebody who again is there, as part of the permanent cadre should have a right to vote in the state of Maryland. 
    So the distinction can still be made, the issue that is raised here is whether a person living in a particular locality and planning to live there for the rest of his life should be deprived forever of his right to vote as long as he chooses to live at that particular locality even though he is paying taxes to the state and is as the court below pointed out also subject to the criminal laws of the state through the Assimilative Crimes Act. 
    The only issue, the only point of distinction as I have mentioned before is the point of distinction with regard to the enforcement of the criminal laws and to return to Mr. Justice Harlan's question, I would say that if the state were to provide that residents of the enclaves may not vote for a state’s attorney Montgomery Count, I would say that there would be a rational reason for depriving them of that right to vote because a state's attorney of Montgomery County does indeed have no jurisdiction over the enclave. 
    But every other officer of government for whom these residents may not vote under the theory of the other state, is a person in whom, in whose services have a vital interest.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now, I am not sure I quite understand your statement of fact but the state's attorney is the only officer without at least some if not complete jurisdiction over these would-be voters. 
    Why doesn't he under the Assimilative Crimes Act, he does not --
speaker="richard_schifter" startTime="2832.093" stopTime="2832.760">
    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    No he does not.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2832.760" stopTime="2841.653">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I mean if there is a robbery or a murder or a rape or criminal assault and battery, the state substantive law applies out of the Assimilative Crimes Act?
speaker="richard_schifter" startTime="2841.653" stopTime="2844.836">
    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    It does but it is enforced by the U.S. Attorney in the federal courts.

    Not in Assimilative Crimes Act.

speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2853.503" stopTime="2871.730">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I'm just wondering whether you're giving away too much. 
    Who enforces the income tax violation criminal? 
    If somebody on the enclaves refused to pay his taxes, estate taxes, who enforces that?
speaker="richard_schifter" startTime="2871.730" stopTime="2878.510">
    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    I assume that this would be done as far as the civil action is concerned.

    Criminal action. 
    Is it a crime in Maryland not to pay income tax?

    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    I suppose it is a crime to falsify your return, Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    The enforcement I would assume would still be vested in the U.S. Attorney.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2900.395" stopTime="2901.974">

    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    Yes, I cannot find any way out of that. 
    The states attorney just has no jurisdiction. 
    The U.S. Attorney would have to proceed in terms of enforcing the criminal laws of the state under the Assimilative Crimes Act.

    Do you have many people living --

    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    I assume we do not and the point is that in case of military personnel, the issue arises much less because they vote back home in their permanent place of residence. 
    In this particular case, we are dealing with a group of people who have made their home there for decades and who plan to stay there for good.

    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    I am not sure Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I suppose they do.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2978.297" stopTime="2989.009">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But there are a number of residences around the hospital. 
    But I do not know whether the hospices or their doctors. 
    I understand they live outside.
speaker="richard_schifter" startTime="2989.009" stopTime="3075.275">
    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    I suppose some live there and others may live in homes on the reservation off the enclave. 
    With regard to the basic question of whether the absence of criminal jurisdiction can deprive a voter or a resident of a particular locality of the right to vote as to place of residence, I would like to direct the attention of the Court to the analogy in the cases involving American Indians who though they live in Indian reservations are and are not under the criminal jurisdiction of the states in most instances, do have the right to vote under the various decisions of the State Supreme Court since 1948. 
    We have referred in our brief to the decisions both in Arizona and New Mexico on this particular question. 
    The issue in that instance is the same one that arises here that in the absence of criminal jurisdiction of a state over the people living on the reservation, the right to vote can nevertheless not be denied.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if someone opens up a liquor store on the enclave without complying with Maryland's laws for running retail liquor stores. 
    Can those who enforce those laws come and seize the liquor, perhaps the state's attorney couldn't prosecute you say but could they come on and close up the store? 
    Padlock it and seize the liquor?
speaker="richard_schifter" startTime="3099.073" stopTime="3104.054">
    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    I assume Mr. Justice White, they cannot.

    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Richard Schifter

    Well, could they come and serve warrants?

    Yes, they can. 
    Since the very beginning of the experience under the Forts and Dock-yard Clause, an exemption has always been written into--

    Mr. Richard Schifter 
    I suppose that we are dealing in that particular situation with a no man's land, will be very well be true. 
    Some of -- we have point out that in terms of the real factors involving people's lives, on a day to day basis, we're dealing here fundamentally with the point that the residents of enclaves pay the taxes that all other residents of Maryland similarly situated pay and are subject to the same laws that other residents of the State of Maryland are in terms of again, the daily life that the average resident of any part of the United States participates in. 
    The only opportunity that these people have to vote is to vote as residents of the enclave. 
    If they are deprived of the opportunity of voting on the enclave, they are totally deprived of the opportunity of voting anywhere.
