    Sullivan against Little Hunting Park Incorporated. 
    Mr. Brown, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="14.829" stopTime="421.058">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is before the Court for the second time having been here previously on order of this Court granting a petition for writ of certiorari at the same. 
    At same time is which the Court vacated the judgment of Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals and remanded the proceeding to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of the case of Jones against Alfred H. Mayer Company. 
    That was in the 1967 term of the Court. 
    Last year, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals after we seek of this Court's mandate refused to accept the remand to reconsider the case in light of the Mayer case and issued an opinion indicating that it would not take the case back for the same reason that it refuse to entertain the appeals on the first occasion. 
    The reason stated being petitioners alleged failure to comply with certain procedural rule of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. 
    The Court indicated that it did not had jurisdiction over the proceeding in the first instance and that therefore did not have jurisdiction to accept the remand. 
    We petition for certiorari and the Court -- the case is now here again on the Court's granting of this second petition. 
    By granting the first petition for certiorari, the Court impliedly held that the nonfederal ground of decision for the State Court with the nonfederal ground upon which the State Court decided the case was inadequate to support the judgment and that the federal question should therefore be examined. 
    The State Court by failing to accept the remand, by failing to comply with this Court's mandate, we submit has fail to observe its responsibilities under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. 
    We are now before the Court with the case on the merits. 
    The case -- the principal issues in the case concern the matter of whether a community recreation association may engage in racially discriminatory policies and practices within the -- under the proscriptions contained of the 1866 -- Civil Rights Act of 1866 which this Court construed in Jones against Alfred Mayer Company. 
    And whether also those racially discriminatory practices are banned or prohibited by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The second question -- major question that is, is whether a party was a member of this local recreation association and dissents from its policies may consonant with the protections afforded by the 1866 law in the Constitution be expelled for his dissent. 
    Briefly, the facts are that Little Hunting Park Incorporated is a nonstop corporation organized under the Virginia law for the purpose of providing a community recreation facility. 
    It has a swimming pool, tennis courts and a park and picnic area. 
    The bylaws has provide that its facilities are available and membership is available to anyone living within prescribed neighborhood, a prescribed geographic area consisting of four real estate subdivisions plus such adjacent areas or additional areas as the Board of Directors might decide. 
    The membership in the association is obtained by the purchase or assignment of shares. 
    Shares maybe purchase for a sum of money and they may also be obtained upon assignment from landlord to tenant, these are provisions of the bylaws. 
    There is a limit of 600 shares in the association and the record shows that in the history of this association's existence namely from 1955 to 1965 -- excuse me, 1965 to 1966 when the trial was held. 
    Shares had been uniformly permitted that is assignment and transfer of shares have been uniformly permitted by the Board of Directors of the association all such purchases and assignments of shares being subject to approval. 
    The only occasion for an the assignment or refusal to permit an assignment having occurred at the time of the incidents which are alleged to herein to be the basis for this action namely the refusal to permit the assignment from the one pool of Sullivan, to Dr. Theodore Freeman because of the latter's race -- the -- Dr. Freeman being a Negro. 
    The situation involving these two parties came about as follows: Mr. Sullivan, a white man had owned property in the neighborhood covered by the bylaws of the association and in 1955 or 1954 when the association have been formed had purchased a share which he used so long as he live in a house on Condor Road in Fairfax County, Virginia. 
    He, after 11 years, moved to another house as part of the purchase price of the second house purchased a second share in the association. 
    In the meantime, he continued to rent the first property and as part of the lease made a practice of assigning the share in the association that he'd purchased as to accompany the first piece of property of the first house. 
    So, Mr. Sullivan owned two shares, he owned two houses, the first house he rented out. 
    In 1965, rented the first house to Dr. Freeman and as part of the lease provided for the assignment of the share in the association it went along with that property.

    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    No, this was not, he would have three prior tenants and on one and he had made a practice of assigning the swimming -- or the association membership share and at least the record shows that share has always been -- the assignments had always been approved by the Board of Directors.

    Yes. 
    The -- what happened here was that the -- when Mr. Sullivan submitted the application for assignment of this share to the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors of the association disapproved it for the reason that Dr. Freeman and his family were negroes.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is there any claim now there was any reason other than the fact that the applicant was a Negro that the membership --
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="492.656" stopTime="736.144">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    So far as I know, there is no such claim sir. 
    There was a suggestion of this raised in the opposition to the first petition for certiorari or maybe it was a second petition and we filed a responds to that pointing out the point -- the place is in the record showing conclusively that race was the reason for the disapproval of the membership assignment and the issue has not been raised now in respondent's brief. 
    As a result of Mr. Sullivan's disappointment with the failure of the association Board of Directors to approve this assignment to Dr. Freeman, Mr. Sullivan sought to find out why the assignment had not been approved and he sought to within the association work out means within the neighborhood where this had occurred, he sought to bring about a reversal of the -- what he thought to be a discriminatory refusal to approve this assignment. 
    As a result of his activities with among, both within the association and among persons in the neighborhood such as leaders in the church, other community leaders, the association Board of Directors expelled Mr. Sullivan. 
    The two actions here seek: one, relief Mr. Sullivan, we seek his reinstatement into the association and damages for the injury that he has suffered by as a result of the expulsion; and secondly, we seek a -- damages for Dr. Freeman. 
    Dr. Freeman is no longer in the county, is no longer in the neighborhood, no longer lives in the neighborhood served by the association and although an injunctive remedy maybe a future value to him that it is of no immediate value because he doesn't live there and we seek damages on his behalf for the discrimination that he suffered. 
    We think there is little doubt but what the 1866 Civil Rights Act which this Court construed in Jones against Mayer applies to this, to the facts of this case that the provisions of law involved are contained presently in 42 U.S.C Sections 1981 and 1982. 
    The Section 1981 grants Negroes the same rights as white persons to make an enforce contracts. 
    Section 1982, provide Negroes -- grants Negroes the same right as white persons to inherit purchase and lease, real and personal property. 
    The -- we have shown, the record shows that the -- both of these provisions of the law are relevant here. 
    There was a contract between Mr. Sullivan and Dr. Freeman which provided for the assignment of the share involved and the Board of Directors of the association refused to permit the consummation of that -- or the performance of that contract because of the race of Dr. Freeman. 
    The -- so that would make Section 1981 applicable on its face, Section 1982 of 42 U.S.C. we believe is applicable under the -- by virtue of the fact that the shares of the membership share here is a personal property and the membership share also constitutes and membership in the association constitutes an incident of the real property and it indeed it was a part of the lease hold interest that Dr. Freeman obtained from Mr. Sullivan.

    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    A part of the effective date --
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="751.475" stopTime="1146.322">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    Well, I'm not certain to that if -- I just don't know the answer sir. 
    When we started this action because this Court had not yet construed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, we press in addition a constitutional basis for our case. 
    Under this Court's decision in Evans versus Newton, we felt that this association perform the same function as Bakers Field Park which was at issue in the Evans against Newton case namely that it was a public facility which provided public recreation and that it had all of the attributes of a public facility of the sort that were at issue in Evans against Newton. 
    We still would continue to press this as an alternative ground for a decision. 
    As far as Dr. Freeman is concerned, we think that both the 1866 law and constitutional provisions warrant his obtaining relief. 
    As far as Mr. Sullivan is concerned, the record shows that he was expelled from this association essentially for dissenting from its racially discriminatory policy. 
    He, under the law, was required to deal with Dr. Freeman on a nondiscriminatory basis. 
    When he sought to do so, his action was frustrated, it was thwarted and when he sought to reverse the action of the Board of Directors and engaged in legitimate means of dissent or legitimate means to try and reverse the Board of Directors' action, he was expelled, he was punished, the action was retaliatory, it was by way of reprisal and we indeed feel that this action may not be permitted to stand under relevant authorities. 
    The case that's most analogous is that of Barrows versus Jackson, which is discussed in our brief and in the amicus brief of the United States. 
    There, you will recall that a party who had failed to comply with a discriminatory racial covenant was sued for damages and this Court held that he could rely on -- that he could defend by relying on the constitutional right of the Negro who was involved that the law protected him in those circumstances. 
    We think that the circumstances here are certainly analogous. 
    The -- we have reviewed in our brief the various charges that were brought against Mr. Sullivan as the alleged basis for his discharge -- excuse me, the alleged basis for his expulsion. 
    We have demonstrated, I believe, that his expulsion was that there were whole series of charges that were brought against him that were in the nature of exaggerations and some instances alleged outright falsehood. 
    All of which served the purpose of which serves the pretext for the -- to mask the hostility that the, and resentment that the directors of this association felt against him first for creating this controversy by attempting to assign his membership to a Negro and then by not accepting the decision which they had made to deny the negro of the assignment. 
    The -- an important aspect of the case which I've not cared to over look and I'd like to deal with for moment if I may, concerns the matter of damages. 
    In a supplemental brief that we filed, we attempted to response to the point which the Government had made in its amicus curiae brief namely that the plaintiffs here may not be entitled to punitive damages because the Acts involved occurred before this Court had construed the 1866 law in Jones against Mayer. 
    We, I think, have responded to that in a sense of showing that punitive damages are not foreclosed merely because the action took what the acts took place before the resurrection of the 1866 law. 
    The point I would like to make is this and I did not cover this in our brief because, frankly, the -- what I am about to say had not quite jelled in my mind at the time I wrote the supplemental brief. 
    And that is that we feel that there is a right established on this record by both parties to compensatory damages for the injuries that they have suffered. 
    We think also that they are both entitled to punitive damages and we think that this is an important part of the case primarily in the case of Dr. Freeman because he is not in this country any longer.He is how with the United States Embassy in Tokyo. 
    The question of punitive damages, I think, as far as Mr. Sullivan is concerned is quite well shown or exploited in our brief and we showed it on the record. 
    His expulsion from the association was motivated by attitudes of hostility, resentment, a desire to act if by way of reprisal against him because of what he had done. 
    These are the elements of malice or these are the elements that constitute malice and which are basis for assessing punitive damages as far as Mr. Sullivan is concerned.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1146.322" stopTime="1156.289">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In Jones against Mayer, as I remember it, we didn't even decide that compensatory damages were available, is that correct?
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="1156.289" stopTime="1157.624">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    That's correct sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1157.624" stopTime="1159.209">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Didn't we leave that question undecided of explicitly?
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="1159.209" stopTime="1380.515">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    We left the question undecided, sir and there's -- I must say there's a somewhat, with all due respect, there is somewhat a footnote in that case, it's little hard to understand. 
    But, in which it suggested that the parties may not have on those pleadings made that a case warranting punitive damages. 
    Now, we when we ask for punitive, we've have asked for compensatory and punitive damages all the way along here. 
    And the thing that I want to indicate is that in the case of Dr. Freeman, there are no facts it might appear from the record which would warrant punitive damages. 
    But I would submit that he was the victim of racial discrimination and that racial discrimination as a matter of law warrants the imposition of punitive damages. 
    Race discrimination is unjustified, race discriminations cannot be rationalize to the law. 
    Race discrimination is based on hatred, prejudice, bias, it has no justification as it comes a matter of the employing malice. 
    There's malice in law, there is implied malice. 
    These are recognized in other fields of the law and we submit that when a person is the victim of racial discrimination, there is implied malice and that punitive damages are warranted. 
    We feel that it's particularly important here to -- in this respect and that is to achieve the full effectiveness of this 1866 Act that the Court would be well warranted in giving meaning to this concept of punitive damages. 
    There is indiligence to it the Court said that where suddenly protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that the Courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant necessary relief. 
    Now, this case is probably one of the last perhaps sometime that will come before the Court involving this 1866 Act. 
    In order to give full effect to this law, we submit that punitive damages should be awarded and should be recognized as a valid remedy. 
    The 1964 Civil Rights Act, the public accommodation provisions of it have no damages remedy attached. 
    There is only injunctive relief that is allowed. 
    Since, if damages are allotted at all here, it seems to me, that it would be appropriate for the Court to spell out both the right of a party to obtain both the compensatory and punitive damages and as I say where punitive -- where discrimination against the Negro occurs for no other reason than his race or color punitive damage, it's an inherently malicious act, inherently malicious and punitive damages should be awarded. 
    Here, it's particularly appropriate, you know, because the Court -- the Board of Directors of this association refused repeatedly to ever meet Dr. Freeman. 
    Dr. Freeman was an eminently qualified individual. 
    He has a PhD degree from the University of Wisconsin. 
    He's an agricultural economist. 
    He's a captain in the District Columbia National Guard. 
    He had eminent qualifications, they never met him, they didn't want to meet him. 
    They knew he was black and that was enough. 
    That is malice in law and warrants punitive damages. 
    Thank you.

    May it please the Court. 
    The rules of procedure in the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals required that counsel must serve the transcript on the serve and notice on the opposing counsel as to the tendering of transcript and give him a reasonable opportunity to examine it. 
    And on the basis of the failure in this particular case for counsel to serve need with an adequate notice, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia refuse to hear this appeal. 
    Now, they based it on the case of Snead versus Commonwealth which was a criminal case in 1959. 
    Snead's counsel presented the transcript 30 minutes before -- to the counsel, before he submitted to the judge for certification and on the basis of this, the Virginia Court said that 30 minutes was not reasonable and therefore since it was not reasonable and the requirement was jurisdictional. 
    Therefore, they would not hear Mr. Snead's appeal. 
    Mr. Snead served his five years in penitentiary.

    Mr. John Charles Harris 
    Again, that my argument here is not whether I've been hurt or not but whether the Court of Appeals of Virginia is right in saying that this notice must be given and its jurisdictional that notice must be given beforehand.

    Mind if I read this in it correctly.
speaker="john_charles_harris" startTime="2033.396" stopTime="2248.672">
    Mr. John Charles Harris 
    Alright, going on to the 1866, Title 1982, I consider these all part of Title 42 and I think that if we are going to look at Section 1982 of Title 42, we must look at in under the doctrine of pari materia or construing all statutes on the same subject together. 
    We must look at the rest of Title 42 including that Section which is known as a Public Accommodations Law. 
    And this provides that all persons shall be entitled to the use of facilities. 
    Provided those facilities are Interstate Commerce, the segregation in those facilities are enforced by the State, State action. 
    And also it excludes from the operation of Public Accommodations Law any establishment which is not in fact open to the public, also it excludes clubs. 
    Now, in the transcript is a rather extensive coverage of the security that was available at this particular establishment to keep people out. 
    And the thing was not in fact open to the public, it was not -- there was no support of segregation by the State. 
    In fact, the defendants, the respondents in this case are very reluctantly before this Court, they were brought into Court. 
    They didn't ask State to enforce segregation. 
    In addition, we contend that Little Hunting Park is a club. 
    Now, if we're contending it as a club, we have to know what a club means. 
    Webster defines a club as an association of persons for some common object, specially one jointly supported meaning periodically. 
    Now, I refer to Black maybe for legal definition and Black says a word, club has no very definite meaning. 
    Clubs are formed for also its purposes and there was no uniformity in their constitution and rules. 
    It is well known that clubs exist which limit the number of their members and select them with great care which own considerable property in common and in which the furnishing of food and drink to the members for money is not but one of the many conveniences with the members -- which the members enjoy. 
    Now, Little Hunting Park started out as a group of people buying land and putting up tennis courts, a building, swimming pool for their own purpose and those that they elected to join them. 
    They provided in their bylaws, they setup a secured charter from the State of Virginia. 
    And in this charter, they use the word community and this is a basis of the petitioner's case as a fact for the use of word “community.” 
    And looking at Webster's definition of community, community as we think of now the community meaning a public that was a second definition, the community is a community of interest. 
    At the same time they drafted bylaws and the bylaws say that they are operating only for their members. 
    And if they're operating only for the members that cannot be open to the public or it cannot be a community organization.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2248.672" stopTime="2262.377">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Did not this club at some subsequent time permit the shares to the treated at least as an incident of a lease hold?
speaker="john_charles_harris" startTime="2262.377" stopTime="2311.727">
    Mr. John Charles Harris 
    No, the provision in the bylaws is this, that an owner and I presume this is because of the many military in the area who were transferred.The owner may assign temporarily subject to the approval of the Board of Directors his privileges not his membership, but his privileges. 
    He may allow the facilities to be use by his tenant subject to the approval of Board of Directors and this is what happened in particular case here. 
    We have that Mr. Sullivan who owned a membership in the particular club moot and when moved to other house, he bought another membership and assigned them at the privileges of his membership to his tenant or attempted to assign that the privileges of membership to his tenants in the first house.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2311.727" stopTime="2315.707">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, (Voice Overlap) he had done that three times before, hadn't he?
speaker="john_charles_harris" startTime="2315.707" stopTime="2337.113">
    Mr. John Charles Harris 
    Yes, but the record will show that not only one of three -- two times before I understand, only one time that he transferred the privileges. 
    And again he went to the procedure applying to the Board of Directors and asking the Board of Directors, will you prove my tenant for the use of the facilities of this membership and they did. 
    They allowed him to assign his membership.

    No, no.

    In this particular case, these people who find and again this is in the record, they find that their membership is dropping. 
    As their membership drops, they must increase to do, as they increase the do, the membership drops further.

    Mr. Freeman is not looking for any admission to this club, he is looking for damages and if he is not entitle to damages, then the question is moot and this Court should not consider moot question, so I understand. 
    But if the only way he can get in my opinion, the only he can get damages is under 1982. 
    And if 1982 as Jones versus Mayer does not allow damages then the question is moot as far as criminal is concern.

    There have been cases from other Civil Rights that damages had been awarded by this Court.

    Submit them all right with one.
speaker="john_charles_harris" startTime="3122.503" stopTime="3226.774">
    Mr. John Charles Harris 
    Under the public accommodation section and which is Title 42 which is included -- includes 1982. 
    In there and of course Mr. Brown is just admitted that there is no damages under the public accommodations law. 
    It's strictly consolatory and there is a provision for referral to a mediation service, but there is no damages under the public accommodations law except for the granting of counsel fees. 
    Now, there's also an error, it says but this shown, I preclude the assertion of any other federal State law or federal or State law not inconsistent. 
    And if we look at the Charlotte v. (Inaudible), we'll see that the natural application was an assault with a rule that there was no provisions -- no damages under the public accommodations law. 
    But in a case of an assault in connection with the discrimination, you could sue for damages on assault. 
    So in my opinion, there is no provision for damages under 1982 or under the Public Accommodation Section to the Civil Rights Act and this is what you're talking about. 
    They are not really talking about land because if they're talking about the Fourteenth Amendment and then unlawful restriction on land, then we did not enlist the aid of the State Court to enforce of restrictive covenant. 
    They are suing us. 
    This does mean that all you have to do to bring the Fourteenth Amendment down to individuals is the file suit against that individual. 
    And the Barrows versus Jackson case, it was a question of the Court coming in, calling on the Court to a system to take damages against someone who violate and restricted of covenant.

    You'd have to have your Bridge Club in here and a reason for -- the reason why we don't have more people in the District of Columbia or even in Arlington is because of the fact that it's further away, it's to far to travel.

    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    Yes sir, pages 125 to 126, I believe. 
    It's on page seven of the brief, on the record citations --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3474.713" stopTime="3476.368">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Has there ever been any rejections?
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="3476.368" stopTime="3486.998">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    Only the -- the record only suggest as Mr. Harris indicated that there was one possible rejection at one time because there is no indication of the record is why that rejection occurred.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3486.998" stopTime="3492.635">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you agree with him that people who are not residents of these specified areas may apply for membership?
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="3492.635" stopTime="3596.975">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    There is some evidence in the record, yes that people who do not belong why residence in those areas may apply. 
    Because there is this clause which provides that the area maybe it's sort of elastic. 
    It can be extended by the Board of Directors, but I would point out that these considerations are not really controlling, that is the elasticity of the boundaries. 
    I mean under Section 1981 and 1982 of 42 U.S.C, the question is, do we have the incidents of a contract present in this case? 
    Do we have the incidents or either personal land or real property? 
    And the fact that it may or may not be an incident of real property alone is not the controlling question. 
    I would like to mention one other thing or two or three other things rather. 
    One thing Mr. Harris suggested that if damages are not allowed, Dr. Freeman, the case becomes moot because he is not entitled with injunctive relief. 
    We do not believe that is so, Dr. Freeman is for example here in the foreign service of the United States. 
    He can return to this area at any time and he should be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent future recurrence of the discrimination if he should move back into one of the house for example that he lived in for or some other house within the subdivision neighborhood served by this association. 
    Now, one very important --

    May I ask you a question, I don't hink on the merits, but how far is this club of Hunting town?
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="3604.126" stopTime="3636.513">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    It's about four miles south of there -- sir about three or four mile south near Fort Hunt Road and it's about half way between Hunting Towers and Mt. Vernon off of Fort Hunt Road. 
    And it's in the area that is surrounded by residential areas except on one side, it's contiguous to a school yard. 
    The Bucknell elementary school, a public school is contiguous on one side of this property.

    Before we get away from that procedural point, could you tell me this. 
    What is the scope of our review of the action of a State Court in interpreting its own jurisdiction, do we for example may we reverse if we simply disagree with it, would have arrive to the different decision or is there higher standard that must be met?
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="3669.168" stopTime="3705.164">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    Well, the question I think as I would read the decisions is whether the State Court denied the appeals in this case on arbitrary grounds. 
    If it was acted arbitrarily and unreasonably not just did it misinterpreted its own rule. 
    I think, I maybe wrong on this, but as I understand that the Court will inquire into the reasonableness of the interpretation that the State Court has given to state procedure. 
    And we believe --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3705.164" stopTime="3713.066">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But the consequences if we don't agree for the State Court what we would say is, this not an adequate state ground and we didn't get to the merits here.
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="3713.066" stopTime="3713.760">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    Correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3713.760" stopTime="3715.317">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    They would be remand it.
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="3715.317" stopTime="3791.758">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    That's right, that's correct. 
    Absolutely, that you would decide the case on the merits here that a very -- there are number of cases that we have cited in our brief on this issue. 
    Now, the one thing that we feel it is particularly important and that is that the case is not be remanded at the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals because they have already ruled that they don't have jurisdiction in the case. 
    And we have pointed out for example the case in our brief, the case of Naim v. Naim which should involve a test that the Virginia anti-miscegenation laws where the Virginia Supreme Court under the circumstances quite comparable to this refuse to accept the remand, completely frustrated that this Court's mandate by failing to provide the kind of relief to the Court had directed it to provide. 
    So, we submit that this case should be treated as one being on a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Fairfax County and that it should returned to the Circuit Court of Fairfax County for entry of a decree as ordered by this Court and for the assessment of damages of that being, that is the only issue and that it should go directly back to the Circuit Court of Fairfax County. 
    Thank you.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    For you to have a decree I understood from your adversary that the Court haven't pass on the merits of the case, is that right or not?
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="3802.812" stopTime="3836.184">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals refuse to accept the appeals and therefore it's no different in a situation where a highest Court in the exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction decides that it won't review the case and that's what the Court did here in effect. 
    So the matter -- there are no further matters for the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to decide once this Court has answered the federal issue is involve, resolved the federal is involved and if that so and then it should remanded to the Circuit Court of Fairfax County.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3836.184" stopTime="3850.658">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia has never touched the merits. 
    Let's assume hypothetically that it was remanded there and they heard the case and decided with you on the merits, you should have all you wanted, wouldn't you?
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="3850.658" stopTime="3855.751">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    So, the Court -- you already tried to do that once with all due regard due respect. 
    You (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3855.751" stopTime="3855.906">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, sometimes that --
speaker="allison_w_brown_jr" startTime="3855.906" stopTime="3899.489">
    Ms. Allison W. Brown, Jr. 
    You try that once you told the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to take the case back reconsider it on the merits in the light on Jones versus Alfred H. Mayer Company and that Court refused to comply with this Court's mandate. 
    Now, that there are cases in this Court reported case that would suggest that the appropriate remedy and such an instance would have been for us to apply for a writ of mandamus against the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, we do not do that. 
    We chose this method of seeking review on a writ of certiorari in this Court and have urged in our brief that this Court decide the case on the merits and we think that's way about the appropriate thing to do now. 
    That the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has already violated its responsibilities under the supremacy clause in Constitution.
