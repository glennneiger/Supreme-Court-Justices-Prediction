    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Chandler against the Judicial Council. 
    Good morning, Mr. Kenan, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="28.808" stopTime="113.320">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Thank you sir, may it please the Court. 
    Gentlemen, this is a case that's here on motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of prohibition and/or mandamus in the matter of the Honorable Stephen Chandler, Judge of the Western District of Oklahoma against the Tenth Judicial Council of the United States. 
    I will briefly state the facts in this matter. 
    On December 13, 1965, the Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit entered a -- entered an order, held after a secret meeting at which Judge Chandler was not able to be present, and the order effectively stripped Judge Chandler of all of his powers. 
    He was ordered not to hear any of the cases assigned to him, nor was he to be allowed to hear any further cases that would be filed in his Court. 
    The other judges of his court were ordered to divide Judge Chan -- Judge Chandler's cases among themselves and to enter into a new order of business whereby none of the future cases filed in the court could be assigned to Judge Chandler.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How many judges are there in that district, Mr. Kenan?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="116.493" stopTime="123.638">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Your Honor, I think there's three, maybe four -- four judges. 
    There's also an inactive judge, or there was at the time.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="123.638" stopTime="124.446">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    A senior judge?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="124.446" stopTime="149.989">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Yes, sir. 
    This order was signed by the members of the Judicial Council, not as members of Judicial Council but as circuit judges. 
    It was filed in the Tenth Circuit Court. 
    It was filed in the Western District Court and a Deputy Marshal was ordered to serve it on Judge Chandler.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="149.989" stopTime="156.409">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How do you distinguish -- how do you discern the form in which they act?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="156.409" stopTime="194.828">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Well, sir, the order itself, the signators or the judges who signed it beneath their signators, they said Circuit Judge. 
    This point, Your Honor, I bring up because it does have some bearing upon the jurisdiction of this Court. 
    It does enter into that argument. 
    It does have to do with whether or not these judges were entertaining judicial powers or administrative powers. 
    They were clothing about themselves the powers of the judicial offices, which they held when they signed the order, Circuit Judge, filed at the court and they got a Deputy Marshal to serve it.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="194.828" stopTime="210.164">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, when all the judges -- all of the circuit judges of a given circuit assemble and meet to address themselves to any business other than an en banc hearing, are they not acting as a Judicial Council?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="210.164" stopTime="236.843">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    I don't believe they are, Your Honor. 
    Section 332 of Title 28 provides that a meeting of the Judicial Council shall be called by the Chief Judge at least twice a year. 
    I'm not convinced that the Chief Judge can't call a meeting of the circuit judges for other reasons. 
    If another a judge calls a meeting, is it a proper meeting of the Judicial Council? 
    According to the statute, only the Chief Judge can call it.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="236.843" stopTime="250.863">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But some Judicial Councils meet once a month, sometimes twice a month, sometimes three times a month, depending on the nature and the quantity of the administrative problems they have before them. 
    I'm speaking now of me --
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="250.863" stopTime="251.190">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Yes sir.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="251.190" stopTime="254.930">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- as a counsel, not on a particular case.
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="254.930" stopTime="260.515">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Well sir, the statute provides only that they're required to meet at least twice a year. 
    They can certainly meet more often.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="260.515" stopTime="267.289">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But you would not suggest that other meetings were not meetings of the council if they go beyond two meetings.
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="267.289" stopTime="275.651">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    No sir, I believe that this was a meeting of the Judicial Council. 
    I'm not questioning that. 
    It was the Judicial Council which uttered the order.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="275.651" stopTime="281.606">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Oh, I was confused then by your comment about the signatures that the signed as circuit judges --
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="281.606" stopTime="281.975">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="281.975" stopTime="287.055">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But of course, they hold their place on the council only by virtue of their being the circuit judges, is that not true?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="287.055" stopTime="359.372">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Yes sir, that is true. 
    That is true, Your Honor. 
    I brought this up only for the jurisdictional problems, which I will come to a bit later. 
    This meeting effectively stripped Judge Chandler of all of his judicial powers. 
    There was not a slight semblance of due process at the meeting, he wasn't allowed to be present. 
    He didn't know what the charges were. 
    He wasn't allowed to cross-examine anyone, couldn't have counsel. 
    The order that was entered spoke in rather strange terms about why his cases were being taken away from him. 
    It mentioned the effect on the business of Judge Chandler's Court of his attitude and conduct. 
    It mentioned that he was a party defendant in both civil and criminal litigation and stated that one civil case was still pending and are -- there were also two disqualification proceedings against him. 
    It stated that after a review of the entire situation that Judge Chandler was either unable or unwilling to discharge efficiently the powers of his office, and that was why all of his cases were taken from him.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="359.372" stopTime="367.829">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Kenan, I've seen the order quoted, excerpts from it quoted and described in these various briefs. 
    Do we have a copy of the order?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="367.829" stopTime="602.148">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Yes, sir. 
    It is Exhibit A to the original motion for leave to file that was entered in this case, the first -- the first matter filed. 
    After the -- after the handing down of the order, we filed a motion for leave to file for a writ of mandamus in this Court. 
    We also made application for stay of the Judicial Council's order. 
    A few days later, there appeared, Solicitor General Marshall representing, the Judicial Council and he advised this Court that the order of the Judicial Council was intended to be temporary only, pending prompt further proceedings by the Judicial Council. 
    He stated that a hearing would be held, at which hearing, the Judicial Council would determine what powers to use. 
    Under three sections -- this is very interesting, Your Honors, it was cited not only Section 332, which provides administrative powers we believe for Judicial Councils, but Section 137 which provides a method whereby Judicial Councils can settle disputes among District Judges when they can't decide on how to assign new cases in their Court. 
    But Solicitor General Marshall mentioned that the Judicial Council wanted to consider what use of its power should be made under Section 372 (b), which as the members of this Court know a Section that bears upon the mental fitness of a federal judge. 
    In other words, he was suggesting to this Court that reason existed perhaps for the Judicial Council to certify to the President that Judge Chandler was permanently, mentally disabled. 
    Solicitor General Marshall stated that the order had been issued only to keep Judge Chandler from filling his office while the conduct of his office was thus in question and he stated that the order was interlocutory. 
    That pending a full hearing into the fitness of Judge Chandler, and then the Solicitor General said that he had personally examined files in the Tenth Circuit and here in Washington that it was his conviction, conviction of the matter, warranted careful examination, that it was highly desirable to maintain the status quo and that public confidence in the Federal Judiciary would be inevitably impaired if Judge Chandler were to preside over his court while the question of his fitness to serve was under consideration. 
    Well, we can quite understand why this Court denied the application for stay, based upon this very strong language of the Solicitor General. 
    We can understand it, we -- it happened, anyway, the application for stay was denied. 
    After that was denied, the Judicial Council then did issue a second order. 
    In our opinion, this order did not call for the type of hearing that had been represented to you, gentlemen, by the Judicial Council would be held. 
    Judge Chandler wasn't ordered to come to any hearing. 
    He was notified that a hearing would be held and that if he wanted to appear, he might, and that he could present to the hearing such matters as he deemed desirable. 
    There was no indication of any charges against him. 
    He wasn't ordered. 
    The county was told he could bring counsel if he wanted. 
    Well, Judge Chandler advised both this Court and the Judicial Council that he would not attend such a hearing, that he challenged their jurisdiction to remove cases from him and upon that, the Judicial Council then decided that it would hold a hearing.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="602.148" stopTime="607.218">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What the -- did the second order purport to do with reference to the first?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="607.218" stopTime="648.402">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Well, Your Honor, the second order merely called for the hearing. 
    At the time that Judge Chandler stated that he wouldn't appear at the hearing, then the other District Judges in Judge Chandler's Court then advised Judge Chandler that the original order had ordered them to re-divide all the cases in the court. 
    This Court had denied his application for stay. 
    It appeared that we were in for a long session with respect to this matter. 
    At that point, the district judges advised Judge Chandler that they ought to do something with respect to complying to the first order of the Judicial Council. 
    So the judges --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="648.402" stopTime="658.780">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Does the Council undertake to say that certain members of the Court of Appeals shall not sit in certain cases?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="658.780" stopTime="660.204">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    No sir, it doesn't.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="660.204" stopTime="664.896">

    Is this running just to the -- I know that Judge Chandler is a District Judge.

    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Well, Your Honor, the Judicial Council is given the authority to examine the reports of the administrator of the U.S. Courts and --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="677.362" stopTime="684.742">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    I understand that. 
    I'm just asking as a matter of practice what is it that the Tenth Circuit done with respect to circuit judges?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="684.742" stopTime="690.006">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Well, as a matter of practice, the Judicial Council is the Tenth Circuit and --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    I know, but what have they done as respect to the Circuit? 
    This is pretty wide-roving power, it seems to me. 
    I --
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="695.985" stopTime="703.305">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Well, Your Honor, I don't know what they've done with respect to the rest of the Circuit. 
    I honestly don't, and I just know this one matter.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="703.305" stopTime="721.086">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Section 300, in the last paragraph of Section 332, whether advertently or inadvertently, Congress provided only that district judges shall properly carry into effect all orders of the Judicial Council, it does not mention circuit judges.
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="721.086" stopTime="780.176">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    That's correct, sir. 
    Well, after the District Judges then met to decide upon a new order of business since it appeared that Judge Chandler was going to require some time to settle this matter, Judge Chandler disagreed with the re-division of his standing cases, those already assigned to him among the other judges. 
    And he did agree however that in order to keep this matter going and not to get into a complete brawl with the members of the District Court who were only trying to carry out the orders of the Judicial Council and were going to let Judge Chandler contest them, he agreed that he wouldn't hear any cases assigned, any future cases filed in his court, although he did not believe the Judicial Council had power to take those away from him, but he disagreed with respect to reassigning cases already assigned to him. 
    At that --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="780.176" stopTime="785.119">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I gather that the -- that District Court doesn't operate from a master calendar?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="785.119" stopTime="790.328">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    The -- there is a system whereby the cases are arbitrarily assigned to judges, Your Honor.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="790.328" stopTime="791.075">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    As they're filed?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="791.075" stopTime="792.755">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    As they're filed, yes sir, by law.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="792.755" stopTime="793.947">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And that's criminal or civil?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="793.947" stopTime="975.429">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Yes, sir. 
    After this new division of order was entered into, the Judicial Council then did this next strange thing. 
    It said well, we now have power under Section 137 to allocate cases in this Court because there's a disagreement with respect to the division of cases already on file in Judge Chandler's Court, judge Chandler is disagreeing that these cases can be reassigned. 
    Therefore -- and this was their decision -- we're going to let the present situation stand as to existing cases, but we're going to re-divide the newly filed cases. 
    Well, it didn't make any sense but nevertheless, that's what happened and they superseded, they said, the old order. 
    Well, gentlemen, at this point when the first order was superseded, what we're questioning here today is the first order. 
    There are other facts in this case that go on, which facts have a bearing upon whether or not this Court should exercise its discretion, which the granting of a writ of mandamus always is, because these further facts bear upon the attitude of the Judicial Council and the true spirit in which this punitive order was entered into. 
    These facts can be boiled down basically to one thing. 
    For a couple of years thereafter, the Judicial Council went through an elaborate procedure, designed to create a paper record that they were acting all along to assist Judge Chandler in cleaning up a crowded docket. 
    They got documents from the administrator of the court bearing upon his case load. 
    The facts were from the very beginning Judge Chandler's case load, was a number of cases less than he normally decides in a year. 
    The facts are that when the first order was issued, there was no mention made of a crowded case load. 
    This was an afterthought and it was designed by the Judicial Council to try to detain some kind of firm ground upon which to base their assault on Judge Chandler. 
    Your Honor, we came here and we based the jurisdiction of this case upon the All Writs Act. 
    There is a very excellent inquiry into the jurisdictional problems of this case that the Solicitor General has in his brief, and also the counsel for the respondent. 
    These jurisdictional problems boil down basically to a single question. 
    For instance, both Solicitor General and Mr. Wright do not disagree that the All Writs Act does provide authority for this Court to act. 
    They disagree only on the constitutional ground, whether or not this case is within the appellate powers of this Court and all that question boils down to one point, was the Judicial Council acting as a lower court or an inferior tribunal rather than an administrative agency in this proceeding? 
    Solicitor General Griswold contends that it was.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="975.429" stopTime="976.645">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That it was what?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="976.645" stopTime="979.135">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    That it was acting as a Court, as an inferior court.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="979.135" stopTime="980.529">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Inferior Court?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="980.529" stopTime="1015.659">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Yes sir, when it issued this order, stripping Judge Chandler of his powers. 
    He contends that no matter what their nature, that they were acting as a court would act. 
    Now, Your Honor, I agree that Congress intended that the Judicial Council be an administrative agency. 
    I agree entirely and yet, this council is composed of judges who have judicial power and they acted in a way that judges would act, and I contend that they were acting with the judicial powers of their offices. 
    And I also will say this --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1015.659" stopTime="1026.671">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would you say the same, Mr. Kenan, with respect to the judges sitting on the Judicial Conference of the United States which is also a statutory body?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="1026.671" stopTime="1059.947">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Your Honor, I contend that the Judicial Conference could act in a way in which was an exercise of the judicial powers. 
    For instance, a Judicial Council is given the power to remove a referee in bankruptcy. 
    Now, this is the exercise of judicial powers. 
    It's admitted by Mr. Wright that it's the exercise of judicial powers. 
    This is given to the Judicial Council statutorily, this right. 
    So Congress did give for instance to a Judicial Council at least one specific and explicit instance of the right to exercise judicial powers.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1059.947" stopTime="1062.299">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    No, I was back on the Judicial Council, Your Honor. 
    I don't --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1066.724" stopTime="1076.982">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What is the specific judicial power which has been vested in those terms in the Judicial Council to which you were referring? 
    The council now as (Voice overlap) --
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="1076.982" stopTime="1107.336">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Yes sir, the Council -- the Council by statue of Congress is given the authority when the district judges cannot agree upon the removal of the referee in bankruptcy, to remove the referee in bankruptcy of their Court upon a hearing, and this is provided by Congress. 
    So it shows that in this one statute that the Congress does believe that a Judicial Council can't act with the judicial powers that the judges have.

    By the Court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1215.586" stopTime="1218.000">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that a judicial act when the court appoints him?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="1218.000" stopTime="1497.113">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Yes, sir. 
    I think it is. 
    I think that the court is appointing an officer to perform certain judicial functions. 
    I think the referee performs judicial functions. 
    I think it's a very high honor for -- for a lawyer to be appointed to this. 
    It certainly is in assistance of the judges of the court in their carrying out their judicial functions and I think that when a Judicial Council acts to remove from a judge all of his power to hear and decide cases that now, we have the strongest possible instance when someone is exercising judicial power. 
    Your Honor, the main thing is the -- is this Section 332 which set up Judicial Councils and what it means. 
    And I want to direct this Court's attention to I think the most significant part of this case, and that is, what is the meaning of Section 332 and it is our contention that in 1948 when there was a revision of the Judicial Code that there were important changes made that slipped by the Congress in such a manner that congressional intent could not have been involved and that these changes cannot be the law. 
    The Committee Report in 1948 stated, and it was only eight pages long with a big appendix to -- of the reviser's notes. 
    The Committee Report said, “The reviser's notes are akin to the sections of the revision and explain in detail every change made in the past.” 
    Now, that's the notice given to the Congress. 
    The reviser's notes on Section 332 said, “Changes in phraseology were made,” there were two other remarks, but they don't bear upon this case. 
    Well, Your Honor, if you will compare the 1939 statute, which was the original one, and the 1948 statute, and I have these two statutes laid out side by side on page 13 of my brief. 
    I think that you can see what violence was done to the 1939 statute. 
    Now, the 1939 statute has cohesion and builds logically from first, the calling of council meetings to second, the submission to the meetings of the administrator of the U.S. Court Reports, next, to the taking of action thereon by the council, and finally, notice to the district judges of their duty to promptly carry out the directions of the Council as to the administration of business of their courts. 
    Your Honors, in the 1948 revised version, there's been a lot said about the fact that the word “order” was substituted for the word “directions,” that that's not the principal change that was made. 
    The principal change made is that in the 1948 Act, the Judicial Council was given two sources of authority. 
    In the 1939 Act, it was given a single source of authority. 
    The 1948 Act in the third paragraph, continues as the 1939 Act did, talks about the quarterly reports of the administrator of the Courts and then says, “The Council shall take such action thereon as may be necessary.” 
    There is a source of power for Judicial Councils. 
    Then it breaks a paragraph and it commences with the final paragraph, and it commences with a second source of power, which the 1939 Act didn't have. 
    It says, “Each Judicial Council shall make all necessary orders for the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the Courts within its circuit.” 
    It's got two statements of authority; the 1939 Act had one and now, the sentence about the judges carrying into effect that directions or orders, I don't care what you call it, this Section is put at the bottom after the second source of power of Judicial Councils. 
    Now, there's been a lot said about the powers of Judicial Councils being just about plenary, and I can see why because when this 1948 revision was made, there was slipped into this statute in the revis -- in the revising process, two sources of power for Judicial Councils, and that was not the intent in the 1939 Act.

    And either a senator or a staff member, someone then reached into the 1939 Act and added this modification, which is the last sentence of the 1948 Amendment.

    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Your Honor, my memory may be faulty ,but with all due respect, I do not believe you are correct. 
    The change that was made was made in the House in the 1948 revision, this was a House Bill. 
    The particular statement you're referring to about the Act has not teeth in it occurred in hearings before the Senate in the 1939 enactment. 
    In 1948, the Act originated in the House, was placed on the consent calendar of the House whereby it goes through automatically because the Committee Report says there really aren't any substantive changes made in the old law, and Congressmen are given this very slight notice of this Act is intended to change law and the appendix even said in the House Report that the law wasn't changed --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1615.632" stopTime="1631.533">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, whether it's in the 1939, even though this occurred in the 1939 setting or the 1948 setting, it was in the setting of members of the Senate who have thought the statute had to be strengthened to give bigger authority to the Council. 
    Is that not correct?
speaker="thomas_j_kenan" startTime="1631.533" stopTime="1916.893">
    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Your Honor, I don't know if that was the intention of their questioning. 
    They did ask the question and I don't recall whether it was Chief Justice Groner or someone who -- I don't believe it was him as a matter of fact -- said in their opinion, there were sufficient teeth because if the Judicial Council made a direction that it would be carried out quite naturally and that no further words were needed. 
    I believe that that is the desolation of the 1939 discussion about were teeth needed. 
    I think that people may have been concerned at the time whether or not they could put additional teeth in there if it came to a point of taking a judge's cases away from him. 
    Well, sir, Your Honor, the -- I think the history of the 1939 Act really is a history which shows that what was really intended to be done in 1939 was to set up an administrative procedure for the Courts to take away from the Attorney General the necessity of attending to these details. 
    They provided the administrator of the U.S. Court, a new office and they tied to the Judicial Council the preparation of these -- this data gathering and statistics compiling reports of the administrator of the courts and submitting these to the Councils and the Councils acting thereon, and then issuing directions to the judges who shall carry out the directions, in the words of the statute, as to the administration of the business of their respective courts. 
    I contend that the 1948 revision, because of the Committee Report, which is the true legislative history of any enactment, because of the reviser's notes, the changes in phraseology were made; that's all. 
    I contend the original intention of 1939 controlled and that the two sources of authority for Judicial Councils to act now don't really change what the law is because that wasn't the intention of Congress, Congress didn't intend to change the law. 
    Your Honor, I notice that the Judicial Conference in 1961 issued a report entitled “The Powers and Responsibilities of the Judicial Councils.” 
    This was a very elaborate document. 
    Someone got Chairman Celler to print it as a House document, and it's a fine and elaborate defense of the Judicial Councils. 
    In fact, it even appears to me as its an attempt to take care of any weaknesses in the authority of Judicial Councils. 
    This report immediately focuses on the Ninth -- the first thing it does is talk about the 1948 revision and particularly, the change of word of “directions” to “orders.” 
    Now, that's strengthening word but that isn't a significant thing. 
    Nevertheless, the Judicial Conference says, “The changes are one of form and emphasis rather than substance.” 
    No change in substance has occurred. 
    That was the conclusion of the Judicial Conference in 1961. 
    It's important that that document makes no mention of the fact that the 1948 statute carries two sources of powers for the Judicial Council whereby the 1939 Act only carried one. 
    I submit the -- there's been no change in the -- any intention of Congress. 
    Your Honor, I think that -- I think that there's another issue involved in this case, and that is that taking all the cases from a judge, all the cases, is tantamount to impeachment and I think there's a very serious question here. 
    The Constitution gave the impeachment powers to the House and to the Senate. 
    The Senate shall have the sole power to impeach this -- I mean the House -- the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. 
    I think the history of the Constitution shows that there was no intention to provide any other means for removing a federal judge from the bench. 
    Federal judges were given their offices during good behavior and yet the federalist in its number 78 and 79, devotes itself to proving how important judicial independence is to the rights and liberties of the people, and how the Constitution secures that. 
    It talks about then about the impeachment powers of the House and Senate and says, “This is the only provision on the point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial carrier.”

    Mr. Thomas J. Kenan 
    Your Honor, the order has been superseded because of the continuation of the Council to act and because of the importance to the judiciary of whether they can do this. 
    Since the Judicial Council merely only has to supersede any order when challenged, we think that it is within the discretion of this Court to issue mandamus to the Judicial Council, to order them not to do this anymore and to cease any vestiges of its action against Judge Chandler otherwise, this question can never be litigated, so it meant some importance to the judiciary.

    He may be mentally disabled” and yet, they turned right around thereafter and say, “Well, it's alright for him to hear all the cases assigned to him.” 
    This whole thing, there is one cohesive thing. 
    This has been a struggle between the Judicial Council and Judge Chandler, and has continued down to this moment. 
    And when the Judicial Council offered to the members of Judge Chandler's Court the ability finally to enter into a new order dividing the business of their Court without interference of the Judicial Council, the judges of this Court said, “Under the circumstances, the present order will stand.”

   Argument of Carl L. Shipley
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2781.503" stopTime="2782.737">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Shipley.
speaker="carl_l_shipley" startTime="2782.737" stopTime="3303.341">
    Mr. Carl L. Shipley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    In view of the lineup in which presentations will be made in our time situation, I would like to anticipate some of the argument that the Solicitor General has included in his brief and some of the arguments which are presented by Professor Wright in his brief in this case. 
    I think that in considering the matter, the Court necessarily must bear in mind the long history involving good behavior and the impeachment Sections of the Federal Constitution and major Section 332 of the statute and the action of the Judicial Council in this specific case against that long history. 
    A part of these two briefs to which I refer address themselves to that problem, to the history and we all know that from the time that John Randolph in 1787 made his original resolutions respecting a national judiciary in the Continental Congress. 
    And when Mr. Dickinson moved that the good behavior provision should be modified to follow the British pattern that where a -- and address by the Congress and the Senate to the President might result in the removal of a federal judge, that this was rejected in favor of the independence of the Federal Judiciary. 
    We'd recall that Thomas Jefferson of course strongly supported the idea of total independence, except for impeachment and then, a few years later, we find that he was criticizing the impeachment procedures as not being adequate. 
    And against that background, we have to look at what's happened in this specific case. 
    It can only be characterized as outrageous. 
    There is a chief judge at federal district court who served with honor, with honesty, with efficiency for 26 years, who's been chief judge for 8 years. 
    We know from public documents that are a matter of public record in which in our brief, we've asked this Court to take judicial notice of and which it properly can take judicial notice of -- and which it should take judicial notice of that there's been a long friction in terms of jurisdiction between what the Tenth Judicial Circuit thought it could do honestly, I suppose, in terms of Section 332 and Section 137, Section 372, perhaps Section 371 of Title 28. 
    And this -- a friction has manifested itself ultimately in the final order of the Judicial Council which was not its first order against this judge. 
    In the Solicitor General's brief, there are references to the Occidental Petroleum case and to the Texaco case that referred to the Judicial Council's order, not by name, but simply saying that the judge has been involved in criminal and civil litigation which has had some impact that speak of his attitude and his conduct and the efficiency of the Court without any factual showing as to how these relate in any manner to the difficulties any federal judge has over many years in dealing with complicated cases and complicated litigants. 
    The first question which concerns me against this historical background is the -- the threshold question, as the Solicitor General calls it, of whether this Court has jurisdiction, and which some of the justices have raised. 
    Our position is that the Court does have jurisdiction under Section 1651 of Title 28, that being the All Writs Act, which incorporates as we understand it and as we understand, the Solicitor General understands it. 
    It incorporates the old Sections 13 and 14 of the original Judiciary Act of 1789. 
    And although Judge McGruder and I guess the Josephson case perhaps it suggested that there had been some change by reason of the revision of these older sections into the present Section 1651, the All Writs Act. 
    We agree with the Solicitor General that this Court has jurisdiction by reason of that Act. 
    A second point I think I would touch on briefly is that in our brief, we suggested that the Court had inherent power. 
    And we also mentioned that it would have power under the due process proceed -- provisions of the Constitution to deal with the matter of this extraordinary significance, in this context, in this historical context, and in -- and then the practical immediate context because here, these are live judges operating a very important circuit of where we've had a long running situation that's resulted in an interference by somebody with the operation of that Court. 
    Our position is the Tenth Judicial Council has unconstitutionally not impeached the judge and removed the judge from the office, but they've removed the office from the judge in a kind of reverse English procedure which certainly Congress could not possibly have intended because it would be unconstitutional in our judgment on the face. 
    The provisions of the Federal Constitution relating to this matter are so explicit in setting up a special court in the Senate that requires a two-thirds vote where everybody's on oath and it names who the chief justice and providing officers shall be, and exactly what the procedure shall be in the judicial proceeding to convict somebody. 
    And all of these things we think come within the type of problem, which is contemplated, can be reached under Section 1651 under the extraordinary writs. 
    These are the kind of extraordinary circumstances, the actual Judicial Council here that -- that energize and bring the Section 1651 into play. 
    Now, the inherent powers, we didn't just make up the term. 
    This Tenth Judicial Council and at least three of the cases cited in Solicitor General's brief, and I say the Solicitor General's brief does not touch on this. 
    It makes reference to the fact they never heard of this Court suggesting it had inherent powers. 
    But in the Ritter case cited in the Solicitor General's brief and the Texaco Case and the Occidental Petroleum Case, all three, the court there the Tenth Circuit said, “We're exercising our power under Section 1651 or our inherent appellate jurisdiction.” 
    They didn't care which, and they specifically stated it in all three cases, and that's how they acted to -- to issue extraordinary writs against Judge Chandler in these specific cases, which lie at the base of the existing order which we challenge. 
    Now, the second problem that seems to me that we're concerned with is the Solicitor General, and putting aside Professor Wright's position, that this Court has no jurisdiction, we follow the Solicitor General on that. 
    We think it does, for the reasons he addresses himself to and the reasons I have set forth. 
    The second problem is whether or not, and as I understand the Solicitor General's brief, he says, “Either the case is moot or Judge Chandler is estopped from being here because he has agreed to the present division of business in his Court.” 
    On the question of agreement, we have cited in our brief that this was a kind of a -- this was not the kind of a -- of an agreement that can lead to estoppel, just as it was not the kind of disagreement that would energize Section 137 of Title 28, that is the -- it would energize or activate the statutory authority whereby the Tenth Judicial Council could divide the business of the Court. 
    And on that point, let me say I would not agree that an exercise of Section 137 so extreme that it deprived the judge of all his cases was a constitutional exercise of that authority. 
    I think 137 has to be measured against what they're trying to do, and it cannot be used to deprive a judge of his office any more than Section 332 can. 
    It can be used when it's activated properly by a genuine and bona fide disagreement to divide the business of the Court so we can get on with the judicial business of the nation. 
    Now, with respect to whether or not that first order, the order we challenge, was moot, I simply call the Court's attention to the Grant case we cite and to this Court's more recent case in the American Phosphate Exporters case, which was decided last November which addresses itself to this problem of mootness and I just have a -- just a word --

    If they are to get on with the business of the court, but that in this case, you then raise a question of whether that was the good faith purpose. 
    Are there any findings? 
    Has there been any determination by anyone that we could review to determine whether they were in good faith or in bad faith?

speaker="carl_l_shipley" startTime="3347.692" stopTime="3401.945">
    Mr. Carl L. Shipley 
    I think the Court simply has to look at the record before it. 
    This matter came before this Court on the Tenth Judicial Council's original order of December 13, 1965 where they said, and I quote directly from the order, “In the past four years, the Judicial Council at many meetings has discussed and considered the business of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and has done so with particular regard to the effect thereon of the attitude and conduct.” 
    So these are not words in any statute. 
    They made them up, and they could make up a lot more and any Judicial Council could at this Court authorize this kind of action. 
    The attitude and conduct of Judge Chandler, who as Chief Judge of the district, is primarily responsible for the administration of such business. 
    During that period, Judge Chandler has been a party defendant in both civil and criminal litigation. 
    One civil case is still pending --

speaker="carl_l_shipley" startTime="3405.188" stopTime="3422.020">
    Mr. Carl L. Shipley 
    This is the first order which we challenge and which we say is not moot, and we rely on the American Export case which points out that the mere fact that somebody takes subsequent curative action doesn't remove the question of whether or not --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3422.020" stopTime="3431.472">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I'm still at a loss as to just how or where there is something we could review that would shed any light on the presence or absence of good faith.
speaker="carl_l_shipley" startTime="3431.472" stopTime="3479.803">
    Mr. Carl L. Shipley 
    Well, I think if you'll look at the order itself under Section 332 of the original order, which is not moot when you look at the cases, and which simply stated in terms that the judge was literally, his office was taken away from him then and there, and his cases were to be reassigned. 
    Section 137 had not been energized. 
    They had no authority under Section 137. 
    There was no disagreement as to the assignment of the work. 
    There's no showing there was a backlog. 
    There was no showing the court wasn't operating efficiently. 
    As a matter of fact, the statistics from the office -- the administrative office showed just the opposite. 
    He was doing his work and everybody else was doing theirs. 
    There wasn't the slightest question of the efficiency of that court. 
    The question was just what they said, the attitude and conduct of the judge. 
    They plainly didn't like it. 
    There was no objection from the Bar Association, no objection from litigants, no objection from the lawyers in the town, no objection from anybody, except the Tenth Judicial Council.

    I think the United States itself through the Solicitor General has weapons available, writ of quo warranto. 
    It could follow some of its own suggestions. 
    It could challenge any public officer who wasn't doing his duty in a certain way but it -- I think the Constitution sets up a special court to deal with judges and their tenure and just as the President has four years, a judge is appointed for good behavior. 
    And when that question of good behavior is to be resolved, the Congress itself must do it in a special court provided in the Constitution with a two-thirds vote which no pardon can issue under the Constitution. 
    The President can't pardon the person and he's only removed from his office and if there's a crime or something else involved, then he can be subsequently subjected to double jeopardy, let us say, and prosecuted again.

    Mr. Carl L. Shipley 
    Well, I think we've run out of our time here and I do have some points I want to address myself, too, and I want to know when the time was up for our side in the matter. 
    If the Court please, a very -- another very important question which has come up is -- the Solicitor General I'm sure will address himself to is whether or not Judge Chandler has agreed to the present division of business. 
    And that by this agreement, he's -- although the Solicitor General doesn't knew that he use the term that he's estopped, whether or not by this agreement, it makes the case moot or removes any colors for this Court to get into what the Solicitor General calls the delicate question, Constitutional questions involved in Section 332. 
    We've pointed out in our brief that Judge Chandler's agreement was not a bona fide agreement in the sense that the law would contemplate it that it should be to a estopping from complaining about something to which he had agreed. 
    His agreement was simply, he put right in the letter that he was signing under protest to avoid creating a disagreement and that he would expect to address himself to the constitutionality of the action of the Tenth Judicial Council, as outlined in our brief. 
    I see that my time has come out, and I'll just close on saying this, that I -- we agree with Congressman Celler and other scholars who have said that good behavior, attitude, conduct in these matters are not just issue. 
    They're not questions that can be tried in any place except in the Senate of the United States acting as a Court of impeachment in accordance with the Constitution. 
    And therefore, we would say this Court, in order to clarify the matter, not to avoid what's the delicate problem but to solve what's been 150 years of a complicated problem should speak forthrightly and completely and totally so that the federal judges will know, the Judicial Councils will know exactly where their authority begins and ends under Section 137 and under Section 332, because if this Court says it doesn't have jurisdiction and steps away from this case, it will compound what is a very serious situation which will continue in all the Judicial Circuits. 
    Some of them may run wild. 
    We don't know what will happen, but certainly, these are human beings with the same personality frailties that have given rise to this case and brought all of us here today. 
    Thank you.

    Thank you, Mr. Shipley. 
    Mr. Wright.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="3789.106" stopTime="3908.187">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please in my submission, the part of this case was in the question that Mr. Justice Stewart put to Mr. Kenan when he said, “Would you agree that if the action of the Judicial Council was administrative in nature that this Court is entirely without jurisdiction to review the matter?” 
    And Mr. Kenan answered that question in the affirmative, an answer that I think is compelled by a line of authority going back to Marbury v. Madison, that unless the proceeding that is brought here is a judicial action by an inferior tribunal, but then this Court is being asked to exercise original jurisdiction and that it may do only in cases to which states were parties or ambassadors or consuls are involved. 
    Mr. Kenan having agreed with the basic premise then suggested that in this particular instance, the Judicial Council acted in a judicial fashion, an argument that I must confess I have some difficulty in following. 
    His view as I understand it is that Congress intended to create an administrative agency called the Judicial Council. 
    I agree entirely. 
    It seems that legislative history is clear, that literature is all in one direction on this that no one, so far as prior to the Solicitor General's brief in this case, has ever suggested that a Judicial Council is vested with any part of the judicial power of the United States. 
    That it has always been understood to be merely an administrative agency. 
    Justices Black and Douglas when this case was here before referred to it as a governmental agency with limited administrative power.

    Yes sir. 
    Undoubtedly, the proceeding between Judge Chandler and the Judicial Council, what we are arguing this morning is a case or controversy, though I submit that it is a case or controversy that this Court can't hear because it's not within your original jurisdiction. 
    In my submission, what the Judicial Council did, whether the relevant order be that of December 13, 1965 or as I think February 4, 1966 was not a case or controversy, that it bore none of the earmarks of a judicial determination, that as you've suggested, Mr. Justice Douglas, an administrative action may lead to a case or controversy. 
    Someone may be dissatisfied with what an administrator has done, and then challenge that. 
    But the appropriate place to challenge that is not in the first instance, the Supreme Court of the United States.

    This Court in Booth versus United States suggested that taking away the right to try cases is not removal so long as the office and the salary continue that the -- the taking away of the right to try cases is not barred by the Constitution, it is dictum (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4153.158" stopTime="4157.622">

    You mean this Court has held where it was a point to be decided in a case?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="4157.622" stopTime="4267.819">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    No, it was dictum by Justice Roberts in 291 U.S, but the position that we've take of course is that this Court has no occasion in this proceeding to decide whether impeachment is, as some people believe or as not as others believe, the only way that action can be taken against a federal judge. 
    We think that first, you lack jurisdiction to hear the case altogether, that the petitioner has misconceived the proper forum in which to seek a remedy. 
    And second, we believe that if this Court had jurisdiction but on the merits it could not now reach the Court -- the question of whether or not the order of December 13th was an attempt to remove Judge Chandler, whether it was a proper order that this Court does not issue advisory opinions about things that have long since gone out of existence. 
    That the order is now in effect to those of February 4, 1966 and September, 1967 in which the Judicial Council has provided that Judge Chandler may hear the cases that Judge Chandler certified that he wanted to hear. 
    Under the order of the Judicial Council, anytime the judges of the western district agree on a new division, that will go into effect immediately. 
    If they disagree, they have only to disagree and evoke the statutory power of the Judicial Council and it then resolves the disagreement. 
    The one time there was a disagreement, it resolved to disagreement in the direction that Judge Chandler had asked for rather then the direction the other judges had asked for.

    Well, Professor, what would you say if there was a disagreement and there was a Council order saying that a judge should first clean up all of his cases before he takes any more? 
    That order goes into effect and he does clean up his cases and then he wants a change in the order. 
    The other District Judges don't want any change in the order. 
    So there's a disagreement and the Tenth -- and the Council then says, “We will have the order stand, no more cases.” 
    Is that within the reach of 137?

    I suggest that the Judicial Council has shown no inclination to do -- to take -- to further course of conduct, Justice White that you suggest. 
    The Judicial Council on its own initiative, noting that Judge Chandler had at that time only 12 cases left, suggested to the judges in the western district that they make a new division and the judges reported back and said, “No, the current division is agreeable to us.”

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    It said until further order, and the Council then represented to this Court that it intended to dispose of the matter promptly and I believe that we have to accept what the Council has said at its face value. 
    I think there are even some circumstances in which constitutionally, a Judicial Council or someone other than the Senate may tell a judge that he is not to hear any cases at all in the future. 
    I think that when there is a certification under Section 372 (b) and a new judge is appointed, the judge who is found to be physically and mentally disabled under the statute becomes junior in seniority, but it would be unbelievable that a judge who has been found mentally disabled to act as a judge then be free to hear cases, and I can't conceive that that is what the statute contemplates or that is the practice, or that is what the Constitution would require under those circumstances. 
    But --

    I think our Constitution means a great deal more than that about the independence of judges, Mr. Justice Black, but I think the judicial independence is a -- is a quality that goes far beyond the very limited issues that are here at stake. 
    I think judicial independence means nobody is to tell a judge how he's to decide a case, that he's not to be answerable except to an appellate Court for his views of the law. 
    Judicial independence means this and much else, but I do not think that judicial independence means that a person who has been found by a Judicial Council and by the President of the United States to be mentally unable to function as a judge be permitted to go ahead and function as a judge.

    Assuming that on the time about Judge Chandler, Chandler runs out of business because he sensed that there is a disagreement among the district judges as to whether any more cases should be assigned him. 
    Is there anything to show in this record that the Circuit Council would not step in and break that lock?

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    You think that the order of December 13, 1965 is properly here. 
    As counsel, I disagree but there is a different question, and that is whether anything is properly here, even if the December 13th order was still in full force and effect, and it's an order of the constitutionality of which I think I can safely predict your view on at least that would not -- that would not create original jurisdiction in this Court. 
    Original jurisdiction does not arise out of necessity. 
    It does not arise because something has happened that may be gravely unconstitutional. 
    Original jurisdiction is carefully defined by the Constitution and the -- the best known case that this Court has ever decided so that you simply can't go beyond them. 
    The doctrine in drawing the line between original and appellate jurisdiction has been laid down many times. 
    It bears such famous names as Marshall Story, Tony Brandeis, and that is that this Court can act only if an inferior tribunal has acted judicially, and I submit that whatever the Judicial Council did, right or wrong, the Judicial Council is not a Court and what its action is it's not judicial. 
    It was administrative action. 
    It may have been, as my friends on this side of the table think and its someone outside of the bench think a very terrible thing that the Council did. 
    But administrative agencies on occasion did do terrible things, and that fact of itself is not enough to create original jurisdiction in this Court, nor does it permit this Court to act immediately on the theory that it might come here sometime and therefore, it's potentially within our appellate jurisdiction. 
    The appellate jurisdiction of this Court -- its potential appellate jurisdiction does not begin to exist until the case has reached some judicial tribunal of the United States. 
    Now, I'm aware of course of the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas in Hirota v. MacArthur suggesting a somewhat different view on that and with respect, I disagree.

    First, I would like to correct a possible misunderstanding which results from the way this case was listed in the hearing list by the clerk's office. 
    It is there said that the Solicitor General will appear as a friend of the Court for the respondent. 
    I do not understand that I am appearing for the respondent or for the petitioner and that was the first question.

speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="5345.487" stopTime="5369.737">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Well, but simply as a friend of the Court, I have tried with the aid of my former associate, Philip Lacovara to make a complete on examination of the problems here as we could in an effort to be as helpful to the Court as possible.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="5369.737" stopTime="5373.795">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You are then what we sometimes -- or as sometimes referred to as a true friend of the Court.
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="5373.795" stopTime="5630.337">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    A true -- [Laughter] A true friend of the Court. 
    The first question to which I will address myself is this Court's jurisdiction of this matter. 
    It is plain of course that the Court has jurisdiction only as an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, that this case is here as an original matter. 
    It is obvious that neither the United States nor a state nor a foreign minister or ambassador is a party and there is no basis for original jurisdiction. 
    I may say that when I started consideration of this case, I had the tentative view that there was no jurisdiction here, that this was not an exercise of appellate jurisdiction. 
    That indeed, the argument presented by Professor Wright was the sound analysis. 
    I learned my federal jurisdiction from Professor Frankfurter and I tend to take a rather strict view of these matters and also to regard them as important. 
    But after my associate, who I regret has now left the government service, Mr. Lacovara, presented me an elaborate memorandum on the matter and I discussed it with him at some length. 
    I came to the conclusion that that was probably wrong. 
    I would like to make it plain that I do not regard this as by any means a matter of black and white. 
    It will be clearer after this Court has decided it and it is not. 
    But it does not help it seems to me to say that this is administrative action. 
    That is an example of the tyranny of words because if this is a judicial administration, it may present a situation which is different than anything with which the Court has previously dealt. 
    It is of course clear and accepted in many fields that it is a Constitution we are dealing with and that the understanding of the Constitution grows and develops with the development of problems, and the approach is to problems. 
    It was probably true at an earlier time that we had a very small conception of judicial administration of the function and responsibility of courts in seeing to it that their business is soundly and effectively handled, in addition to the process of the actual decision of the case in court. 
    Over the past generation, there's been a great expansion in the awareness of the importance of the function of the judicial administration, and we have people like Chief Justice Hughes and Chief Justice Groner and Judge Parker and Arthur Vanderbilt and others who were largely responsible for the development of the statutory provisions which now exist, establishing not only the Judicial Conference of the United States which is not involved here in any way whatever, but also the Judicial Councils. 
    Now, the Judicial Council, it is perfectly plain or simply the Courts of Appeals sitting en banc.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Sometimes, not much opportunity for briefing in terms of stay orders and things of that kind which are done by the court. 
    I would like to suggest that in Section 137 of Title 28, the statute now reads that -- this is the last paragraph of Section 137 -- if the district judges in any district are unable to agree upon the adoption of rules or orders for that purpose, it now says the Judicial Council of the Circuit shall make the necessary orders. 
    It would be only a verbal difference if it said the Court of Appeals sitting en banc shall make the necessary orders. 
    And similarly in Section 332, the last paragraph which is at the top of page 4 of my brief, it says, “Each Judicial Council shall make all necessary orders.” 
    And there again, if it said each Court of appeal sitting en banc shall make all necessary orders, it would be exactly what we have here and I find it difficult to see that what is a verbal difference only, having no effect upon either of the persons who participate or the capacity in which they participate, should make this into something which is non-judicial.

speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="5943.356" stopTime="6426.320">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    And I could simply provide him the statute that the Court sitting en banc could be convened by the chief judge for this purpose. 
    It still seems to me that what the court is doing -- what the Judicial Council is doing here is exercising what has come to be recognized not only as judicial power but as an important judicial responsibility to see that the judicial business of the circuit is effectively and expeditiously administered. 
    This was not an accident. 
    It was not an arbitrary action. 
    It grew out of such experiences as those which Chief Justice Taft lived through in the 1920s when there was no such power. 
    And I just happened on a letter written by Chief Justice Taft in the 1920s in Alpheus Mason's biography of Taft. 
    He wrote a letter to a district judge who had not disposed of a case which had been pending before him for four years and he felt that he had to put into that letter the following, and think of this from an ex-president and chief justice of the United States. 
    “Of course, I write this letter with no assumption that I may exercise direct authority over you in the discharge of your duties, but as head of the federal judiciary, I feel I do have to appeal to you in its interest and in the interest of the public whom it is created to serve to end this indefinite situation.” 
    And the objective, the intended objective was to provide a judicial authority within the judiciary, nobody outside, no executive authority, no legislative authority, but the courts were to run their own house or to do it without interference and their representative said that, “Give us the chance. 
    Give us that power and we will take care of it.” 
    Now, it is also clear that they contemplated that it would be -- that it would very rarely be necessary to do anything to enforce it. 
    These are high level people and if it became necessary for the Judicial Council to issue an order, the odds were very strong that it would be complied with however reluctantly. 
    But the statute does expressly give the Judicial Council, which I repeat is the Court of Appeals sitting en banc by another name. 
    It does give them expressly authority to make those orders and it provides that it shall be the duty of the District Judges to carry them out. 
    Such an order was issued in this case. 
    I have no doubt that the constitutional requirement of case or controversy is met here. 
    Chief Judge Chandler sought leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition to review the validity of that order. 
    And though as I've said, it is not fully clear, it does seem to me that that was a judicial order entered by a judicial body in carrying out judicial responsibility and that the review of that order before this Court is an exercise of appellate and not original jurisdiction. 
    Now, I would turn to the question on the merits where I do agree with Professor Wright's position in representation of the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council. 
    In the first place, the only paper before this Court, the only pleading before this Court is Judge Chandler's petition or motion for leave to file and petition for a writ or mandamus, which was filed in January 1966. 
    And in that petition, he prays that a writ or prohibition or a mandamus be issued to restrain the respondent from exceeding its jurisdictional power. 
    In ordering that until its further order, the petitioner shall take no action whatsoever in any case or proceeding now or hereafter pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and that order no longer exists. 
    It was completely superseded on February 4, 1966 in the document which is marked F in the return or response, which has been filed by the Tenth Circuit Judicial Conference. 
    And as far as the record is concerned, since that date, there has been no dispute, no controversy between the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council and Judge Chandler. 
    Now, I think that that can most clearly be shown by examining the item, which is item K in the return of the Tenth Circuit, which is a letter on the stationery of Judge Chandler signed by all five judges of the Western District of Oklahoma, leading off with Stephen J. Chandler as the first signature addressed to the Tenth Circuit Judicial Conference in response to the letter of the Honorable Davis T. Lewis to the active judges of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. 
    In the minutes of the meeting of the Judicial Council attached thereto, “We advise that the current order for the division of business in this district is agreeable under the circumstances.” 
    Now Judge Chandler makes a lot out of that “under the circumstances.” 
    He refers to the fact that his previous letter in February 1966 by which he joined with the other judges in agreement as to the division of the business was under protest. 
    He says that this is under duress. 
    However, it seems to me clear that Judge Chandler cannot have it both ways. 
    He cannot either consent and not consent at the same time. 
    By this letter, he has consented. 
    There is thus no dispute between him and the Tenth Circuit Judicial Conference.

    What would you do with the under the circumstances?

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    I don't know what under the circumstances means there. 
    These are the -- I suppose anyone acts under the circumstances, any appearance or any consent is, but if Judge Chandler does not consent, all he has to do is to say so, in which case, it will become incumbent on the Judicial Council under Section 137 to issue an order for the division of judicial business in the Western District of Oklahoma. 
    And if Judge Chandler doesn't like that order, he can take whatever steps may be appropriate at that time.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, Mr. Solicitor General, what do you think the Judicial Council should do when Judge Chandler is out of business, and his old cases or so called statute that to say he has all business is rather a (Inaudible). 
    Do you think the Judicial Council is entitled to leave its order in effect just because the district judges say it's satisfactory to them?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="6498.336" stopTime="6504.226">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Yes, Mr. Justice, not only entitled but I don't believe they have any power with respect to it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6504.226" stopTime="6511.169">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So two -- three district judges, as long as they all agree, can agree that one judge will never have any more cases?

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    No, Mr. Justice. 
    Only all of the judges of the -- of the Western District of Oklahoma can agree as to --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6518.672" stopTime="6529.488">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that's what I just said. 
    I just said, can all of the judges of a district agree that one judge will never be able to -- will never do any more work?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="6529.488" stopTime="6551.877">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Yes, Mr. Justice, I believe they can, and I believe that if they do, the Judicial Council has no authority with respect to it and if that results in an inappropriate situation, it can be reported to the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives and they can consider whether this is an occasion for impeachment. 
    Now, there may be --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think that --
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="6552.559" stopTime="6553.535">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    -- possibilities under Section --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6553.535" stopTime="6555.851">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think that answer is essential to your case?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="6555.851" stopTime="6618.265">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    No, Mr. Justice. 
    I'm about to qualify it, if I may be allowed to. 
    There may be possibilities under Section 332. 
    I was thinking solely in terms of Section 137, the division of judicial business in the district. 
    There may be circumstances which would be relevant with respect to that under Section 332 under which each judicial council shall make all necessary orders for the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the Courts within its circuit, and I suppose that if the -- all of the District Judges of the Western District of Oklahoma entered an order by which they agreed that no business would be assigned to any of them, that it would certainly be appropriate for the Judicial Council to act under Section 332 and it would then be the statutory duty, as well as the moral duty of the judges to carry out that order.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, the Section -- the situation you pose would arise equally, would it not, if without anything entering any order to that effect, they simply all refuse to do any work.
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="6628.793" stopTime="6630.149">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Yes, Mr. Justice. 
    This --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="6630.149" stopTime="6633.523">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So it isn't the order that triggers this, it's the conduct, isn't it?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="6633.523" stopTime="6959.927">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Yes, Mr. Justice. 
    It's the -- it is the statutory responsibility of the Courts of Appeals sitting en banc and thereby being known as the Judicial Councils to make appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious handling of the business of the District Courts and a situation where all of the district judges in a district fail to meet their responsibilities would clearly be a situation calling for the exercise of that power. 
    Now, various things have been said about the order which was entered by the Judicial Council in December of 1965 that it was done without a hearing and without notice and so on. 
    In our brief, we indicate that we think that as of that time, it may have been difficult to support that action. 
    It was quickly explained as having been interlocutory and I can conceive of situations where it would be appropriate for the Judicial Council to take action of this sort without a hearing and indeed without notice just as courts repeatedly grant temporary restraining orders on ex parte applications because something has to be done quickly. 
    I can imagine a situation where a judge should go on stark raving mad and something had to be done. 
    I can imagine situations where it would be entirely appropriate for the Judicial Council to order that no further cases be assigned to a judge and that he not sit on any pending cases presumably after a notice and a hearing. 
    For example, if a judge were indicted for having accepted bribes in connection with his handling of the cases and he announced, “Well, who cares about that? 
    I'll be in Court Monday, you can go ahead.” 
    I can imagine that it would be appropriate for the Judicial Council to issue an order such as was issued here or even stronger than was issued here, providing that he should no longer -- should not sit on pending matters and should have no new matters assigned to him until the indictment had been disposed of. 
    Now, that is not this case. 
    In this case, it is my own view that the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council did not act with the proper procedures, but on February 4, 1966, that order was completely superseded, it is no longer in effect. 
    I don't think the antitrust case of last year has any real application to this. 
    There is no -- there is no threat or risk that the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council will do further acts which would be inappropriate. 
    Since February 4, 1966, the only order that has been outstanding has been one which is in entire accord with the position of Judge Chandler. 
    Item one, Judge Chandler has agreed with the judges of the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma that no new business will be assigned to him. 
    And item two, all pending cases before Judge Chandler are left to him without interference in any way. 
    He thus has exactly what he asks for currently. 
    If he thinks that isn't all that he wants, he can change it. 
    With respect to pending cases that may soon be cleared out. 
    With respect to future cases, all he has to do is to tell his fellow district judges that he doesn't agree and that he wants some cases assigned to him. 
    If his fellow judges do agree to assign cases to him and he accepts that, there will be no disagreement and there will be no basis for the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council to act under Section 137. 
    If on the other hand his fellow district judges do not agree, then there will be a disagreement. 
    It will be appropriate for the Tenth Circuit to take whatever action may be appropriate under the circumstances, and I have no idea what that action would be. 
    Thus, I submit for the Court's consideration that although it is novel that this is a case within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States, but that the motion for leave to file the petition for a writ of mandamus should be denied because there is no longer any existing controversy outstanding.
