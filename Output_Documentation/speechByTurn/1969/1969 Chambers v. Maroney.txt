Chambers v. Maroney

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear argument in number 830, Chambers against Maroney. 
    Mr. Grogan, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This kernel matter is before the Court on write of certiorari to the Court of appeals for the Third Circuit. 
    Constitutional questions presented are whether petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel where he met his lawyer on the hallway on the way to the courtroom for trial on serious criminal charges. 
    It also involves the constitutional question of whether a warrantless search of an automobile in which the petitioner was a passenger which was made while he was in custody in a police station after the car had been moved from the scene of arrest to the police station and where there have been two previous searches of the same automobile. 
    It also involves the question of harmless error in connection with the admission into evidence of dumdum bullets which were illegally seized and then used to trial to connect petitioner with weapons that were found in the warrantless search of the car and also used to describe the severity of impact that could be made by such bullets two petitioner judgment. 
    The statement of -- the case in our brief is extensive. I'll try to summarize it more briefly for the Court. 
    It opens with the statement within the first week of September 1963, petitioner and three co-defendants were tried on fourth criminal charges. 
    I find now since the time of preparation in my brief and I've advised my opponent Ms. Los that the record of this trial has become available to me and that trial did not involve four criminal charges but rather two. 
    It appears that the indictment that was presented to the court and jury in that case involved solely the alleged robbery of the service station on May 28, 1963, and for reasons it will become apparent this is very important to our case. 
    I'd like to offer this to the Court at this time. 
    At the trial in early September 1963, petitioner was represented by a member of the Legal Aid Society of Pittsburgh. 
    The trial ended in a mistrial and withdrawal of a juror for reasons that are not explained in this record. 
    Later in September, on September 27, 1963 --

    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    Yes, Your Honor all the defendants or four defendants were for each of those cases. 
    Petitioner was called again to trial this time he was again represented by member of Legal Aid Society of Pittsburgh. 
    It happened to be another lawyer not the one who represented him at the first trial. 
    He met his lawyer in the hallway on the way to the courtroom, there is no evidence in the record as to what discussions they were before that if any with his lawyer, they proceeded to trial --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, we have another factor don't we? 
    Ordinary human experience in the practice and the habits of lawyers that two lawyers associated in the same organization whether be a law firm or legal aid society would reasonably be in communication with each other about a case when one is transferring it to another and they build up the file along and there's some things, some assumptions that can demand about that on the basis of experience?

    If I may speak outside the record, I believe so. 
    I have obtained copies of the Legal Aid Society, files in connection with the case and I believe that which show very, very little to and assist the lawyer in a second trial of the same charges. 
    Additionally, we have the problem here that we have been -- I have been operating under the assumption that the first trial involved all four counts where as we find now that it only involves two counts for one of the two robberies that he was charged with and tried in September.

    But there's been a habeas corpus petition hearing on the question of advocacy of counsel, right?

    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    Not in the federal system, Your Honor, and also its not a full hearing. 
    Part of our contention is that under Townsend against Sain there was not an adequate fact-finding hearing by the state court that the material facts are not disclosed in this record. 
    The record of the habeas corpus hearing appears in the appendix and it shows that petitioner took the stand he was ask when he met his counsel, he testified that he met him in the hallway on the way to the courtroom. 
    He was not asked any questions in connection with what other preparation there was whether he discussed it with him or not. 
    The only other thing touching on the fact was that petitioner said that at some point in time between the time when he was incarcerated in the first trial that a member of the Legal Aid Society staff apparently came to the precinct to talk to him.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="473.748" stopTime="476.459">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You do plan to spent some time on the search and seizure?
speaker="vincent_j_grogan" startTime="476.459" stopTime="773.774">
    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    Yes. 
    Yes I do, Your Honor. 
    The trial testimony disclosed that on May 13, 1963. 
    Two Negroes walked into a service station and demanded all of the money that the service station operator had. 
    One of them displayed a pistol, a nickel-plated pistol and they received from the service station operator $66.00 in cash, some personal cards, and his wallet. 
    At the trial, the service station operator identified petitioner as the person who was holding the gun. 
    He made an in-court identification of petitioner and identified these items as his personal property, the cards and also the wallet. 
    Testimony further disclosed that around 11:30 o'clock p.m. on May the 20th, two teenagers saw a car, a light blue station wagon parked in a parking lot near the teenage girl's home, in it were seated four Negro gentlemen. 
    They then testified that they saw this station wagon circled the block around the teenage girl's residence and also a Gulf service station. 
    Subsequently, about 15 minutes later, someone ran from the service station exclaiming that there had been a robbery. 
    They then saw within a few seconds this light blue station wagon leave the parking lot at a high rate of speed. 
    The record shows that service station was not visible from the parking area, there is nothing in the record to indicate that at anytime, the -- anyone ran from the service station to the automobile, got out of the automobile or in any other fashion connected at with the robbery. 
    The service station attendant testified that two Negro gentlemen came into the service station both of them displayed pistols and demanded everything that they had. 
    One of them, one is wearing a green sweater, the other was wearing a trench coat. 
    He took the change that he had and put it in his right hand glove, the service station attendant's glove, and gave it to the two robbers. 
    As police were summoned they came. 
    They interviewed the teenagers and the service station attendant and a description of the car and the four occupants were put -- or was put on the police radio. 
    Approximately, 45 minutes to an hour later, two neighboring or two police officers in the neighboring community saw a vehicle that answer the description that have been put on the radio and that is it was a light blue compact station wagon occupied by four Negroes. 
    At that time, the station wagon was being operated back toward the scene of the crime of that evening or the previous evening. 
    The police officers pulled the vehicle over on a side street, now the Commonwealth has argued that there may be inferences here leading or could be inferred that the gentlemen were attempting to elude the police at the time but I do no think that that's a fair inference from the record. 
    But in any event they were pulled over in the parking lot. 
    They got out of the station wagon and the police officers first looked at that point for weapons. 
    Within moments, other police officers from the community where the robbery had taken place came to the scene. 
    At that time, those police officers look through the station wagon by means of searchlight. 
    Petitioner and the owner of the vehicle were then taken to the police station in the community where the robbery had occurred. 
    They were again searched, at that time moment or that moment, money was removed from their purses. 
    The police officers went outside and made a search of a vehicle. 
    The chief of police or the lieutenant who was in-charge testified that they went through everything to indicate the depth of the search. 
    They went back inside after finding nothing again questioned petitioner and the Lawson, one of the other co-defendants went back out again. 
    And in this third search of the car, one of the officers opened up a bin in the heater and from this bin he removed two pistols, the cards taken in the robbery of May the 13th and a personal wallet of the attendant of that earlier event.

    Does the record show why the officers discontinued the search and went into the station house and then went back out and continued the search?

    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    They don't say its explicitly, Your Honor, what they do assert is that they went through everything and found nothing and it appears as if what they did then was to go back in and further interrogate or attempt to interrogate to disclose information.

speaker="vincent_j_grogan" startTime="831.424" stopTime="842.368">
    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    The matter of continuity is a little hard to explain, Your Honor, because of the passage of time that must be on inferred from the testimony of the officers as to how the search went on.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="842.368" stopTime="849.824">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Does the record suggest that this was the only matter that the officers where then engaged in or did they have other things to do?
speaker="vincent_j_grogan" startTime="849.824" stopTime="1024.644">
    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    It appears as if this was the only thing they were engaged in, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Later that same morning, then the chief of police of the community obtained a search warrant and went to the homes of the four defendants and made a search. 
    In the homes of the three other defendants nothing was found. 
    He went to petitioner's residence and there found a holster, some dumdum bullets that were matched to one of the revolvers found in the search of the car. 
    At the trial, petitioner's counsel objected to the introduction of these dumdum bullets into evidence on the grounds of irrelevancy at first, this was overruled. 
    Then the police officer testified on the stand that the dumdum bullets matched one of the -- matched the bullets taken from one of the weapons and that the effect of the dumdum bullet on the human body is to make larger holes and to cause more tissue damage. 
    Petitioner's counsel again objected. 
    This time he objected on the grounds that the search warrant did not disclose or did not indicate what they were searching for and it did not specifically say what they were searching for. 
    Unfortunately, this search warrant is not available to us now. 
    It has been lost, it's not a matter of this record, it apparently was lost before the state habeas corpus hearings, and so we are unable to say at the present time exactly what the search warrant did disclose except for the testimony of the police officer when he was on stand who said that the search warrant did not indicate that they were looking for bullets. 
    In any event, petitioner's then counsel objection to this evidence was overruled by the court who said that his failure to file pretrial motions meant that the suppression evidence should have been heard earlier not having been heard it was overruled on those procedure grounds. 
    The jury returned verdicts convicting the four defendants of the crimes of May 20th and petitioner was sentenced to 6 to 15 years imprisonment. 
    About two years after his conviction, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the state court and evidentiary hearing was held, and I've summarized for you what was disclosed at that time that he met his counsel on the way to the courtroom for the trial. 
    There is no extensive discussion as to what preparation if any there was, there was no exploration as to what defenses were available merely those statements.

    Do you point anything in the record that would show that there was any affect of assistance where there was any dereliction of duty or failure to do some things that shouldn't have been done by the lawyer?

    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    Your Honor, I think -- Mr. Chief Justice, if I can I think the basic proposition which start with the things disclosed by the record and they would be that in the first instance the trial court in overruling the objections to the dumdum bullets on the grounds that there had not been a pretrial motion filed. 
    The failure of counsel to recognize the very valid argument in connection with the search of the automobile which we submit to this Court at this time, the fact that there is no evidence at all of any pretrial consultation between the lawyer and his colleagues or as a matter of fact the petitioner.

    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan

    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    I believe they are material. 
    In connection with argument we submit that the late appointment of counsel for petitioner in this case were so prejudicial to whom as to warrant reversal. 
    This Court in getting Gideon against Wainwright held that the right to counsel when charged with a serious crime is a fundamental right essential to a fair trial. 
    The Court reaffirmed the principles of Powell against Alabama where the Court said that this right was not a hollow one but it meant appointment at such time and under such circumstances as to give effective aid of counsel in the preparation and trial the case.

    No, Your Honor.

    There would have been plenty of time to do it. 
    In other cases this Court has not considered the possibility of prejudice in connection with the appointment of counsel. 
    Glasser against United States, for example, where the Court determined that it would not inquire into the degree of prejudice sustained by one who had not had the assistance of counsel unimpaired by a conflict of interest.

    Do you want to keep the remaining time for rebuttal or do you want to continue?
speaker="vincent_j_grogan" startTime="1407.375" stopTime="1676.627">
    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    I would like to continue, if you please. 
    Before the luncheon recess, Mr. Justice Marshall asked me a question in connection with when petitioner first met his counsel, I find it in the appendix of page 256 the testimony of the state habeas corpus hearing indicates that he first met his counsel on the morning of trial. 
    It states it quite clearly. 
    In my remaining time I'd like to point out to the Court that our argument in connection with the rule of the Third Circuit as adopted in this case is erroneous that for the reason that I -- we do not believe that you must show specific prejudice in order to warrant reversal. 
    We point to the case as this Court has considered in connection with recidivist proceedings in connection with the pretrial procedures. 
    But in any event if you assume the validity of the rule adopted by the Third Circuit in this case which shifts the burden to the prosecuting authorities to show that there was not any prejudice from the lay appointment of counsel that this rule doesn't fall to the teachings of this Court as indicated in the case of Chapman. 
    Because in Chapman, this Court said that before you can declare a constitutional error to be harmless the Court must expressly believe that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and this rule as adopted by the Third Circuit talks in terms of overcoming this prima facie case of the ineffectiveness of counsel solely by adequate affirmative proof and we submit that adequate affirmative proof in this case is not the same thing as proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    As in this case, we have nothing but the trial record before us. 
    And all that trial record discloses is what was done or what may have been counsel may have been able to do within the confines of the record as stated. 
    There is nothing here to indicate what could have been done and was not done, what counsel may have to consider and yet did not take any action upon. 
    We've pointed out in our brief that there are instances where even if you assume the validity of the rule and ignore the dictates of Chapman, that there is specific prejudice indicated, indicated by the failure of counsel for example to forcefully argue for severance of the indictments of the two counts in connection with the two separate robberies. 
    There is no common scheme. 
    The only thing in common about them was the fact that the fruits of the robberies were found at the same time. 
    There are other things to consider. 
    In this case, the Third Circuit went beyond the rule of the Fourth Circuit and inquired into the adequacy of counsel solely by reference to the record of the trial. 
    Nothing was done here to develop what counsel could have done through his own testimony, this case unlike any other case that we could find counsel did not testify. 
    Counsel was not called to testify either in the state habeas corpus hearings or in the habeas corpus hearings in the federal district court. 
    The Legal Aid Society records were never introduced. 
    Petitioner was never examined in detail as to what defenses he may have had. 
    The testimony the petitioner at the place I've indicated in the record covers just a few pages and centers around the fact that he met his counsel on that morning. 
    There is no explanation for the failure of the counsel for example to file the pretrial motions as indicated by the record, this thing should be determined and can only be done so by following the dictates of Townsend against Sain and having a preliminary hearing. 
    Turning to the search and seizure problem we've argued in the brief if there was not probable cause for arrest and I believe that that argument is set forth adequately in the brief. 
    I would like however in the remaining time to call the Court's attention to what this Third Circuit did in this case and connection with the application of the doctrine of Preston against United States.

speaker="vincent_j_grogan" startTime="1686.910" stopTime="1760.975">
    Mr. Vincent J. Grogan 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    In Preston, this Court decided that where a person is lawfully arrested, a warrantless search can be made for two purposes. 
    To find weapons to prevent the person from escaping or from injuring the apprehending officer and also to prevent the destruction of any evidence. 
    The Third Circuit in its cases United States against Dento placed two additional distinguishing features into that test. 
    And said that you can nevertheless validate a warrantless search where the search was substantially contemporaneous and there was a reasonable nexus between the offense and the search. 
    Neither of these matters were part of the Preston test and should not become a part of our law. 
    We have indicated to the Court in our brief the case of Wood against Crouse decided by the Tenth Circuit ably distinguishes Preston or ably distinguishes Dento and indicates its failure to follow the dictates of Preston.

   Argument of Carol Mary Los

    Ms. Los.
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="1966.925" stopTime="2031.398">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The Commonwealth the Pennsylvania would readily agree that certainly no man should be asked to stand trial on serious criminal charges or in any charges unless he has had adequate opportunity to discuss his case with counsel. 
    But certainly counsel shouldn't be forced to represent the man with only a few moments notice. 
    This we feel destroys any semblance of the attorney-client relationship, because not only does it land itself to the fact that the attorney might not be adequately prepared but also he may likely in conation to act as an advocate on behalf of his client. 
    Fortunately, that did not happen to Frank Chambers. 
    As the record shows, we know that he was visited during the five-month period that he was lodged in a county jail by an investigator from the Legal Aid Society that the investigator did prepare report that was reduced into writing and was placed in a file. 
    But the file was subsequently turned over to Mr. Tamburo who was to represent Chambers on the day of trial.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2031.398" stopTime="2034.064">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is that all in the record?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2034.064" stopTime="2073.186">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Your Honor, it's in the record by virtue of allegations made in response to the habeas corpus petition filed in the state court. 
    Unfortunately, what happened to state habeas corpus hearing was the counsel for the petitioner then withdrew the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. 
    Consequently, the matter was never before the court, the Commonwealth was not required to go forward with its burden of proof or to present Mr. Tamburo or to offer, in fact any files or records from the Legal Aid Society. 
    Consequently, there is nothing actually on the record before your Court.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2073.186" stopTime="2076.181">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The issue then was presented to the state court?

    It was presented to the state court --

    It was withdrawn.
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2078.764" stopTime="2090.366">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    -- and withdrawn. 
    However, Your Honor in the federal district court.

    Do you think?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2094.699" stopTime="2107.118">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    I feel that if that is the case, if petitioner was not waiving it at the time that it did not exhaust the state revenues and the question actually should be before the state court.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2107.118" stopTime="2111.853">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    How did he -- he withdrew it?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2111.853" stopTime="2121.407">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    By virtue of his counsel when the Commonwealth attempted to cross-examine Chambers about the length of time that he had -- had an opportunity to speak with Mr. Tamburo.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2121.407" stopTime="2127.272">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if there wasn't an adequate hearing in the state court because they didn't do that.
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2127.272" stopTime="2200.625">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Yes, that is our point Your Honor, we are saying that they with -- if there is anything lacking in the record, then it is likely by virtue of counsel for the petitioner at the time withdrawing the allegation and consequently the Commonwealth then stopped its line of questioning with the petitioner on this lines and did not present any affirmative evidence to share the petitioner had had an opportunity to discuss this case with Mr. Tamburo. 
    In any event, I think we can tell from the record that Mr. Tamburo was very much aware of the facts of the mistrial that it occurred three weeks prior and was certainly very much aware of the evidence that have been admitted at the previous trial. 
    Chambers now shows that the near fact that he didn't get to consult with Mr. Tamburo for longer period of time warrants a new trial. 
    In the past, in our circuit in the state courts when an allegation of this nature is made, it is merely one factor to be considered in the overall test of effectiveness of counsel. 
    In other words, the burden remains with the petitioner to prove that he was prejudiced because of the belated appointment.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Ms. Los.

speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="2214.424" stopTime="2360.742">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Yes, it does it sets it forth for you. 
    Now, this is -- generally, this is the Pennsylvania rule. 
    In other words, the prisoner -- the petitioner would have to show that the appointment was made in bad faith as being merely perfunctory prior to trial or that he was actually prejudiced. 
    This is the decision, I believe, that the Attorney General of New York seeks to bring before you in the amicus brief in this case. 
    This position while we are certainly happy to have the work by the Attorney General of New York goes beyond the position that we are taken because we feel that as far as the facts of the apparent -- this criminal law in Allegheny County is concerned that the facts especially in this case might warrant the presumption that the Third Circuit has given in cases of belated appointment. 
    For one thing, there is certainly a great hesitancy among the judiciary to judge defense counsel's work especially, if the judge has himself appointed defense counsel to represent an instant defendant. 
    And again, there is a hesitancy on the part of the defense counsel to say that he actually was ineffective or was inadequately prepared. 
    Of course, where he has not asked for a continuance of the case based upon these facts, it would be I think, more embarrassing for him to admit that he was inadequately prepared. 
    And third, of course the prisoner lacking any legal knowledge would not be in a position to judge his attorney's competence. 
    Now the problem is aggravated in Allegheny County in Pittsburgh because there, unless the case is a murder case or involves an extensive string of armed robberies, counsel is appointed ahead of time, it is the public defender's office who is appointed and an investigator does a preparatory work. 
    But unfortunately, the prisoner does not have an opportunity to speak with his counsel sometimes even just prior to going into the courtroom. 
    Usually counsel, defense counsel will visit the prisoner in the bullpen which is located below the courtrooms on the morning of trial. 
    But unfortunately, in most situations, I must admit the counsel does not have an opportunity to speak with his client until just moments before the trial begins.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I would say at least.

    He says he is prejudiced because he did not receive a severance from the other defendants. 
    And he cites the fact that Raymond Lawson had previously been tried on a murder charge. 
    In fact, I eventually say that the other defendants were prejudiced by being tried with him because he was the one that was identified as being the gunman at the two robberies.

    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    They -- I believe it is their position, that this -- that the effectiveness of counsel is a question which does depend upon retroactivity for its existence. 
    In other words, this is fundamental to a defendant's due process of law and an indigent defendant's equal protection laws consequently it would not --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2986.473" stopTime="2999.660">

    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    Well, that may very well be true, Your Honor, I would suggest that certainly as far as the -- as their client is concerned that they are in a rather precarious position. 
    In other words, once the state has appointed counsel for someone and that particular counsel chooses not to prepare the case and in effect renders ineffective assistance to counsel, or counsels appointed by the state merely is a perfunctory gesture so there is not sufficient time to prepare, then certainly, I think that it is our duty whether it's a persecutor saying or defense counsel or the court to step in and to rectify that situation.

    Well, they argue that Raymond Lawson, a co-defendant have been previously tried on a murder charge and that if they have known this, they never would have wanted Lawson to be able to testify his own behalf, because he apparently does not make a very credible witness. 
    It is our position that anyone of the co-defendants might have been more prejudiced by being tried with Chambers and vice versa because of the four of them Chambers was the one that was absolutely identified as the gunman in the two different robberies. 
    Consequently, we don't feel that there's anything at all that would have aided chambers by being severed in the two cases.

    The bullets were of two characters.

    They -- the prosecution then placed into evidence, the two revolvers that were seized from the car in which the petitioner was riding. 
    These two -- the bullets from those guns matched. 
    In other words they were .38-caliber long and short, some of them were dumdum bullets.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Given the merits, I don't recall the record at the moment but you spoke of eye witnesses, how many eyewitnesses identified this appellant-petitioner?
speaker="carol_mary_los" startTime="3549.755" stopTime="3659.263">
    Ms. Carol Mary Los 
    At the first -- as involves the first robbery there was only one witness, the fellow who was robbed, the gas station tenant. 
    He positively identified him. 
    At the -- for the second robbery, the fellow who was robbed stated that he was unable to identify him in Court because his physical appearance was somewhat changed. 
    He had a different -- it was different clothing, he was now wearing glasses, he had shaved the moustache that he was wearing at the time of the robbery. 
    However, he did identify him within hours of the robbery as being the person who -- the gunman, who would come in to rob him. 
    So, these are the -- this is the eyewitness testimony that we have. 
    The teenagers who observed the car circling the area, a car which contained four Negro occupants, one was wearing a dark green pullover V-neck sweater, and another was wearing a light trench coat. 
    And we know from the fellow who was robbed that one of the gunman was wearing a V-neck sweater and another was wearing a light tan trench coat. 
    Of course, we have no eyewitness testimony from the two teenagers who observed this car because they couldn't identify anyone who was in the car other than their race and their dress, and they did not observe the robbery. 
    I would like, just for a moment, if I may to reach the question of the search that was conducted at the police station. 
    Certainly, if Chimel is retroactive, then I must concede this argument. 
    But it is our position, at the time that the police officers acted that the test must be the reasonable of the search that they made, they couldn't search the car.

    Right. 
    No, they could not reach the car I will admit that. 
    But we are saying that the police officers would have placed themselves in danger because of the dark circumstances in this parking lot, the fact that it adjoined a bar where friends of the petitioner and his co-defendants were frequent.
