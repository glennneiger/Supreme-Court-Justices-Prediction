    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments in Number 927, Williams against the State of Florida. 
    Mr. Kanner you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may I please the Court. 
    Known as this case involves the validity of the Florida procedural requiring the defendant in a criminal case to on proper notice to give the prosecuting attorney the names and addresses of any alibi witnesses which the defendant might use. 
    Your Honors, the case also involves the validity of Florida six-men criminal trial jury. 
    The facts are not in the list of dispute, they are reflected both in my brief and in the state's brief without any dispute. 
    I will not dwell on them here other than to note the state apparently acknowledges that the questions were properly raised and preserved below and that the state apparently acknowledges now that to the Fifth and Sixth Amendments applied to the state. 
    Your Honors, I will discuss the interpretation of the terms witness, compulsion and against himself in discussing the Fifth Amendment right. 
    And I will also discuss reasons why Your Honors in my opinion the number 12 is fundamental to the jury system in this country.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In the State of Florida, does the statute require the prosecution to furnish this to its witnesses?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="115.255" stopTime="131.160">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor we have a procedural rule which is the same affect as a statute which when I offer to disclose all of my witnesses, the state is then required to disclose all of their witnesses.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="131.160" stopTime="132.762">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's conditional?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="132.762" stopTime="135.339">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    It is conditionally Your Honor on that I have.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="135.339" stopTime="137.530">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    On defense counsel has been making that offer?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="137.530" stopTime="153.098">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes sir Your Honor. 
    We have another statute that is not conditional Your Honor that the state without any conditional on my part must disclose the name of their witness upon whom the information is based as distinguished from their witnesses on the case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="153.098" stopTime="157.900">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That would be the chief prosecuting witness, if he were the victim of the offense presumably?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="157.900" stopTime="160.471">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Presumably yes sir.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="160.471" stopTime="165.820">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But you proceed only by information and the Florida not by indictment at all?M
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="165.820" stopTime="219.668">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor, the statutes in Florida provide for indictment on capital cases. 
    On non capital cases Your Honor the prosecuting officials have the right to proceed by either information or at least has been in my experience in solitary cases, even in misdemeanors sometimes that they are proceeded on by indictment but this is strictly up to the prosecuting authorities. 
    Your Honors, the Fifth Amendment is historically simple. 
    No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. 
    Your Honors, whatever this prohibition means and I'm going to get to this in a minute. 
    This prohibition Your Honor is utterly and completely without qualification or exemption, absolutely. 
    This prohibition, the Fifth Amendment is absolutely, positively never ever, ever subject to competing public interest regardless of how vast this public interest might take.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="219.668" stopTime="222.772">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are you talking about it now on the context to the --
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="222.772" stopTime="224.174">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Alibi.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="224.174" stopTime="239.718">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I am speaking of the defendant himself when you say it's absolute and subject to no qualifications, do you mean that no one can make him take the stand under oath and testify or not under oath and testify?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="239.718" stopTime="248.867">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    I mean Mr. Chief Justice, the Fifth Amendment says this, the cases of this Court I think of which I've cited in my brief.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="248.867" stopTime="251.458">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I was wondering what scope you were giving it.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="251.458" stopTime="397.359">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Only the scope that this Court has given it Your Honor because the state has argued in its brief that the reason for the alibi rule is to combat perjury. 
    The reason for the alibi ruling Your Honors is in a quest for the search for truth. 
    In arguendo Your Honors, I concede all of this absolutely for the sake of this argument. 
    I would also concede Your Honors if they would ask and without being utterly facetious about it that the alibi rule would stop pollution and stop the war and anything else because Your Honors, I think not subject to reasonable question that whatever comes within the scope of the Fifth Amendment it is not subject to competing state interest. 
    The state has not been able to show a solitary case which came within the Fifth Amendment that this Court or any other Court has said or at least that this Court has said, well even though this comes within the Fifth Amendment, the rights of the state in this context are so great that we are not going to bring it out of the Fifth Amendment. 
    Your Honors, I suggested in my brief or at least cited in my brief an early case Boyd versus United States which had to do with the forfeiture of goods but in the -- and Boyd, this Court quoted from an English trespass case and there the English justice noted that trespass in a single nature is just absolute. 
    And I suggest that at least whatever the Fifth Amendment says it's true here, that as the English case said. 
    If you're going to have an invasion of this privilege, you have got to go back to the common law principles and find some justification for it and that the silence of the books according to the English justice is authority against the invasion. 
    The state is not been able to cite a solitary case of this Court or any case in principle in history which would sanction the use of an alibi witness. 
    The fact I note parenthetically that the alibi witness rule has been proposed twice in the federal rules and rejected but I don't think that that is determinative of all.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="397.359" stopTime="430.183">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, isn't it rather incumbent upon you to show us why this is constitutionally invalid, here is a statute or rule of law that state of Florida would use it quite rightly if it does violate the Fifth Amendment to the constitution, even if we might think it does a good or wise rule if it violates the constitution that violates the constitution, but that as I understand your argument is what you told us so far now isn't it incumbent upon you to tell us why it violates the constitution?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="430.183" stopTime="431.938">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes your honor I'm going to discuss --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="431.938" stopTime="437.615">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Not up to Florida to find cases, it's rather up to you to find the precedence.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="437.615" stopTime="550.285">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    I agree, I believe I've cited them in my brief but I'm going to discuss now the interpretation of these words in the Fifth Amendment compelled to be a witness against yourself and let's see what these words mean. 
    Let's take the first one which I think is easiest and that is witness. 
    I believe Your Honor is that the state concedes that this alibi and notice rules falls within the term 'witness' and I think they correctly concede that. 
    While they cite in their brief some of the physical test cases Schmerber versus California the blood alcohol test, I believe there they might not cite the finger print test cases. 
    All going outside the Fifth Amendment privilege and properly so, is I understand the rationale of those cases. 
    The Court said the that the Fifth Amendment is related solely to communications and that the physical test not being communications or not being documents or not within Fifth Amendment and I only suggest to the Court that this rationale should not be expanded today because since the state apparently concedes that the notice of alibi rule is within the purview or the category of witness, let's leave it at that. 
    I know that one case that I cited in my brief Albertson versus Subversive Activities Control Board which was the case which this Court said the communist need not register. 
    Now, this is the same thing, the mere fact that it's a document, a pleading prior to trial by counsel should not take this Court out of the term or this case rather out of the term of witness.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="550.285" stopTime="563.677">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The communist case of course turned to a large extent on the fact that there was incriminatory aspect to the registration, did it not?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="563.677" stopTime="564.373">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes sir that's --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="564.373" stopTime="570.425">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What you see is the incriminatory aspect of furnishing the names of witnesses?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="570.425" stopTime="581.210">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor, the Fifth Amendment doesn't say incriminatory Your Honor. 
    The Fifth Amendment says no person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="581.210" stopTime="586.188">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, doesn't against himself imply the same thing that might could be?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="586.188" stopTime="596.076">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor this is position that the state takes. 
    The state says this, that the alibi notice rule is not incriminating but its exonerating.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="596.076" stopTime="600.070">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You're going to bring the witness and to help you, aren't you?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="600.070" stopTime="616.759">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    You're going to bring this witness into trial to help you anyway and the mere acceleration of the disclosure of notifying the state attorney is to when this witness is going to come in can only exonerate you. 
    Well Your Honors as I reach the case --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="616.759" stopTime="637.839">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mr. Kanner, assume a case where the defendant never talks to anybody, police or anybody else and does not testify at the trial. 
    How do you get that under the Firth Amendment witness word?

    Your Honor --

    The defendant is never going to witness, the state --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="648.578" stopTime="652.395">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, that's the only one he can put the claim on it.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="652.395" stopTime="711.835">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor, the state says this in answer to your question Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    They say that should defendant give the name of my witnesses prior to trial to the prosecuting attorney is according to the procedural rule that no notice can be ever be given to the jury by way of opening or closing argument that here, the defendant supplied the state with the names of the alibi witnesses, where are those alibi witnesses? 
    Your Honor, the defendant says or rather the state says that there can be no argument like that to the jury. 
    They have not cited any cases and I have not found the first case Your Honor which would support their contention that should I comply with the statute that this alibi witness will not become known to the jury. 
    And I believe Your Honor that that is a context.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="733.132" stopTime="764.171">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    No Your Honor, I'm suggesting Mr. Justice Marshall that in answer to your question, if the defendant would not testify, how the alibi notice rule would be a witness. 
    I'm only trying to suggest a possibility that the state in arguing opening and closing argument to the jury will announce to the jury that the defendant has an alibi. 
    We do not believe that this alibi is proper. 
    This the only --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="764.171" stopTime="774.380">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That assumes that a prosecutor will say it and that a judge will let him say it and that the state court rule have said it. 
    That's four assumptions.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="774.380" stopTime="777.973">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    These assumptions made by the state in its brief Your Honor.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="777.973" stopTime="779.955">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, which side do you argue?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="779.955" stopTime="803.776">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    I'm arguing my side Your Honor that the only possible way that the witness rule can apply is if the defendant does not testify as in the context that I have suggested. 
    That is the state apparently it concedes in its brief that the alibi notice rule comes within the purview of witness at least as I understand their brief.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="803.776" stopTime="806.238">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, that doesn't bind us anyway.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="806.238" stopTime="829.398">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    No Your Honor but I only suggest the -- regardless of whether their brief buying support, I only suggest that in the communist case and then Schmerber versus California, this Court held that witnesses mean anything communication and I feel that the alibi notice rule is a communication within the Fifth Amendment scope of a witness.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="829.398" stopTime="848.394">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well this is what is requires the defendant to do as I understand it specify number of days before on trial to ten days is to give the prosecution, a list of people who are going to testify on behalf of the defendant and his behalf and then his favor.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="848.394" stopTime="848.795">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Our only alibi.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="848.795" stopTime="869.176">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In support of his alibi defense that's what I mean. 
    How does this -- I don't really -- certainly these people are going to be witnesses, the defendant says they're going to be witnesses, there's no question about, no problem about that but how does this requirement violate the defendant's right against or anybody else's right against self incrimination?

    No --

    Or constitutional right not to be a witness against him? 
    It's all to be a witness against himself.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor as I read the cases. 
    I -- or at least I as counsel have the sole right of the determining when I am going to make this judgment as to what to put forth by alibi witness.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="887.054" stopTime="895.441">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What's that, perhaps that's true and that is true in many jurisdictions but what does that have to do with the self incrimination clause of the the Fifth Amendment?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="895.441" stopTime="900.572">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    As I read the cases that I've cited in my brief --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="900.572" stopTime="902.245">

    Schmerber doesn't decide that?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="902.245" stopTime="909.061">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    No! 
    Schmerber only says that, what is a witness, I didn't cite Schmerber, as I read the case --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="909.061" stopTime="922.292">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I would suppose you would. 
    You make the suggestion earlier that Schmerber made the dichotomy between communicative and non communicative? 
    I thought the dichotomy in Schmerber was testimonial and non testimonial?

    Mr. Richard Kanner

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They were, aren't they? 
    That's rather different isn't it? 
    The test is not whether the violation of the memo to communicate something in advance, whether it's testimonial or non-testimonial, isn't it, as far as the privilege is concerned?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="942.984" stopTime="949.353">

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honor, the test as I read the cases Your Honors is not whether the disclosure is incriminating. 
    As I read the cases Your Honor, the test is whether this evidence is going to be used or whether this information can be used by the state at trial.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="985.094" stopTime="1002.415">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I did not include in my question any incriminatory aspect. 
    I just said, how is it giving evidence becoming a witness, how is it, how does it trespass the Fifth Amendment in its precise language? 
    You said you were depending on the precise language.
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1002.415" stopTime="1003.430">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes sir Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1003.430" stopTime="1007.618">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now how does it trespass that?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1007.618" stopTime="1108.244">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    I feel that cases here bring the notice of alibi statute within the term witness. 
    I feel that it brings the language -- the cases that I cited brings the notice of alibi rule within the language witness against himself because as I read particularly like Garrity versus New Jersey, Brown versus Walker that the defendant's absolute right to remain silent and the test of against himself at least as I read the cases is not whether it is incriminating. 
    True that in most all instances or every instance that I'm aware of, the rational has been that the testimony of the communication was incriminating but I don't read the Fifth Amendment like that as you -- as I read the Fifth Amendment and as I read the cases without taking things out of context, the test of against himself is whether evidence from the defendant's own lips is to be used against him at his trial. 
    Garrity versus New Jersey as I recollect was a case where some policeman testified at the civil service area and then this evidence was used in their trial. 
    Well the record doesn't disclose Your Honor but theoretically these policeman would not have testified at the civil service hearing anything but what they thought would have exonerated. 
    So I don't feel Your Honors that the test of against himself is necessarily incriminating and it maybe --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1108.244" stopTime="1128.374">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But I gather for example finger prints that are taken before trial are used by the prosecution against the defendant at trial. 
    That's information they obtain for the purpose of using it against the defendant in that trial. 
    You would not claim that that in anyway violated privilege, would you?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1128.374" stopTime="1130.742">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Not in the list Mr. Justice.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1133.521" stopTime="1148.626">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So you really have to hear to establish that in giving the notice on the name of the witness, this is testimonial in the sense that we do a distinction between testimonial and non-testimonial Schmerber and the other case?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1148.626" stopTime="1149.959">

speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1153.752" stopTime="1192.537">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Well, I believe that the state is conceded that it's testimonial. 
    I think the state says though that is not compulsion and the reason that they say that it's not compulsion, I believe it was even the Chief Justice raised or maybe Justice Marshall raised the question that since this alibi witness is going to be used to trial anyway, there's no compulsion about it and my answer to this Your Honor is quite simply that I believe that I as counsel have got the absolute positive right to wait until the conclusion of the state's case before I want to make a decision is to whether I wish to put an alibi witness on. 
    We have without a doubt.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1192.537" stopTime="1197.264">

    Your honor --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1198.429" stopTime="1224.731">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Your position is not impaired except on this hypothesis that you went around with, that it might be used in argument by the prosecutor but if Justice Marshall said that case isn't here today, how are you injured in this sense by disclosing the name when you come to the decision of whether you are going to put on witnesses?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1224.731" stopTime="1312.021">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that the Fifth Amendment requires that I be injured. 
    I don't believe that the Fifth Amendment requires that I incriminate myself. 
    I believe that the Fifth Amendment says that I cannot be compelled to be a witness against myself and I believe that your point is certainly the most difficult that I have to overcome that is what is the test of “against himself.” 
    I believe that that is the strongest argument that the state has, that this is really not against himself. 
    And the only answer that I have to this Your Honor is I feel that I have an absolute right to remain silent up until the very close of the state's case that there are factors that are going to be apparent only at trial even the composition of the jury that I'm going to base my decision on. 
    There may not be anything incriminating and I believe the analogy is reasonable if we uphold the alibi-notice-rule, the state can come back and say ask that question of the defendant by a procedural rule, are you going to testify? 
    Well, I don't believe it would be any question about that as being invalid.

    Your argument goes so far as to say that it will be now criminal discovery of any kind against himself?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1320.644" stopTime="1384.377">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Not quite Mr. Justice but almost. 
    The only criminal discovery that I would sanction and against the defendant is the notice of insanity and the reason that I would -- I believe that the notice of insanity rule is good. 
    Notice of insanity is very similar to the alibi in Florida and I believe it's predominant through out the state. 
    If the defendant is going to rely on insanity, he advices the state a certain amount of days before trial with the names of his witnesses. 
    But there Your Honors, there is always a presumption of sanity and once you file a show that you are insane, this gives the state an additional burden of proof other than the facts that are in the information. 
    Well of course the alibi-notice-rule does not. 
    So Mr. Justice, in answer to your question, the notice of insanity rule is the only criminal discovery that I as a trial attorney would allow.

    Mr. Justice Black, the statute provides that the alibi witness cannot testify, the defendant himself in Florida can testify at all times as also provision in the rule that the judge if the circumstance is warranted can excuse the defendant from the provisions of the alibi notice.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Well, Your Honor we are getting into the Sixth Amendment right here which I noticed in my brief of Washington versus Texas and I'd like to only make this comment that I raised the point and I suggested in my brief Washington versus Texas which was a case which a defendant try to subpoena a co-defendant who was not on trial and the Texas procedure apparently was that the co-defendant could not testify. 
    I am going to answer your question Your Honor. 
    This Court held that the Sixth Amendment right of compulsory attendance of witnesses was inapplicable to the states. 
    Your Honor, I did not specifically raise the Sixth Amendment during trial but I have always relied on the Fourteenth Amendment and I suggest only that this Sixth Amendment right in the context Your Honors that I presented it here today is similar to our Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. 
    In answer to your question Mr. Justice, the law of the procedural rule in Florida is clear that should there not be notice given, the defendant or the witness rather is not a confident witness at trial unless the judge within the exercise of his own discretion --

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honors my initial reaction on the jury point was that Florida being Spanish domain, our six-man jury came from that. 
    In the words of the vernacular Your Honor suggests isn't so. 
    My research that there are four states with less than 12 man juries, of the four Your Honor, only Utah has had a six-man jury from the inception. 
    South Carolina in its 1776 constitutional and up to 1865 had 12 man juries. 
    Florida had -- Andrew Jackson's first order when he was territorial government said that all criminal cases shall be tried in accordance to the principles of the common law. 
    Louisiana Your Honor, there's a specific federal statute when Louisiana was admitted to a territory that said all criminal cases there shall be a jury of 12. 
    So Your Honors, I feel that the number 12 whether it's good or bad regardless the number 12 Your Honors is sufficient and rather as fundamental to our jury system. 
    Your Honors I only suggest --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1650.827" stopTime="1656.305">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I wonder why that should be, why is it fundamental, you mean just because historically has always been 12.

    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Your Honors as I read it, the jury was always 12 or more and that the reason, the 12 came out --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1683.126" stopTime="1686.039">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I think sanctity -- this trial was 500, wouldn't it?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="1686.039" stopTime="1769.961">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    That at least to the common law Mr. Justice that at least 12 persons had to agree and if they couldn't get 12 persons to agree they -- throughout some of the juries and they brought in some more juries and held 12 could agree. 
    I believe that at least historically is how I read it but I don't know the number of 12. Your Honor I only suggest here that the Bill of Rights were enacted not to protect the guilty or rather to protect the innocent but rather they were made by our founders to protect the innocent and that the reasons which dictated the Bill of Rights 200 years ago, that is that all Governments want to get rid of all trouble makers as quickly as possible is certainly is true today as it was way back then. 
    And Your Honors the Bill or Rights being to protect the guilty and to shield the guilty from the powers of the state, I feel that it's incumbent on this Court to read them in the manner in which they were written. 
    And then answer to one of the -- I guess -- one of the justices, there is no criminal discovery in a -- against to the defendant unless we're going to change the literal terms of the Fifth Amendment compelled to be a witness against himself. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Jesse J. McCrary, Jr.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1769.961" stopTime="1772.068">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. McCrary.
speaker="jesse_j_mccrary" startTime="1772.068" stopTime="1862.669">
    Mr. Jesse J. McCrary, Jr. 
    May it please the Court. 
    The respondent would like to respectfully address itself to the issues as they have been raised in our brief. 
    The first issue being, do the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment privileges against self incrimination violated by requirement that a defendant disclosed ten days prior to trial, his intent to rely on alibi defenses. 
    First, I would like to say that Florida's rule of notice of alibi as we were referring to it is fundamentally fair and it's not unconstitutional. 
    The rule is not designed in any way for a defendant to say anything against himself. 
    The rule is a rule of procedure. 
    Now, the constitution, it do not think does not grant to a defendant the right to so have the kind of defense, so that the state cannot check the veracity of that defense and that's what he is suggesting here. 
    All that the constitution or all that we profit to the Court today is that upon a written demand by the prosecuting attorney and we want to straighten out a few of the concessions that we were supposed to have made that there must be a written demand by the prosecuting attorney first to a defendant asking whether or not he intends to rely on an alibi defense. 
    If he so does, then and only then is he required to give the names of the witnesses as are known to him who will testify for him.

    Because if the state has an opportunity or the state knows of the witnesses that the defendant intends to use as an alibi and the alibi statute probably states that if alibi, the defendant was not at a particular place at a particular time, therefore he could not have permitted the crime. 
    It gives the state an opportunity then if nothing else to know a price or to dismiss the matter.

    No the rule does not go that for us Mr. Kanner said.

    Mr. Jesse J. McCrary, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice Black, I would quite agree, I think that the same Court that decided this case, the Third District Court of Appeal is mindful of this and we cited it at page 14 in our brief, (Inaudible) versus State of Florida and Wilson versus the State of Florida where the defendant did not comply with the notice of alibi rule and the Court still let those witnesses testify so that the rule is not an un-reasonable rule where we say --

    Now, do you see any distinction between the advance notice which he concedes as constitutional and the advance notice on alibis which he argues is unconstitutional?

    Yes sir and if we talk about the trial strategy, there was nothing that prohibited the defendant from testifying in his own behalf if he wanted to at any time during the trial. 
    What we are really talking about is a bit of timing. 
    Now, he can determine at the close of the state's case whether he wants to put on alibi witnesses or he can determine 15 days before trial that he does not -- that he wants to put or does not want to put on alibi witnesses. 
    Now, the way it harms and is absolutely (Inaudible) to me and there is not any violation anywhere of the Fifth Amendment here because he is not required to put on anybody on the stand.

speaker="jesse_j_mccrary" startTime="2834.231" stopTime="2948.833">
    Mr. Jesse J. McCrary, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    I just like, well conclude a statement to the question given before the Court. 
    The first issue is that, certainly it's not incriminating, what might have happened is not before this Court and as suggested by Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Stewart in the total effect over here, it was absolutely harmless to the defendant to have those witness to testify where he complied with the rule. 
    The second issue is raised in our brief is to the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause and the Sixth Amendment entitle a state defendant to a trial of 12-men jury. 
    First, I think to understand or towards to get to the core of this problem, we first must necessarily talk about the 12-men jury of a purpose of the jury trial as defined by this Court's decision in Duncan versus Louisiana. 
    I think the majority opinion stated that the purpose of the jury and the Anglo-American system was protection against arbitrary power. 
    The jury of a pierce gave this kind of safeguard from overzealous prosecutor and overzealous federal and State Governments. 
    Secondly, there have been decisions from this Court, says that the federal standard only requires that we adhere to the essentials of the common law jury. 
    And to number the essentials, we think that the essentials are one, that a person's needs or should have the right to a jury trial in serious offenses. 
    Another essential of the jury system as we think the unanimous verdict as defined by this code in Patton versus United States and the only decisions tend to say Maxwell versus Dow and Thompson versus Utah suggest that 12 men is an essential of the jury system.

    Mr. Jesse J. McCrary, Jr. 
    Yes sir, that word suggest did not -- I didn't mean suggest, the Court said or held, but they were only applied then in terms of the federal standard. 
    Now, we have to look at what are the essentials of the jury system. 
    (Inaudible) we think that this is essential because of the possible confinement. 
    Unanimous verdict and Florida complies with this but when we talk about the 12 men jury, there is nothing, there's no particular reason for having 12 men on a jury as opposed to six men. 
    We find that the common law or the reason that we have to have is merely a carry over of the common law at the time we adopted the constitution in 1789.

    Mr. Jesse J. McCrary, Jr. 
    One should be tried by a jury of his peers which was suggested to me the plural of the word peers would mean more than one. 
    Historically we have seen and I think it's lost in history that sometimes people were tried by 500 as have been suggested today or down to as many as three. 
    When this jury system was developing but there is no statistical data available that has been presented by the petitioner which suggests that a man tried by 12 is going to receive a fairer trial than a man who was tried by six.

    Isn't it true that if you have 12 jurors as compared to 6 you lose opportunity of six, one votes for hung jury?

    You use that --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    If you have 12, you already had convinced one out of 12 to get a hung jury?

    Mr. Jesse J. McCrary, Jr. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall you're absolutely correct but I think that we come back to a number's game and this Court is --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3180.651" stopTime="3183.354">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well it would be better to have 25 under my theory.

    Mr. Jesse J. McCrary, Jr. 
    Your Honor, if we took to this to the logical conclusion, we ought to have the population of Washington sitting on one case. 
    So long as we provide, as this Court said in the jury system a buffer between overzealous prosecutors or overzealous state officials and we provide it by a fair and impartial manner, I think that this is all that's required and if we play the number's games I would suggest that we shouldn't use 12.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3212.087" stopTime="3228.150">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, there any fewer than 12 man juries anywhere in the states when the constitution was adopted, was anyone trying criminal cases or a jury trial was required with any fewer than 12?
speaker="jesse_j_mccrary" startTime="3228.150" stopTime="3268.331">
    Mr. Jesse J. McCrary, Jr. 
    Your Honor, my research does not reveal that, it does reveal that Thompson versus Utah, before they were a state, I think this was about 1898 decided by this Court stated that Thompson wanted to be tried by eight people or some number less than 12 and the Court said -- that the State of Utah, not the state but the territory of Utah could not do this because they were on the federal jurisdiction. 
    To me, the dicta sort of indicated that had not, they had been on the federal jurisdiction that he would have been allowed, it would have been okay to try him by a people or by a number less than 12.

    Mr. Jesse J. McCrary, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I think the State of Utah use a six and I think that there are some 12 states at some trial proceedings throughout from the lowest court up to the highest trial court use less than six on one occasion or another, I mean less than 12 on one occasion or another.

   Rebuttal of Richard Kanner
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3302.018" stopTime="3305.219">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    When did it adopt six men jury law?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="3305.219" stopTime="3313.157">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Sir, it first appears under constitution of 1875 by constitutional amendment.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3313.157" stopTime="3315.641">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    As a reconstruction which is statutory?
speaker="richard_kanner" startTime="3315.641" stopTime="3464.300">
    Mr. Richard Kanner 
    Yes sir. 
    We suggest that in our brief we put in our brief joined Mr. Justice Harlan's words that there's nothing significant about the number 12 that we've come to get this number based on the anti-establishment clause that its basic reference comes from the bible, 12 disciples to 12 stones to 12 tribes of Israel to 12 gates to Jerusalem, all and there's nothing significant about it. 
    And that six people can provide what Mr. Justice White did say that we put to provide a buffer between Government and the people so that this kind of a pressure is not put on people by overzealous prosecutors or overzealous Government. 
    There have been some statistical study shown in Winchester Massachusetts District Court, the legislature authorized there six-men jury and the report said that it's been found the six member juries render the same kinds of verdicts that 12 member juries render or their render the same kind of lawyers would expect from 12-men juries. 
    It was also found true to be -- this to be true in the state of New Jersey. 
    To quote Mr. Justice Holmes in our position, he says that it is revolting that we have no better reason for keeping a rule than that rule was laid down in the time of Henry IV. 
    He says that it's more revolting as the grounds upon which it was laid down long vanished and the rule persist from the blind imitation of the past. 
    We think that the 12 men jury should not be required on the states, additionally we think that the numbers game is not essential to fulfilling the purpose that this Court pronounced in Duncan versus the United -- versus Louisiana and that the sole purpose of the jury is to protect the public and whether that number is six or 12, it is fulfilled and that there is nothing violative of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment when you use six men on a jury trial. 
    We respectfully urge this court on both issues to affirm the District Court of Appeal and to hold particularly that a six men jury does not violate the constitution and the notice of alibi does not violate the Fifth Amendment nor the due process clause of the United State constitution. 
    Thank you.
