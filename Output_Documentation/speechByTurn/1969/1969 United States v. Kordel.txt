    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This is a criminal prosecution under the federal food and drug laws. 
    Respondents and Detroit Vital Foods Incorporated, the corporation of which they were officers were convicted after a jury trial on five counts of an indictment charging them with misbranding of drugs. 
    The corporation is not before this Court on present petition. 
    The sentences imposed by the District Court are summarized in our brief on pages 2 and 3. 
    The evidence showed that respondent Kordel was President of the corporation and the author of books and leaflets promoting its products and that he traveled across the country delivering lectures which were advertised and open to the public. 
    The writings and lectures claimed that specified ailments could alleviated by the consumption of certain foods and food elements and that the best sources of these were the products offered for sale by the corporation. 
    These products were sold in booths and/or near the lecture halls and were also available in health food stores generally. 
    Respondent Feldten acted as Kordel's assistant selling products at the lectures and taking orders for shipments from Detroit. 
    The criminal charges were that as to some of the products certain of the books and leaflets constituted part of the labeling and contained false and misleading statements. 
    And as to all of the counts on which respondents were convicted, the products which they claim to be merely food supplements were in fact drugs because they were intended by the defendants to be used for the prevention and treatment of various diseases and health conditions, and that the labeling of these products failed to set forth adequate directions for the uses for which they were intended as required by the act. 
    Since the oral representations made in respondent Kordel's public lectures were relevant in showing the uses for which the products were intended, tape recordings of his public lectures were introduced into evidence by the Government at the trial. 
    At this point, I believe a summary of the relevant procedural chronology will be helpful to the Court. 
    The indictment in this case was returned in the summer of 1963. 
    Previously, in June of 1960, the Government had filed a libel proceeding under Section 334 of the Act to condemn quantities of the corporation's products as misbranded. 
    The corporation appeared as claimant in this in rem proceeding and filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. 
    The parties then served interrogatories upon each other, pursuant to Rule 33 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. 
    The Government's interrogatories were served in January and April of 1961 and sought among other things detailed information about the labeling, testing, manufacture, and composition of certain of the products and about Kordel's oral representations concerning the efficacy of these products made during public lectures that he gave in Detroit. 
    In late January 1961, shortly after service of the Government's initial interrogatories, the corporation received a notice from the Government pursuant to Section 335 of the Act, indicating that criminal prosecution of the corporation and of respondents was contemplated in part for the same conduct that was the subject of the libel. 
    The corporation then in April 1961 moved that the District Court extend its time to respond to the interrogatories until final disposition of any criminal prosecution that might be brought. 
    The District Court denied this motion in June 1961, holding that their was no certainty, when or whether a criminal prosecution would be brought and that there is no prejudice in requiring the corporation to answer the interrogatories since the same information would otherwise become available to the Government in any event from the trial of the libel proceeding. 
    Pursuant to the Court's order, the corporation then filed answers to some of the interrogatories in September 1961 and filed specific objections to others. 
    In subsequent proceedings, some of the objections were sustained and some are overruled and the Government withdrew some of the interrogatories. 
    The corporation then answered the remaining interrogatories in September 1962. 
    Respondent Feldten subscribed to all of the corporation's answers as Vice President and stated that they were true to the best of his knowledge and belief, but that not all of the answers were known to him personally. 
    The libel proceeding thereafter terminated in a consent decree, entered in November 1962. 
    In June 1962, after service of the interrogatories and after the corporation's initial answers, but prior to its supplemental answers, the Food and Drug Administration referred the matter to the Department of Justice with the recommendation for criminal prosecution. 
    The indictment was returned in August 1963. 
    In March 1965, defendants in the criminal case moved to suppress any evidence obtained by the Government as a result of the corporation's answers to the interrogatories in the libel proceeding or in the alternative for a hearing to determine the Government's motive in bringing the civil action and serving the interrogatories. 
    The District Court granted the alternative request for a hearing which lasted three days. 
    The transcript of the hearing, set forth in the appendix at pages 58 to 290, showed that at the time the civil case was filed, the Food and Drug Administration already had evidence sufficient in its judgment to establish all the elements of the criminal violations, but had not yet decided whether to recommend criminal prosecution that the agency determined that the in rem seizure proceeding should be commenced promptly in order to prevent harm to the public from continued distribution of the misbranded drugs. 
    And that the interrogatories were designed solely for the purposes of the civil suit and were submitted as they are routinely in such suits in an effort to narrow the issues for trial and in the hope of laying the foundation for a motion for summary judgment or possibly inducing the corporation to agree to a consent decree by demonstrating the insubstantiality of its case which is what eventually happened. 
    The District Court held on the basis of this hearing that the governmental decisions to commence the civil suit and to serve the interrogatories were made in good faith and not for the purpose of procuring evidence for a criminal prosecution, and the conviction followed. 
    And while not disagreeing with these findings, the Court of Appeals reversed respondent's convictions on the ground that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination of the individual criminal defendants have been violated by requiring the corporation to answer the interrogatories in the civil proceeding. 
    The Court held that it was constitutionally insufficient that the Government had acted in good faith in the civil proceeding and that none of the answers to the interrogatories had been introduced into evidence in the criminal case. 
    It held that the Government must also prove that it had not in anyway utilized for purposes of the criminal case, information or leads obtained from the answers to the interrogatories. 
    In its initial opinion, the Court of Appeals also reversed the corporation's conviction, but on the Government's petition for rehearing, it modified its opinion in judgment so as to affirm that conviction on the ground that the privilege against self-incrimination is available under this Court's decisions only to natural persons and not to a corporation. 
    A petition for certiorari by the corporation was denied by this Court and a petition for rehearing is presently pending. 
    We contend, first, that the Court of Appeals aired in holding that respondents privilege against self-incrimination had been violated. 
    Neither of the respondents had interposed any claim to the seized drugs, nor did either of them have a personal property interest in the drugs. 
    Neither of them was party to the civil action. 
    Neither of them was obligated or required to answer any of the interrogatories served on the corporation in that proceeding, and indeed, respondent Kordel supplied no answers. 
    And respondent Feldten who did submit answers on behalf of the corporation stated therein that the truth of the answers was not known to him personally, so the answers did not constitute an admission on his part. 
    And finally, neither respondent in anyway claimed that his privilege was being violated when respondent Feldten submitted the answers on behalf of the corporation. 
    The explicit language of Rule 33 dealing with interrogatories and the decisions implementing the rule make clear that when a corporation is the party served with interrogatories, the corporation is obligated to appoint an agent who without fear of self-incrimination can furnish such requested information as is available to the corporation. 
    No claim was made in the libel proceeding that answers to any of the questions were not available to the corporation within the meaning of the rule because the only repositories of the information were individuals who might incriminate themselves by disclosing it. 
    No individual is required under the rule to submit any answer on the corporation's behalf that might tend to incriminate him personally. 
    But the corporation which under this Court's decisions has no privilege against self-incrimination and cannot invoke the privilege of any individual on its behalf remains obligated under the rule to provide such requested information as is available to it. 
    To the extent that this obligation with the attendant risk that failure of the corporation to comply might result in a judgment forfeiting the corporation's property constitutes compulsion. 
    It is compulsion of the corporation which has no privilege and not of the respondents as officers or shareholders of the corporation. 
    To hold otherwise would be to overrule Campbell Painting Corporation against Reid in volume 392 U.S. and its predecessor decisions because compulsion of a corporation to provide possibly incriminating information can always be said to amount to compulsion of its individual officers or shareholders. 
    They cannot utilized the corporate form of doing business and yet claim a personal interest in the corporation's property only for purposes of the Fifth Amendment privilege. 
    That is the meaning of these Court's decisions and it was error in our view for the Court of Appeals to hold to the contrary.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    We have also addressed our brief to the broader concern which seems to underlie the decision of the Court of Appeals the question of fairness in the administration by Government agencies in this and other fields of their responsibilities under statutes which provide for the possibility of both civil and criminal remedies against defending corporations or individuals. 
    Our brief discusses the practices and experiences of several agencies and articulates some general criteria which seem to us to be suggested by the leading cases in this field. 
    And we also discuss the matter to which I would now like to turn our contention that there was no unfairness in the administration of the food and drug laws in this case. 
    There was in the first place an important need to protect the public from harm here as is frequently true in food and drug or in securities fraud cases for that matter, by commencing the civil proceedings promptly. 
    It was at the very least reasonable for the responsible officials to decide that this protection of the public should not await determination of whether a criminal prosecution would also be appropriate, let alone final disposition of any criminal proceeding that might be instituted. 
    Moreover, it was important to proceed to judgment in the condemnation case because Congress has for good reasons referred to in our brief, provided in Section 334 of the Act set forth at pages 26 and 27 of our brief that the Government must obtain a favorable judgment in a forfeiture case before it can proceed by multiple seizures against traditional quantities of the drugs being marketed elsewhere. 
    The interrogatories served on the corporation were found after a hearing to have been designed in good faith for the legitimate purpose of expediting the civil suit to judgment. 
    The questions asked were relevant to the issues in the civil proceeding even though, the Court of Appeals seem to believed that some of them were not apparently because it did not appreciate the bearing of respondent Kordel's oral representations of the public lectures on the theory of the Government civil case, which dependent on proof of the uses for which the products being marketed by the corporation were intended. 
    In their brief, the respondents suggest a lack of fairness because the Government could have utilized an alternative procedure of seeking interim injunctive relief instead of the libel in rem. 
    But the same interrogatories would have been equally irrelevant to establishing the Government's case in an injunctive proceeding. 
    Moreover, a judgment in an in rem proceeding provides more effective protection of the public because it enables the Government expeditiously to prevent further dissemination of the misbranded drugs by anyone holding them for sale. 
    A final indication of the Government's fairness in this case is to be found in the fact that shortly after service of the initial interrogatories and prior to the corporation's answering of them, the Government notified the corporation pursuant to Section 335 of the Act, that criminal prosecution of respondents and the corporation was being considered. 
    Respondents could thus judge whether providing answers to the interrogatories on behalf of the corporation might tend to incriminate them and indeed the not very revealing answers actually furnished and set forth in the appendix suggests that this consideration did not escape their attention.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1336.540" stopTime="1340.671">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Was that notice of the criminal proceedings required by the statute or was it?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1340.671" stopTime="1438.657">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    It is required by the statute in Section 335, Title 21 Your Honor. 
    We do not rest, however, on a contention that the Government learned nothing from these answers, a matter as to which it is generally difficult to sustain a burden of proof such as the Court of Appeals here imposed. 
    Our position is that because the interrogatories were used properly and fairly in a good faith civil suit for the legitimate purposes of that suit, there is no more reason for preventing the Government from basing a criminal investigation on information learned thereby, than there would be for preventing it from basing an investigation on information legitimately revealed in the course of any other good faith civil proceeding whether between private parties or similarly involving the Government as a party. 
    Exclusionary rules in their various permutations have after all been held by this Court to be required only where otherwise relevant and competent evidence has been illegally or improperly obtained. 
    And in our view, it would ill serve the cause of justice for the Court now to depart from that principle and we therefore ask that the judgment below be reversed.

    What you considered there, I think in new cases of corporate privilege that causes involvement or absence to the Court's privilege is about when the rationality of the Court of Appeals' decision here could be brought on neglect or certification in this with that --

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well, the case has been relied upon in litigation. 
    In securities fraud cases for example. 
    I'd been informed by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, I think that the food and drug and the securities areas are the ones in which the problem is most likely to arise because they are the areas in which the Government agencies most frequently find it necessary to proceed quickly with civil proceedings before a determination can be made as to whether criminal prosecution is warranted.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well surely, the result would have been justified if the in rem proceeding had been brought in bad faith merely as a device for securing evidence to be used in the criminal proceeding or as an improper instrument of criminal investigation. 
    I think if the hearing had showed that and there had been a finding to that effect, then the result would have been justified, although, we can't accept the rational that the violation was of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.

    I think Your Honor the answer to that question is that at that point, they would have been a choice which they could make. 
    If they had testified, they would have been deemed to have waived their privilege. 
    In the instant case, they sought relief in the form of a protective order and then were ordered, that is to say as they would argue the corporation which happens to be the same two individuals, the corporation was ordered to answer the questions

    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    Mr. Chief Justice, in all of the cases that I've found on this, what has happened in the usual case and in almost every case is that the civil Court will stay the trial of that case pending the outcome of the criminal case if in fact the criminal case is either pending or eminent. 
    Now --

    But what if it's neither?
speaker="solomon_h_friend" startTime="1974.834" stopTime="1995.469">
    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    There are cases would say that if it's neither, if the Government does not have under contemplation of bringing of a criminal case, then there are cases which say that while the defendant must answer the question the civil case in the interests of fairness and to avoid abuse, the Government may not use those answers in the criminal case.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assuming if it gets to background of the Fifth Amendment problem?
speaker="solomon_h_friend" startTime="1999.498" stopTime="2127.820">
    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    No. 
    No, Mr. Justice White. 
    The cases go on the broader theory that it is inherently unfair for either the defendant in a civil case to try and get the Government's evidence by use of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure where there is a threatened criminal case or a pending criminal case. 
    And for the Government to interpose, propose interrogatories to the defendant to try to get the defendant's defense or evidence which will support the prosecution. 
    And as a matter of fact, in the cases cited on our brief, in our brief, under the anti trust laws and as well as under the Internal Revenue Service laws, the case United States against Linen Supply Institute of greater New York, the Government had moved to extend its time and sought a protective order, just as we did, from being required to answer interrogatories which had been propounded to it by the defendant in the civil case and argued the very the same argument which we make, at least one of the arguments which we make here, namely that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should not be used by either side, where there is a criminal case pending, so as to draw from the use of the federal rules information which they would not be entitled to under the criminal rules. 
    Now, we don't say and nor did the Court find, in fact the Court of Appeals specifically held that the Government may bring a civil and a criminal case simultaneously if the statute so provides. 
    But as we read the Court of Appeals' holding, they are saying that the strike a fair bounce between the need of the Government to obtain answers to interrogatories to pursue its remedies civilly, while that would be sufficient. 
    They could use the answers in a civil case. 
    They should not be allowed to use those answers in the criminal case. 
    They may bring their criminal case but they should not be allowed to use those answers because then we have a virtually uncontrolled situation where both sides, where there is a--

    Whether this is a really an argument that to the extent that there maybe discovery in a criminal prosecution.

    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    Our position would be that if the Government had at that time a pending criminal proceeding, they should not seek to elicit through the use of interrogatories in a case which is identical to the criminal case.

    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    Well, I most respectfully disagree with that suggestion Mr. Justice White because even the District Court felt and the Court of Appeals made express findings with respect to this point that what they sought was not corporate documents, but what they sought was admissions concerning activities of Kordel. 
    Now as Your Honor we'll recall the Solicitor made the point that the acts which misbranded these drugs were books which have been writing by Kordel, lectures which he had given. 
    There wasn't anything intrinsically wrong with the label itself. 
    The drug was not adulterated. 
    There was not a non-safe or poisonous substance being sold and what they did is that they choose the pierce the corporate veil themselves by the interrogatories which they answered.

    Let me ask you a question. 
    Suppose you had a civil case started, no criminal case in completion or investigation and the testimony in the trial of the civil case satisfied the prosecutor that there was a criminal case which could be made out and then he got an indictment after the disposition of the civil case. 
    Would you make these same claims?

    Mr. Solomon H. Friend

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But then does the constitutional question you're arguing depend upon the motivation of the prosecutor in pressing the civil case first?
speaker="solomon_h_friend" startTime="2392.542" stopTime="2495.599">
    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I do not believe a pursuit of the motive or the good faith or the lack of good faith is a fruitful inquiry for this reason. 
    In every case, where there was a criminal case pending or threatened that's parallel to a civil case. 
    It can always be argued by the Government that at least one of the motives in serving the interrogatories is to lay the ground work for summary judgment or narrow the issues and indeed, the filing of a civil case under the food and drug law is a relatively simple and common place function. 
    As a matter of fact, what happened in this case is after they filed the civil case, they did nothing to protect the public interest either by an injunction and of course if they had all the evidence anyway which they say had to bring a criminal case, they most certainly could have moved in with the temporary restraining order to restrain shipments which would have dried up the source of materials they wouldn't have to make multiple seizures. 
    Secondly, they never made multiple seizures. 
    The case was settled by a consent decree containing Exculpatory Clause in which they admit it that nothing within the -- within that civil case would be deemed as an admission against defendants that they violated the law, and then by using the interrogatory, the answers to the interrogatories, I'd like to talk about that for a moment, by using the interrogatories, they accomplished exactly that which they said would not be implied by the end of the year of the consent decree namely the admission of guilt or evidence or leads to/from evidence concerning guilt.

    The Court of Appeals -- I do as a matter of fact, I have a petition for rehearing of that denial the petition for certiorari as to the corporation which was filed in June and which is still pending before the Court. 
    And one of the arguments we made in the petition rehearing is, that if we're right on this other point of unfairness, that is to say if the Court of Appeals is sustained on grounds broader perhaps than what they specifically articulated, then that would justify a reversal of the Court of Appeals' affirmance with respect to the corporation and I suspect that perhaps, that's one of the reasons why our motion petition for rehearing is still pending because there is a relationship between the two cases.

    As I read Boyd, Mr. Justice Brennan, the holding of Boyd or the language in Boyd is somewhat broader than the Fourth or Fifth Amendment.

    It's an unreasonable search and seizure and the District Court and I know --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But did not -- but did not this Court in the Boyd case emphasized with great particularity that it was private papers, private papers that were being seized and cited a British Judge from a couple of 100 years before that man's private papers are among his most -- that his dearest possession, some language of that kind. 
    Now, you don't have private papers here, do you?
speaker="solomon_h_friend" startTime="2678.371" stopTime="2742.840">
    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    Mr. Chief Justice, the case did deal with private papers. 
    But there is language in the Boyd case which the District Judge in our case, who ruled against the us on this motion to suppress by the way, felt, suggests that the Boyd holding is broader than a Fifth Amendment or private papers in that, it's basically unfair. 
    It's violative of the public policy which is rooted, this is their language, rooted in historical and several concepts of Anglo-Saxon criminal jurisprudence that a defendant or a prospective defendant should not be required to disclose evidence to sustain the prosecution against them in a criminal case or his evidence of defense and in the fair case and in any number of cases, they make the point that this is not a manner of Fifth Amendment. 
    It's broader than the possible violation of a privilege of self-incrimination and that the issue is also whether the methods employed --

    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    Well, Mr. Justice Black, I think the standard here would be when one views the facts. 
    No different from what the standard was in the McNab case or in the Reid case. 
    What happen here, I think this should be stressed, is that the interrogatories were prepared by Mr. Josh Randolph of the Food and Drug Administration at the same time that he prepared a notice, notifying the defendants, all of the defendants including the corporation that their investigation revealed defendants' responsibility for criminal violations of the Act. 
    Now this notice said, just that it, it didn't say we have it under considerations. 
    It says, our investigation, this is on page 105 in our appendix in the brief, investigation by this administration indicates your responsibility for violation of the act, and then they spell out the violation. 
    Now, the same individual who was investigating and this was Mr. Randolph's testimony, he was in charge of the investigation the criminal case and he was in charge of preparing the interrogatories in a civil case.

    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    No, sir. 
    No, mister -- the interrogatories were answered in September, but because the motion had been made in the meantime to stay the answering of these interrogatories. 
    But what happened was, when he got the answers, he then made a recommendation, his second recommendation to indict that the defendants be indicted and to refer the matter to the Department of Justice, this within a matter of a week or two and as the record shows in discussing the matter with the Food and Drug Administration official in Detroit, Mr. Randolph being in Washington, he made it a point of telling the FDA official in Detroit who was handling the civil case on the local scene to be sure to send him the answers to the interrogatories. 
    And when he said he would, and did, he then called Mr. Fowler in Detroit and told Mr. Fowler the he'd liked the send out another notice of criminal violation which is the fourth notice which they sent out, which now broadened the first three, they actually sent three out almost at the same time but the fourth one was sent out after they've had the answers and a second recommendation was made to indict these defendants.

    Well, I think the narrow -- the technical holding of Boyd was the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment as I read the case Mr. Justice Black and the District Court here apparently felt that it's even broader than that.

    What's unfair if somebody has violated the law and you have no legal standard which says its not unfair, what's unfair about the Government trying to get facts even by asking a defendant, you said supposed to be to violate the law, outside of the provision to the Constitution, what's unfair about it?

    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    Well, McNab was not decided on any constitutional provision as I recall the McNab case.

    But it was decided, was it not, under the criminal, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and I should think in answer to Mr. Justice Black, we are of course, sworn to uphold and force the Constitution but there are also are statutes and in with particular reference to this case, there are Federal Rules of Civil Procedure created, promulgated, and laid down by this Court. 
    And I suppose that there are somewhere irrelevance too and they're laid down for civil cases and the very specific standard to which it seems to me you can repair in this case is those Federal Rules of Civil Procedure having to do with interrogatories and pretrial discovery that are made for civil cases explicitly, the rules laid down by this Court and are not to be abused or taken advantage of for abuse that wrong use in criminal cases.

    Except Mr. Chief Justice that in this case, they would deny us that protection because they say, technically the interrogatories were directed to the corporation which doesn't enjoy the privilege, and we say, and the Court held below that Kordel was the dominant personality, the corporation was merely a device, an instrumentality through which he sold his products, that the interrogatories would directed in his activities and that since they choose to get this information about him by asking a corporation the questions in effect since they have breeched the corporate veil and the questions that they asked, they shouldn't be permitted to repair that breech to deny Kordel his Fifth Amendment privilege and --

speaker="solomon_h_friend" startTime="3427.594" stopTime="3507.406">
    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    He did not assert it but I think a more complete answer Your Honor would be that he did not waive it either because of the motion that was made at the time to excuse him from being or excuse the corporation from being required to answered the question. 
    Now, what they say Kordel should have done? 
    They admit Kordel and Feldten had the Fifth Amendment privilege. 
    They didn't have to answer, but they say and this is the crux of their case, they say that the corporation should have appointed a third party, some agent, to answer the questions and in effect what they're saying is, of course the corporation could only act through a human being, they're saying that Kordel, who would himself had a privilege not to answer, should have appointed that an agent and then supplied him with the information to answer the questions which he himself would have been privileged to withhold. 
    And they go so far as to say that there is an agent available, why is the corporations' Attorney, who happens to be me, that what I should do is sign the answers to the -- sign the answers to the interrogatories in behalf of the corporation. 
    But the only way that I could get the information available to the corporation is by asking my client, Mr. Kordel, the President of the corporation as to whom they sought admissions.

    They didn't need the admissions either to lay the basis for summary judgment or to press forth on the case before it because is -- if they have all these evidence, they can go back and retry the case without too much difficulty.

    Mr. Friend, I have one question for this.
speaker="solomon_h_friend" startTime="3576.571" stopTime="3576.894">
    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3576.894" stopTime="3595.172">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's not, if you don't mind, it is not -- it clear to me, what use was in fact made of the material that was acquired by means of this pretrial discovery in the civil litigation. 
    What use was made of that material in the subsequent criminal trial?
speaker="solomon_h_friend" startTime="3595.172" stopTime="3689.227">
    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    The Court of Appeals answered that question and I'd like to refer to the Court to not only with the Court of Appeals said but the actual transcript. 
    On page 142 and 143, I asked the question of the witness as to whether they anticipated difficulty in proving interstate commerce with respect to the principle product known as “Korleen” and the answer was that they had difficulty proving interstate commerce with respect to Korleen manufactured by a different manufacturer. 
    But with respect to the manufacturer that was involved in this case, they wouldn't have such difficulty because they have the answers to the interrogatories. 
    Secondly, the fact of the matter is that these answers to the interrogatories, which they say was not necessary to get the indictment, was brought into the grand jury room as part of one file which they had -- to which they had put both the civil and the criminal aspects and the results of their investigation, that appears on page 192 and 193 where I asked the witness, and isn't true that you used to assists you in your testimony with the grand jury almost all the papers that were in that one file which had combined the civil and the criminal case? 
    Answer: I reviewed the entire file before I went before the grand jury, yes, sir. 
    I had it with me and I used it in preparing for the grand jury, yes sir.

    That the interstate --

    That part was directed to the trial?
speaker="solomon_h_friend" startTime="3694.191" stopTime="3768.385">
    Mr. Solomon H. Friend 
    That was prior to the trial but with respect to the interstate commerce. 
    When we identified the manufacturer of the Korleen, that evidence was introduced into the trial not on the form of answer to the interrogatory, that's true, but the information which they believe and the final answer is, in the Court of Appeals make straights laid great stress on this, it had been the practice of the FDA for 38 years, a practice by the way which is received a great deal of criticism in the administrative law review journal and other members of a food and drug bar, a practice whereby they bring a relatively simple procedure to follow a civil case, do nothing to protect the public either by summary judgment, multiple seizures or what have you. 
    And then, put everything in a one case into one file and indict it first and that's what happened here and as the rights would inure to the benefit of the corporation under these circumstances as well as the individual because it's inherently unfair and uphold to the form of criminal procedure which we would like to see in our land to allow the Government to use --

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    The Government did not make multiple seizures eventually in this case and in administering food and drug laws the Government tries to avoid making multiple seizures of products that are not harmful in themselves. 
    But the availability of multiple seizures as a sanction after in a misbranding case, a favorable judgment is procured and a forfeiture proceeding can served as an inducement to get a consent decree that will eliminate the misbranding which is what we were seeking to do in this case and not to forfeit someone's property that in the absence of the misbranding should be allowed to be disseminated. 
    The record does not show to what extent Kordel and the corporation should be considered to be altered egos in the situation that was involved here, but it does show that the corporation never made any claim that the information requested was not available to it within the meaning of Rule 33 because only Kordel knew the information and he didn't want to disclose it. 
    The corporation never made that claim.
