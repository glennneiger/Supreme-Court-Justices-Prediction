Morris v. Schoonfield

    Number 782, Morris against Schoonfield.

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    May it please the Court. 
    My name is Robert Fisher. 
    I represent a class of plaintiff appellants. 
    The class is defined as those people who are incarcerated in the Baltimore City Jail and we have defined it as a continuing class. 
    We brought this action in July 1968 and there are currently about a 150 people in the Baltimore City Jail under the statute that we are attacking. 
    This case is different from the Williams case that the Court has just heard, in that there, only I -- and unusual application of the jail or fine statute was being contested. 
    The situation where the judge gives both the maximum jail sentence and a fine, and the person is required to serve more than the maximum amount allowed. 
    Our case covers all types of incarceration for non-payment of fines except the contumacious refusal to pay situation. 
    We're not concerned with that. 
    Our case involves a two-dollar rate instead of a five-dollar rate. 
    It is a mandatory rate as the statute says the judge shall commit him and then pursuant to the terms of the statute, then the statute provides a two-dollar rate.

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    That's right Your Honor. 
    The new statute should be enforced, but it is not. 
    I called the Chief Judge of the Municipal Court of Baltimore City yesterday, and he said he had never heard of the new statute. 
    He asked me to send him a copy which I did. 
    I called the jail and they said they had not heard of the new statute and that nobody was getting out under it. 
    The new statute by the way just gives a judicial remedy. 
    It does not say that everybody who's committed under the old statute should get out, and only gives them a right to apply to the justice that committed them for re-determination under the new statute and it does not guarantee that we -- they will get out.

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    That's right. 
    If Your Honor, it gives a potential remedy, but it doesn't require that they be notified of the existence of the remedy and the Chief Judge of the municipal court doesn't know about it a week after it was passed.

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    Yes it does Your Honor --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="248.032" stopTime="251.607">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    This does involve the traffic offense so that we are talking about --
speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="251.607" stopTime="341.395">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    That's right. 
    I'm aware of the colloquy before me and I notice that the Attorney General of Illinois said that it would be disastrous because there'd be no way to compel people to pay traffic fines, it serves a very good way of compelling people to pay traffic fines, and that is to take away their license if they don't pay the fine, and they're other traffic remedies. 
    So I -- let me explain how we got here. 
    I have very little time, and then maybe I can start of with my argument on the equal protection and due process, cruel and unusual punishment, excessive fines and involuntary servitude when we come back after lunch. 
    We commenced this action under 42 United States Code, Section 1983 for an injunction of the warden of the Baltimore City Jail from -- to restrain him from holding people unconstitutionally detained, and for a declaratory judgment that the statute is unconstitutional on its face. 
    The District Court held that the statute was constitutional on its face, but that it was unconstitutional as applied in two respects. 
    In the first place, it said it was --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="341.395" stopTime="356.895">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I think we'll suspend for lunch now Mr. Fisher and pick up after lunch. 
    [Luncheon Break] 
    Mr. Fisher, you may pick up where you left off.
speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="356.895" stopTime="500.378">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    Where I left off Your Honor was the decision of the three-judge District Court. 
    It upheld the Maryland $2.00 a day statute as constitutional on its face, but it held that in each case, the sentencing judge had to hold a hearing to allow persons to be committed to tell a judge about their indigency and give him an opportunity to decide whether or not do reduce the fine or to put them on probation or to allow them to pay in installments or to commit them. 
    And it also held that as the statute was being applied with respect to costs at that particular time, the statute was unconstitutional. 
    For costs of people who were not being jailed, for costs in all cases, but they were in some cases and under the Rinaldi versus Yeager case, this was a discrimination and denial of equal protection, and at that particular time, the statute could not constitutionally be applied in the State of Maryland to jail people for non-payment of costs. 
    We have appealed from the statute under -- from this decision under the authority of Article XXVIII, Section 1253, and our basic contention in this Court boils down really to one premise, and that is that one 24-hour day in jail with all of that entails in terms of the stigma in the community and that fact the man may loose his job, the fact that man maybe subjected to the unpleasant experiences of the jail, one 24-hour a day in jail does not equal dollars. 
    The poor man is being punished more severely than the rich man if the rich pays $2.00 and the poor man goes to jail for 24-hour a day. 
    We submit that this goes to the -- initial is so fundamental that it's written in stone on the front of this Court House, equal justice under law.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="500.378" stopTime="525.754">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How far would that argument go? 
    Let's assume a $10.00 fine on a person and that person -- all that all that person possessed in the world is $10.00 as compared to a $10.00 fine on a person who had a million dollars. 
    Now That would be unequal protection, wouldn't it, under your standard?
speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="525.754" stopTime="541.513">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    Well, the way our society looks at the man who has paid the fine is different from the way our society looks at the man who's going to jail. 
    The man who's going to jail is a criminal. 
    The man who has paid the fine as somebody who might have gotten a traffic ticket.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="541.513" stopTime="549.783">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that's not what the Maryland legislature has said. 
    Maryland legislature said they are equivalent.
speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="549.783" stopTime="550.369">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    It's -- they are not --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="550.369" stopTime="556.383">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's the way society as represented in the Maryland legislature disagrees with you, doesn't it?
speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="556.383" stopTime="598.767">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    Well, no. 
    The Maryland legislature has another purpose in passing the statute and that is compel people with money to pay. 
    The Maryland legislature has deliberately made the alternative to non-payment a harsher penalty so that people will choose the -- who with money will choose the alternative of paying and that's the dominant -- we submit, that's the only purpose behind the statute. 
    The other side disagrees, but that a certainly the dominant purpose of this statute. 
    The legislative history makes that clear to collect money from those who can't pay by threatening them with jail. 
    Now --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="598.767" stopTime="603.126">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And by jailing those who don't pay, isn't that correct?
speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="603.126" stopTime="622.776">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    If you jail those who don't pay, you're punishing a man unfairly in a greater amount than the judge adjudicated in order to make somebody else pay. 
    He's a sacrificial goat so to speak for the man who doesn't want to pay and has being made to pay and we submit this --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="622.776" stopTime="636.792">

    What's to happen to the scofflaw who collects dozens and dozens of parking tickets in his friend's automobile and who hasn't got a nickel to his name?

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    We have an intervener in this case who's in that very position. 
    He had something like $1,200.00 worth of fine. 
    He was a scofflaw. 
    He was a school teacher. 
    He went to jail for -- he would have gone to jail, but for this case for over a year, whereas another scofflaw who had $1,200.00 would not have gone to jail at all. 
    The school teacher lost his right to teach school. 
    He can never teach school in the State of Maryland again because they found out; they found out that he had been sent to jail. 
    The man who pays the $1,200.00 because he's got a -- they never find that out.

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    I think that as a matter of wisdom, the State of Maryland should provide a statute that sends scofflaws of all kinds to jail. 
    If scofflaw should be sent to jail, all scofflaws should be sent to jail and the State of Maryland can make that decision, and I think it should have made that decision. 
    What the State of Maryland cannot do is ruin the career of one's scofflaw in order to make another scofflaw pay.

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    He didn't have $1,200.00 on the day that he was supposed to pay.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="767.617" stopTime="773.683">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Of course, the law afforded him an opportunity to pay it installment in the first instance?

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    No, it did not.

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    Oh, no, he did not, that's true. 
    He did -- the law afforded him an opportunity not to commit a crime.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
    It afforded him an opportunity to pay two, four or $6.00 each time he got the tickets, that's what I'm talking about. 
    And now, you suggest that there's something inherently unfair about the fact that the boom was lowered on him finally at the $1,200.00 mark?

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    I think there's something unfair -- apparently unfair that the boom was lowered on him when it was not lowered on somebody else who led his traffic tickets accumulate. 
    Two people, justice has taken her blindfold off and look at this man and the only thing that she has seen that's different from the other man as the fact that he doesn't have $1,200.00 today.

    Mr. Fisher, well, we have you stopped for a moment. 
    I can sympathize with your arguments about $2.00 a day for 24-hour a day. 
    What if the Maryland legislature had said that it should be tied to the minimum wage established by the Department of Labor which I think is a $1.60 an hour now, isn't it? 
    If that so, that'd be $38.48. 
    Suppose they fixed it to that and you got $38.48 credit on a fine for every 24 hours he served in jail, would you have problems?

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    I would still have problems, but I would have less problems. 
    What Your Honor is suggesting is a sort of a separate but equal doctrine whereas a man without money is punished separately and -- in a way that's suppose to be equivalent. 
    And because of the other problems that attend the jail punishment, I don't think that it's possible to equate jail punishment and the fine punishment. 
    But certainly, that would be a much better situation than we have here where we have a $2.00 statute which is designed to be unequal, because it's really designed to compel the person with the money to pay. 
    This statute cannot simultaneously have the two purposes that had been advanced for it, one to equate jail and time and fine money and two, to compel people who don't have money to pay -- that do have money to pay.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Because the premise of the latter proposition is that it's much easier to -- to go to jail is much more unpleasant than to pay.

    That they're not equal?
speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="1151.417" stopTime="1179.399">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    That's right. 
    Now, what Your Honor is suggesting is that the state might design a new statute. 
    Actually, they have attempted to do it. 
    I think the State of Maryland has recognized the unconstitutionality of this statute in passing the new statute and they have attempted to improve upon it and they have raised the figure to $10.00 a day. 
    What Your Honor is suggesting that that is certainly more equal and better, but it is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1179.399" stopTime="1184.783">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No. 
    Isn't really dusting it Mr. Fisher, I want to know what you have to say about it?
speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="1184.783" stopTime="1338.954">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    Well, what I say is its more equal but it still no equal. 
    It's a type of separate but equal doctrine that that just cannot be equated. 
    Now, there are other things that the state can do in order to punish the man or deter the man that are more equal to a fine that he cannot -- that one of the arguments that's been raised says there's no way that the state can punish these people; no way that they can deter them and that just is not true. 
    There are other things that can be done. 
    One that we've suggested is that man can be allowed to pay in installments. 
    This is actually fulfilling the sentence of the judge who sentenced them. 
    He wanted them to pay a fine. 
    He thought that was the deterrent. 
    The state legislature provided that the judge could fine him. 
    They expected him to use his best judgment in deciding what was appropriate. 
    He decided the fine was appropriate and the way that he can carry out the state legislature's intent in the situation is to allow the man to pay on terms that he can pay. 
    This is certainly a more equal alternative. 
    Now, suppose the man cannot pay, he can still put him in jail as the model penal code suggests, if the man fails to make a showing that he has made reasonable efforts to make the money, get the money. 
    In that case, they'll be putting him in jail for contempt or for some additional act or omission, he can take away his driver's license. 
    As the Rinaldi versus Yeager case suggested, they can garnish his salary if he has any or collect the judgment by attachment, probably not a feasible way of doing it. 
    They can put him on probation with conditions that he worked in the court house, you don't have to lock him up in maximum security in order to get some work out of him. 
    They can send him to driver's school. 
    I anticipate that Mr. Russell is going to talk about mootness and I would like to reserve some time so that I can answer whatever he has to say about the mootness. 
    So, I'm going to sit down at this point. 
   
   
   
   Argument of George L. Russell, Jr.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1338.954" stopTime="1343.034">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Russell.
speaker="george_l_russell_jr" startTime="1343.034" stopTime="1454.003">
    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    My brother is correct. 
    The first argument are intend to make is that this case is moot in light of the statute recently passed by the Maryland legislature as an emergency Bill in Title Chapter 147 and it was signed by Governor Mandel on the 15th of April. 
    This statute under Section 6 is retroactive in its application and therefore, the plaintiffs or the appellants in this case may take advantage of it. 
    It provides that any person incarcerated for default of payment of a fine may apply for a hearing or by general order of the court may have a hearing on his indigent status. 
    The court after conducting an inquiry if it finds that this individual is unable to pay the fine immediately, the court may provide installment payments. 
    If the court finds that installment payments are not feasible under the circumstances, then may offer to the defendant substitute punishment, and this is the theory under which Maryland has enacted its legislation. 
    The theory that there must be an alternative punishment appropriately imposed upon a defendant upon whom financial criminal sanctions would have no relevancy. 
    And in this case in the Maryland statute, the court cannot impose a confinement that exceeds $10.00 a day. 
    That is to state that the -- if the fine is $500.00 and the court finds that the defendant is indigent, it may state that I believe that one day in jail is sufficient, but the court cannot impose a sentence which would exceed $10.00 a day; that is the minimum that it can allow.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1454.003" stopTime="1455.762">

    When did that legislation become effective?

    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    April 15th, immediately upon signing by the governor and that is the reason that my brother anticipated the mootness statute because we propose that this is the law of the case under prior Supreme Court rulings. 
    Now as to the philosophy under which their substitute punishment --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1472.964" stopTime="1478.050">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    It would hardly be moot technically because they're still in the jail?

    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    Well, that is true.

    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    They have this remedy available to him upon application or by general order of the court. 
    That is to say the statute anticipates that perhaps the Chief Judge of the municipal court or the Chief Judge of the supreme bench of Baltimore City can by general order make this available for all of the --

    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    Except to the extent that substitute punishment as a philosophy is not a denial of equal protection of the law.

    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    I understood that my brother was raising the issue that the theory of substitute punishment is a denial of equal protection of the laws. 
    That is under any circumstances, if a man is indigent where the statute only provides as a penalty of fine, that it would be unconstitutional to give as an alternative punishment to an indigent man confined in jail.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1581.026" stopTime="1593.294">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well it makes no difference as to whether we agree with the petitioner or the Chief Judge of the supreme bench issues an order, either way, this petitioner that gets out if it?

    But the --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1622.443" stopTime="1631.487">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But the new law your point is, the new law with all its ameliorations nonetheless still does preserve the theory of substitute punishment?
speaker="george_l_russell_jr" startTime="1631.487" stopTime="1633.100">
    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    And this is the fair --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1633.100" stopTime="1641.212">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that if you understand your brother on the other side attacks continues to attack in that it is that that you're here to do -- to defend?
speaker="george_l_russell_jr" startTime="1641.212" stopTime="1753.458">
    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    Address myself to, yes sir. 
    Now, to get involve with the theory of substitute punishment, I think one must view first of all the function of the State of Maryland; that is to provide sanctions so that people will obey its criminal laws. 
    Now, we've created the class of people in Maryland, those who can pay fines and those who are too poor to pay fines. 
    And so that state has been left with the obligation to the overwhelming class in the state, the law abiding citizens to impose criminal sanctions to protect the law abiding citizens of Maryland from those who violate the laws of Maryland and do not have funds or intend to plead poverty as a defense to punishment. 
    Maryland in its judgment has stated that there shall be a substitute punishment or alternative punishment, and this was the theory of Judge Thompson's majority opinion, and the statute of course codified it. 
    Now, to the extent that my brother feels that Maryland has not been wise in its judgment, that there are other alternatives that the State of Maryland could've made, that may have been better, that may have been reach the problem better. 
    This Court has said time and time again that the equal protection of the laws does not require this Court to substitute its judgment for that of the Maryland legislature or indeed any state legislature as long as it meets the requirement of the constitution. 
    And as I understand it and I propose that the Equal Protection Clause requires only that the remedy be reasonable and that it be related to a legitimate state interest. 
    And in this case, deterrence of criminal activity or deterrence of the violation of criminal laws is a legitimate function of the state, and we believe that the alternative punishment is rationally related to it and under the cases that this law should be upheld.

    Now --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    By saying that everybody who violates this law goes to jail; that's one way of doing it, and that wouldn't violate the constitution?

    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    That may well be the result if the Court finds as that many cases upheld, particularly the New York case and it's been suggested in a Washington case that any conclusion that the alternative punishment theory is not constitutional would cause the kind of irreparable harm what would result from imprisonment for everyone.

    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    Oh, we have the authority that Chief Judge Thompson relied on the Privitera case. 
    You see, the approach as we view it Your Honor is whether the state has a legitimate interest in imposing sanctions on people who are unable to pay fines. 
    We simply cannot have a system of justice which would call for charge account justice where by a man would violate the law and then bleed poverty and simply tell the court to put it on the account, and this is what exactly would result, it would be application under the theory that has been offered by the court here.

    I don't assume that recidivist is a recidivist because he wants to be and did it deliberately.

    I would concur that this should not be assumed for pauper. 
    Man is poor from no fault but his own, but I must assume that he willfully violated the law and assuming that he willfully violated the law, he then should not be able to escape or be able to elect -- dictate the kind of punishment he uses, or as to incur and under the present Maryland statute, the court is given wide latitude as to the amount of confinement. 
    For instance, in the case where the statute provides only a fine that confinement shall not be more than 15 days. 
    However, it can be shorter time as the judge feels in his wise discretion that the case before him dictates.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2132.155" stopTime="2135.453">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Can the judge allow him to pay the fine on installments?
speaker="george_l_russell_jr" startTime="2135.453" stopTime="2322.745">
    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    That is provided in the statute also. 
    The commitment of a man is the last alternative that the court has before it. 
    Installment payments as a condition of probation, payment at once or the judge in his discretion and I'm speaking now where the statute calls only for fine because I do not deal with the problem where the statute provides for imprisonment, and the court and as the alternative makes a fine and commits him. 
    Our statute states that in that case, he shall not serve more than one-third of the term provided for imprisonment or 90 days whichever is less. 
    But the problem arises of course in the case where only a fine is provided as a penalty and I submit that it is not a denial of equal protection of the laws to offer to this man or to impose upon him an alternative punishment since he is unable because of his poverty which obtained about through no fault of his own and presumably for the purpose of this case to no fault at anyone. 
    Now, to do otherwise would be asking this Court or would as I believe the -- to ask -- the appellants would be asking this Court to correct every inequity that existed in our society because of the poverty that's there. 
    And while this is a praise worthy objective, I think it's the function -- I do not feel that it is a function of the court to interject and to substitute its judgment for the Maryland legislature how the poor the court may believe it they have been expressed. 
    Although, I submit that this is perhaps the most enlightening statute in the nation insofar as the punishment is concerned, I believe that the cases have held and this Court has held many times before that the court simply will not substitute its judgment. 
    Now, the sole question therefore as I view it is whether the alternative punishment theory is constitutional, not whether -- it is the best alternative that could be offered, but whether it is a meet the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause, and I say that it does because it's a reasonable classification, and secondly because it is related directly to a legitimate state interest. 
    The Court asked in the prior case about some statistics, and I thought that I would offer to the Court. 
    In Maryland, there are 99,000 traffic case is tried in one year. 
    Now, that is in Baltimore City and out of the 199,000, 157 were committed in default of payment of fines. 
    Now, we view it or offer that it's less than 0.3 % of those cases tried that people are incarcerated because they cannot pay the fines. 
    In some cases in the criminal courts of course, people are committed into fault to payment of fines, and then suddenly, the money arrives. 
    And they of course are given credit for the time that they've served and the balance is paid and their release is effective.

    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr.

    Mr. George L. Russell, Jr. 
    Well, my brother has indicated in his brief that he felt that the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution was violated as well as the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, and just to -- because I only have one appearance here, I would like to state that vis-a-vis these cases that we feel that the Maryland statute that we believe was the law of the case now, in anyway violates either those amendments to the constitution. 
    Involuntary servitude or slavery or cruel and inhuman punishment or nor do we have the problem of excessive fines here. 
    All of the fines imposed are within the statutory limits and I simply want to acknowledge that we have reacted to this argument in our briefs, and we'd be prepared to answer any questions on those particular issues. 
    But as to the Equal Protection Clause, I feel viewed in its totality and viewing the function and the duty that's states that have to its individual inhabitants to impose sanctions upon individuals and to determine the need to have sanctions and that this statutes meets the constitutional burden to the extent that it provides an alternative punishment for individuals who are unable to pay fines, and that this alternative punishment theory meets all of the requirements in constitution.

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    Your Honor, Mr. Russell and I are talking about different statutes. 
    He is defending the new statute and we're attacking the old statute. 
    There is nobody as far as I know that has been committed to jail in Maryland so far under the new statute. 
    The Chief Judge and the municipal court just found out about that statute, 2:30 yesterday afternoon from me. 
    There are a 150 people in jail today under the old statute.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2576.256" stopTime="2585.299">

speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="2585.299" stopTime="2613.667">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    It does not furnish any interpretation that I can see of the power to release these people by general order because one of the provisions of the new statute is that each case has to be decided on its own merits, and the $10.00 figure is only a minimum figure. 
    So, if the judge were to deal with all of these people by general order, he would be violating that part of the statutory scheme.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2613.667" stopTime="2629.492">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So let's lay aside the general order mechanism.

speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="2634.192" stopTime="2648.254">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    They do if they find out about it. 
    The statute doesn't provide that they're supposed to -- that they're to be notified. 
    They are indigents. 
    They don't have lawyers. 
    They're in jail where they don't have access to news media.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2648.254" stopTime="2655.822">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    Well, we representing the whole class of people who are defined as those people that are in the Baltimore City Jail, and those people that have detainers against them and we also submit that our request for declaratory judgment covers all of those people who have been in jail since the beginning of the lawsuit because they have an interest in this case. 
    So, the burden is always on the state -- on the party asserting mootness to prove it and they're in no position to assert mootness at this point. 
    In addition that the new statute would require these people to be re-sentenced in effect with the possibility that they could get a penalty that is more severe than the penalty they originally got, the fine and I submit that there are double jeopardy problems there and ex post facto law problems there. 
    So, this new statute simply is not a way out when you have people that are actually in jail under the old statute at this time and no evidence of the new statute has actually come into force other than up in the sky somewhere.

speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="2760.404" stopTime="2878.543">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    I submit that in the broad argument that I've made that jail could never be equated with money. 
    So, I would have to question it, but I'm not really questioning it today because I got a $2.00 statute and under no circumstances can $2.00 be equated with 24 hours. 
    So, I don't have to attack $10.00 and I'm in a much better position to attack $2.00. 
    There is no overriding state interest in punishing poor people at a greater rate than rich people in order to make rich people pay. 
    There is no overriding that justifies having justice take her blindfold off and give poor people a harsher penalty than the judge who was charge with the state law -- authorized by state law with determining the appropriate penalty determinant. 
    The state has other things that it can do to solve this problem. 
    I'm not asking this Court to tell the state what to do. 
    There are many different alternatives. 
    I'm not asking this Court to spell out for the state what they are. 
    I'm not -- I suggest an analogy that the constitution is the foundation of our justice system, and that state penal system is the structure that the state builds upon that foundation. 
    In this case, the system the state has built is off of the foundation of equal justice under law, and it is properly the role of this Court to establish that foundation.

speaker="robert_g_fisher" startTime="2995.574" stopTime="3025.359">
    Mr. Robert G. Fisher 
    It certainly would not be equal. 
    I think that poor people should be punished in some way. 
    I'm saying the state must find an equal way of punishing them. 
    It certainly cannot find a grossly unequal way of punishing them when it is not necessary to do so, and it has no compelling interest in punishing these people more severely than other people that are equally guilty of the same offense.

    As a matter of fact, the Court in Stratman v. Stad stated that it would be a denial of equal protection to let the poor man go and I'm not suggesting that he be let go. 
    I'm suggesting that the best thing to do is to do what the judge decided should be done, to find a way to make him pay his fine, and that can be done. 
    Your Honor asked the question in the previous argument about whether the new statute will be counter productive, where there a judge would start sending people to jail. 
    I think we have to assume that judges will act the way judges are suppose to act and keep their -- the blindfold on as far as the person's poverty is concerned, and that they will be sentence people fairly and judicially, even though they may under some new scheme not be able to send them to jail for non-payment of a fine. 
    So, I don't think -- I see my time is up.
