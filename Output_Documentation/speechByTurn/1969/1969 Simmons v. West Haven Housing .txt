    Mr. Dineen.
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="23.203" stopTime="260.785">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    My name is Francis X. Dineen. 
    I represent the appellants in this matter. 
    Jurisdiction of this Court has invoked under 28 United States Code, Section 1257, Subsection 2 because of the fact that the constitutionality of a state statute as an issue. 
    And by the decision of the appellate division of the State of Connecticut, the constitutionality of that state statute has been upheld. 
    The Supreme Court of Connecticut denied our petition for certification and so the appeal to this Court is from the appellant's division of the Circuit Court. 
    The facts of this case involve a relatively ordinary eviction action which was commenced in July of 1967. 
    Thereafter, pleadings were filed and defenses were raised and in fact seven special defenses were raised to the eviction action that was brought. 
    In January of 1968, a trial took place. 
    On January 16, judgment was entered for the landlord, the Housing Authority of West Haven. 
    Thereafter on January 18, our appeal from that judgment was filed with the Appellate Division. 
    At that time, pursuant to Section 52-542 of the Connecticut General Statutes, it was required that we file with the court a bond with a surety to cover the rents that might accrue during the pendency of the appeal. 
    And in order to file that bond, on behalf of our clients, we went to several surety companies asking them what they would require to go on the bond as a surety. 
    The bond in this case because the rent was $72.00 per month would have been approximately something in the nature of $400.00 to $500.00 or even more dollars for this bond. 
    In fact, that case that we have cited in our brief, in which the rent was approximately the same as our rent, the trial court had ordered that a bond in the amount of $700.00 be filed in that particular case. 
    So that in any event, our bond would've been something in the nature of $500.00 to $700.00. 
    And this again, is to covered the rents that would accrue during the pendency of the appeal. 
    The surety companies that we approached asking that they own this bond with us, demanded full cash collateral before they would sign a bond as well as demanding their fee. 
    This was impossible for our clients to pay. 
    They were poor and they didn't have that kind of money. 
    So, we went to the trial court and by motion on our client's behalf to waive the surety bond. 
    We stated these facts to the trial court and asked that as an alternative in order to protect the landlord during the pendency of the appeal that we be allowed to pay the rent into the Court every month to be held by the Court in escrow. 
    And we also agreed that in the event that we should loss the appeal and ultimately if the Supreme Court of Connecticut heard it and lose there, but this body then will be turn over to the landlord. 
    We also agreed that if any one month we fail to pay that rent into the Court that the appeal could automatically be dismissed. 
    Now, we thought this was a fair alternative because the increase of the state has in protecting the landlord would be met entirely by this provision by this alternative that we offered if we pay the rent to the Court every month as it came due. 
    And if we fail any one month and our appeal would then be dismissed, the landlord would have all the protection that he would be entitled to.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is it clear Mr. Dineen that the Court have the power by way of equity, discretion or some other source to waive the bond requirement and accept your alternative proposal?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="275.946" stopTime="351.964">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Your Honor, it appears to us that it's clear that they did not have that discretion. 
    The reason I say that, we cited in our appendix the appellate court decision and on page 57 in the appendix where we recited the decision, the court says, the right to an appeal is a not a constitutional one. 
    Though one based upon privileges of natural justice. 
    It is but statutory privilege which an aggrieved party has the right to avail himself of only when he is strictly complied with the provisions of the statutes. 
    And later, on page 60 of the appendix, the Appellate Division says, "Want a bond with surety, where a bond with surety is by statute a prerequisite of review furnishes a sufficient ground for dismissal of the appeal." 
    We made the motion in the trial court because there had not been a decision such as this with regard to waiving a surety bond prior to this time. 
    We made it because we felt when we're offering a fair alternative. 
    It turned out from our understanding now of the Appellate Division's decision that the Appellate Division decides that it does not have the power to waive this --

    This is an eviction action Your Honor.

    It -- nonpayment of rent?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="359.466" stopTime="368.784">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Well, there were two actions. 
    The action that we're concerned with was based on nonpayment of rent. 
    Prior to that, --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="368.784" stopTime="371.279">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And you offered to pay the money in the court?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="371.279" stopTime="388.280">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    We offered to pay the money in the Court at the time of the appeal. 
    During the pendency of the action from July 1967 until the time of judgment in January of 68', rent was not being paid. 
    Now, --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="388.280" stopTime="389.787">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Was there any defense?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="389.787" stopTime="408.065">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Yes, there was Your Honor. 
    There were defenses on the merits that no rent was due. 
    Our defense all along was for two reasons no rent was due. 
    One was that the -- we claim that the landlord, the Housing Authority, had not complied with Connecticut statutes and this is set forth as well on page 29 of the appendix.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="408.065" stopTime="409.333">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What Connecticut statutes?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="409.333" stopTime="479.048">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    There're Connecticut statutes Your Honor that require that any building that is considered a tenement house or a garden type apartment. 
    And these are -- they find in Connecticut statutes, must have what is called a tenement house certificate stating that that building complies precisely with these tenement house laws. 
    And if it does not have a tenement house certificate, then no rent is due. 
    And under a case cited I believe in our jurisdictional statement, Creamy Hollow Apartments against Louis, no special proceeding or some reprocess action can be brought when such a house does not have this tenement house certificate. 
    That was one of our defenses as to the claim for rent. 
    There was a second defense and that relates to the first action that was brought. 
    There was an action brought some two months or three months before the second action which is an issue here. 
    That was brought in early May and it was effort file the landlord to put these people out for another reason. 
    That was our contention that under Connecticut law that once a first action is brought, there is no more obligation on the part of the tenant to pay rent to the landlord. 
    It's an obligation to pay what we --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="479.048" stopTime="482.339">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But you offered to pay the rent first, plus the cost?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="482.339" stopTime="483.597">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    I beg your pardon Your Honor?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="483.597" stopTime="488.276">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did I understand that you say awhile ago, you had offered to pay rent plus the cost?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="488.276" stopTime="495.110">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    We had offered to pay rent every month from the time of the appeal. 
    The point I'm trying to make is this.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="495.110" stopTime="496.916">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That would pay at all?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="496.916" stopTime="497.772">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    I beg your pardon Your Honor?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="497.772" stopTime="500.118">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That would pay all the man was claiming, that company --
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="500.118" stopTime="508.879">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    No, Your Honor. 
    That would pay from the time the appeal started -- from the time the appeal started during the entire pendency of the appeal.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="508.879" stopTime="510.157">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But would it pay the back rent?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="510.157" stopTime="597.707">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    It would not pay the back rent, Your Honor. 
    Now as to that question, there's no required in Connecticut law that in order to defend or to litigate in a summary process action, if you have to pay any rent. 
    In fact generally, when a summary process action is commenced, the landlord will refuse to take any rent because this would be a waiver probably of his action. 
    Litigating and defending an eviction action is not conditioned in Connecticut upon paying current rent. 
    Connecticut law does not require that. 
    And this particular factor, we don't feel as relevant to this case. 
    In other words the fact that for several months, from July until January rent was not paid is not relevant to the issue that we presented to this Court. 
    If we had paid the rent in full, every month as we went along during the litigation. 
    We still would have come to the same problem that we came to here. 
    We would've come to the time of a appeal where we would have had put up this bond with a surety. 
    In other words, to get the surety, we would have to put up lump amount covering perhaps some six or seven or eight months rent. 
    And so the precise same issue that's raised by this case would have been raised even if every month we had been paying the rent to the landlord or into the court during the litigation. 
    But we had defenses up until the time --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="597.707" stopTime="599.921">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What did you say your second defense was?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="599.921" stopTime="618.823">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    The first was that there wasn't any tenement house certificate. 
    The second was, that there had been a prior action brought which terminates any obligation on the part of a tenant to pay rent to the landlord. 
    Once the landlord commences an eviction action, he waives his right to collect rent and his effort to terminate the lease --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="618.823" stopTime="620.520">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    He waives his right to collect rent?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="620.520" stopTime="639.146">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Collect rent as such Your Honor. 
    He's still is entitled to collect whatever the reasonable value of the premises are, but this would be a separate matter. 
    These were our two defenses during the cause of the trial that rent was not due to the landlord.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="639.146" stopTime="643.468">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What was the basis of the prior action? 
    Was that also an eviction action?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="643.468" stopTime="671.583">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    That was an eviction Your Honor. 
    The basis of that was they claimed the nuisance with regard toward tenants. 
    We defended that. 
    That never came to trial, that action in fact is still pending, theoretically. 
    It's never been withdrawn, it still exist. 
    Our defense is relating to that action are set forth from the special defenses that we had which are part of the record in the second action.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="671.583" stopTime="678.427">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So, that was the first action in the eviction action because your clients have allegedly were committing a nuisance?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="678.427" stopTime="679.324">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    That was the allegation Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="679.324" stopTime="692.142">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And then -- and that's never been resolved. 
    And then there was a second eviction action based upon to nonpayment of rent. 
    And you had two defenses. 
    First, that since they didn't have a certificate, they couldn't ask you for rent?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="692.142" stopTime="692.669">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="692.669" stopTime="698.675">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And secondly, since they brought this earlier action, they didn't have any right to ask you for rent as such (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="698.675" stopTime="701.378">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    That's correct Your Honor. 
    They have waived it or they were stopped to claim --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="701.378" stopTime="719.070">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But I don't understand, how you can say that if you had kept paying rent this question would still have arisen because if you had I suppose in this action which is only based on a nonpayment of rent, it couldn't have arisen. 
    There would've not been an appeal, there wouldn't have not been a --
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="719.070" stopTime="764.683">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Yes Your Honor. 
    If we had been paying -- let us assume we have been paying during the course of the litigation each month. 
    Now, if we paid as rent, there is some technical use of words in Connecticut as to rent or use in occupancy. 
    If we paid as to rent and it was accepted as rent, this would operate as a waiver of the action. 
    In other words, once the landlord had renewed the tenancy, then they couldn't continue on with the action. 
    Well, let us assume we didn't pay it as a rent, we paid it as use in occupancy with the reasonable value with the premises as we went along. 
    Now, that would have not affected to the court's judgment because the judgment was based upon facts that took place prior to this time, prior to the continuation of litigation.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="764.683" stopTime="765.410">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Nonpayment of rent --
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="765.410" stopTime="816.119">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Nonpayment of rent for a specific month which was back in the month of May which was what they were claiming. 
    At the time of judgment, I -- if we are paying the during the course of litigation is, what I'm saying is that would not affected the court's judgment. 
    At the time of judgment, eventhough we were paid up and were current, we still would've face this appeal bond which says, if you want to appeal, you have to put up a bond with surety to cover the rents that will accrue. 
    Even if we had no arrears at that time, we would have to get a surety and pay him say, five months in advance or whatever it would be that we would put down in the bond, say $500.00 in advance. 
    And even if we're current and had no arrears, we would still in order to meet this appeal bond have to have more tenants put up $500.00 in there which they couldn't afford.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="816.119" stopTime="825.846">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But how would you lose if you paid the rent? 
    So I understand you said this would pay you to pay rent?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="825.846" stopTime="826.533">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    The eviction --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="826.533" stopTime="831.192">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And you did pay rent, you'd win.
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="831.192" stopTime="890.483">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Well, not necessarily because this is a very -- it's a very technical action. 
    The action that was brought related to a failure to pay in May. 
    The first action was brought on May 5th. 
    We claimed we had a leeway to pay. 
    In other words, they have been there for months before sometimes they paid on the 10th, sometimes on the 15th. 
    It's a working family. 
    When they didn't have it, they got a few days extra to pay. 
    The landlord wanted them out and brought the action on the 5th on the technicality that they hadn't pay on the first. 
    Now, what I understood Mr. Justice Stewart's comment today was if we're paying in good faith a long as we went rather not necessarily on the first which is the technical basis of the action. 
    But say on the 15th and whatever we had it each month, wouldn't that affect the outcome. 
    I'm saying no, that would not affect the outcome at all, because he would still get to the point of judgment where the trial judge say, why didn't you pay on the first. 
    Therefore, judgment for the landlord, I don't care whether you've been paying your arrears or --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="890.483" stopTime="901.748">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You mean the Connecticut Court would say that for the past six months you paid $72.00 everyday, every month on the second, therefore, you are out?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="901.748" stopTime="902.660">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Yes Your Honor. 
    If you didn't meet the terms --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="902.660" stopTime="903.728">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That's what the Court would say?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="903.728" stopTime="943.697">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    If you didn't meet the terms of the lease and the eviction action were brought on the basis of -- then termination of the lease for failure to comply with it. 
    Even though during the course of litigation, we were paying use in occupancy. 
    That court would still say, that they were the judgment of the landlord. 
    So that there could've been a time, and what I'm saying is that makes this nonpayment or this failure to pay during the litigation irrelevant. 
    There could've been a time when we came to judgment for the landlord and we had no arrears. 
    We've been paying this use of occupancy all along and we're still faced with the precise question that were faced with here.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="943.697" stopTime="974.239">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Dineen, let me see if I can get one opinion clear there were some findings here and then there are some colloquy in the record which would seem to explain the findings. 
    And I'm not sure to -- in which action this took place. 
    The finding I'm referring to, the finding of the trial judge, if the court at the first instance that this appeal was taken for purposes of delay and not in good faith. 
    Now, do you challenge those findings?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="974.239" stopTime="976.103">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Yes, we did challenge those Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="976.103" stopTime="994.412">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But now if those findings, let's assume first that you are right from -- and that the findings are in error, do we review a finding of the Court at the first instance of the state on a factual issue in which undoubtedly credibility and other similar factors are --
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="994.412" stopTime="1008.679">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    No, no Your Honor. 
    My contention as to that as well is that that finding is irrelevant to this appeal. 
    That finding that the appeal was taken for the purpose of delay relates only to stay of execution. 
    Other words, we're still --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1008.679" stopTime="1014.527">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Was it not also relate to whether a bond would be accepted --

    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    No Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1014.981" stopTime="1015.770">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- Under any circumstances?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="1015.770" stopTime="1103.404">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    -- because as I understand the Appellate Division decision there is no discretion in the court to waive the bond. 
    In other words, even if they thought we were appealing in for delay. 
    They or not for delay or in appealing in good faith whatever the trial court may have found. 
    He still doesn't have the discretion to waive that bond. 
    He requires the bond and failure to put up the bond makes a subject then to a motion to dismiss the appeal. 
    Our feeling is that the finding that the appeal was taken for the purpose of delay is not relevant to the questions before this Court because that only relates to the stay of execution. 
    The Appellate Division's decision in this matter, when they dismissed the appeal and denied our motion to review says nothing about any delay. 
    It simply says, that we failed to put up a bond and that the bond is required. 
    The appeal was dismissed because we didn't put up the bond and the bond was not waived because there was no authority in the court to waive a bond. 
    Any question of delay which we did dispute all along even assuming that there were delay involved and that the finding of the trial court were correct is not relevant to this appeal. 
    The only thing that's relevant as we see it, is the surety bond which requires in a fact that in advance be made on the rent in lump sum for some five or six months.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1103.404" stopTime="1136.844">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that would defend if you -- while you approach this issues about the statute on this face and the statute in the trial. 
    If you're arguing as a matter of federal constitutional law, state could not insist about security and in appeal in a situation where it made the determination, that the appeal was frivolous unless you can take it for the purpose in July, are arguing that?
speaker="francis_x_dineen" startTime="1136.844" stopTime="1177.185">
    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    I'm not arguing that Your Honor. 
    Under Connecticut law, the question of delay or formality doesn't relate to your being entitle to appeal. 
    What we are questioning is when there is the right to appeal, that's available to everyone but it's condition on the posting of this bond and which requires that you in a fact put up several months rent in advance. 
    Now, that that is unconstitutional because it deprives some constitutional, we claim for several reasons both it denies Equal Protection of the law and it denies Due Process.

    Mr. Francis X. Dineen 
    Yes, I'm not going that far Your Honor. 
    Our position is that we offered to pay that and we would pay that and also, we offered that if we fail to pay, the appeal could be dismissed forth with at any one month that we did that. 
    We're not saying -- we're not asking that he need not pay anything at all. 
    We say that the state has a legitimate interest in protecting the landlord during the pendency appeal. 
    We might even had said that if were a matter of state law that the state might have a legitimate interest during the previous time.

    Not precisely, I don't think because we do recognize that there is a reasonable and legitimate interest that the State may have in protecting land owners. 
    After a judgment has rendered in their favor during the pendency of an appeal. 
    What we're saying is that it's arbitrary that they manifest this kind of interest or this protection by in effect requiring that five or six months be pay all at once at one time which is impossible for somebody who can't afford it. 
    We're saying that the reasonable way and the almost obvious way, that they could've protect the interest of the landlord was to require that if be paid month by month.

    Each month we deposited $72.00 with one or another clerk either the District Court or up our own Circuit Court. 
    So that there is now an effect. 
    In fact, $360.00, which is on deposit which has been deposited $72.00 per month since the time of the appeal.

    We had offered in our motion to pay $72.00 a month to the clerk.

    We were indigent to the extent that we not that we couldn't pay the rent. 
    We offered to pay the rent. 
    We are indigent to the extent that we couldn't pay the $500.00 for the surety which would have been required in order to put up the surety bond.

    We didn't have the five months rent to put down all at one time. 
    See the surety bond required that we put down in lump. 
    Five times or six times each month's rent. 
    It would be something like $400.00 to $500.00 in lump sum at that time. 
    We didn't have that money. 
    We did have enough money to pay the rent each month on the first of the month or whenever as it came due in the amount of $72.00. 
    Which is what we did and there is now $360.00 available to the landlord. 
    But, that was only -- we are only able to pay $72.00 a month.

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The State of Connecticut is not a party, a named party to this appeal. 
    However, because of the decision of the West Haven Housing Authority which is the appellee in this case not to further relief or orally argued the issue raised by the appellants in this case. 
    The State of Connecticut filed the motion with this Court for permission to orally argue the issue and the Court graciously granted it.

    Mr. F. Michael Ahern 
    And also the state's interest in protecting property owners who have been, shall I say denigrated by the tenants by nonpayment of rent, so that they have their rights to their own property and to the retention of their property. 
    Because of the adverse and disruptive effect on civil process if this appeal is sustained. 
    The State of Connecticut and 14 of her sister States have together entered into a amici curiae brief in this case in support of the appellee's position. 
    This is pursuant to Rule 42, Subsection 4 of the rules to this Court. 
    If I may, in reviewing the file in this case one cannot help but the amaze that the zealous and ambiguous advocacy of the appellant's rights by counsel in the lower courts. 
    In the period between the initial notice to quick possession on July 12, 1967 until the trial on the merits was held on January 9, 1968. 
    Six judges of the Connecticut Circuit Court were called upon to rule on the same number of motions, six motions. 
    The legal maneuvering of counsel for appellants has followed a torturous and very exhausted path through both the state and federal judicial systems. 
    Appellants have their day in Court and the Connecticut Circuit Court and the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court and then the State Supreme Court. 
    Simultaneously, a inaugurated hearings in the United States District Court for the district of Connecticut, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and finally to this honorable Court this morning. 
    I count 36 separate entries in the file concerning legal action on the part of the appellants.

    They became tenants of the Housing Authority on November 1, 1966 under a written a lease. 
    A monthly written lease which was renewable each month at the rate of $72.00 per month. 
    The monthly rent was determined by an objective schedule according to their ability to pay. 
    Having withheld payment of the rent for the months of May, June, and July of 1967. 
    The appellants were given a statutory notice to quit the premises on July 12, 1967.

    The appellant is not having complied with the notice to quit. 
    We're given a statutory -- were asked again to quit and when they refuse a summary process action was instituted in the Circuit Court for the State of Connecticut. 
    That was on July 19, 1967, which was actually five -- three months after the first withholding of the rent. 
    After the preliminary motions were disposed of trial on the merits was had on January 9, 1968, which resulted in judgment for possession for the Housing Authority. 
    Pursuant to Section 52-542 of the Connecticut General Statutes, the appellants instituted an appeal which was promptly filed with the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court of Connecticut. 
    In lieu of the surety bond required by the statute, they attached to their appeal a motion to waive surety bond on the grounds of alleged indigency. 
    After a full hearing in the Court, the same trial judge who had heard the case on the merits earlier denied the motion because he found that the appeal was not taken in good faith but for purposes of delay and obstruction.

    Mr. F. Michael Ahern 
    They did -- it is mentioned in the decision of the Court of Appeals or the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court that the lower court found that the action is taken for reasons of delay.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2382.393" stopTime="2385.517">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Is that one of the reasons that they affirmed?
speaker="f_michael_ahern" startTime="2385.517" stopTime="2488.906">
    Mr. F. Michael Ahern 
    That's our position Your Honor that that's the reason they did affirm. 
    The appellants filed a motion for review with the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court from the judge dissenters denial of the motion. 
    And that motion was denied by the Appellate Division and the appeal was dismissed. 
    Thereafter, the appellants filed the petition for certification in the Supreme Court of the State of Connecticut and petition was dismissed or denied. 
    The Housing Authority then moved the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court to terminate the stay of execution which motion was granted. 
    Now concurrently with the state legal activities, the appellants in order to delay their eviction filed an injunction action in the United States District Court for the district of Connecticut. 
    That court in a very lengthy decision dismissed the federal complaint and the decision was promptly appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    The Court of Appeals dismissed the federal complaint as moot on January 10, 1968 and an appeal was taken to this Court, which noted probable jurisdiction on September 7 -- on April 7, 1969. 
    I think it would -- it should emphasize to this point that the Housing Authority finally obtain possession of the premises on July 26, 1968, which was full year after the filing of the summary process action in the Circuit Court in Connecticut and more than 15 months after the tenants decided to withhold the payment of rent to the authority.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2488.906" stopTime="2491.381">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What's happened to the $360.00?
speaker="f_michael_ahern" startTime="2491.381" stopTime="2614.613">
    Mr. F. Michael Ahern 
    I believe it's still in the custody of the clerk of the Court. 
    The Housing Authority has never filed a motion to reach it and the clerk is holding it pending the ultimate determination of this case. 
    In addition to the Zoas Legal Representation provided the appellants by counsel in the lower courts. 
    They have the benefit of extensive briefs by their attorneys and also by several organizations who have filed amici curiae briefs in this Court. 
    The question presented by the appellant's appeal is whether the surety bond requirement of 52-542 of the Connecticut general statutes on an appeal on summary process action is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause. 
    The Connecticut summary process statute was initially adopted in 1806, prior to that time if a land owner desire to oust the tenant of possession. 
    He was required to file an action in ejectment in the courts which was a slow and expensive procedure. 
    The purpose of the summary process statute was to give the property owner and all to that means of recovering possession of his property from a tenant who was either unable or unwilling to pay his rent. 
    I want to emphasize the Connecticut summary process statute is not a statute of general application. 
    Its applicability is limited to those cases where there is a lease which has terminated either by time or nonpayment of rent or where there is occupation without greater privilege. 
    I also want to emphasize that the property owner utilizing the summary process procedure does not recover rent. 
    He only recovers possession of his property. 
    In order the reach the unpaid rent, he must bring a separate subsequent legal action for money his own.

    Mr. F. Michael Ahern 
    I think this is where the appellants in the Housing Authority disagreed whether or not the surety bond in all cases must accompany in appeal. 
    Certainly, since this for sole protection of the landlord, the landlord could waive the surety bond requirement we feel and similar --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2959.796" stopTime="2972.904">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The landlord could the Court waive -- did the Court say no bond because the person is indigent and the appeal is in good faith?

    Mr. F. Michael Ahern 
    We haven't been able to find the Connecticut case that provides that Justice White. 
    However, we have cited cases and we feel once the matter is before the Court. 
    That the Court could waive the surety bond as long as it provide adequate protection for the landlord.

    Mr. F. Michael Ahern 
    I think that's probably because of the word “shown in the statute” and they're referring to the same that this is the statute under which they have appeal to this Court in which they claim is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The bond on appeal and stay of execution.

    Mr. F. Michael Ahern 
    I think it means to show unless the Court appeals that there are equitable considerations that should be taken into consideration by the Court. 
    Either the Court could use its good offices to have the landlord waive the surety bond requirement which I think can be done -- could be done because the sole purpose of the surety bond is to protect the landlord's interest. 
    Then I think also, that if the Court felt that the circumstances in the particular case warranted. 
    It could probably, it could waive the surety bond requirement as long as some means were provided for the protection of the land owners.

    The only kind of authority, I guess, is that Appellate Division's opinion in this case, is it?
speaker="f_michael_ahern" startTime="3145.461" stopTime="3339.569">
    Mr. F. Michael Ahern 
    It's breaking new ground Justice Stewart, I believe. 
    The West Haven Housing Authority as I stated earlier is a federal and state instrumentality. 
    It set up by state and federal statutes, it's finance by public bond issues and by grants from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development which controls its operations. 
    The income derived from the tenant rentals is used to meet its obligations to bond holders and to pay the normal continuing operating expenses of the authority. 
    In the defending the summary process action in the trial court, the appellants advanced seven special defenses all of which were procedural and all of which were considered by the trial court and evidently considered meritless. 
    It is obvious from a reading of the first special defense and the trial brief that the reason, the appellants, the tenants determined to withhold payment of rent from the authority was that they were lift because of the previous summary process action instituted by the authority which was not prosecuted to effect. 
    The trial court in entering judgment for possession of the premises expressly found that the appellants had not paid rent for a period of eight months from April 1967 to December of 1967, which was immediately prior to the trial on the merits. 
    And the trial court made the following significant statement in its memorandum of decision, dated January 16, 1968, and I would like to quote it. 
    ”The record in this quick case clearly shows what can happen to a summary proceeding where the process is abused by dilatory tactics, defense is interposed to delay or obstruct the proceeding and every effort made to delay a trial of the case on the merits." 
    That can be found in the record appendix at page 5. 
    Just three days after the above decision was rendered by the trial court, that is on January 19, 1968, the same trial judge heard arguments addressed to the appellant's motion to waive surety bond. 
    After argument, the trial judge found “this appeal is being taken for the purpose of delay and the motion was denied.” 
    But, posting requirements upon the privilege of obtaining judicial relief are found in both the State and federal statutes. 
    And this Courts has consistently held that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution does not prevent a State from proscribing reasonable and appropriate conditions precedent to the seeking of judicial relief in its courts so long as the basis of the distinction is real and the conditions imposed have a reasonable relationship to a legitimate object. 
    Applying this standard to the surety bond provision of Section 52-542 we submit. 
    It is clear that the statute proscribes the reasonable and appropriate conditions with a legitimate object in view. 
    That is the protection of the landowner. 
    We therefore submit that the statute is constitutional on its face.
