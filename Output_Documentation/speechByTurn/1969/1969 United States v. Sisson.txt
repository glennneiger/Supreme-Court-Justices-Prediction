    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think we left off suggesting that if there were no Bill of Rights at all, this Court would nonetheless be required by the constitution as adopted by the framers, by the state ratifying conventions as they understood the constitution would require this Court nonetheless to protect the individual rights of citizens –

    You say as they understood it?

    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="41.078" stopTime="43.943">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have a particular focus to put that on?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="43.943" stopTime="92.453">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Yes, Your Honor, I do. 
    On page 98 through 99 of our brief -– I'm sorry, it's page 100 through 101. 
    We quote from a statement made by the Rhode Island Ratifying Convention, which is virtually identical, I think there are very minor changes in language that is almost identical to the statements made by the North Carolina and Virginia Ratifying Conventions, I'm sorry. 
    And the statement states, that is that's just a very small portion of the statement made by the Ratifying Convention. 
    The Ratifying Convention said –-

    Made by who?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="93.614" stopTime="157.862">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    By the Ratifying Convention of the State of Rhode Island, Your Honor, almost identical to the statement made by the Ratifying Convention of the State of North Carolina, as well as the State of Virginia. 
    These statements expressly asserted that ratification of the constitution was based on an expressed understanding that it did not infringe unalienable rights of individual citizens. 
    The fourth paragraph, the fourth proposition stated in that ratifying statement is that religion or the duty which we owe to our creator in the manner of discharging it can be directed only by reason and conviction and not by force or violence. 
    And therefore, all men have an equal, natural and inalienable right to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience and that no particular religious sect or society ought to be favored or established by law in preference to others.

    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    100 through 101, Your Honor, the bottom of 100 through the top of 101. 
    That statement is virtually identical to the statement made from the Ratifying Convention of the State of New York. 
    I accorded that at the end of the argument yesterday.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    When did Rhode Island get around to ratifying the constitution? 
    Pretty late in the game, wouldn't it?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="179.307" stopTime="180.499">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Very late, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="180.499" stopTime="182.779">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Why?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="182.779" stopTime="238.730">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    I'm not sure, but I think among the four states represented in these statements, it's perfectly clear that there would have been no ratification of the constitution but for the expressed understanding that these rights were safeguarded. 
    That is, there was no need for the Bill of Rights to protect religion as understood by the persons who drafted and who ratified the constitution. 
    It's true that a Bill of Rights were subsequently enacted but Madison explained, and that's quoted at the bottom of 98 through top of 99, “Although I know whenever the great rights, the trial by jury, freedom of the press, of liberty of conscience come in question in that body, the invasion of them is resisted by able advocates. 
    Yet, their magna carta does not contain any one provision for the security of those rights respecting which the people of America are most alarmed.” 
    The freedom –-
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="238.730" stopTime="241.250">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that the only reference you have?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="241.250" stopTime="243.042">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Well, I have –- these are just random –-
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="243.042" stopTime="255.412">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I mean to this? 
    I don't see anything in here that necessarily leads to the conclusion that they thought a man could get out of going to the army constitutionally because of his religious belief?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="255.412" stopTime="349.478">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Well, that's a separate question, Your Honor. 
    It certainly is related and that's why I mentioned it at this point, but I'm simply addressing myself now to the assertion made by the government that religion does not mean conscience. 
    And I think that's clearly wrong from the standpoint of history. 
    I can understand the government's inclination so to construe the protection of religion in the Bill of Rights. 
    I understand why they would like to limit it, but it's just flatly inaccurate as a matter of history. 
    That's just not what they understood 180 years ago. 
    What we're calling for is not something which would destroy orderly government at all. 
    Obviously, what would be most destructive of orderly government would be if the constitution were ignored, and we want the constitution enforced. 
    That is, the constitution says certain things about what powers Congress have, and I will come very quickly to that central question. 
    That is, what power did Congress receive through the constitution to draft individuals, whether in peace or in order. 
    That's the central issue. 
    Obviously, if the constitution did not delegate this power to Congress, Congress doesn't have it. 
    Even if Congress would like to have it, even if Congress thinks that it is absolutely indispensable in its judgment to have that power, if that power was not conferred by the constitution, it's perfectly plain they don't have the power. 
    The constitution sets the limits of the power that were in fact conferred to Congress. 
    Now, I'm simply –-
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="349.478" stopTime="363.637">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So it's your idea that anything –- anytime a man believes its wrong to go to war, it couldn't be conscripted that was almost necessary to do away with conscription, wouldn't it?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="363.637" stopTime="389.837">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    That is not our proposition, Your Honor. 
    That is –- I think there's a very important distinction between a man who acts on the basis of conscience that is who simply can't obey the order. 
    That's on that system. 
    And a man who thinks, well, it'd be a bad policy to follow, to go fight a war in Vietnam --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="389.837" stopTime="394.169">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But they were allowed to distinguish between the two, wouldn't it, when you begin to probe the line?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="394.169" stopTime="410.022">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Yes, Your Honor, but that's a very customary function in law, that is we're constantly –- the Courts, that is –- are constantly about the business of establishing where the man intended to do something around it, but just don't know how to avoid that. 
    But –-
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="410.022" stopTime="436.076">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well counsel, this familiar history is very interesting but let's bring it down to the particular case, and if I may put to you again the question I suggested yesterday, would his rights of conscience be violated if in fact he were taken in and assigned as a security guard at the American Embassy in Paris for the entire tour of his duty? 
    Would his rights of conscience be invaded?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="436.076" stopTime="437.436">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    I think so, Your Honor. 
    But is –-
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="437.436" stopTime="443.437">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I thought his objection was to the particular war being conducted in Vietnam?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="443.437" stopTime="447.736">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Well, in a sense, that's true, but –-
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="447.736" stopTime="451.345">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, is it all military service or just the war in Vietnam, I wanted it that clear?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="451.345" stopTime="499.389">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Well, that's the military service. 
    That is, he disobeyed an order. 
    He disobeyed that order on the basis of his conviction that the order was invalid. 
    Now at this point, I really don't think that the question is whether his subjective belief was well founded. 
    At least the threshold question is whether from an objective point of view, he was right, whether the order was valid. 
    Did Congress in fact have the power to issue the order to this man that he report for induction because if Congress had no such power, simply to induct him into the army, then refusal to obey the order simply is not a criminal act. 
    And that's independent of what he may have believed to doubt the Vietnam war or may not have believed.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="499.389" stopTime="518.727">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I have difficulty reconciling the points as you state them now and his own declaration which if I understood this record were all aimed at military activity in Vietnam. 
    Did I misread the record?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="518.727" stopTime="546.825">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    I think so, Your Honor. 
    I respectfully suggest that from the outset, the motion is filed, the pre-trial motion is filed in this case squarely raised and the government has so recognized –- squarely raised that the initial question raised by the appellee was simply the power of Congress to issue that order to him, and he said no, Congress does not have that power. 
    That is, if he had said nothing about his beliefs.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="546.825" stopTime="554.187">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So I'm making a distinction between what he said and what you were saying, and I here at least see a difference?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="554.187" stopTime="640.965">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Well, I think, Your Honor. 
    If I understand Your Honor's question that there's on the issues which were properly raised one issue, very definitely is the issue which the District Judge in fact based his decision upon. 
    That is, the right of Johny Sisson to exercise freely his religion under the First Amendment. 
    Or alternatively, the question, the issue whether the Selective Service Act of 1967 constitutes an establishment of religion. 
    But that -- those were just two of the issues raised. 
    We repeatedly reasserted and reasserted again in the motion in the rest of judgment. 
    The threshold question obviously has to be whether the order issued to Johny Sisson was invalid. 
    It might have been invalid for a number of technical reasons. 
    Now, those technical reasons –- technical deficiencies in the order did not appear at the trial. 
    If such deficiencies had appeared in fact, the case would not be here, certainly not on direct appeal. 
    That is, the only questions presently being raised are questions bearing on the validity, constitutionality of that order. 
    And the point we repeatedly stressed is that Congress just does not have power to conscript Sisson now.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="640.965" stopTime="651.909">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That is because –- well, for a variety of reasons, to what reason in your submission though –- what particular reason are you submitting to us, I'm not very clear of that?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="651.909" stopTime="665.570">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    The particular reason, Your Honor, is that Congress is powered to raise and support arguments, which is the clause on which the government relies squarely, does not extend –- it is not an unlimited power.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="665.570" stopTime="673.875">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, alright, but then what -– and is limited in what respect where there's a vis-à-vis this case?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="673.875" stopTime="700.744">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    It is limited first of all to circumstances where an emergency exists. 
    I know that that's somewhat vague, but I think by looking at the historical interpretation of Congress' power, we can derive very definite meaning as to what the framers of the constitution understood, what members of the first Congress understood by the power to raise and support arguments. 
    Now –-
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="700.744" stopTime="737.368">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, are you saying –- I know that perhaps –- I know in your brief, you say a variety of things but now, are you directing yourself to the argument that Congress has no constitutional power to enact a Selective Service Act when there is no declared war? 
    Or are you saying it has no power to conscript people into the military when there is a situation going on, that is going on at Southeast Asia that violates international law? 
    What are you -– to what point are you arguing now is what I don't quite get.
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="737.368" stopTime="781.445">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    I think the most solid point we have is the point that Congress has no power to draft in an emergency, which usually will mean the same thing as no power to draft absent to declaration of war. 
    But the reason I think I don't –- we do not assert that in that form, that is that Congress can't conscript unless there's been a declaration of war, is that we concede that in a number of the emergencies, even if there were no declaration of war, Congress would have the power to conscript because I just don't believe that Congress is powerless to defend this country. 
    This country must have the power to survive.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="781.445" stopTime="790.559">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, then you're saying that there's no power to -- a constitutional power to conscript when there is no imminent danger of invasion of this country?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="790.559" stopTime="794.024">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym

    I really don't understand your argument.

    That's right.

    Yes. 
    One example of an emergency, Your Honor, would be the Civil War.

    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Yes, Your Honor.

speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="846.463" stopTime="888.548">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Time of peace again is somewhat misleading because that may be thought to mean the absence of a declaration of war. 
    But I think what is at issue is the existence of an emergency that it makes it very, very clear that Congress has no choice, that it must conscript because if it doesn't conscript for a National Security is in a very mediate sense at stake. 
    I don't think there's much ambiguity about what the power of Congress is meant for the first 150 years of the existence of this country. 
    That is, peace time conscription as we know it is very, very recent in time, just –- it didn't take years.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="888.548" stopTime="897.694">

    Definitely not, no.

    That is, if that had been even remotely suggested at the time that the constitution was ratified, absolutely no question but that that the constitution would not have been ratified.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="915.816" stopTime="924.369">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mr. Flym, can you help me with my problem of getting conscience and legality together?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="924.369" stopTime="945.508">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    I'll try, Your Honor. 
    There are several steps to our argument. 
    We begin with a broader story argument and with a relatively narrow argument based on Johnny Sisson. 
    First argument is whether Congress has the power to draft anybody at this time.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="945.508" stopTime="959.325">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    So use of equip–- put in the same bowl the fact that I disagree with the legality of an act of Congress with my conscience –-
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="959.325" stopTime="1000.683">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    No, or –- no. 
    That has been suggested two or three times. 
    I hope I can make it very clear that that's not what we mean at all. 
    That is, if Congress has the power to draft people in general, then the argument which we are now making is not relevant at all. 
    It would remain a subsequent, a different question. 
    That is, assuming that Congress has the power to draft the generality of men at this time, are they nonetheless restricted by the individual right of conscience, the right to free exercise of religion, so that they can't conscript certain classes of men.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1000.683" stopTime="1008.776">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But because I disagree, my conscience tells me I can abide by that law?

    Mr. John G. S. Flym

    But I would, simply as the last comment to Mr. Justice Marshall's remark with respect to the difficulty of ascertaining, the meaning of conscience indicate that the draftsmen of the constitution had no problem with that. 
    That is, I quote from Madison, “The freedom of the press and rights of conscience, those choices, privileges of the people are unguarded in the British Constitution”. 
    He had no question, but that if there were no Bill of Rights, a man's right of conscience would nonetheless be protected. 
    He didn't need a Bill of Rights. 
    As a matter of fact, precisely the argument which the government now makes was the argument feared back then. 
    That if you provided a Bill of Rights then, somebody would say, “Well, that's all you have.”

    No, we are not. 
    We made several arguments and we maintain them all.

    The second argument is whether that power is in some specifically –- a specific way limited by the first amendment. 
    I am not addressing myself solely to the first question, forgetting about the Bill of Rights altogether, what power did the constitution confer upon Congress to raise and support armies? 
    I do suggest respectfully that the history of the ratification of the constitution, of the dates at the constitutional convention simply do not blame themselves to any interpretation which would suggest that back then, it was thought that the federal government -– Congress could simply reach out and pluck people out for universal military service.

speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="1399.102" stopTime="1551.354">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The man who acted not under the power to raise and support armies, but rather under the militia clauses of Article 12 –- of Article 1, that is, the constitution provides a very, very plain scheme, provides for standing armies. 
    Those were very, very, very much feared. 
    In addition to standing armies for instance, the garrison, the frontier posts against the possibility of hostilities with the invasions. 
    The constitution says well, if you have an insurrection or if you have an invasion, or if you have a problem with executing the laws, you can call out the state militias. 
    The calling of the state militias meant something very specific. 
    It meant you could only call them for three months, in any one year. 
    You could only call them in rotation so that if you called them in once, you couldn't call them again until every other able bodied man, and his battalion had been called. 
    Furthermore, you didn't call them for a specific length of time. 
    You just called them out for that particular purpose. 
    If you had a problem with the unions in one location, you call out the militia and they dealt with the unions there and then they went back home to their jobs, farmers, various other jobs which they are in. 
    That was the scheme which the constitution provided. 
    That is that's the way in which Congress was to deal with problems of national defense. 
    We are conceding that in addition to what is clearly provided, in a clear case of national emergency where the national survival is at stake, it's perfectly clear that Congress must have the power to mobilize every resource. 
    And certainly, that was contemplated, it is not denied. 
    In the constitution therefore, we don't deny that it must exist by inference. 
    But when we read the historical record without which that was simply cannot be read, that is you just can't raise and support armies literally unless you understand what they meant by a raise and support armies. 
    Now, we deal with the historical argument at length in our brief. 
    I think we demonstrate very clearly that the power to conscript was feared. 
    It was not even used in the revolutionary war except in very limited circumstances. 
    At the height –- at the height of the idealism which motivated the men who were fighting for their freedom of this country.

    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    We would have a very, very different case, Your Honor, but that is precisely what we have in mind.

    I understand that, Your Honor, but that would be one very clear example of a declaration of a national emergency. 
    It's one thing to say we really need to do this. 
    It's quite another matter to enact the statute which is designed not simply to meet with national emergencies but to deal with peace time conditions and to apply it in peace time rather than limiting its application to war time conditions, or national emergency conditions. 
    But it just –- it just was beyond anything that any of advancement or any of the people at the time that the constitution was adopted that this federal government, this body of people could simply reach out and conscript people. 
    If they can do it now, why couldn't they have done it back then? 
    Why couldn't they simply conscript one million men? 
    We're going to have a standing army of one million men. 
    Furthermore, we're going to induct them, we're going to conscript them for ten years because we think we ought to have a very strong army. 
    Yet it just is inconceivable that that power was granted. 
    It just was not granted.

speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="1718.489" stopTime="1810.585">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    I think ultimately, this Court must decide any argument that Congress has exceeded the limits of its power. 
    But certainly, action taken by congress, unequivocal action declaring the existence of an emergency would be very persuasive, not necessarily conclusive but I think we –- we would have very, very little hope of prevailing if Congress had said well, we've got a national emergency and we absolutely need to conscript men. 
    But we don't have that situation at all. 
    For the last six years, there've been studies upon studies as to whether volunteer army was feasible, clearly testified time and time again both by government persons who opposed a no-volunteer army as well as by men who preferred the volunteer army that it is feasible. 
    I mean, manpower is available. 
    It just costs money. 
    But that's the way in which a standing army has been raised for 150 years. 
    And it was never suggested that Congress could simply say, “Well, we don't think we ought to be spending money this way. 
    We're not going to do it. 
    We'll save the little money. 
    Furthermore, we think it's democratic. 
    We don't a mercenary army.” 
    Maybe Congress does think that there are valid reasons for conscripting men instead of simply having volunteers to mend this standing army in peace time. 
    But that doesn't change the power that Congress -– that was delegated to Congress at the time the constitution was adopted.

    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    No, I think Your Honor, the historical record is clear that the power to raise and support armies is included because a standing army as feared as it was, and it was very, very much feared because the fear was that Congress would use the standing army to eliminate the power of the states and to oppress the individual citizens in the states.

speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="1909.495" stopTime="1957.882">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Oh absolutely! 
    There are at least five separate preferences to militia. 
    That is, you have at least three clauses in Article 1 which deal expressly with militia. 
    And again, militia were to be called and specified circumstance only while the emergency lasted. 
    In the Second Amendment for instance, the Second Amendment provides that individual citizens had the right to keep and bear arms because you need a strong militia so that the state can defend itself. 
    The argument that a standing army was all right was based repeatedly on the argument that Congress could never amass a standing army of such power that it could overcome the power of the states because they had the militia and the militia were very, very numerous.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1957.882" stopTime="1978.125">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    As I recall it or my memory maybe entirely wrong. 
    Those who insisted on having nothing but a militia, state militia, were defeated in the constitutional convention and it was provided that the Congress agrees on?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="1978.125" stopTime="2035.976">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    That's absolutely correct, Your Honor, but it's important to bear in mind that the concept of a standing army was agreed to in a very, very limited way that is precisely the opposition which you are noted, that people will say, “Well, you don't need a standing army, we've got our state militia.” 
    The argument was well, are you going to take farmers and post them on garrison posts on the frontiers to combat the unions? 
    We need an army, a standing army. 
    Now, what did that mean? 
    The very first Congress enacted a bill. 
    I had as a matter of fact, starting by 1789, 1790, 1791, 1792, 1793, 1794, 1795, there are separate bills, numerous, dealing with the army, the standing army, as well as with militia but in quite separate ways. 
    And the standing army that was provided consisted of I think 1,200 men, meant to deal very expressly with the problem of the frontiers.

speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="2049.538" stopTime="2286.028">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Forgive me, Your Honor. 
    In any event, I really don't think I should spend more time on this argument. 
    I would like to mention another separate argument. 
    That is, I simply mentioned that in passing. 
    That is that if a non-volunteer army is feasible, Congress just can't pick and choose ways of raising men and say, “Well, we're not going to spend the money so that we'll have this money available for the project.” 
    That is, if they can raise volunteers, they're required to raise volunteers for the standing army. 
    That was the original concept. 
    As a matter of fact, the concept -– the word “raise armies” is used repeatedly by the first congress, by the early Congresses, and they specified that they mean volunteers and the deal with militia entirely separately. 
    As a matter of fact in one case, they increased the size of the authorized army I think to 5,000 men, and they said, “But we want to make it clear that as soon as the emergency is over, that army is to be disbanded. 
    We don't want it around. 
    We want that number reduced to 1,500.” 
    And so now, I won't even touch on the argument that the power of Congress is further limited so that it can't raise an army for an illegal war. 
    Now, that's dealt within our brief. 
    I think it's much too complex to even begin at this point. 
    I would, if I may, like to turn for the remaining time to the solicitor's argument with respect to the establishment issue, as well as the free exercise issue. 
    Incidentally, Mr. Justice Marshall, I checked in to various authorities on the question bearing on whether we have an rest of judgment decision more in a -– well, another authority, I'm very bad on issues, right, it simply don't communicate if there's anything to be done after you grant the motion of rest of judgment, you grant it and that's it. 
    And I checked the records in this Court in the cases of Bramblett as well as the case of Green, they are cited at page 15 of our brief, and I looked at the order entered by the lower courts in those cases and that's all they say, motion to rest of judgment granted. 
    I found no indication that there's anything else which anyone else thought needed to be done. 
    On the establishment question simply indicate that on the basis of the Solicitor General's argument, it's perfectly clear that the act tends to establish pacifist religions. 
    That's what the Act has intended -– well, it isn't intended to establish them but it is intended to protect members of pacifist religions. 
    Now, the Solicitor General says, “That's alright, that's alright because religion doesn't mean what we say it means within the First Amendment,” and that's because the First Amendment somehow can't be used in this way to limit the power of Congress to raise and support armies. 
    I think that -– that logically it falls from everything I've said up to now, that that just isn't true. 
    Historically, that is completely inaccurate. 
    Now, on the free exercise of religion argument, there's an important misconception that must be dealt with. 
    We're not dealing here with a non-religious objector, I mentioned that yesterday. 
    This man is a non-religious in the statutory sense, conscientious objector. 
    Now, the question is whether he's –-
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2286.028" stopTime="2291.147">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But he's a non -– non-religious, conscientious, selective objector?
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="2291.147" stopTime="2291.646">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2291.646" stopTime="2291.688">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Thank you very much.
speaker="john_g_s_flym" startTime="2291.688" stopTime="2405.843">
    Mr. John G. S. Flym 
    Selective objector. 
    Now, that's correct Your Honor. 
    Now, the question is not whether he can pick and choose his war but whether religions, including established religions, recognize the concept of just war. 
    I don't think there's any question about the fact that today at least, Protestant, Catholic, Jewish organizations, the Vatican Council, all have made it perfectly plain that they think that there are differences between wars. 
    Some wars are okay and some aren't. 
    That is, as religious organizations, it just doesn't seem to me that the argument can be made that if a man objects to a particular war, he necessarily has a “political” objection as opposed to a religious objection. 
    That just doesn't square with the facts. 
    Again, I think that whether you reach this conclusion or not depends on your concept of the power of Congress to raise and support armies. 
    If you conceive of it as being completely uncontrollable, then it might make sense to apply much more restrictive notion of what is meant by religion in the First Amendment insofar as it relates to the power of Congress to raise and support armies. 
    But I just don't think there's any support, any historical support with the view that Congress in 1789 could simply reach out and say, “I'm going to take you. 
    I know its peace time. 
    I know we don't have any wars, but we've got -– we've got to have a strong army.” Just absolutely no support for that view. 
    If there are no questions, I'll submit.

   Argument of Erwin N. Griswold
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2415.070" stopTime="2515.931">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    May it please the Court. 
    First, with respect to the jurisdictional question, Mr. Justice Harlan asked me yesterday about a statute which has been opposed in Congress. 
    It is referred to in a footnote on pages 15 and particularly on page 16 of our brief where there is a reference to the congressional record. 
    I have obtained a Xerox copy of that page with the congressional record and also a copy of the bill, and I will lodge it with the clerk if that is helpful to the Court. 
    The proposed statute is simple and I think clear. 
    It provides –- it would supersede the first seven paragraphs of the present Section 3731 and would substitute “In a criminal case, an appeal by the United States shall lie to a Court of Appeals from a judgment or order of a District Court dismissing an indictment or information, or terminating a prosecution in favor of a defendant as to any one or more counts, except that no appeal shall lie from a judgment of acquittal, provided however that when the judgment or order is based solely on a determination of the invalidity of an Act of congress, the appeal shall lie directly to the Supreme Court.” 
    The direct appeal would only be in the case of the invalidity and not the construction –-
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2515.931" stopTime="2526.188">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Would you have any questions, Mr. Solicitor General, about this -– the ability of this Court, the power of this Court to transfer to a Court of Appeals in this case?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2526.188" stopTime="2534.035">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    There would be no such provision under this –- yes, I suspect there would be. 
    The provision for transfer would still –-
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2534.035" stopTime="2535.345">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you think be applicable to this type?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2535.345" stopTime="2546.184">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Would still stay in because this simply is a substitute for the first seven paragraphs and the transfer provisions are in the subsequent paragraphs –-
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2546.184" stopTime="2548.200">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Under existing law, we could view that?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2548.200" stopTime="2561.218">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    So that if this Court concluded that no question of the constitutionality of a statute was involved, it could transfer it to a Court of Appeals. 
    Now in addition --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    With the present bill, Mr. Solicitor General, or the present statute of the –-

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    The present statute provides for transfer both ways, from the Court of Appeals to the -– and we have recently filed a motion for a transfer of a case from this stage to a Court of Appeals, which I regretted having to file, but we find it very baffling to tell in some cases where the appeal should lie. 
    I may say that I have in addition prepared Xerox copies of all of the pages of the congressional record back in 1909 where the Criminal Appeals Act was discussed, and I will lodge that, too, with the Court because it might be convenient in examining that. 
    I will lodge that with the clerk because it might be convenient in examining the matter.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2614.319" stopTime="2648.781">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Solicitor, go back to that statute for a moment. 
    As you read it, as you see it, the direct appeal to this Court did not foreclose the application of the transfer statute and therefore, the direct appeal is I take it simply to provide expedition in a proper case where important interests were involved. 
    Is that it?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2648.781" stopTime="2654.735">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Well, where the constitutionality of the Act of Congress is involved, that's the only question.

    But to –- I am speaking -– addressing myself just to the reasons, the congressional reasons that you see for the direct appeal was because I am would be –- it might well be of the essence in those cases?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2666.821" stopTime="2682.149">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Because the department felt and it has been the practice of Congress elsewhere that when an Act of Congress is held unconstitutional, that is an important question which ought to come to this Court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2682.149" stopTime="2687.812">

    Can I ask you, Mr. Solicitor General, suppose a trial judge makes some findings of fact as a basis for his arrest or his order arresting judgment, facts which were stipulated to or anything else. 
    And suppose that the –- these weren't evident on the face of the indictment and so on and that this couldn't properly be called an arrest of judgment, what happens then in terms of appeal?

    If it --

    It certainly wouldn't be just a motion –- just a dismissal of the indictment since he's made factual findings.
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2750.438" stopTime="2775.434">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    If it can't be called a motion in arrest of judgment, then the only basis for appeal would be to call it a motion in bar where the statutes expressly says when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy, whether it would or would not be a motion of bar is a point upon which members of the Court have been in disagreement.

speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2783.215" stopTime="2797.332">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    No, so you would then have to come under from a decision or judgment setting aside or dismissing any indictment or information, or any count thereof, where it is based on the invalidity or construction of the statute.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2797.332" stopTime="2806.413">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Under that -– does the same sort of fact finding vitiate an appeal under that provision like it does in the arrest of judgment?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2806.413" stopTime="2868.840">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Mr. Justice, rightly or wrongly, we don't get to that because we construe that in the light of the legislative history as also involving the question whether the defendant has been put in jeopardy. 
    And if the defendant has been put in jeopardy, we not only so construe it but there's a long practice within the Department of Justice at least accepted by this Court to the same effect. 
    Now, if your findings of fact were held, were made before the empanelling of the jury, for example, if the Court said, “I am greatly troubled by the validity of the statute in this case, but I'm not sure about the facts and can we have a factual hearing which will have evidence,” and he then finds facts from which he concludes that the statute is unconstitutional, no jury ever having been in panel, then I would suppose that the first clause would apply.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2868.840" stopTime="2886.205">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But if it –- but if we disagreed with the government here and said that there were fact finding and there was a species of fact finding here in this case which removed it from the arrest of judgment category, then there just wouldn't be an appeal anywhere?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2886.205" stopTime="2896.551">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Then we are unable to find a basis for jurisdiction of this Court on appeal.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, that was what the law undoubtedly was in all respects until 1909 and all that we can say is that Congress in its great care with respect to the double jeopardy simply has not yet made available an appeal in that case. 
    We are trying to persuade the Congress to take care of the problem and I hope we can.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I suppose, Mr. Solicitor General however if this Court and some other case, unrelated case or some other case should express its views, and if those views were inconsistent with the views reached by Judge Wyzanski in this case, there would be nothing to prevent the government from going to the District Court and asking -– making a motion for the modification for the arrest of judgment, would there?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="3048.951" stopTime="3058.441">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Well, that's -– we'll keep in mind, Mr. Justice.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    There of course would be a problem but offhand, it seems to me it is answerable. 
    For example, suppose there had been a petition for rehearing filed in -– before Judge Wyzanski the next day, one reason I'm hesitant is I'm not familiar with what the rule provisions are as to the time and there might come a time when it would be said that that was final and amounted to an acquittal.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Well, Mr. Justice, I would think that if you concluded that you had no jurisdiction, the case had never left the District Court, and you would not have power to send it back with any directions or instructions of any kind. 
    There is a suggestion here in the argument today that Sisson's objection was not a selective one. 
    On that, I would simply refer to page 151 of the appendix, Sisson's testimony which the government accepts as part of the agreed statement of facts here, “I refused induction because I believe the war in Vietnam, that is the United States war making in Vietnam, to be wrong.” 
    He then went on to say, “That therefore, I felt that by accepting induction that even though I might not be sent to Vietnam, I would be consenting to the government's waging a war in Vietnam and I believe that my duty not to consent with that action because I did not consent in my own mind.” 
    With respect to the power of Congress to impose a peace time military service, I was fortunate enough to go off in a country which did not have conscription, and I suppose I regarded that as something which would last for all time. 
    It would be fine if we could get to that situation. 
    I would point out though that Congress enacted the modern conscription laws in 1940, which was technically a time of peace, actually a time of peace in this country. 
    That the problem of reenacting that statute in 1941 also came up in a time of peace in this country, and it would be rather surprising if it should now be held that Congress had no power to pass those statutes. 
    Let me conclude by simply saying that our professional historian friends are rather skeptical of lawyer's history. 
    They refer to it as law office history and regarded as –- to use an appropriate word, as highly selective. C.V. Wedgwood, the noted historian, wrote one time, “We know the end before we consider the beginning and we can never wholly recapture what it was to know the beginning only.” 
    And our submission here is that the Court should not find in history something that surely was not there. 
    Our predecessors were sensitive to the First Amendment, but the founders accepted the exemption from military service for members of the peace churches without any question, and this was accepted explicitly in the Acts of Congress for 130 years right through the First World War. 
    It would be odd indeed if the invalidity of this unbroken practice was now discovered for the first time a 180 years after the adoption of the Bill of Rights.
