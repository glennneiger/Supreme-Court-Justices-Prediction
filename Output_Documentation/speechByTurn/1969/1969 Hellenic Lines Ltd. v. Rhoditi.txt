    Number 661, Hellenic Lines against Rhoditis. 
    Mr. Estabrook, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="12.212" stopTime="201.446">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I represent the petitioner herein in a petition for certiorari from the Fifth Circuit. 
    George Wood, the original counsel of record who tried this case in Mobile and who argued the case in the Fifth Circuit is very sorry he's unable to be here. 
    He called me about two weeks ago and said he had the recurrence of a heart condition, asked me if I could possibly argue. 
    I agreed. 
    I was hoping to see him here but unfortunately his brother passed away on Saturday right after a golf game and George was unable to attend. 
    I represent not only the petitioners herein but I also submitted a brief amicus for the Royal Greek Government. 
    As I said before this is an appeal -- a petition for certiorari by Hellenic Lines Limited and Universal Cargo Carriers from a decision of the Fifth Circuit affirming an admiralty decree in the Southern District of Alabama Southern Division in favor of the libellant below the respondent here. 
    The accident occurred August 3, 1965 in a libel in rem and in personam was filed August 13, 1965. 
    So the case came up under the old admiralty rules. 
    Briefly, the facts which are pertinent are that Rhoditis, the libellant below and the respondent here was a Greek seaman with a wife and two children in Greece. 
    He is a resident of Greece. 
    He joined the Greek Flag Motorship Hellenic Hero in Heraklion Crete. 
    He signed the standard Greek articles. 
    While the opinion of the District Court contained in the findings and conclusions stated he is illiterate. 
    He is practically illiterate in English. 
    The record is disclosing that he can read and write only figures and write only his address in English but that he can read and write Greek since he can write letters to his wife and he can read Greek. 
    The Hellenic Hero, a Greek flag vessel was sailing in the United States, India, Pakistan Trade. 
    At the time the depositions herein were taken, the Suez Canal was either open or had just been closed. 
    Now, this trade through Suez no longer exists. 
    The practical difference, however, is this that whereas in -- when the depositions were taken and on the record it appears that Hellenic Lines had 20 ships, 24 ships sailing out of New York and U.S. ports and only 12 ships out of European ports based on Pireas at present. 
    The American-based ships are down to 20 and the European ships are up to 19. 
    The -- also there is some --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="201.446" stopTime="208.267">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, is this not a situation which fluctuates from time to time depending on the demands for shipping?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="208.267" stopTime="717.389">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    Of course it does. 
    The demands of this case happened to be away from the American trade and in favor to foreign trade also there while the report, the facts as stated by the trial judge stated there was no intermediate traffic at present time, there is a considerable amount of trade between intermediate ports particularly between the Indian, Pakistan ports and South Africa. 
    Briefly, the acts did occur in this manner. 
    As the Hellenic Hero was tying up, and the purpose of this is to show how the acts had really involves only the people of the ship, he was tying up in New Orleans. 
    They have the lines opened and the spring line or a line leading from the bow aft not directly to dock but aft to keep the ship from surging ahead was being secured where that is working up in the bow. 
    This spring line was secured around the winch and they had been taking the strain on it and when they are going to tie the ship up, they had to take this line which is a heavy wire rope off the winch drum and bend it around bollards which are two iron columns about three feet high and about three feet apart like two fourplex and you bend this wire around the bollards making about eight -- figure eights and that's how you secure the ship. 
    But when you take the wire off the winch drum, it's necessary to secure it by a small piece of chain which the interpreter and the record referred to as a keeper. 
    Actually the correct term is stopper and you take the slide chain and you wind it around the wire tying some knots on it and that will take the strain off the wire in the drum because the end of the chain is secured to the bits. 
    Then with the strain off the wire and the drum, you can loosen the wire on the drum and put it on the bits. 
    Well, they did that. 
    They -- the stopper or keeper looked new, looked to be in good condition. 
    They put it on. 
    They took the wire off the drum and they were putting it on the bits and as they were putting it the second turn, the chain suddenly broke as the engines of the ship went ahead. 
    That's the testimony. 
    Why they went ahead, nobody knows, but of course that would put extra strain and the line leading aft extra strain on the chain. 
    The chain broke and the piece of a chain struck Rhoditis in the leg. 
    Rhoditis was then taken to a hospital in New Orleans after his first cast was removed. 
    As soon as he was able to travel, he was moved to Greece and he was able to return to work according to the trial court the next March. 
    Hellenic Lines, the employer is a Greek corporation. 
    It had in its employ some 1100 seamen. 
    It paid taxes last year of over $5 million to Greece. 
    Some old repair bills were paid to Greece of about the same amount. 
    It, however, did have a New York office and in the New York office, the record shows it employed between 75 to 100 people depending on whether it appeared to the testimony. 
    It has a New Orleans office, 10 to 15 people and the Pireas office of 70 to 75. 
    If you disregard the seaman, then you do have more people employed in the offices in New York than in Greece but if you take the seaman into account and they are all Greeks then you have a pronounced Greek flavor to the company. 
    There are also some longshoremen employed in New York , stevedores, but we also have longshoremen abroad and actually you employ a lot more longshoremen abroad than you do in this country because you have better machinery in this country. 
    So in any international run, you tend to have more longshoremen than the other side. 
    We believe this -- however there are some American features the operation. 
    The substantial part of Hellenic Heroes trade is to and from the United States. 
    While Hellenic Lines is a Greek corporation, the majority stockholder and the principal executive officer or general manager of the company is a resident of the United States although a citizen of Greece. 
    We have in our brief for the petitioner and the record indicates he received several honors from the kingdom of Greece. 
    We are not claiming sovereign immunity, diplomatic immunity or anything like that. 
    Mr. Callimanopoulos has been of assistance, the Greek mission. 
    He is receiving official Greek passport from time to time and the purpose of this proof in the record is to show his allegiance to Greece. 
    He is a bona fide Greek citizen. 
    He performs duties to the Greek Government. 
    We believe this case comes squarely under the doctrine of Larsen against Lauritzen because both these cases emphasized two things, the primacy of the flag, that is very important. 
    The flag of a ship should determine the law applicable to the ship and also the fact that it's important that there will be an available forum. 
    There is an available forum in this case. 
    Mr. Rhoditis can pursue his claim for compensation in Greece, and there we must pay him under Greek law and under the collective bargaining agreement. 
    In fact, the collective bargaining agreement specifies particularly the adoption of Greek law and this is very similar to the collective bargaining agreement that was followed by this Court in Larsen against Lauritzen which provided for determination of disputes in Denmark. 
    The -- in Larsen against Lauritzen, we had an accident in Havana where the ship sailing between United States and the West Coast of South America. 
    Both -- that ship never did go to Denmark in a regular trade. 
    Both vessels had crews of substantially crews of the citizenship of the flag. 
    They -- the Randa did have a few Chileans but all the officers and most of the crew were Danes. 
    In both cases, the -- we claim the place of the acts in this is unimportant. 
    In the Randa the man was injured in Havana yet he was brought to the United States for medical treatment and he remained. 
    Larsen actually remained in the United States until he was able to sail again, so the medical testimony was readily available here yet the Court held that Jones Act did apply. 
    In both cases, the court was based for the seaman who was engaged under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement negotiated with the assistance of the national union and the national association of shipowners. 
    We the petitioner here and the Greek Government are both very much opposed to the "runaway flag". 
    Insofar as the respondent and his amici argue against the runaway flag were or in fully in a Court. 
    We believe that argument is solved but we say it does not apply to this case. 
    Our position is that as stated in the Larsen case and quoted in my brief amicus, "Each state under international law" it's page 3 "may determine for itself the conditions upon which you can grant us nationality to a merchant ship thereby accepting responsibility for it and acquiring authority over it. 
    We believe that the phrase "accepting responsibility" is important. 
    If a nation does not accept responsibility for its merchant ships then that you have a runaway flag situation.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Mr. Estabrook does his remedy that you have referred to under Greek law still subsists?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="725.784" stopTime="726.962">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    Yes.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="726.962" stopTime="730.290">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Statute of limitations is not involved?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="730.290" stopTime="941.792">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    He can -- it still subsists, that was -- we have the same thing in Tsakonites, Your Honor. 
    Tsakonites brought his case up in the Second Circuit. 
    This Court denied certiorari and thereupon Tsakonites commenced proceedings in the Greek court and recovered and that is exhibit A on the Greek Government's brief. 
    If you don't accept responsibility for a ship then you have true runaway flag. 
    For instance, you may have a ship under say Panamanian or Liberian Registry with a Cayman Island crew, Norwegian officers and Spanish engineers. 
    You don't have the regular inspection that we have. 
    The Greek Government insists on regular inspections of the ship, regular surveys. 
    It insists on Greek ownership. 
    If you have a foreign corporation owning a Greek ship then does exists here then the technical ownership was in universal cargo carriers, a Panamanian corporation but the ship was in fact operated by Hellenic who hired the crew then you must under Greek law have an agent in Greece who can make the reports necessary. 
    You must have the ship under the Greek flag. 
    I mean you do have a -- you must also have a Greek crew. 
    You must have Greek officers. 
    You have a pension plan in Greece known as NAT capital N, capital A, capital T to which all Greek seamen must contribute. 
    To this doctrine of recognizing responsible flags has been followed by this Court not only Larsen against Lauritzen in 1953 but again in 1959, in Romero case where a Spanish seaman was injured on a Spanish ship in the port of New York, the Court held that Spanish laws should and not the Jones Act. 
    A similar case in McCulloch against Honduran Union quoted in the petitioner's brief where the Court -- this Court held that the National Labor Relations Act would not apply to Honduran flag ships with Honduran crews operated by Honduran corporations between New York and Honduras even though the Honduran corporations were subsidiaries of an American corporation. 
    The -- they recognized the law of the flag as being a responsible flag for the reason that these Honduran ships were actually meant by Hondurans and they had Honduran officers. 
    The background being of course that these ships were carrying bananas and one of the conditions for granting banana concessions, the fruit company would be that bona fide Honduran ships would be used to transport bananas and while the ultimate directions of these ships is in the United States, the allegiance of the owner, a Honduran corporation was to the Republic of Honduras. 
    For that reason when the Court declined to apply the National Labor Relations Act.

    What you're saying is some statute.
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="1013.457" stopTime="1014.076">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    Yes, the Jones Act --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1014.076" stopTime="1020.662">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Can you find something in that statute that shows that the case could be tried here?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="1020.662" stopTime="1123.047">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    The Jones Act, Your Honor has been interpreted by this Court in 19 -- it does, there's in the statute. 
    Now, I brief this point thoroughly in my Randall, Larsen -- Lauritzen against Larsen case. 
    The Jones Act is Section 20 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. 
    Certain sections of that Act specifically apply to foreign ships. 
    I'm talking primarily about the provision against advances that applies to foreign ships as well as to American ships and so states in the statute. 
    There's another section, the so-called penalty wage statute that specifically applies to foreign vessels. 
    That requires a shipowner to pay half earned wages in an intermediate port and all of the earned wages within four days after arriving from a foreign voyage at the port of destination. 
    Now, the history is rather interesting. 
    When those two sections were originally enacted, I believe it was the Shipping Act of 1916 or maybe a little earlier. 
    They were in general terms such as the Jones Act. 
    The courts construe both those sections in the first instance as not applying either to advances made in a foreign port or to foreign ships. 
    At that point, both sections were amended specifically to apply foreign vessels. 
    Consequently, cases like Strathearn against Dillon read that the Congress had the power to apply a statute to foreign vessels but --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1123.047" stopTime="1124.160">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What was the power?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="1124.160" stopTime="1183.584">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    To apply statutes as to pay and as permitting advances to foreign vessels but unless it specifically applies to foreign vessels then they shouldn't be construed so as to apply the foreign vessels and the reason for that is this, other sections of the Shipping Act refer to the rights of any shipowner who call in American consul in a foreign port must submit disputes in a foreign port. 
    Well, obviously, you wouldn't expect the British or Japanese or Greek ship to see an American consul in London. 
    He'd go to his own consul if he had trouble. 
    So the statute, the Jones Act has been construed as not applying to foreign crews despite the broadness of the terms and this construction of the Jones Act in the Larsen case of 1953 was followed by the Romero case is 1959 and yet Congress did nothing to amend the Act.

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    In this case, he very likely could because this remedy in this country is rather small when you consider the seriousness of the injuries and when you consider that he got I believe $6,000.00 in this country and that's all he gets, he can't go back.

    Well, because first of all, you have a question of congestion in the Courts and the second place, the Greek remedy is similar to workman's compensation. 
    It's very similar.

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    I'm arguing that the Greeks think the Greek remedy is better and the Greeks have provided the Greek remedy for Greek seamen somewhat a workman's compensation with punitive damages in the event there's a violation of the safety law or a safety regulation.

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    Well, I believe in circumstances where you have a seaman on -- injured on a ship which is a bona fide foreign flag operator. 
    In other words, the country of the flag has responsibility for the ship that it cruise the ship, it supervises the ship and where there's a forum readily available, then I believe it will be better for these -- our courts that decline jurisdiction and in any event, this decision below --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume that the Jones Act expressly applied to accidents on foreign flag ships sailing in American waters but the parties as in this case contracted out, attempted to contract out, the parties here expressly agreed to the application of Greek law I take it.

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    Yes they did. 
    If the Jones Act expressly applied to foreign flag vessels sailing in American waters, then a number of sections of the Jones Act specifically invalidate any contractual exemption from the Act. 
    There is a section of the Railway Labor Act which is incorporated in reference by the Jones Act which makes an attempt to avoid the Act by contract invalid.

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    That's right.

   Argument of Joseph B. Stahl

    Mr. Joseph B. Stahl 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this honorable --

    Mr. Joseph B. Stahl 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    May it please this Honorable Court. 
    According to this Court in the Lauritzen case, there are two justifications for disregarding the law of the nation of the vessel's foreign flag in order to apply American law in a suit such as this. 
    The first justification is if the flag is merely one of convenience and not bona fide. 
    The other is if there exists some heavy account of weight to even a bona fide foreign flag, we contend in this case that this is -- this Greek flag is a flag merely of convenience by virtue of the following facts which I shall attempt to state as briefly as possible. 
    The ship owner in this case Mr. Callimanopoulos, a Greek citizen concededly and the owner of the petitioner corporations started a shipping business in Greece in 1935. 
    This Greek operation operated from Greece was reduced to absolutely nothing in World War II by sinking an enemy action. 
    At the end of World War II during which incidentally the Greek Government had confiscated his ships for military defense purposes, in 1945 he came to the United States and started over a completely anew in the shipping business such that there was no continuum of Greek operation and Greek flag used. 
    He started over here as if he had never been in any shipping business anywhere else. 
    And the fact is that now, he has been a domiciliary of this country for 25 years. 
    During the last 19 of which, he has enjoyed permanent resident alien status.

    Continuing on factually, he finances his entire operation with money borrowed from New York banks and always has. 
    The claims manager of petitioner, Hellenic, is the United States citizen in domiciliary. 
    Its treasurer who collects freight rates charged all over the world is a United States citizen domiciliary and one of its directors is the United States citizen in domiciliary. 
    His ships are operated from the United States in five regular line of services. 
    That is the operating instructions emanate from offices in New York City. 
    All the voyages of which line of services originate and terminate the United States with all cargos thereon originating and terminating in the United States ports. 
    He is charging freight rates fixed by United States line of conference systems of which his corporations are members. 
    He handles virtually no trade with the nation from which he came, Greece, but trades actively with 15 other nations. 
    He owns his docks in New York. 
    He employs regularly in this country approximately 215 people and employs only at most a total 75 in Greece but more significant and I'm getting at what I think establishes the broad of the connection with the United States. 
    It is the policy of his company that all cargos including European cargos are solicited only by his New York office even in situations were the Greek office learns of their movement first in Greece, they are required by the rules of the company to relay this information to petitioners U.S. office so that the latter, not the Greek office, may solicit such cargo and most significant, getting to this Panamanian corporation. 
    In 1956, Mr. Callimanopoulos registered the ownership of most of his U.S. line of service vessels to two Panamanian corporations created by him especially for this purpose, Trans Pacific Cargo Carriers, Inc. and petitioner, Universal.

    But Mr. Justice Jackson in the Lauritzen case indicated that the argument of that type was misaddressed to this Court and it should have been taken over that at Congress and if it was in the interest of the United States, it was not for this Court to legislate it but for Congress to do so and I don't think that that is necessary to justify an affirmation of the Fifth Circuit's decision in this case.

    The first is that regardless of his literacy well-known, the restrictive provision be explained to him and the second is that he be paid extra compensation for his agreement so restrict his rights.

    Mr. Joseph B. Stahl 
    Yes, Your Honor, I would not only say that but I would say that if these were American citizens that that has no significance at all. 
    When you're dealing with the question of the national allegiance of a corporation, which is what we're dealing with here, and the law to which its subject, the U.S. citizenship of its stockholders could not render American law applicable to it. 
    If this was so, American citizens would have the power to taint and stigmatized bona fide foreign enterprises by buying their stock and thereby subjecting them to more stringent American laws. 
    And when it comes to a corporation, it's my understanding of a basic corporation law that presence of principal actors and parties in a forum state of the corporation and conduct in the forum of the corporation's principal business including all managerial and operational functions far outweighs the naked fact that the incorporation elsewhere as far as determining that the law of the forum is applicable to such a corporation and this has been the decision of many of our district in the circuit courts in cases specifically involving the application of the Jones Act of foreign registered corporations. 
    What they have looked to is not the citizenship of the stockholders but to the place where the corporation makes its money. 
    Any other result would result in chaos. 
    If corporations were held subject to the laws of the place where they paid dividends to their stockholders or to the law of the place where they borrowed the money to finance their operations, this would indeed result in chaos and do more to blight international commerce in the application of the Jones Act to this case.

    Mr. Joseph B. Stahl 
    It would depend on the place from which he run it to my way of thinking. 
    It would depend -- if we are to look at the corporations and ask -- in other words, if we only look at this corporate façade and ask what is the allegiance of this corporations, I would say it is the place where the corporations do their business but if on the other hand, we are to look at the individual, I think we should do what this Court did in the Lauritzen case and that is look to the national allegiance of this individual shipowner and I've cited a body of law of what I think is impressive universality and maturity going back 150 years according to which in the eyes of the law of nations, a man's national allegiance is deemed to be to that nation where he has his domicile because domicile is prima facie evidence of national character susceptible of course at all times to explanations. 
    If it be for a special purpose and transient in its nature then it does not derogate from or destroy the prior or original national character but if it be taken up with the intention of remaining as here, then it substitutes for the original or prior national character, the disabilities and penalties as well as the privileges and immunities of the United States citizen. 
    Your Honor, Mr. Justice Black, held that in the case of Kwong Hai Chew versus Colding in which the Justice Department attempted to deport without a hearing a resident alien and he claimed that the constitutional privileges were available to him. 
    I see if I may so that the Honorable Mr. Davis here represented the Government in that case and Your Honor held that even though Congress had never said it, and the constitutional convention didn't put it in the Constitution, Your Honor held that the constitutional protections were available to resident aliens and these cases which I've cited, have held further resident aliens are subject to our draft laws.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Were there any bills have been introduced in the Congress that follows Lauritzen or Romero?
speaker="joseph_b_stahl" startTime="3145.095" stopTime="3292.921">
    Mr. Joseph B. Stahl 
    No there were not. 
    Let me say this. 
    Though I think there's a good reason based on language of Mr. Justice Jackson in the Lauritzen case, he pointed that the laws of this -- the shipping laws of this country which are contained in Title 46 are many and of those very few are specific in their language, in their application either to American or foreign shipping operations and this is what he said about that. 
    He said many give no evidence that Congress addressed itself to their foreign application and are in general terms which leave their application to be judicially determined from context and circumstance. 
    He decided that where Congress has been silent, while it is not -- the courts not only made but they must speak on what they mean and then specifically with reference to the Jones Act, he said Congress could not have been unaware of the necessity of construction imposed upon courts by such generality of language and was well warned but in the absence of the more definite directions than are contained in the Jones Act, it would be applied by the courts two foreign advanced ships and foreign seamen in accordance with the usual doctrine and practices of maritime law. 
    So apparently Congress has felt that the courts must and are able to determine in each case whether they are sufficient contacts of the United States as weighed by the seven factors to Lauritzen test to warrant or justify the application to foreign transactions or not. 
    So that in effect, it has not been necessary for Congress to legislate on that. 
    I think it would even be dangerous for Congress to legislate on that because these shipping operators -- the national symbols for which they surround themselves are but part and parcel of the paraphernalia that's dictated by the exigencies and convenience of their economics and commerce and the scrambled types of transactions at which we have a wonderful example here are just typical. 
    And it would be very difficult for Congress to comprehend in one act something that would slice the line between a bona fide foreign operator like Mr. Jay Lauritzen of Denmark who has always incidentally been a Danish domiciliary and an operator like Mr. Pericles Callimanopoulos who is enjoying the privileges and the immunities as American citizen by living here.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3292.921" stopTime="3308.942">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you have any statistics on the number of ships bought from the American Government on five terms that operate under Panamanian registry although they do all their business practices in this country?
speaker="joseph_b_stahl" startTime="3308.942" stopTime="3558.020">
    Mr. Joseph B. Stahl 
    I do not Your Honor and they are certainly would not make a matter of proof in this case. 
    Let me if I may dwell upon the Tsakonites decision as Your Honors I believe have been made aware, this case comes to you on a conflict between the circuits that Tsakonites court decided on identical facts that the Jones Act did not apply. 
    Incidentally, with regard to what I contend as a flag of convenience here, I would be the first to say that if Mr. Callimanopoulos had just recently come over here, -- if he had just recently come here and then only temporarily to get started, a United States office is merely a small branch to a Greek office and they were a continued and uninterrupted use of Greek flags as part of a principal business in Greece which is not the case and even Your Honor would say that the Court of the United States would be stretching matters rather far to brand his flags as flags of convenience but whereas here, there's an overwhelming preponderance of contacts with the United States as I've outlined and corporate registry in Panama, it is obvious that what this man is doing is dictated by convenience. 
    And if the Court is prepared to say that even under these circumstances, such a flag is a bona fide flag, then I would conclude that the United States has become a fair game to a certain extent for economic parasites to entrust themselves like binnacles in the whole of our maritime commerce. 
    But getting to Tsakonites, in Tsakonites, the basis of the decision was, I beg your pardon, let me say that no case has really set forth guidelines as to what determines whether a flag is one of convenience or not. 
    Our courts have had no difficulty for instance in saying that where American citizens domiciled here and operating ships from here, have gone shopping abroad in a foreign marketplace of flags and gotten a foreign flag, and such a flag is obviously not a good faith flag and on the other hand, where it is foreign citizens with a bona fide foreign operation and the foreign flag of the same nation, then that is obviously a bona fide flag. 
    But these facts are in between and I would think that the Court would be doing a service at least to the Circuit Courts Of Appeal to tell us what is the flag of convenience so that never again shall two circuit Courts Of Appeal look at identical facts and come up with opposite conclusions as the Fifth and the Second have done here. 
    Now, this was the reason for the Second Circuit's decision in Tsakonites. 
    It was the law of the contract. 
    They conceded their own confusion as a result of the facts. 
    They said, "We must concede that these -- this constellation of facts" and I'm only paraphrasing, "presents a combination never before seen in any other case and they took the easy but the wrong way out and decided the case on the law of the contract which as I believe has been well dealt with cannot wag the dog, that's only the tail and the act of the law must be determined on the basis of the seven Lauritzen factors. 
    I believe I have also indicated that it is not necessary for Your Honors to decide that this flag is one of convenience in order to uphold the Fifth Circuit even if it is a bona fide flag in accordance with Lauritzen, there exists to it that heavy counterweight of the domicile and national allegiance of the shipowner. 
    May I have an alternative argument that the General Maritime Law would be applicable here as not being repugnant to the law of Greece under two theories. 
    Two cases which I have not cited in my brief, one from this Court, the Scotland and the other Heredia versus Davies held that in matters of this type where foreign law is not proved, it may be presumed to be the same as the law of the United States. 
    That being the case, then there is nothing repugnant to the law of Greece in applying the General Maritime Law of the United States.

    He received most of that in Greece although he was hospitalized for approximately two weeks in the United States but that is a factor which if I may say has never been given any weight by any court.

    I just asked. 
    What were -- what were the nature and extent of his injuries?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3632.052" stopTime="3639.251">

    His injuries were merely two puncture fractures of the small bone or fibula of his lower leg.

    Mr. Joseph B. Stahl 
    When I say puncture fractures, it was made by broken chain lengths, so there were two prongs and they're just punctured about half an inch deep and just made some chunky fractures.

    Mr. Joseph B. Stahl 
    A long time ago, this Court, I believe in the Osceola decided that the maritime law of nations at least as far as it applies to seamen is that they have a right of action for damages for unseaworthiness but since that time, the General Maritime Law has come to be viewed as the General Maritime Law of the United States as distinguished from whatever the international maritime law and the law of nations is. 
    But I think that that quotation taken in connection with his dispensing or giving short shrift to the argument that the interest of the seamen in that case were the interest of the United States because if he were granted recovery, it would equalize competition, this was I believe Mr. Justice Jackson's way of saying that we cannot consider the interest of the United States in this kind of a contact -- context in order to oust some applicable law of another foreign nation, of a foreign nation.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Estabrook.
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3750.805" stopTime="3825.033">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    I think I have a couple of minutes, Your Honor. 
    I would just like to point out none of the courts below considered at all the number of Greek seamen on these ships. 
    There are over 1100 seamen to back up our point that this is a bona fide Greek operation. 
    We also have another resting opinion from Judge Hoffman in Virginia which is the next to the supplemental brief which he goes in great detail to the point raised by Mr. Justice White on the application of the contract restrictions to determine the law to be applied and finally, we have the fact that Mr. Callimanopoulos, he may be a binnacle, but he's a fair paying binnacle. 
    As a domiciliary, he is required to pay income taxes here and he isn't trying to avoid any of his American obligations. 
    He has obligations to America, and to Greece and as far as his allegiance to Greece is concerned, he is a citizen of Greece and the Larsen case definitely stated, it was the allegiance of the shipowner that should be considered as one of the primary points. 
    His allegiance was to Greece.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3825.033" stopTime="3833.399">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mr. Estabrook, are they part of the reason for the large number of Greek seaman be the factor that there are cheaper labor?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3833.399" stopTime="3841.487">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    One -- one of the points, things Your Honor, there are over 100,000 Greek seamen and one of the largest groups of seamen in the world and I think the principal --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3841.487" stopTime="3848.948">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, is the standard wages for Greek seamen equal to that of the United States, the answer is no.
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3848.948" stopTime="3852.787">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    Of course not. 
    It is higher though than say Spanish seamen.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3852.787" stopTime="3855.629">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But we're dealing with the United States here.
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3855.629" stopTime="3858.276">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    It is lower and --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3858.276" stopTime="3860.290">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Does he pay taxes in Greece?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3860.290" stopTime="3862.071">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    Yes, he does, Your Honor.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3862.071" stopTime="3870.883">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And does he pay on these insurance policies over there, working compensation clauses, or do the seamen pay that?

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    He pays on -- he pays that there.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3873.055" stopTime="3875.237">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I thought you said the seamen pay them.
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3875.237" stopTime="3884.740">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    The seamen -- no, the seamen contribute and he contributes to a seaman's pension fund, NAT, N-A-T.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3884.740" stopTime="3886.105">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Oh!

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    No, that's not involved here.

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    He'll get more than that Your Honor.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    How much?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3899.675" stopTime="3901.070">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    I don't know.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3901.070" stopTime="3903.279">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    165?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3903.279" stopTime="3939.848">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    No. 
    He was just disabled for I think seven months. 
    He got 40 pounds a month. 
    He'd probably get $500.00 or $600.00 as wages, he'd get medical but the most important thing he'd get in Greece would be that this should reactivate itself. 
    He would then get further medical attention and a further payment along the lines of workman's compensation. 
    The Greek law is actually designed to be similar like the New York State Workman's Comp.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3939.848" stopTime="3942.681">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    He gets paid while he's working?

speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3952.977" stopTime="3954.964">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    No, he'd get more than that. 
    He got paid once.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But you don't know how much more?

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    I don't know how much more and if there's any -- I don't -- this Court found no disability so he'd get --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3961.365" stopTime="3969.877">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Couldn't I assume from the fact that you're defending this case that there would be more?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3969.877" stopTime="3972.949">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    We're defending this case because as a matter of principle --

    I see.
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="3973.416" stopTime="3981.542">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    -- he'd get more. 
    I can assure you that as far as this, if it were not for the principle involved, this case would never be here, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3981.542" stopTime="3989.880">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you would be making the same argument whether the -- suppose that this individual was a Greek or an American, wouldn't you?

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    On this ship, yes. 
    I'd say that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3991.287" stopTime="4002.291">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So it's really irrelevant about the allegiance of the majority stockholder of this corporation, your argument would be the same?
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="4002.291" stopTime="4004.527">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    That's right. 
    In fact the McCulloch case says it is the same.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4004.527" stopTime="4011.232">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And you're -- and the owner of the ship anyway is a Panamanian corporation?

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    All of the stock of which is owned by a Greek Corporation.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    By a Greek Corporation and 99% of which is owned by --

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    A Greek citizen domiciled in this country.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4021.220" stopTime="4028.562">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But those things are really irrelevant, aren't they, to your argument because as long as the ship is registered in Greece --
speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="4028.562" stopTime="4029.101">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    That's right.

    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4032.093" stopTime="4034.791">

    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    That's -- yes, that follows the argument in the McCulloch. 
    Now, in Larsen against Lauritzen, the allegiance of the owner, the fact the owner is a Greek citizen is important and the same way in the Romero case which followed --

    You say there are no such things as flags of convenience.

speaker="james_m_estabrook" startTime="4056.911" stopTime="4071.721">
    Mr. James M. Estabrook 
    Because of the fact the Greek Government is responsible for the good order and maintenance of the ship. 
    They have a Greek crew on board this ship. 
    They have Greek licensed officers. 
    They have Greek inspections. 
    This is a bona fide Greek operation.
