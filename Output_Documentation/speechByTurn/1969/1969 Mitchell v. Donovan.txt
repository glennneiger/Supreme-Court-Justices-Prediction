    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The appellants in this case are the Communist Party of the United States of America, Communist Party of the State of Minnesota, Mrs. Charlene Mitchell and Mr. Michael Zagerell, 1968 Communist Party Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, Mrs. Betty Smith State Secretary of the Minnesota Communist Party, 10 presidential electors from the State of Minnesota for the Communist Party, two plaintiff appellees representing the 2,394 registered voters who signed a petition to put the Communist Party candidates on the 1968 ballot and one registered voter who did not sign the petition. 
    The Communist Party of the State of Minnesota as well as the National Party are unincorporated associations. 
    The Communist Party of Minnesota held a duly convened statewide convention in Minnesota on or about June 23, 1968. 
    They elected six delegates and an alternate delegate to the National Convention of the Communist Party U.S.A, which was called for and held in New York, July 4 to July 7, 1968. 
    At the Communist Party of Minnesota Convention, a motion was passed that if the Communist Party U.S.A nominated a presidential ticket that the Communist Party of Minnesota would endeavor to place on the ballot in Minnesota those candidates. 
    Mrs. Betty Smith attended that convention as a delegate in New York. 
    Mrs. Mitchell and Mr. Zagerell were duly nominated by that convention immediately following the Communist Party of Minnesota mounted a campaign to obtain the requisite number of signatures, under Minnesota Law, 2000 to place the candidates on the ballot. 
    On this nominating petition appeared the name of the ten Communist presidential electors and under Minnesota Law on the ballot only appears the name of the candidates and by Minnesota Law, a vote for the candidates is a vote for those electors. 
    On Sunday, September 8, the party completed its campaign to collect signatures. 
    On the next day, Monday the 9th, representatives of the Communist Party, the National Office as well as the State appeared at the Office of Secretary of State of Minnesota Joseph Donovan to file the nominating petition. 
    The party representatives arrived at the Secretary of State's Office during the noon hour. 
    Immediately after noon, they tendered their petition. 
    This petition was anticipated and they were presented a written refusal of the Secretary of State. 
    He did examine the contents of the package and satisfied himself that it was the nominating petition for the Communist Party. 
    His refusal said, “Please be advised that upon the advice of the Attorney General of Minnesota and at his direction as a matter of law, I hereby officially refuse.” 
    The Attorney General had issued an opinion which was also a copy of which was given to the representatives, in which the Attorney General said, “In view of the Federal Statutes and quoted in full Sections 841 and 842 of the Communist Control Act, we are of the opinion that you should refuse to accept for filing the nominating petition in question. 
    However, any doubts relative to this matter can only be finally resolved by the Courts pursuant to appropriate legal proceedings.” 
    The party went to Court. 
    Judge Devitt convened the three-fudge District Court and on September 30th, heard arguments of counsel. 
    Following that and inspite of a request for a permanent injunction, the Court ruled that a hurried decision would not be appropriate.

    That is the only injunction at that time. 
    We ask for such other and further relief in the prayer for relief and following the issuance of the temporary injunction and the passage of election, we noticed it for trial came back to Court and found ourselves arguing a motion to dismiss as moot.

    Yes, we amended our complaint and the three-judge court granted the motion to amend the complaint. 
    In the prayer, we said that the Communist Party of Minnesota intended to participate in future local, state and national elections. 
    This amendment was granted and it was supported by an affidavit of Mrs. Smith to this effect on behalf of the party.

    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    The prayer was not amended. 
    We felt that under Rule 54(c) the request for additional relief would incorporate our desire to obtain a permanent injunction.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="472.619" stopTime="485.229">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The only injunction you ask for, as I understand it explicitly, was an injunction to an election that is now passed and an election in which your clients were placed on a ballot in that time.
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="485.229" stopTime="486.922">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="486.922" stopTime="497.064">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that thereafter the only explicit relief demanded either in the original complaint or in the complaint that's amended was one for declaratory relief, is that right?
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="497.064" stopTime="510.225">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    That is correct, although we feel we were not able to come back to Court because of the disposition of the motion of the state to dismiss as moot to ask for a permanent injunction which we feel we are entitled to by this party.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="510.225" stopTime="519.133">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, yes, you were entitled to ask for it and then the dismissal would have been a denial of it but you did not in fact ask for it, did you?

    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    No, we did not.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="519.589" stopTime="537.417">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    An injunction is strong medicine and generally the rules of pleading required that if you want an injunction you have to ask for an injunction and then it is not incorporated in the ordinary boilerplate language of such other further relief that maybe appropriate in circumstances etcetera, etcetera.
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="537.417" stopTime="538.395">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    We did see --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="538.395" stopTime="556.008">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You know that is on my mind I suppose to these questions and that is whether or not this Court has jurisdiction under Title 28 of the Code Section 1253 whether or not in other words there was here a denial of an injunction and there was a denial of an injunction only if you asked for an injunction that was denied?
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="556.008" stopTime="576.911">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    We feel that the relief asked for, we did ask for a permanent injunction. 
    We feel that this is similar to the Moore v. Ogilvie case the specific injunction to put them on the ballot was not necessary after the election. 
    All that remained was declaratory relief which if granted would have the effect of an injunction.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="576.911" stopTime="582.324">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What necessitated three-judge court?
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="582.324" stopTime="609.446">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    We sought to enjoin the both by the temporary relief requested the permanent injunction and the declaratory relief to stop to enjoin the execution and enforcement of the Communist Control Act of 1954. 
    Had we obtained the declaratory relief we asked for, it would have had the effect of restraining the operation and enforcement of the Act.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="609.446" stopTime="617.388">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I don't see any request for an injunction for restraining and enforcing of the Communist Control Act.
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="617.388" stopTime="641.227">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    The United States is not a party. 
    We could not restrain the United States from enforcing the Act as against State Elections because the United States has no power to interfere with the state elections in this regard. 
    The only state -- the only Government officials who have the power to execute and enforce the Communist Control Act in elections are the state officials.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="641.227" stopTime="649.606">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You did not -- even not ask them a Court injunction against --
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="649.606" stopTime="952.576">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    Well, we asked for the relief which the Court held below entitled us to a three-judge court, to restrain the state officials from preventing the Communist Party from being on the ‘68 ballot. 
    Following that election, we amended our compliant to let the Court know that the Communist Party intended to participate in future elections. 
    The next point is that in support of the lower court's order dismissing the complaint as moot, we believe that it is clear that the Communist Party will continue to participate in elections both on a statewide level and on a national level. 
    The party has participated in the past in 163 elections, 41 states have been the site of those elections and in Minnesota there have been 27 elections all but one of these have been election contests for state or national office. 
    Now, the Attorney General has made the argument below that it is and this was adopted by the three-judge court that it is just speculative that the party will run for future elections and he said the earliest time that could come up again is 1972. 
    We would like to point out to the Court that the time is upon us now for the party to participate in other elections. 
    We have statewide elections, we have elections for United States Senator as well as for the House of Representatives and if this case is -- if the order of the court below is upheld as moot, the Communist Party will have participated in litigation for almost two years and be in precisely the situation that we argue such an order would place us that is that we would have to go back into Court again and litigate the question of the right of the party to appear on the ballot. 
    The court below refused to reach the merits saying that a hurried decision would not be wise or would be unwise. 
    They also wish the United States to be a party. 
    Chief Judge Devitt teletyped the United States Attorney, Mr. Ramsey Clark and ordered him to appear on the Court. 
    Mr. Clark replied with a letter saying that he had other commitments and did not appear. 
    However, he sent the United States Attorney for the District of Minnesota to appear amicus curiae and he did appear and argued to the Court that the Communist Control Act does not bar the party from the ballot that it can be interpreted citing Catherwood as for the proposition that Communist Party, pardon me, candidates could run as long as they didn't use the label Communist Party. 
    He also suggested to the Attorney General that Minnesota Law might allow the Communist Party to appear on the ballot with the designation Communist Party, an argument which was not accepted by either the Court or by the Attorney General. 
    I think that that position of the United States fails because it does not recognize that the party itself under Minnesota Law has a right. 
    There are provisions in the law, which allow a party to present candidates if it receives a percentage of votes and we feel that a vote for party enthronement is equally as important as a vote for party candidates. 
    The United States in its brief relied on Salwen and Rees. 
    The only other case construing the Communist Control Act in terms of elections for the proposition that a Communist Party candidate could run for election. 
    In that case the New Jersey Courts as well including the Supreme Court did not accept even that argument and said that it would be a keen way to avoid the effect of the Act if Communist Party Candidates could run and hide from the public or not mention the fact that they are espousing Communist Party principles. 
    So, both the appellants and the appellees in this case agree that there is no question that the Communist Party -- I'm sorry that the Communist Control Act bars the Communist Party or its candidate from running in elections whether or not they disclose or speak to the effect that they are running under the Communist Party label.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, as I understand the judgment of the lower court was that there was no case in controversy because the Attorney General in his amicus brief had suggested that the law did not apply to Minnesota.

    Mr. Lynn S. Castner

    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    But we feel Mr. Justice that this case is going to be presented again before that man leaves office. 
    The filing date for the national elections are in July of 1970. 
    His office does not expire until November of 1970. 
    The Attorney General will be in office until November of 1970. 
    The party is now seriously considering the state and national elections in Minnesota. 
    I believe no candidates have filed although a number are talking of their intent to do so. 
    If this case is dismissed, if the order dismissing the case is moot as upheld, the appellants are precisely in the position they were in the summer of 1968 of having to come back to Court again with exactly the same defendants and waste the resources on their time again covering the same ground. 
    Moreover, we take the position that the mere change of the constitutional officers of the state is not enough to moot the case. 
    There is no authority for the proposition save the one amicus curiae brief of the United States Attorney. 
    There is no legal authority for the proposition that the act does not apply. 
    I can't imagine that a constitutional officer would take another position. 
    They cite the opinion of a Connecticut Attorney General ruling the same way Salwen and Rees stands for not only that proposition but to the Communist party candidate without his party cannot participate in elections and the United States failure to appear.

speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="1433.389" stopTime="1654.307">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    They did not. 
    The United States, we feel, did not appear to defend the Constitutionality of the Act because they have had a long standing provision that such an Act violates the Constitution of the United States. 
    In 1948, when Congress was considering and the year subsequent a number of bills which would have barred the Communist Party from activity, two congressional subcommittees were holding hearings on legislation aimed at restricting the activities of the Communist Party. 
    One bill would have banned from the ballot and any election in the United States all political parties directly or indirectly affiliated with the Communist Party of the United States. 
    After the bills' constitutionality was assailed by a number of witnesses, the committee recessed to await an opinion from the Department of Justice on this subject. 
    The opinion was forthcoming in a letter on March 9, 1948 to the Chairman of the House Committee on House Administration that letter said and I quote, “Although this department is in complete sympathy of course with the desire that no subversive or disloyal person should be permitted to hold a position of honor, trust, or profit in the Government, it is believed that the bill under consideration will be of doubtful validity and enforceability for many reasons. 
    The most outstanding of which is that it might be regarded as in the nature of Bill of Attainder, a denial of due process of law and an attempt by the Federal Government to legislate insofar as it would apply to the qualifications of a political party in any election in a field for which no federal authority exists. 
    The United States has not in any case that we can find moved from this position. 
    We believe that this position has been consistent regardless of the change of constitutional officers. 
    We believe also that any state official with the state of the law as it is today would be the same as the Attorney General of Minnesota in this case. 
    We urge the Court and feel the Court has authority to issue a permanent injunction restraining state officials from preventing Minnesota candidates, from Minnesota Communist Party candidates, from presenting their nominating petitions and participating in elections. 
    We feel the Court should reach the merits of constitutionality that the argument of the Act does not apply is without merit and is not relied by legislative history. 
    There was little agreement on the extent of the scope of this Act in the legislative debates as few as they were, but there was agreement on one thing that this Act barred the party from the ballot and the authorities that have studied and written about this Act subsequent to its passage have agreed that the Act has this effect.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    People you have to hear if you want to get an injunction?
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="1680.610" stopTime="1993.370">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    Oh, the appellees in case have not denied that the Act applies and let me take this opportunity, thank you for reminding me, there is an error in the appellant's brief on page 45. 
    On the first paragraph of page 45, the second sentence says, “both the attorney general and the U.S. Attorney argued below that the Communist Control Act infringes upon the power of the states in this regard that is to qualify electors.” 
    The inclusion of the Minnesota Attorney General should not be there, this was an error. 
    Turning to the merits, we urge the Court to find the Act unconstitutional as a Bill of Attainder. 
    We believe the Act is a classical Bill of Attainder and the decisions of this Court and all who sat on this Court considering the cases of attainder would find this Act a classical Bill of Attainder. 
    First, the Act outlaws the Communist Party by legislative fiat. 
    The party itself was outlawed in this case in the SACB Case. 
    I'm sorry, this Court in that case pointed out that if the party by name were outlawed, the Act would be a Bill of Attainder. 
    The Communist Control Act of 1954 made this finding. 
    The second test is whether there is a legislative finding of guilt. 
    In 841 there is the flat conclusion that the Communist Party should be outlawed and in 841 also, in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States. 
    There is a legislative finding of guilt taking away from the power of the Court to make determination not granting a hearing to the party on its conclusions and we urge that the position of the appellees that this Court may take into consideration the legislative findings in other and not related acts as to the nature of a Communist Party cannot support this Act. 
    We feel that's a novel assertion that the findings of one Act can be held to support another. 
    This Act was adopted on the eve of adjournment in 1954, there were no committee hearings on the Act saved Congressman Dice, the legislative history has been properly described by this Court in the Catherwood case has given little guidance. 
    The third test, we feel, is met as if the party is punished. 
    There is no comparable example of such a flat legislative finding of guilt in the absence of a judicial trial and the cases of this Court going back to the post Civil War Bill of Attainder cases Cummings and Garland clearly show that punishment need not be imprisonment but in fact point out specific -- in specific example precisely what has happened under this Act that the party is barred from the ballot. 
    The fourth test and one which this Court which many authorities feel this Court has set forth in Dallas is also met. 
    There is no opportunity for the party to reform itself. 
    It cannot escape the provisions of this Act. 
    Nothing it does can allow it to come to the ballot and in fact, the interpretations of the Act do not allow an individual candidate supporting the principles of the party to appear without party endorsement. 
    The second provision and there are many or the second of unconstitutionality and one which we feel is in equal weight is the infringement upon freedom of speech. 
    This Court in the last term in Williams and Rhodes made it clear with the right vote and First Amendment protects that right both for the right of qualified voters to cast their votes as well as the right of individuals to associate with a party or an association to cast their votes. 
    The state would urge that the paltry showing of the party in the last election, 415 votes, would minimize the importance of participation in the electoral process. 
    We feel that cannot be serious in this regard. 
    The real importance and contribution to participation in the political process is the forum of an electoral contest as freedom of speech. 
    This Court has made it clear that freedom of speech is on the highest of scale of constitutional liberties and we feel the Court has also made it clear that the right to vote is at the top with it.

    They also have pointed to the hiatus of participation in electoral politics by the party from 1950 until the 1968 election and this lack of participation was not due to a lack in interest but to the effect of the McCarran Act. 
    The party itself has come back into electoral politics in 1968.

    Now, the position of the state or the position of the Attorney General and the Secretary of State who were named defendants in this action at the very outset was a three-judge district court was not required to hear this action because no request was made that would have the effect of restraining the operation or enforcement of Act of Congress that even if the plaintiffs here secured the declaratory relief which they sought that the party be placed upon the ballot and that their candidates be allowed to run, this would not have the effect of putting and grinding to a halt, so to speak the operations of Communist Control Act 1954 or whatever operation that Act had.

    They've been not. 
    They ran in 1968. 
    Not pursuant to anything we did but pursuant to an order of the three-judge district court but there has been no request since that time to come on again and there had been no opportunity or there has been opportunity in 1969 which we had at least local elections in the State of Minnesota as far as our office was concerned. 
    We received no information from anyone that this problem had arisen again. Notwithstanding, I might point out, the affidavit presented by the Secretary, Mrs. Smith of the Communist Party that they intended to participate in future Minnesota local elections. 
    At least one year has gone by and if participation took place it was brought to no ones attention.

    Mr. Richard H. Kyle 
    Now, it is our position on this appeal that jurisdiction is also lacking in addition to the fact that a three-judge court in our view was not required below but that there was no denial of permanent injunction in this litigation and that is a requirement of Section 1253, a section which recently was reviewed in analogous context in a Goldstein decision by this Court about two months ago. 
    It says that this Court has appellate jurisdiction from a final order granting a permanent injunction in this case. 
    Now, there was no request for a permanent injunction in this case. 
    It was requested that the Secretary of State except the nominating petition and that he place those candidates upon the ballot. 
    Now, to the extent that that request for relief constituted a request for a permanent injunction, it was granted. 
    The temporary mandatory injunction issued by the three-judge court gave to the plaintiffs, every aspect of the injunctive relief which they had originally sought and it was only at that stage that we probably could have appealed to this Court from the granting of that temporary injunction which we chose not to do. 
    The amendment which came two weeks later but before the election has two statement of facts allegations that the Communist Party of Minnesota intends to participate, whatever that means, in future local, national, state elections and further that the Attorney General will continue to give his view that the Communist Control Act bars. 
    No request that any state official present or future be barred from taking any action, none was asked for and therefore none was given. 
    So, it is only I submit, if this Court reads the order of dismissal as moot, as having the effect of denying their request for permanent injunction that this Court would have jurisdiction and I submit that --

    The Colorado legislature, as I recall, amended that requirement during the course of litigation, so that the plaintiffs would qualified and I think -- I believe this Court said that in so doing the class of which the plaintiffs were members when the suite started disappeared because they were no longer eligible and I don't think we really have a class even of the plaintiffs here because these are plaintiffs who signed a nominating petition for the 1968 election or who did not sign the nominating petition for the 1968 election and that election having gone by, their status as class members, I think is very tenuous.

    Thank you Mr. Kyle.

    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    I would like to speak first of the question of 1253 jurisdiction. 
    Appellants urge that the Goldstein case is not applicable to this case. 
    Goldstein said that the only interlocutory orders which the Court has power to review under 1253 are orders granting or denying preliminary injunctions. 
    We do not ask what the order did not deny a preliminary injunction. 
    The order of July of the three-judge court in this case was a final order. 
    We feel this is similar to Moore and a number of other cases where the need for injunctive relief though quite previously asked for has evaporated.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But what's the statute say 28 United States Code Section 1253. 
    It doesn't tell you, there's no question about that concerning whether it was final or not final, whether it is interlocutory of final where it's concerned of whether or not comes under the terms of that jurisdictional statute. 
    It appears on page two of appellees' brief. 
    I think you know what it says. 
    It is kind of a rhetorical question of mine, that I have it before me and nobody answered.

    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    The Court issues a permanent injunction requiring the Defendant Secretary of State Joseph Donovan to accept and file the petition for nomination as required by the statutes and required that Donovan include upon the ballot the names of Mitchell and Zagarell. 
    The permanent injunction we asked for, we urge is the only relief we could have asked for prior to the election.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3981.254" stopTime="4031.332">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Aren't you bound on what you ask for here? 
    Number one, you asked for a specific people, the Secretary of State and the 1968 election. 
    Now, you wanted to form an injunction you receive, any Secretary of State in any election, any time in the future. 
    You didn't ask for anything more than that the Secretary of State by name Joseph L. Donovan, accept this petition and that he'd be permanently enjoined from not accepting it for 1968, isn't that what you asked for?
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="4031.332" stopTime="4032.741">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    That is what we asked for prior to the election.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And you wouldn't deny it.

    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    We did not.

speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="4044.370" stopTime="4056.865">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    We amended the complaint and we feel that rule 54 is broad enough and clear that for such other and further relief that we are entitled to a permanent injunction.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="4056.865" stopTime="4086.177">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well then, if you filed a case in which you asked for a two declaratory judgments and for such of them further relief, you think you'd get under this Act? 
    This is a special Act and requires precise proceedings and I don't think you can say under further relief. 
    Where are you going to get your permanent injunction from?

    Under the All Writs statute, I guess.
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="4096.448" stopTime="4097.126">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    Yes.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="4097.126" stopTime="4101.981">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Yeah. 
    Thanks for the information.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4101.981" stopTime="4131.292">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now, tell me Mr. Castner, I noticed that the opening sentence the three-judge court decision is that we considers ourselves here with the propriety entertaining that which the plaintiffs seeking declaratory relief based on issues arising, are we doing first that to at least the three-judge court would not regard it but was there any law before them in the application for some mootness.
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="4131.292" stopTime="4212.481">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    And at that point in time the issues before them were a motion to amend the complaint and a motion to dismiss. 
    The Court characterizes the nature of relief as asking for declaratory relief. 
    We urge that once a three-judge court has properly convened and has jurisdiction and we feel the three judges below properly decided they had jurisdiction under 1983 that once the need for the immediate injunctive relief passes that declaratory relief is sufficient to continue the jurisdiction of the three-judge court. 
    We feel this was the situation in Moore v. Ogelvie. 
    It was the situation in Zwickler and Koota and in that case the fact that it was moot is a separate issue from whether there is jurisdiction to appeal from the three-judge court. 
    In Zwickler, the need for injunctive relief had passed and the Court, this Court accepted jurisdiction on the remaining declaratory relief. 
    We also feel there was no need although we did ask for injunctive relief, there are cases which support the proposition that reached --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4212.481" stopTime="4238.175">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That is to say that even that the three-judge court have not reached the conclusion with no cases actually, he would have concluded that there was a case and that they may have limited relief to the declaratory relief and under the courtroom, that was perfectly proper if it attack the fact that it was the three-judge court.
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="4238.175" stopTime="4261.593">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    That is correct, we feel more and Ogelvie stands for the same proposition. 
    As to the question of case or controversy, we feel that the three cases cited to this Court and discussed Brockington and Rhodes, Hall and Beals, and Golden versus Zwickler are not applicable to our case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4261.593" stopTime="4263.596">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    This Hall and Beals is the Colorado case?
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="4263.596" stopTime="4296.093">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    Yes, it is. 
    In that case, this Court mooted the case because the Colorado legislature had amended the statute after review, I'm sorry, amended the statute under review after the Court had noted probable jurisdiction. 
    In Brockington, the case was moot because the petitioner had requested only mandamus, which could not be granted after the election and he did not alleged that he intended to run for office in the future. 
    He did not sue for himself and others similarly situated. 
    It was not class action as this is.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4296.093" stopTime="4299.578">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Beside the feeling up here, do you feel that the Court of Appeals.
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="4299.578" stopTime="4336.157">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    No, we did not. 
    We feel that if -- have Judge Devitt and the three-judge court ruled that dissolved and found no jurisdiction. 
    Well, we feel then the proper remedy was to go to the Court of Appeals but the three-judge court did not disturb the jurisdiction in the original case and only dismissed the case because of want of an actual controversy. 
    In an election situation, which we feel is unique, we are in round-robin of going to the Court, having the election passed and then coming back down to the lower court and raising the same issues in the (Voice Overlap)?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4336.157" stopTime="4353.505">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But that didn't happen to you. 
    In this case, you got exactly the relief you asked for with respect to the election for which you asked it. 
    Isn't that correct? 
    You didn't get caught in a round-robin in the court, the three-judge district court gave you exactly the relief you asked for with respect to the 1968 election.
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="4353.505" stopTime="4360.989">

    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    No, but we disagree as to the effect of that type of relief. 
    We feel this Court does have in an election situation of a 1253 jurisdiction to review.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, I'm not, I was merely talking about that.
speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="4385.302" stopTime="4433.345">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    Let me make one or two more points. 
    A question was raised as to whether it would be required by us to have a future -- a class action alleging future elections. 
    We feel that this would be an unfair requirement to ask a party to pick candidates in the future to run for elections to show that there is an actual controversy or that they intend to run for elections. 
    The Communist Party itself, the political party, is an appellant in this case and the party has maintained that it will run for future elections. 
    We don't feel that it need be required to pick particular candidates for elections.

speaker="lynn_s_castner" startTime="4451.013" stopTime="4494.104">
    Mr. Lynn S. Castner 
    One last point, we feel that the question of granting of declaratory relief after the need for an injunction is passed is founded in the number of decisions. 
    United States v. 149 Gift Packages, the Court considered a case of libel against Gift Packages by the Government alleging them to be misbranded. 
    The answer did not deny misbranding but filed a counterclaim which attacked the statute as unconstitutional. 
    In that case, as well as a number of other cited in the appellant's brief, declaratory relief was granted after the necessity for injunctive relief had passed and the three-judge court jurisdiction was sustained.
