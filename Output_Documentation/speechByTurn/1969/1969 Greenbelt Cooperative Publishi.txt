    Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing against Bresler. 
    Mr. Chasanow, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The petitioners in this case contend that the evidence is constitutionally insufficient to support the judgment and as a basis for that contention, they refer to three of the 45 exhibits which were introduced by the respondent which the trial court instructed the jury it was to consider and which it did in fact consider. 
    Now, some of those exhibits are contained in the printed record, others which are not as important as the major exhibits are in the transcript. 
    But the Court of Appeals specifically made mention of the fact that in addition to the publications that Mr. Bresler had committed blackmail, there were publications that he had engaged in an unethical trade, had been guilty of skullduggery, had had legal proceedings started against him for failure to make construction, corrections in accordance with county standards. 
    These allegations were injurious to Mr. Bresler and his business as a contractor and were libelous per se. 
    The Court had also previously referred in its opinion to another article which was published prior to the three foregoing articles. 
    On April 22, 1965, before the blackmail articles and before Mr. Bresler became a candidate for comptroller and that was headlined, City Battles Bresler on Two Fronts. 
    There was a sub caption court suit, it was written by petitioner Skolnick and it falsely alleged that the city and Bresler will also be at odds this week when the suit filed by the city against Ivy Homes, Inc. and Boxwood Village Inc. comes before the Circuit Court.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you think the disparities are characterized [Inaudible] rather than that the Court of Appeals to think that Bresler [Inaudible] charged with the blackmail charge?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="162.339" stopTime="163.957">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    No, Your Honor, we do agree --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="163.957" stopTime="172.778">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    The evidence is all the way through it with some of these other matters because as I read the opinion, the essence of it was the blackmail charge?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="172.778" stopTime="216.948">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    We do not dispute the fact that this was the principle charge but I'd like to point out that in the second blackmail article for example, there was the word skullduggery and when the -- Mr. Skolnick was asked on the stand about the word skullduggery, he said, this is the word that the reporter used in the article. 
    When the reporter testified for the petitioners, she said, I did not use that word, that was inserted and as frequently happens. 
    Now this was a change and this was what the Court of Appeals also said was intended to impute dishonesty on the part of Bresler.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="216.948" stopTime="222.823">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What did the trial court refer to in instructions to the jury?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="222.823" stopTime="293.359">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    The trial court specifically said of course that the jury should consider all of the articles in evidence and also instructed the jury that it was to consider the entire context. 
    Now, I emphasize that because one of their principle arguments says that the word blackmail was taken out of context and it didn't mean what it said. 
    Well, first, they had taken it out of context but publishing it as a caption in the first article. 
    Secondly, the reporters both said that they had not published all of their notes concerning the meeting but that they had used the word blackmail. 
    The second reporter, the reporter who wrote the second article said, I selected out the word blackmail to show it was Mr. Herling's word. 
    But she said, I didn't use all my notes and when I asked her why she selected out the word, she said, well, it had been used, the word the week before and I felt it was proper to use it again in the article. 
    The Court of Appeals makes one other important point and that is that these people --

    Justice Byron R. White

    But I --

    Oh! 
    Yes. 
    The second blackmail article, exhibit 2 in the record.

    What else?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="307.741" stopTime="324.204">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    It referred to the blackmail article -- well, actually the Court said, it was not going to comment particularly on the facts but just briefly said what the -- what some of the witnesses said, but it didn't go into detail on the facts itself.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="324.204" stopTime="332.524">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    They just and in its instruction to the jury as far as any particular document is concerned, it only referred to the blackmail article?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="332.524" stopTime="338.024">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    No sir, as a matter of fact, I don't recall that there was specific --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="338.024" stopTime="339.186">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's alright.
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="339.186" stopTime="420.778">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    I'm sorry sir. 
    The Court of Appeals made one other point which is important to this issue. 
    To distinguish it from other articles, which are published by a newspaper in which intemperate statements are made. 
    It said that there -- this was not a disinterested or impartial publishing of a report of what was said at a public meeting and it pointed out that the people who had made the statement, there was a relationship between them. 
    The Court said specifically -- I'm sorry. 
    Oh! 
    Yes. 
    The Court repealed -- referred and I quote, “The close connection between the Skolnicks, Mrs. Bergemann, Mrs. Rosetti and Mr. Herling, those to whom the word blackmail was attributed, Mrs. Sucher and Mrs. Williamson who wrote the articles and Charles Schwan, the President of GHI and the principal opponent of Bresler on the high school and zoning issues. 
    Now, I think it might be, well, at this point --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="420.778" stopTime="434.808">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Excuse me, Mr. Chasanow, may I ask? 
    Do I understand that the respondent concedes that he had the burden of satisfying the New York Times test to get a recovery?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="434.808" stopTime="440.634">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    We did concede that, Your Honor, I mean for a purpose to void and the Court of Appeals said, arguendo.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="440.634" stopTime="449.204">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I'm asking, but the respondent does concede the judgment sustains only if it satisfied The Times standard?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="449.204" stopTime="498.450">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    May I make an exception to that, Your Honor, I think that this question to public official which would -- has never been clearly defined is an important issue in this case in this respect that their only constitutional defense was that Bresler was a public official. 
    The evidence showed that at the time of the first two series of articles, Bresler was a member of the House of Delegates from Montgomery County, a different county, not Prince George's County. 
    There is no mention in any of the 45 exhibits that Bresler was a member of the House of Delegates and none of the articles pertained in any way to his official conduct which is emphasized in New York Times versus Sullivan. 
    Now --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="498.450" stopTime="500.348">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What difference would that make, Mr. Chasanow --
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="500.348" stopTime="500.920">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    Yes sir.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="500.920" stopTime="512.125">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- if he is a public official? 
    Must they identify him each time by his office in order to bring themselves under the Times and Sullivan rule?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="512.125" stopTime="556.410">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    No sir, I say this because normally, reference is made to official conduct which has to identify the official. 
    This case has nothing to do with official conduct and they didn't even think that they were -- there was any privilege attached to the fact that he was a public official because they didn't mention it. 
    Even the article was a published fact that it was going to be announced that he was to run for state comptroller, that governor, later Vice President Agnew had asked him to run. 
    In that article, there was no mention of the fact that he was a member of the House of Delegates. 
    It had nothing to do with this case. 
    We say they are using this just as a cloak in order to say he was fair game because he happened to be a member of the House of Delegates.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="556.410" stopTime="578.438">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well reading the -- what I must confess a rather confusing instructions of the trial judge particularly on two occasions as I read it, the jury was called back and given rather explicit instructions as I understand it quoting verbatim not only from Sullivan but also from Garrison and from Rosenblatt.
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="578.438" stopTime="579.468">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    Yes sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="579.468" stopTime="589.692">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And that's why I asked you how -- this case certainly was tried wasn't it, on the premise that the respondent recovered only if he satisfied the Times malice test?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="589.692" stopTime="591.437">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    Yes, sir, that was the specific instruction --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="591.437" stopTime="605.940">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And are we then to regard that the issues that we have to decide as on the premise that this is a case within the Times-Sullivan requirement?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="605.940" stopTime="831.453">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    Yes, if Your Honor will draw the distinction, Mr. Justice Brennan, between the Sullivan case and I'd like to point that in my brief, I have indicated there are numerous exceptions. 
    One I'd like to mention particularly, in Mr. Justice Black's dissenting opinion, in the Butts case, he referred -- I'm sorry, New York Times rather, concurring opinion -- a separate concurring opinion, he referred to New York Times as an outside agitator. 
    In the posture of the case, here was the New York Times facing a hostile and prejudiced community which -- in which they could hardly hope for a fair trial. 
    The respondent in that case, Commissioner Sullivan was a resident of Montgomery County, he was tried by a jury composed of residents of Montgomery County. 
    He was attacking this foreign newspaper which was coming in and trying to tell them what to do. 
    We have actually the inverse situation in this case. 
    Mr. Bresler was the foreigner, he was the outsider. 
    He was coming into Greenbelt. 
    Now, in order to put this case in proper perspective, I'd like to mention one thing that the Court of Appeals noted. 
    The respondent -- the petitioner Skolnick was a member of this organization identified as GHI Greenbelt Homes which had once owned the land in controversy plus some 300 acres more. 
    The federal government had sold that land together with the house in Greenbelt to this corporation and said, “We want you to control the development around it. 
    So we're selling you this land at a low price.” 
    Instead of developing it, they took a quick profit, they sold it. 
    Then they realized that they might have made a mistake that somebody else was making the profits that they might have made and then stepping in the first blackmail article, one of the councilmen said, and he was a member of GHI, how much profit is he going to make? 
    This was a burning question. 
    The other was that Mr. Bresler and his associate had plans which were interfering with their own plans, for example on this matter of the townhouses. 
    Parcels one and two were adjacent to Greenbelt homes property. 
    They were fighting, the townhouses on that -- those parcels because the fact, they were going to build their own townhouse. 
    As a matter of fact, they've built there as in Bresler hasn't built a single townhouse on parcel one and two. 
    Then also, they were going to tell the school board where to put the school. 
    Now, the school board planned a high school and two other schools and they said, we don't want the high school next door. 
    We want you to build a high school on parcel 15 which was remote and much more expensive which was next to the beltway which was undesirable for a number of reasons and even filed suit against the school board to prevent them from building the school on parcels one and two. 
    They were also saying to the Park and Planning Commission which was the official professional planning organization for the entire county, we don't want you to zone this property for townhouses. 
    Now, they were trying to dictate even though they had once owned and controlled this property, they were trying to dictate how this property was going to be developed and this is a conflict. 
    These were amateur planners who were trying to tell the professionals what to do. 
    I think that in order to recognize the posture of this case, let me jump to the articles which start with the announcement that Mr. Bresler was going to run for comptroller. 
    I had not realized until recently --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    It is hard to escape the impact of New York Times, that you have to show that Mr. Bresler was neither a republic official nor a public figure, the later by virtue -- the majority in Butts [Inaudible]
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="851.971" stopTime="888.378">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    Well this -- well, let me say this, we had felt that actually Butts was a dominating case because we felt that he was not really a public official at least as it had been previously defined in other cases by this Court. 
    He didn't come within any categories of St. Amant or a commissioner as in New York Times or deputy sheriff or any of the other categories and this Court has specifically said that we're not saying how far we're going to go and we certainly won't go all the way down the line.

    The Court of Appeals, they couldn't comment it, that they would not have found Bresler to be a public figure. 
    Now, I'd like to make this clear. 
    We did not --

    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    The Court of Appeals said that they would not have found Bresler to be either a public official or a public figure but they said arguendo since the trial court had instructed the jury on the basis of both public official and public figure that the question is really academic. 
    But, Mr. Bresler --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, are you arguing here -- you're arguing here then that even if these instructions don't pass muster under New York Times or even if the evidence is insufficient to prove malice under New York Times that you're nevertheless home free on a non-New York Times basis because this isn't a New York Times case, is that your position --

speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="980.424" stopTime="984.380">

    But I'm saying that there are some of these libels which had no application whatsoever to as -- his activities as a public figure. 
    For example, the accusations that there had been suits filed against him for violation of county building standards. 
    This had nothing -- this was a private enterprise, this had nothing to do with the public issue with -- which they were emphasizing land and zoning and we think that it would be carrying the public figure concept too far.

    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    Only insofar as this Court itself has narrowed. 
    For example, in New York Times, the Court said about eight times that this referred to the official conduct of a public official. 
    Then -- there's nothing to do with the official conduct of Mr. Bresler. 
    So we say if New York Times applies, then perhaps, it's just as Goldberg's statement which says it doesn't apply to the private activities of a public official.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1177.910" stopTime="1180.493">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And in what respect was he a public figure?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="1180.493" stopTime="1187.837">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    The fact that they had made him one, as one who was participating -- well, I'd have to go back to 1934 -- I mean, 60 --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1187.837" stopTime="1211.891">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I would suppose that these are -- some of these allegations are certainly related to whatever it was that made him a public figure, namely his activities in the construction business and his relationships with the county board. 
    That's what made him a public figure. 
    Weren't these allegations relate to his -- the conduct of his business with the county?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="1211.891" stopTime="1388.201">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    No sir, I think I could point out more clearly what made him a public figure. 
    In 1964 on May 7 when there was some dispute, some discussion of the council, the News Review published a report that the council and the audience decided it made much more sense to it, stop attacking each other and concentrate on a common target, Bresler who wasn't there and that was when they decided that they had to have a scapegoat because Bresler only owned a minority interest in these properties. 
    He was not the major owner. 
    There were others who owned more of an interest than he, but they had to have a name and his was a name that was selected. 
    They were -- this was followed up by the group sponsored by Greenbelt Homes. 
    Mr. Schwan who was president, in which they announced on April, 8, 1965 that the saved Greenbelt Group gets its officers a name CFPG and they formed this organization with Mr. Schwan with Mayor Smith with Albert Herling who made one of the blackmail accusations with Mrs. Skolnick and then on April, 22, they announced not only a citizenship assistant wide -- a citywide membership drive but had an article, City Battles Bresler on Two Fronts. 
    He was singled out by the News Review and that was when they made the false allegation with the subtitle court suit that the city and Bresler will be at odds. 
    Now, Bresler was not a defendant in that case and they knew it. 
    Even later, on May, 6, after there had been a hearing and after the Court had issued an order against Ivy Homes, Inc. in which Bresler had no interest whatsoever, this was what the News Review said, “At a hearing held two weeks ago, a court order was issued to the builders of Boxwood, another Bresler development.” 
    Bresler had nothing to do with that development to which the court urged, but they wanted to feature his name. 
    The exhibit showed that they constantly featured his name. 
    This is like the man who pleaded for leniency on the ground that he was an orphan after he had shot his parents. 
    They had made him a public figure and they were using this. 
    They were using the public official defense even though they knew that there was no relation and there was no mention in the articles. 
    But getting through the time when they announced Charles Bresler to run for state comptroller on June, 9, 1966, and this is where we get into the question of malice. 
    Now, they point out that this lawsuit that was filed about Mr. Bresler was subsequent, it had nothing to do.

    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    We consider that the blackmail, skullduggery, false reports of lawsuits for violation of building standards which damaged him as a builder, those were probably the most serious. 
    There were other articles about possible corrupt influence on the school board in which his name was mentioned in connection with the suit against the school board. 
    He was not a party to the case but they mentioned -- they featured his name. 
    It's hard to say which draw broke the camel's back but we thought there was an accumulation which certainly --

    Are you sure that the accumulation broke its back?

    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    It certainly made him the most hated man in Greenbelt. 
    I don't think there'd be any dispute about that and we think that the accumulative effect of these articles, even those which were not necessarily libelous per se, which were intended to and did in fact damage him, but describe it to indicate the process. 
    They announced he was going to run for state comptroller on June 9 and that's when they have the article which had several false statements and this time, in that article, he was identified as a builder.

    It not -- would not be the governing factor but I think it would at least if they were saying we have the right to criticize a candidate for office, there certainly might be some reference to the fact that he does hold the political office. 
    If there was a question he was qualified for that office, may be there should be some question about it but we don't contend this is a major premise. 
    We merely wanted to point out that this was damaging as we alleged to his reputation as a builder, his violation of county building standards had nothing to do with any public issue.

    Well, suppose the governor for example coming to the end of a session of legislature announces publicly, a speech or something that if the legislature doesn't do certain things, he's going to call him back in a special session. 
    Then some member of the legislature makes some statement to the press that the governor is engaging in blackmail against -- do you think that's libelous per se?
speaker="abraham_chasanow" startTime="1608.092" stopTime="1720.715">
    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    No, sir, I think there is a difference though. 
    There had been articles published about the time. 
    There still are, there was one in this morning about bribe -- relating to bribery on zoning in Prince George, this had been a burning issue in Prince George's County and Virginia. 
    The people in Greenbelt were very aware of this. 
    Now, to them, the fact that somebody was threatening to prevent the building of a school, I would think would be much more serious than just bribing some official with a couple hundred dollars. 
    The jury obviously felt that they intended to accuse him of blackmail. 
    As a matter of fact, Mrs. Skolnick when asked, did you believe that -- or did you intend to accuse him of blackmail or did you think that the article -- that the statements were intended to accuse him of blackmail were proper, she said yes, in the context of the meeting they were proper. 
    There was no question that they intended to defame him. 
    These were not someone whom the News Review was reporting, these were their own people making these statements so the News Review could publish them and it was intended to inflame the people to the point where they felt he had committed a crime. 
    I certainly think that anyone who would stop the building of a school would be verging on something criminal particularly when they themselves in their brief mention coerced and threatened. 
    This is what the general public feels, this blackmail, coercion and threats. 
    I think the whole posture of the case that the fact that at that meeting, they read an inflammatory statement to begin with by Mr. Schwan and then the statements were made indicate the whole purpose was to cause these inflammatory statements to be made so they could publish them and republish them the following week when Mr. Herling was a member of that group, made the blackmail statement.

    Mr. Abraham Chasanow 
    I'm sorry sir, but I think that they tried to be temperate. 
    I think it indicated that they did reach what they felt was a verdict fair to both sides. 
    We think that this whole pattern and I'm sorry that the exhibits are not in chronological order indicated that they were leading up to, as a matter of fact, the filing of the suit against Mr. Bresler which was an absolutely privileged action was followed shortly after the announcement of his candidacy and we felt that this whole pattern of announcement week after week with a combination of a suit and the misrepresentation as to the purpose of collecting the money for the suit was an indication that they had intended to damage him all the way through that this was a continuing action. 
    We think that obviously the jury was convinced that they intended to accuse him of blackmail and that is what a layman reading the article would have felt, particularly when there was no reason to publish the caption blackmail unless they wanted to invite attention to the fact that he had been accused of blackmail, that he was a criminal. 
    I thank you.

    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I would just like to comment briefly on Justice White's question about the instructions. 
    I think it's very clear from the instructions, Mr. Justice White that the trial court singled out only the blackmail article. 
    In fact, he referred to it three times in his instructions and did not refer to any of the other articles which the only other article --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1877.908" stopTime="1879.119">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Except generally?
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="1879.119" stopTime="1882.187">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    Except generally, the only other article that he relied on --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1882.187" stopTime="1885.143">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    He told the jury to consider all 45 exhibits.
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="1885.143" stopTime="1887.596">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1887.596" stopTime="1892.972">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    [Voice Overlap] before the jury and so we have no idea what the jury thought was of --
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="1892.972" stopTime="1912.609">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    I think that you -- from the -- reading the instructions though, you will see that the focus of the case, and so only the focus of the Court of Appeals' opinion is on the term blackmail and that was the -- you get that clearly from reading the joint extract, you get that clearly from reading the opinion of the Court of Appeals.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1912.609" stopTime="1922.993">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Insofar as those two courts went but it was the jury that decided the factual issues and awarded the damages and there's just no way on earth to know what they might have felt was crucial?
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="1922.993" stopTime="1988.232">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    That's right Your Honor except that there's only one other article in issue about which there was evidence that it was factually inaccurate. Not just one about the homeowners' proceedings which is just a really piddling inaccuracy when you take it against the fact that they knew in the way they reported it. 
    This reference in the instructions to the blackmail I think is helpful in answering the question, the point that you made Mr. Justice Brennan about the explicit references to New York Times at the end of this -- at the end of the Court's instructions. 
    The Court instructed that the jury that -- going to the factor of truth, there was no contention in this case. 
    It is conceded by the defendants that these allegations were not true, that Bresler committed the crime of blackmail, that Bresler was guilty of blackmail. 
    So in the background of that reference when the Court after it instructed the jury that malices, ill wills, spite or hostility --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1988.232" stopTime="1998.934">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well now, on that, didn't the -- if jury as I read this, like it came back twice and on the second occasion, the judge -- is that right?
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="1998.934" stopTime="2000.446">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    The second is --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2000.446" stopTime="2000.633">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="2000.633" stopTime="2004.807">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    It is essentially right as the judge instructed after the lunch break. 
    The jury hadn't been out.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2004.807" stopTime="2026.853">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Oh, I see. 
    But when they came back, he didn't say in so many words, forget everything I said to you about spite, ill will and so forth. 
    The law of the case is the New York Times rule and any, as I read it, what he did was read them the actual language out of the opinions in Times, Garrison and Rosenblatt, is that right?
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="2026.853" stopTime="2028.047">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    That's right.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2028.047" stopTime="2036.363">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Did he -- did what -- did the jury then have the case on the basis, forget all about everything I said to you on spite, ill will?
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="2036.363" stopTime="2073.043">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    If he had said that, I think that would've cured substantially much of the error that had taken place but he didn't simply give the New York Times instruction, this is why I get back to this, a bit about we conceded that the allegations of blackmail were false because when he gets into the New York Times instruction at the end, he prefaces his comment with, there is no contention here that the statements regarding blackmail were true. 
    So he's really instructing the jury that we had conceded the statements were false, that meets the New York Times -- would meet the New York Times, does in effect -- underwrites the instruction completely.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2073.043" stopTime="2083.025">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Oh, no, no. 
    Conceding that the allegations were false, doesn't concede any knowledge of the falsity at the time?
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="2083.025" stopTime="2100.892">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    Well, it -- the fact that we did not contend that the articles were true meant that we conceded that this is what the instruction -- that we conceded that they can -- that the allegations were false. 
    Now, we if --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2100.892" stopTime="2103.724">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You conceded that if they were given the meaning of charging a crime --
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="2103.724" stopTime="2112.176">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    But if we concede, yes, that's exactly right and that's what the Court, led -- I believe led the jury to believe that we had conceded that the --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2112.176" stopTime="2127.464">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But the judge also in defining libel, however, if the jury thought that -- it was left for the jury to determine whether or not to charge you with blackmail the way it was used, was the charge deferred?
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="2127.464" stopTime="2129.508">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    That's right, and then he further instructed --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2129.508" stopTime="2140.247">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the jury could not sign for the plaintiff unless they believe that the way blackmail was used was meant to charge a crime?
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="2140.247" stopTime="2141.279">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    Charged a crime.

    And then --

    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    That's right but then he gives --

    Under these instructions.
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="2146.207" stopTime="2156.894">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    He gives them the further instruction that we conceded that, that we conceded that the allegations were not true, that Bresler was guilty of blackmail. 
    So --

    You do, don't you?

    No, I don't concede the --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you do if they have -- if -- let's assume that the judge ruled as a matter of law that these words charged a crime, you disagree with that but let's assume that he ruled that way. 
    But then he asked if you concede that the so construed, those words were false, you would concede it?
speaker="roger_a_clark" startTime="2183.631" stopTime="2207.541">
    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    I would concede that, but I wouldn't concede that the allegations in the article are false and I think that was misleading to the jury. 
    What's lacking here obviously is an instruction, that clear instruction that the defendant, that the defendants not only charged this but that they knew they were charging, that they intended to charge this strained and really ludicrous meaning that they knew it, they knew it was false.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    In a very lengthy and confused instruction that you could recover on other basis. 
    The other thing quickly is the skullduggery comment. 
    The skullduggery comment is a rather a novel theory. There is no -- it doesn't refer to Bresler. 
    There's no indication that the -- it -- the condensation of the skullduggery word, the condensation was inaccurate. 
    There's no indication of the underlying comments were inaccurate. 
    All it was, was criticism of the school board in delaying the condemnation actually but --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But do you think skullduggery is a libelous word? 
    Now let's just assume why if that -- you say that so and so is guilty of skullduggery?

    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    I don't think it's certainly a very serious --

    Well, I know but is it or isn't it?

    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    I would have to say no. 
    Certainly when it's directed to a public body, an impersonal reference to an official action by a public body as we had in the Rosenblatt case, I would have to say that --

    [Voice Overlap] free, a newspaper is completely free to charge anybody it wants to, private citizen or not with skullduggery?

    I don't have to reach that in this case Mr. Justice White because they didn't charge a private citizen, they charged the school board.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know but that is -- wouldn't make it as far as being libelous is concerned? 
    Wouldn't make any difference whether it's a private citizen or public figure as to whether or not it satisfies the definition of libel?

    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    In the context of what was involved, in other words, the postponement of a condemnation action by an official governmental body, I don't believe that that arises to be stature of a libelous statement under the Constitution.

    Is it your point that this was a group libel in effect by addressing the term skullduggery to the conduct of the entire board, not any one person?

    Mr. Roger A. Clark 
    That certainly is my point and also there is just no showing it's false.
