    The nest case on for argument is Number 1089, Williams against Illinois. 
    Mr. Bass, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from the Illinois Supreme Court presenting the question whether Illinois statutes which authorize a pauper’s incarceration in excess of the maximum period prescribed by law, at the rate of $5.00 a day for payment of fine and Court costs. 
    Despite the fact that the defendant is willing and able to pay them, if given the opportunity, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The facts which are undisputed are briefly as follows: the complaint was issued in June of 1967 against Willie Williams for the crime of theft of property not from the person, and not exceeding $150.00 in value. 
    A warrant was issued and a $2000.00 bail was set. 
    Williams was arrested on August 13. 
    The case was brought before the Court the following day on August 14 at which at the time bail was set at $2000.00. 
    Williams was remanded to jail on motion of the state, the case was continued to August 16. 
    On August 16, the case was again continued on motion of the state to September 6. 
    On September 6, the trial commenced. 
    The defendant appeared in the Court said, there was no Court reporter present. 
    The record shows that the defendant waived his right to a jury trial. 
    The case was tried before the judge without a jury. 
    Finding of guilty was made and the maximum of sentence of one year plus a $500.00 fine was imposed. 
    The $5.00 cost was also made part of the judgment. 
    And the judgment further ordered that the defendant stand committed in jail, if he would default from the payment of the fine and cost. 
    Sometime afterward the defendant contacted the civil legal aid service in the jail and a petition was presented to the sentencing judge, November of 1967, which prayed that the portion of the sentencing order of September 6, which directed that the defendants stand committed in default of payment of the fine and cost be vacated. 
    That further prayed that the defendant be granted sufficient time and wish to obtain the funds and wish to pay the fine and cost and further asked for such other relief as maybe just inappropriate. 
    The petition was made under oath and contained some of the following allegations, that defendant was indigent, inmate of the county jail. 
    He had no funds, no valuable property. 
    He had been unable to post bail. 
    He lacked $200.00, wished to post the 10% under the Illinois law. 
    He was unable to hire an attorney and that he was then unable to pay the fine and cost. 
    He further recited that he had been in jail since August 13 and had been unable to earn funds since that time. 
    And it further alleged that if the defendant were released from jail upon the expiration of the one-year jail sentence that he would be able to get a job and earn the funds to pay the fine and costs. 
    The state did not contravene the factual allegation but moved to dismiss. 
    The lower court dismissed the petition without evidentiary hearing and an appeal was taken to the Illinois Supreme Court. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court held that there is no denial of Equal Protection of the law, when an indigent defendant is imprisoned to satisfy payment of his fine. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court granted a stayed pending appeal, and for the stayed the mandate pending appeal to this Court. 
    It should be noted at the outset what is not challenged in this case. 
    We do not challenge the practice of incarcerating contumacious defendant who refuses to pay the fine nor do we attack the discretion of the sentencing judges who wish to make the punishment for the offender, nor do we attack defendant's obligation to pay that debt, nor do we attack --

speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="311.142" stopTime="346.157">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    That's a possible question. 
    We did not urge the right to counsel the question for a number of reasons. 
    The first reason is that it was doubtful of whether or not the defendant would succeed in that because under Illinois law, the right to counsel depends upon a request for counsel. 
    Secondly, the possibility was substantial that if there had been a retrial, or would have been a reconviction with the same sentence, which would only have resulted in the issue coming up at a later stage, and possibly the defendant is spending more time in jail than he did with respect to this case.

    The maximum sentence that could be imposed for theft of property, not from the person and not exceeding of $150.00 in value was one year plus a $500.00 fine.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="404.690" stopTime="407.953">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How long was he actually in jail?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="407.953" stopTime="500.919">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, I think he received approximately 84 days, which is a normal good time credit. 
    So it would be a year plus five days minus 84, which would be the period from August of 1967 to May of 1968, about nine months. 
    What we do challenge in this case is the construction of the statute by the Illinois Supreme Court which authorizes 24-hour a day imprisonment over the maximum at the rate of $5.00 a day, despite the fact that the defendant has said without any opposition by the state that he will go out and get a job, and earn the funds to pay his fine if he is given the opportunity. 
    The state has indicated that it has two primary goals to be served, the practice of incarceration of indigence should be sustained because of those goals. 
    Those are deterrence of crime and collection of revenue from the fines. 
    But whatever the examination reveals that round-the-clock imprisonment of an indigent under these circumstances is neither necessary nor rationally related to the stated goals and that there are clearly less onerous alternatives and perhaps more effective ones to satisfy the state's interest. 
    Certainly, if the state's interest is in collecting the revenue by remitting the person to jail, they're not going to get the money. 
    And in addition, the state has to pay substantial amount of money to house prisoners in already overcrowded and overburdened facilities.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="500.919" stopTime="514.412">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Could the state insist that we pay the fine by working for the state, and I don't say in a workhouse or in a work farm or something like that.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="514.412" stopTime="539.926">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, it's our position that the state could certainly do that as long they let him go at night. 
    In a hierarchy of alternatives that we have suggested, we have placed remitting to the work house as one of the possibilities, but the problem is in this case, that they keep the man in jail around the clock and there's absolutely no justification for incarcerating somebody at night merely because they're extracting his day life, that's wrong.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="539.926" stopTime="549.117">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you think the Supreme of Illinois had judicial power to shape that kind of solution to problem?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="549.117" stopTime="583.167">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, we feel that the Illinois Supreme Court could easily have saved the statute by construction. 
    For example, the first provision -- the first sentence in the statute talks in terms of a judgment of a fine imposed upon a defendant, maybe enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered the civil action. 
    Just last November, the Illinois Supreme Court held that civil case. 
    It could not obtain the body execution that is jail to facilitate. 
    Absence of showing or refusal to pay, that's the lawyer's title of Phoenix versus Gerber, which we said in Footnote 19 on page 22.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="583.167" stopTime="591.022">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that -- was that done in the context of the old notions of imprisonment for debt?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="591.022" stopTime="616.556">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    No, the Illinois Supreme Court does not treat imprisonment as a result of a conviction as a debt which is considered within that prohibition. 
    But if the Illinois Supreme Court had construed the section, to require resort to the other alternatives before remitting the person immediately, The Illinois Supreme Court could have avoided the constitutional infirmity in this case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="616.556" stopTime="624.837">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, then you don't complain about the rate of the workout, that this $5.00 a day if he goes home at night. 
    Is that it?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="624.837" stopTime="634.581">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    If he goes home at night, I think there maybe some question about whether or not $5.00 a day comports with a reasonable rate. 
    But certainly, $5.00 a day --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="634.581" stopTime="636.551">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are you raising that here or not?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="636.551" stopTime="657.739">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    We do raise it. 
    But what we have it in this case is $5.00 a day not for the workday but the pleasure of his company during the night as well, and that certainly, under those circumstances, that's certainly not compensatory, certainly unjust compensation for -- not only taking his labors during the day but having him around at night too against his will.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="657.739" stopTime="672.081">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But you don't consider the compelled presence and requirements of work in the day -- daytime hours as a form of incarceration?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="672.081" stopTime="712.939">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, we had originally suggested that the alternative of allowing the man to go out on his own is to be preferred. 
    But we're willing to acknowledge that there maybe situations where a person is unable to get a job, where the state is unable to get a job for him, do an employment service. 
    And as a last resort, the state might want to give him the public works program, the job. 
    They could make him work at the hospital or a boy's club or at the work farm. 
    But our point is what the state has done is much more onerous here.

    What -- suppose this was a civil case and he had cost, what does Illinois do?

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Illinois does not imprisonment for nonpayment of cost in civil case. 
    It will clearly have an irrational discrimination here. 
    One can hardly think that costs are necessary to enforce a criminal law.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, I wasn't suggesting that.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    But not under the Illinois statute. 
    That's the problem. 
    No provision has made for any kind of inquiry or hearing or factual evidence to determine whether or not the defendant is refusing to pay or refusing to work, refusing to comply with his obligation.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="853.853" stopTime="863.101">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Would you say that the state, in order to satisfy his obligation, he would always purport that incarcerating then 24 hours a day would have to offer him work?

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, our position is that--

    Would he work by the state?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="866.343" stopTime="875.249">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Our position is that where liberty is involve, that the state is obligated to utilize alternatives rather than automatic remission to jail.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="875.249" stopTime="881.196">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I understand but how about that alternative, are they obligated to use that one too?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="881.196" stopTime="907.965">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, the alternatives that we would suggest would be first, straight installment payments. 
    An economy that's based upon time payment, that's certainly not strange. 
    Secondly, garnishment, that is once he goes out, automatically seize a portion. 
    Third, possibility is to utilize a state employment service to find a job for him. 
    The last one would be to put him on the public works job, whether that would be out in the farm or out in the workhouse. 
    That's the last the last one.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="907.965" stopTime="918.510">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But what if no jobs are available in the community that he can get, must the state furnish him the opportunity to work on its own payroll?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="918.510" stopTime="939.861">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, we think that it's unrealistic to think that there is no work at all these days, but if it were shown -- evidence did show that it was impossible to place him anywhere, we think that it would be permissible to require him to work at a designated place during the day.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="939.861" stopTime="945.812">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, permissible yes. 
    But the state says, we don't want him, we better put him in jail. 
    We haven't got any place for him to work.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="945.812" stopTime="1004.386">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, it's our position that the interest of the society do not justify such as onerous exaction, such an imposition upon the liberty of the defendant. 
    It's interesting to note that the state which talks in terms of these alternatives really administratively feasible for a stance of cost is that administrative convenience is not a sufficient ground for such an onerous exaction. 
    But the second one is that Illinois, by passing a work release program has itself recognized that these alternatives are feasible. 
    Of course, there's one glaring defect in the Illinois work release program as applied to the person who is incarcerated for nonpayment of fine. 
    That's triple punishment. 
    Defendant is required to serve his year in jail, pay his fine with the earnings he gets during the day but he sits in jail at night. 
    And there's absolutely no justification why a person should have to sit in jail at night when he is out there during the day working off his fine.

    With respect to a person who is doing a straight jail sentence, he's certainly receiving quite a benefit to be told that he can obtain some liberty during the day and he can hardly complain of that.

    When they let him go out during the day to get that money, may then have completely undermined that by saying he must come back to jail at night. 
    There is no rational justification.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, as to Williams, of course, the work release program was passed by the legislature effective January 1969 and all of the Williams proceedings occurred in 1967. 
    I was addressing myself to in the event that it were applicable to him or other persons similarly situated what the effect would be, and my point was that the work release statute shows that the administrative convenience argument doesn't hold up. 
    And secondly, that there's a glaring defect in it because it requires night time incarceration so which does no rational justification.

    I don't -- perhaps you told us, but if so, I didn't get it clearly. 
    As I read the Illinois Revised Statute 1967, Chapter 38 Paragraph 180-6, its language would seem entirely to take care of your claim, however, I understand that it's been construed by the Illinois Courts in such a way as to mean something other than what it seems rather clearly to say.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="1162.328" stopTime="1168.431">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, we certainly thought that the language of the statute could be interpreted literarily and would be granted for discharge.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1168.431" stopTime="1172.017">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And how has Illinois suit reviewed? How the Illinois Courts construed it?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="1172.017" stopTime="1290.653">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    They've construed the language until all the legal means have been exhausted to mean that the defendant either must show, he's physically unable to work which is the Goldstones case and People versus Hardenbergh. 
    Or that no work is provided for him. 
    Now, there's always housekeeping available. 
    In fact, the record shows, the jail record of Williams is included in here on page 33 of the record. 
    And it does show that when he was serving his jail time, he worked in the laundry and he worked in the tailor shop and he worked in something beginning with 'K' which I think is the kitchen. 
    So that, all people that are in jail have the opportunity to work. 
    So person who is serving off or working off a fine is not going to be doing anything differently. 
    The state has attempted to suggest that the policy of deterrence requires the result reached in this case. 
    We dispute that contention for the following reasons. 
    First, the fact the Illinois is going under 180-6 to discharge a persons who are unable to work or for whom no work is provided is an indication that automatic incarceration of everybody who don't pay fines, not necessary to the enforcement of the criminal law. 
    We submit that the fine is certainly a different order of punishment than a jail sentence. 
    If the trial judge wishes to individualize the sentence, imposed a fine because he feels that the interest of society require no more than a fine. 
    It's inconsistent with that trial judge's determination then to have the defendant sitting in jail.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    We frame it in terms of the fact that the indigent is required to spend more jail time than the person with funds. 
    The fact the indigent defendant despite his willingness to work is deprived that the opportunity to payoff the fine but rather remitted to incarceration.

speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="1339.117" stopTime="1426.465">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, there is more to it than that. 
    There is a due process aspect to this extent that the state seems to be conclusively presuming that incarceration is necessary because the person might run away and they lose the risk, so to speak, and he'll run away from the job and he won't be around to pay the fine. 
    That type conclusive presumption in the absence any showing, any hearing, any inquiry, certainly doesn't comport with fundamental principles. 
    So, to that extent, there is this blend of Due Process into the Equal Protection. 
    The state's attempt to justify this 24-hour day incarceration for fear that some people might skip is not based upon any evidence. 
    Certainly, not in this record and I take it the state this arguing in a broad proposition that they're entitled to incarcerate somebody around the clock in any case regardless of the fact that a felon may come in and say, “Well, look, I have great possibility of getting a job. 
    I could earn enough funds in perhaps a week or two to pay off this fine.” 
    But -- and the state says, it wants the revenue from collecting these fines, and yet that state does precisely by incarcerating the person and depriving him the opportunity to go out to work.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Clearly, the evaluation is a legislative matter. 
    However, there is a point when 24-hour incarceration for $5.00 a day is so obviously unjust compensation as to render it on Constitution because we have to remember that the defendant here is being kept for longer than the work day.

    Well, my problem with your argument counsel is that I can understand someone rationally fixing a rate for his services. 
    I have some difficulty seeing how you put a rate on his liberty by the hour. 
    You seem to imply that they might rationally fix some X dollars per hour for depriving him of his liberty. 
    Where is your basis for doing that? 
    How do you measure the value of a man's freedom?
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="1511.496" stopTime="1589.835">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, it seems to me that the remission to incarceration at a certain value is the last resort. 
    It's our submission in this case that the state should have done something before they resort to that alternative. 
    And the state didn't. 
    Despite the fact that the defendant said he could go and get the money on his own, the state wouldn't have to keep him in jail and to work off the fine at whatever value they assigned. 
    He said that he could go out and get that money. 
    And the state instead of even inquiring into the credibility of the weights of those contentions which the state did not meet simply denied the petition without evidentiary hearing. 
    And the Illinois Supreme Court rather than adopt the type of construction that could save the statute, simply said, there is no denial of Equal Protection when an indigent is required to work off his fine. 
    The heart of this thing is that there is no equivalent between the rich man's choice that is whether anyone is to pay or sit in jail and there are some people who would like to do that. 
    And the exactions on the indigent requiring him to sit in jail, that is simply an inequality and that is (Inaudible). 
    I'd like to save a few moments for rebuttal, if I may. 
   
   
   
   Argument of James R. Thompson
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1589.835" stopTime="1600.410">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well then, thank you. 
    Mr. Thompson.
speaker="james_r_thompson" startTime="1600.410" stopTime="1823.505">
    Mr. James R. Thompson 
    Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court. 
    In 1927, Mr. Justice Holmes referred to the Equal Protection Clause as the last resort of constitutional arguments. 
    Reading the opinions of this Court will show that we have come quite a ways since that characterization. 
    In fact, Judge Skelly Wright of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia recently referred to the Equal Protection Clause as the cutting edge of our expanding constitutional liberties. 
    One of the issues that's involved in this case before the Court today is whether that cutting edge will press so deeply not only into the statutory scheme in the state of Illinois, the statutory of scheme of the other American states in the Federal Government, to compel those states and the Federal Government to adopt the system of criminal justice administration. 
    Greatly different from that which they have adopted by the legislative process in the name of the explication of the Equal Protection Clause. 
    I think we should consider at the outset what some of the interests are in considering the context or setting of the Equal Protection argument in this case. 
    As Mr. Justice Brennan referred to it in the concurring opinion of Allen versus Illinois just some weeks ago, the constitutional claims must be considered in context. 
    And we think the context of the Equal Protection claim here is an important one. 
    First, the history of incarceration to work off a fine which cannot or will not be paid is an ancient one far outdating the American legal system. 
    Mr. Justice Black said in his opinion for the Court in Kotch versus the Board of River Pilots some years ago and in a dissenting opinion in Harper versus the Virginia Board of Elections, the history of a practice in important in considering whether or not that practice violates the Federal Constitution. 
    Similarly, the widespread usage of a particular feature of a criminal justice system by the states and by the Federal Government is also important in assessing its validity under the Federal Constitution as was noted for the Court in the opinion in Roth versus the United States for the fact that not only in all American jurisdictions and the Federal Government ban the dissemination of obscenity but most of the civilized nations of the world did as well, we think it's equally relevant then to consider in the context of whether or not Equal Protection has been violated here, that all of the states of the Federal Union for years and years and years and the English Government before that have allowed the incarceration of those who cannot or will not pay their fines until the fines has worked off. 
    The impact of this Court's holding that the Illinois system is unconstitutional must also be considered, we believe, for this Court to decide how far they will take the Equal Protection Clause because if the challenge to Illinois statute is successful in this Court today, similar challenges will follow. 
    Challenge to the bail system, the claim that the requirement of a monetary bail in any case is irrational. 
    If other factors will show or seek to persuade that the defendant will not flee.

    Well, New York has a statute where there is to be a hearing on the question of whether or not the indigent can pay the fine and if he cannot pay the fine, they go back and re-sentence and they don't follow exactly the same procedures in Illinois and I'm informed by counsel in the case that you are to here following this one that Maryland has recently changed its statute in light of the opinion below in the Schoonfield case. 
    But to my knowledge, all the rest of the states of the American jurisdiction have statutes similar to Illinois so as the Federal Government.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1871.575" stopTime="1893.136">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Many of them, as I understand it, do not -- I have so -- do not have Illinois as the provision that Illinois has that if a man in fact is unable to work off his fine, he must be released and am I not right that many states to apply that sort of a release --
speaker="james_r_thompson" startTime="1893.136" stopTime="1900.691">
    Mr. James R. Thompson 
    Illinois' policy is more benign in this regard because Illinois does allow discharge where no work is available or where his physically unable to work.

    Mr. James R. Thompson 
    That's right. 
    That follows, I think, our policy of regarding the incarceration for failure to pay this fine as the equivalent of the collection of money by collecting in labor and obviously if we can't collect in labor, the man has no business in jail. 
    But some other states justify incarceration in lieu of payment of fine on an alternative punishment theory and since they don't depend upon the collection of revenue theory, it's easy to see why they don't discharge for failure to provide work.

    Well, I assume he might be put into the disciplinary cell or subject to discipline of some kind or loses good time, probably, most likely a remedy that will be employed. 
    If he refused to work, if he refused in his lawful assignment in the prison system, I assume he would lose his good time.

    Mr. James R. Thompson 
    Yes it is. 
    I assume though that the state is entitled to put its regularly sentenced prisoners to work even though no fine has been imposed and as an incidental benefit to the state, flowing from the year's imprisonment, they're entitled to collect that labor.

    Do you pay people for working in your --
speaker="james_r_thompson" startTime="2362.215" stopTime="2451.921">
    Mr. James R. Thompson 
    There are some projects in the city jail which prisoners may obtain a small amount of paid form even though they're not working out fine. 
    Although sometimes the pay is in the form of privileges or tobacco or things of that sort but it's really not a reimbursement scheme and such. 
    But to answer your question, I think that if the man was sentenced simply for a year in jail, the state is entitled to exact that year in terms of his time in the normal theory of a jail punishment and they're also entitled to the benefits of his labor, I think during that period. 
    But the sentence in this case was a year in jail and a fine of $500.00, a sentence permissible under Illinois law, sentence which is not challenged in this Court on grounds of constitutionality or rationality. 
    The state is therefore saying to Willie Williams, we are entitled to keep you in jail for a year to derive whatever incidental benefits flow to the state from that year of service in jail and we are also entitled to collect from you a $500.00 fine or its equivalent in labor. 
    And I don't think it's irrational for the State of Illinois to say that in so far as the collection of the benefits from the labor are concerned, they must be served separately. 
    In other words, that the fine work off must follow the year's work off and that he need not, under a rational scheme of prison administration, be given credit for the fine work off during the course of the first year.

    The question, that that raises, is does that violate the Equal Protection Clause? 
    And that was the question that was raised in the brief and that is a question which this Court has never really considered. 
    And I'd like to turn for my remaining moments of argument to an examination of how this Court's previous cases, setting forth what the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause are that touch this case. 
    Obviously, the traditional test that this Court has talked about in Equal Protection cases is what class has the state set up? 
    In this case, those who do not, for whatever reason pay their fine. 
    What scheme has the state adopted to deal with that class? 
    In this case, the work off system. 
    What interests of the state does that scheme serve? 
    In this case, transit crime by preserving the value of fines and the Courts which impose fines as a component of our criminal justice system and the collection of revenue which fines bring in. 
    The final question under the traditional test, does the state's scheme rationally relate to the end result which they seek to achieve? 
    And in this case, we say it does because the work off system of Illinois offers the opportunity for the state to keep its fine system viable and at the same time to collect the equivalent of fine and the labor of the defendant.

    I'm not certain Your Honor but it's certainly in the high millions of dollars when you count in the fines collected by the Courts which handle cases in which the fine is the only punishment, including traffic offenses. 
    I'm sure it's in the high millions and as a practical matter, offers the source of support for those Courts which enforce misdemeanor and petty offenses and traffic offenses without the revenues derived from the imposition of fines. 
    Especially in traffic cases, it would be extremely difficult for the State of Illinois under its present budget to support those Courts.

    In several areas, first, a holding of that time would necessarily take this Court far beyond the rationale of Griffin versus Illinois which provided for the first time that the state must attempt to remedy the imbalance between the poor and the rich, so far as the administration of criminal justice is concerned. 
    But the impact to that opinion so far has always been confined by this Court to those stages of the criminal justice process which determined guilt or provide for a first appellate review of guilt. 
    This Court has been very, very hesitant, in fact has not at all taken the rationale of Griffin beyond those narrow bounds.

    Right. 
    The second thing that it would do is that it would encourage spurious claims of indigency and that it would impose on the Court's least able to handle it, a burden of determining something new in a case, not only must they first determine guilt, but after determination of guilt, if there was a claim on indigency and that a fine could not be paid, they would have to hold a hearing to determine whether the man was in fact indigent. 
    Now, it's one thing to require a hearing of that sort in a criminal court where the issues is does he have the money for a transcript on appeal or a lawyer on appeal where the judge may have on his call one or two or three or five cases a day. 
    It's quite another thing to say for example to the Municipal Court of Chicago, in a traffic case where a judge may have two or three or 400 cases on his call per day that whenever he is confronted with the claim of indigency, he must stop and determine that fact in order to decide whether or not the defendant is going to have to work off his fine under the Illinois work off system.

    It does not violate the Constitution because under this traditional Equal Protection test which this Court has set up, if we shown irrational class, those who do not pay, rational state objectives to be achieved in a rational connection between the two of the work off system. 
    It doesn't violate Equal Protection even though it may treat some people differently than others. 
    But even if we move beyond that traditional test, as this Court has moved in some areas. 
    For example, in the Shapiro case, testing whether or not a one year's residency require it for welfare, violated the Equal Protection Clause where Mr. Justice Brennan said that in cases involving the exercise of constitutional right, you have to show a compelling state interest, not merely a rational relationship or some other cases which have essentially used a balancing approach to the advantages gained by the state, outweigh the disadvantages to the defendant. 
    We believe that the interest of the State of Illinois and the rest of the states of the union, in preserving the idea that this does not violate Equal Protection, this and allied practices such as the area of bail, is so strong that it outweighs the disadvantage to the indigent defendant even if the test is compelling state interest or the balancing of advantages to one side.

    I think that if this Court were to hold that indigency excused a man from incarceration under the work off system, that the threat to other state interests, including the maintenance of the whole fine system, the maintenance of the Courts which enforce the fine system, especially in those cases where the fine is the only penalty and the maintenance, the monetary bail system and the potential saddling of all those Courts with spurious claims of indigency which do not now arise because a man knows if he doesn't pay his fine, he's going to jail to work it off, are so compelling that they outweigh whatever disadvantages there are in sending an indigent man to jail to work off his fine.

    Mr. James R. Thompson 
    Well, there are two considerations, I think Mr. Justice White, if we're going to consider the question of alternatives to the work off system which are thought to be less onerous to the indigent defendant than the work off system. 
    The first question which arises is, is it within the province of this Court to examine whether there are viable alternatives? 
    Or must this Court, in an Equal Protection case refrain from deciding what is a wiser, what is a more humane, what is a more just system of the enforcement of the criminal laws.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3371.984" stopTime="3375.184">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know but you are talking about state interest.

    Mr. James R. Thompson 
    Yes sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3375.921" stopTime="3377.258">

    A compelling state interest.
speaker="james_r_thompson" startTime="3377.258" stopTime="3377.852">
    Mr. James R. Thompson 
    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3377.852" stopTime="3389.619">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And if there is a viable alternative why they'd put your (Inaudible) about compelling state interest (Inaudible).
speaker="james_r_thompson" startTime="3389.619" stopTime="3477.309">
    Mr. James R. Thompson 
    Well, I'm not sure. 
    If we were -- if we were following the traditional test of Equal Protection cases, we would not stop to inquire whether there were in fact alternatives. 
    But if we are following what's been called the balancing test or the compelling state interest test, I'm not sure even there that the same rule doesn't carry over. 
    In other words, if this Court can find a compelling state interest which is carried out by a rational scheme which the state has selected, we think the work off system, standing by itself is a rational scheme. 
    Then I'm not so sure that even in a compelling interest case, if this is one. 
    That this Court can say, but we will strike down the rational scheme because there are other rational schemes which contain less disadvantage to the defendant. 
    As this Court said just a few weeks ago in the Dandridge case talking about the maximum grants on welfare payments. 
    The language of Mr. Justice Stewart, reiterating again words which have been used for years in equal protection cases. 
    It may well be that there are other policies which are available at the State of Illinois but the question is, can this Court, under the Equal Protection Clause make the state used. 
    In Illinois, as this Court sits today, we have a legislature sitting and we have a constitutional convention sitting. 
    And I think the arguments of Mr. Bass has made to this Court today are more properly directed to those two bodies. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Thompson I have a question, it won't take too long I hope. 
    Is it possible that in considering these various alternatives that a holding along the lines, holding adverse to the State of Illinois in this case, could lead judges to impose direct prison penal sentences without the alternative of a fine and then produce what is a new term to me these days, counterproductive consequences?
speaker="james_r_thompson" startTime="3518.727" stopTime="3534.479">
    Mr. James R. Thompson 
    I think that's entirely clear. 
    I think one of the results of such a holding would be that some judges would simply impose maximum jail sentences where they do not now impose jail sentences. 
    I couldn't say that all judges would do that.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3534.479" stopTime="3536.677">

    I think the danger of that as a consequence to the holding is great danger as to the consequence to this holding for the bail system, for the whole system of fines in the Courts which force that question.

    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    I think that the traffic courts have utilized the fines as a method of keeping the system supported. 
    I don't think there's any reason to believe that the traffic courts are going to change their practices overnight.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3592.921" stopTime="3603.174">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I wasn't thinking so much of traffic court as the misdemeanor court dealing with behavior not as serious as the behavior involved in this case.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3603.174" stopTime="3620.020">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    I think we're entitled to trust the trial judges' discretion. 
    If they want to individualize the sentence, they should be allowed to do so. 
    If they think that a fine is called for rather than imprisonment, they will impose a fine. 
    If they feel that incarceration is called for, they will impose incarceration.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3620.020" stopTime="3630.863">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The matter of your view then I take it is that there is no potential for the -- what I've characterized as counterproductive results.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3630.863" stopTime="3681.952">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    The potential is there but I think we have to test the Courts. 
    I think the potential will not be realized. 
    I did want to make an observation with respect to the state's complaint that they'll have difficulty administering these evidentiary hearings going to the financial ability of the defendant. 
    I'd always thought that was a basic principle of American law that it's not better to let a man rot in jail because it was easier for the state's administrative machinery to have to dispense with hearings. 
    But besides, the lower court judges right now, under the Illinois statutes conduct inquiries into the defendant's background, etcetera in setting bail. 
    There's a statute right now that requires such inquiries, so I don't understand how the state is going to be put to any substantially greater hearings that it engages in right now.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3681.952" stopTime="3706.030">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, Mr. Bass, what would you think of an overt system by state or a criminal court system which says where it's determined after investigation that a defendant cannot pay a fine, we just won't impose a fine but we will impose an alternative, what we think is some equivalent jail sentence.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3706.030" stopTime="3768.626">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    That's not an equivalent, that's the problem in this case. 
    If the state feels that he cannot pay, they still must do something less than putting him in jail. 
    A fine is not the equivalent of jail. 
    That is obvious and if the state wants to get the revenue, there are ways of collecting it. 
    If the state feels that a fine is the type of punishment, that's different from jail. 
    If that's appropriate, then that's the punishment that the state should stick to. 
    We're not telling the trial judges what to do. 
    We're simply talking about the manner in which the state gets that exaction. 
    If the judge determines money is the sanction that should be the sanction. 
    I did want to point to a reference in terms of cost, it was estimated that in the City of Chicago between 1907 and 1921, when prison costs were relatively low, the city lost $5 million in uncollected fines and incurred an additional expense in prison maintenance of $5 million, a total cost of $10 million.

    Well, we don't have those figures. 
    I'm sorry Your Honor. 
    I believe that the traffic courts have been granting installments on some occasions but I don't have the exact figures. 
    But in terms of the cost problem, the economics of it is not so clear at all that the state will be bankrupted by a ruling.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3804.118" stopTime="3816.663">

    We would submit that if the judge determines that -- well, first of all, if the offense is serious enough to warrant incarceration of an individual would seem to underlie a lot of these, letting an indigence to get away with violating the law with impunity. 
    This legislature has the ability to set up imprisonment as an alternative but if the offense is not serious enough to require an exaction greater than the fine, there's not justification for putting people in jail simply because they don't have the way with all to pay that.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You've almost -- you've almost gone around the circle now on my counterproductive proposition. 
    You said the legislature might respond by making greater class, number of classes of crimes subject to imprisonment which are now subject only to fines as a response to a holding that you can't have an alternative for a poor man.
speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="3889.943" stopTime="3910.200">
    Mr. Stanley A. Bass 
    Well, it's possible that the legislature has always had the discretion to determine what penalties are appropriate for what offenses but we're talking about this situation is an automatic system that puts people in jail without any inquiry whatsoever as to whether or not the money, that the state says is the appropriate sanction, the fine, can be satisfied in the means less onerous.
