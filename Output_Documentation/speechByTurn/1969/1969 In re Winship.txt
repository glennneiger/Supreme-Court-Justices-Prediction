    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case presents the first clear opportunity for the Court to determine one of the implications of a landmark case In re Gault. 
    It affords on a good record, an opportunity which this Court sought, but was unable to seize most recently in the case of Debacker versus Brainard, an opportunity to determine whether a juvenile, maybe found guilty of a law violation and confined for a number of years unless been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that is on proof less than that customarily considered, the highest measure of proof in criminal proceedings. 
    In this case, the 12-year old appellate was found guilty of an act of larceny in violation of the New York Penal Law and while he could have been confined for a maximum of five years, had he been an adult, he faced a maximum confinement of six years because he was tried in a juvenile proceeding in the New York Family Court. 
    The determination that he was guilty of this act of larceny was based expressly upon the provision of the New York statute which provides for such finding by mere preponderance of the evidence. 
    The issue arose briefly in the following context. 
    The juvenile was tried in a fact-finding hearing in the Family Court and at that hearing, the complainant, a saleslady testified that one night she was at work and while the store was open for business, she and her coworkers did not believe any other people were in the premises, that they were no costumers present. 
    However, she became alerted at some point that a lavatory door in the back of the premises was locked and a moment or two later, the door opened and a young boy scooted out of the store and out into the street. 
    The lady testified that she really had at the most 10 seconds to observe him in profile as he darted by and she saw him from a distance of about 20 feet. 
    She then proceeded into --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="155.842" stopTime="161.865">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But if you see someone that you have known before, isn't one second sometimes enough?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="161.865" stopTime="177.365">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Yes, Your Honor but in this case really it emerged that she knew this boy previously, not at that time but she was confronted by him in a one-to-one confrontation the next night in the police station. 
    There is nothing in this record to indicate --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="177.365" stopTime="182.855">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What difference does it make which time she drew those conclusions?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="182.855" stopTime="206.877">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Well, it's unclear from this record and I would suggest that the family court judge, in finding a boy guilty, conceded that there was a reasonable doubt in this case about I don't -- it's unclear as to whether he was -- what the doubt was about that the lady had an opportunity to see him or when she made the determination that this was someone that she had known previously.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="206.877" stopTime="209.641">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What did she say about having known him previously?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="209.641" stopTime="305.688">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    She said -- after she saw the boy scoot out she called the police office and she was then called to the police station the next night where she saw the boy and she testified in court that she knew this boy very well. 
    And she said that she had seen him on many previous occasions when he had come to her store and that she had thrown him out as a matter of fact. 
    The boy of course and his mother and his uncle all testified that he was not at all -- that he was home and could not possibly have been out of his house that entire evening and testified to an alibi. 
    He of course also denied that he ever knew this lady before, but I would suggest that it would be inappropriate here for us to again consider what entered into the fact finder's mind when he was making this determination. 
    He did assess the credibility of various witnesses and had before him the fact that the lady did see him in an inherently suggestive situation the next night and determine that he did have a reasonable doubt about this boy's guilt. 
    This was quite developed in a record and the judge most candidly noted that he was applying a different standard of proof then would have applied in adult situation and that therefore the finding was not ascertain. 
    And I would submit that at this point, what we are here to consider is the appropriateness of the measure of proof that the fact finder applied as opposed to what went into his determination that the child was guilty by the standard the he applied.

    Justice Potter Stewart

speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="317.518" stopTime="320.469">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    That's right, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    I would --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You recall of any case in this Court similar with what the court has said at least without standard in federal case constitutes then?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="329.719" stopTime="344.396">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Mr. Justice Harlan there is no express holding to that effect, but I would suggest that the reason of that is so is that this so widespread standard, it has such fundamental antecedents that holding to that effect has never been necessary.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="344.396" stopTime="346.475">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is that the standard in each of the 50 states here?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="346.475" stopTime="456.250">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Yes it is, Your Honor. 
    I would like to say at the outset that to seek a denomination of the proceeding here involved, either civil or criminal, would be futile and would really only obscure the question that we have to deal with because it is our basic contention that whatever we call these proceedings, juvenile proceedings, to find a child guilty of law violation and to incarcerate him for a substantial period of time unless, unless then the most certain standard of proof known to our law is a violation of due process and it is a violation of due process, I would submit, however that concept maybe defined. 
    Whether it is as in Mr. Justice Black's, view the law of the land where an adult is accused of a crime and confined or whether it is considered the fundamental fairness of the proceedings and although much has been said by this Court and other courts about the fairness of this standard where liberty is at stake for law violation, I would just like to reiterate a couple of considerations and that is the standard after all expresses an attempt to reduce the chance of risk when an innocent person is going to be convicted. 
    It is a flag as it were to the fact finder that you must be very, very certain that this is the person that did the act and in fact as this Court noted in Coffin against the United States many times, many years ago, it is really in fact a corollary to the presumption of innocence and I would doubt that anyone would suggest that that most fundamental presumption should not attach to somebody who is accused merely because of his age and of course a reasonable --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="456.250" stopTime="478.108">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, is that the only reason for it, merely because of his age or is it because whether misguided or well-advised, a system of juvenile courts was set up to take people under a given age out of the criminal process and away from the stream of criminal proceedings and to protect them, isn't that the background?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="478.108" stopTime="501.009">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Mr. Chief Justice, yes precisely and we make no challenge to the policy of a legislature, which seems to be uniformed throughout the country, to establish separate courts apart from the criminal process to try and deal with young offenders. 
    We don't challenge the assumptions on which that legislative policy is based.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="501.009" stopTime="507.129">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In New York, is there a judgment of guilt in a criminal act in this kind of a proceeding?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="507.129" stopTime="536.668">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    He was found guilty of a law violation. 
    My only contention is that within these specialized courts, designed as you suggest to save youngsters before they become perhaps “non-rehabilitatable,” if there's such a word, to offer them special kinds of services, but we only ask that within these special courts the limitations of the Constitution apply, so that fundamental fairness is recognized and observed.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="536.668" stopTime="540.399">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That's really a demand for the best of both worlds, isn't it?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="540.399" stopTime="607.208">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Yes and I think a child, a young offender, is indeed entitled to that and I would like to just for a moment deal with one of the contentions that the city has raised about this confinement procedure. 
    The City of New York has suggested well, there are other kinds of confinement that are based upon a preponderance of the evidence and suggest this is -- does not differ from those kinds of confinement. 
    And the city cites such things as the confinement of mentally ill people and alcoholics and narcotics addicts and I would say that it really strains the analogy to compare this kind of a case with that kind of case. 
    In those cases, you're dealing essentially with the distillation of medical testimony relating to a physical or mental condition. 
    Expert opinions, subject to very honest differences of opinion, what is an alcoholic or how sick is this person, but here we're talking about, did Johnny Jones do X on Y night?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="607.208" stopTime="656.297">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, let's assume you may be right with respect to commitment of the incompetence or narcotics addicts or alcoholics and so on, but coming closer to home right here in New York, as I understand the city's argument that children maybe confined and maybe confined in substantially or exactly the same place that this young man was confined after finding that there are persons in need of supervision and I would gather that doesn't need all sorts of expert testimony. 
    That's not a -- and would you concede that in order to support a finding that a young person is in need of supervision that preponderance of the evidence is all that's required?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="656.297" stopTime="664.926">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, I would say that of course there is some distinction because in one case we're talking about a law violation and in another case not but --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="664.926" stopTime="670.131">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But doesn't the young person -- isn't that -- if possible he's going to end up in the same institution?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="670.131" stopTime="714.127">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Very likely that he will. 
    I would say, however, that the way the statute reads in New York, there is some question and it's rather broadly defined. 
    However, as a matter of practical, as a practical matter, in New York, the courts have required that when someone is charged with being a person in need of supervision that he's incorrigible, that one may not merely accuse him of being incorrigible that one must charge specific acts of misconduct. 
    One must show that Johnny Jones was out away from home for two weeks from such and such date to another date, that he has been drinking intoxicating beverages, that he's associating with bad company namely, Sam Smith etcetera, etcetera, and that must be proved.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="714.127" stopTime="718.305">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But none -- and none of these things so far that you've mentioned and I suppose truancy would be another --
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="718.305" stopTime="718.741">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="718.741" stopTime="721.231">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- would be a criminal offense if committed by an adult.
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="721.231" stopTime="733.712">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    No, I -- it would not but I would suggest that the only implication of the case today is that perhaps the PINS case has says they're called should also be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and I --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="733.712" stopTime="734.302">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of a person in need of supervision.
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="734.302" stopTime="759.468">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Yes and the reason I suggest that is that again although it has no corollary in the criminal law, it is an allegation of misconduct and would seem intolerable for two boys to be in precisely of the same institutions; one, on a higher standard of proof, one on the lower standard of proof, both having been found guilty of misconduct. 
    And I would also think perhaps --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="759.468" stopTime="768.765">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So, so -- at least arguendo you concede the city is right to that extent in its -- in its what are we coming to argument?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="768.765" stopTime="819.802">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Well, in only to that extent. 
    The city has suggested in its brief, well, if this Court finds today that a finding of wrong doing must meet high standards of reliability, that means the whole panoply of criminal procedures will apply, that means it will be jury trials and every other protection. 
    I maintain that it's absolutely not so. 
    This is an entirely separable issue. 
    It is perfectly possible for this Court to find that it is required as a matter of fundamental fairness that the fact finder to be very certain of the child's guilt and not accord or determine any one of these other protections. 
    It may well be that this Court will at some time determine that these other things are necessary, but certainly not as a result to this case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="819.802" stopTime="841.172">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But just as so I understand it you -- I understood that you would say that logic which compelled the result that if a standard of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is required here in Constitution and the same standard would be required in the New York system to prove that a young person was a person in need of supervision.
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="841.172" stopTime="842.816">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Precisely, yes sir.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="842.816" stopTime="869.249">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you have to go no further in this case to prevail and say that where the charge against the delinquent is a criminal charge, a charge, an act which is committed by an adult, it would be a crime that if no circumstances you'd be proofed beyond a reasonable doubt or whatever label you put on it is required. 
    You don't have to go any further than that, do you?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="869.249" stopTime="870.989">

    You might want to but you don't have to.
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="872.685" stopTime="874.128">

    You don't have to, right.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="874.128" stopTime="882.965">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You want -- do you want all these children put right into the criminal court system tried under criminal, full-scale criminal standards?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="882.965" stopTime="947.922">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I think if I may say, I think that the intention of the reformers when the juvenile system began in this country at the turn of the century was to try to bring to bear upon the young offender whatever notions of psychology, sociology, rehabilitating and early training that was possible and deemed it advisable to do these in separate courts with different procedures and I'm not quarreling with that. 
    I think that that is perfectly appropriate but I think maybe at this point, it's important to note that that hope of the reformers will not be affected by finding that, that fact finder be very sure that the child has demonstrated in need for those rehabilitative services and perhaps describing the New York system would best explain how this works and why the finding -- the holding that we urge today will not detract from what you concede up as the efforts of the juvenile system to rehabilitate youngsters.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="947.922" stopTime="956.231">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, but aren't you moving -- aren't you moving every point in your case toward a criminal proceeding?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="956.231" stopTime="1052.296">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    No, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I would say that this finding, this -- what we are urging today is really even more fundamental than the rights accorded to children in Gault. 
    I would say that to ask the fact finder to be very sure that the child has committed the act which indicates he needs rehabilitation, that he'd be very certain of that, will change the court in it's everyday functioning much less than for example according a child the privilege against self-incrimination. 
    That goes much closer to changing the posture of the Court perhaps not in New York but elsewhere than a simple requirement that before you give the child these services, and there is some debate as to how effective they are, you must be very sure that he really needs them, that he has committed that robbery that shows that he needs help. 
    In New York, for example, if I may explain for a moment the hearing is bifurcated one. 
    It's a two-stage proceeding. 
    A child is brought to the fact finding hearing. 
    There, he's given a petition which has the charge in it and the judge hears the fact, he may only consider competent, relevant, and material evidence. 
    No social history is permitted of the judge at that time by New York statute. 
    They can have big case on his family's problems and the boy's psychiatric history but the judge may not see it. 
    He must make an independent determination whether the boy committed this act or not. 
    Once that finding of guilt is made, the child then must attend what is known as a dispositional hearing.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1052.296" stopTime="1056.168">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's not however a finding of guilt as such, is it?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="1056.168" stopTime="1058.327">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    It would be a euphemism to call it anything else than that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1058.327" stopTime="1061.930">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, what if in New York -- to explain in the New York system, what does New York call it?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="1061.930" stopTime="1065.938">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    It's called a fact finding.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1065.938" stopTime="1092.721">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well isn't that -- isn't that the predicate of the whole system? 
    Didn't these reformers who set up the system which the courts are now dismantling piece by piece originally say that no lawyers could be there, the judge wouldn't have a robe, there wouldn't be a bench, it couldn't be any newspaper reporters there and no one could mention his name, weren't all these steps done to protect the child from the traumatic experience of the criminal court setting?
speaker="rena_k_uviller" startTime="1092.721" stopTime="1114.684">
    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice they were but I think Gault quite documented the fact that the hopes that the child would unequivocally stand to benefit from these procedures. 
    It has not been realized and I don't think here it would appropriate to go into a reevaluation of how successful the system has been in New York.

    Well, a lot of them in Court of Appeals, Judge Fuld, Heaney and somebody else.

    Ms. Rena K. Uviller 
    Judge Fuld, Judge Heaney and Judge Burke, I believe. 
    I would like to just make one note about the alleged benefits that the Court of Appeals stressed in its opinion. 
    The Court of Appeals in discussing the advantages of the trial of this so-called secrecy and non-stigma of the proceedings, neglected of course to underscore the harsh reality that when a child is found guilty in this Court, he is subjected to substantial confinement and the facilities which even in New York are subject to a great deal of criticism. 
    Now, the city in its brief has a compounded this omission by the Court of Appeals by again stressing the benefits of the New York system without -- and suggest of the problems with the institutions have never been shown to be relevant to New York and the Attorney General in his amicus brief doubly compounds this by actually suggesting that this is summer camp and that children just can't wait to go to the training school. 
    I would say here that we would insist that the standard of proof be high even if these were model institutions, but I cannot let the suggestion of the Attorney General go un-contradicted at this point. 
    A recent study by the New York Community Service Society, one of the oldest, private service organizations in New York, has issued a report indicating that the facilities in New York are very poor indeed, that rehabilitation and counseling range from token to nonexistent, that there are inadequate provisions not only for vocational training but for even ordinary schooling.

    Neglected children are sent to completely separate institutions and while I'm sure there is again always room for improvement in these facilities, these are not locked shelters. 
    And a -- finding that a child has committed a violation of law also subjects him to a temporary detention. 
    There is -- there are statistics to the effect that some 35% of the children who are found guilty of law violations spend some time in the temporary detention facility and of those some 40% I believe are there beyond 30 days. 
    Now, it takes just one visit to that detention facility in New York to convince one that we're not talking about an open, free shelter for little children. 
    It is a facility where you cannot walk 30 feet but that the custodian doesn't have to unlock the doors to let you go through the corridors and children are locked into their rooms at night.

    Yes, I would say so and I would say Your Honor, it is a very, analogous to the Specht v.

    And the suggestion by the city that this two-stage proceeding somehow relieves the state of proving the underlying act by the highest standard of proof is really essentially an unsound one. 
    In sum, we're merely suggesting that let the state services whether they're good or bad be reserved for children against to whom it's been demonstrated really require them by having prove the acts, requires such rehabilitation.

   Argument of Stanley Buchsbaum
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1753.118" stopTime="1753.431">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Buchsbaum.
speaker="stanley_buchsbaum" startTime="1753.431" stopTime="2001.459">
    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    At the outset, I want to take a moment on the finding by the court below. 
    I think that it may be a little misleading to suggest that the judge in the family court said that if the standard of proof was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, he would have reached a different result. 
    And early in my brief, I discussed this in quote from the appendix as to what happened at that point and if this becomes an element in the case which I rather doubt, I think the Court should look at what happened. 
    Because the judge made his finding in accordance with the law and then counsel for the trial started what ended up as philosophic discussion about the various standards of proof and the judge then made some remarks which in the appellant's brief have all been telescoped even though they're page apart and gives the feeling that he is talking about this specific case, when apparently he is talking about determinations in general. 
    Now, let me turn to the central issue. 
    The question is whether the Constitution requires that in the proceeding of this kind, there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that the preponderance of the evidence standard is inadequate. 
    Now, there is no specific constitutional provision. 
    So the question comes down to whether due process requires it. 
    And as I see it that either must go along one of two paths; either that in a criminal case, you must have such proof and this is a criminal case or two the nature of what happens after this proceeding, the loss of liberty, the incarceration, the possibility of that is of such a nature that due process requires that standard of proof. 
    Aside from those two paths, I cannot see how this can be decided as a constitutional question. 
    Now, much of the discussion we've had in this field and I've seen it in some opinions in the Law Review articles discuss this without referring to the Constitution on the assumption that due process is what I think is wise and if I think this is wise, the Constitution requires it and obviously, this court does not approach the problem that way. 
    Now, let's see whether this is a criminal proceeding and here I suggest that Mr. Justice Fortas in the Gault opinion was writing far ranging. 
    He was writing about the entire juvenile system and he was dealing with a case which at least to me seemed quite horrendous. 
    And what he did was from all the writings, studies, very often students at the law school probably had never seen a juvenile court, what they wrote, he was picking out all the things that went wrong. 
    If something went wrong in Oregon which didn't go wrong in any other state that was listed. 
    Now, it seems to me that we're dealing with the question of whether the Court is the equivalent of a criminal court, we must deal in this case with the New York Court.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2001.459" stopTime="2044.316">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Let me ask you a question, supposing now, you say there's no due process question here, supposing New York passed a law saying our juvenile calendar load is very, very heavy and we will amend our laws so that these children who may be in trouble need supervision and need something. 
    They can be found juvenile delinquents upon the judge finding that there's probable cause to believe they are. 
    Would you think that was it? 
    Do you think that'll raise a question under the Due Process Clause?

speaker="stanley_buchsbaum" startTime="2071.844" stopTime="2092.248">
    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    I would think that almost anything which depends upon someone saying, I think, this maybe so when therefore finality results from it. 
    What we're dealing with a subject altogether different from a juvenile delinquency would raise a due process question.

    I think in a purely civil case.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2097.083" stopTime="2103.277">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    There's nothing in the Constitution that says it does except the Due Process Clause?
speaker="stanley_buchsbaum" startTime="2103.277" stopTime="2132.319">
    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    No but I think due process does require that there must be some element of logic in reaching a conclusion and that there's something lacking in logic if you say something must happen as a finality in a case in any type of case simply because someone thinks it might have happened. 
    No conclusion as to this happened or this didn't happen, I think that would raise a due process question.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2132.319" stopTime="2159.415">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I suppose it would follow a fortiori that if New York had a rule that when some juvenile was charged without more of the Court would incarcerate him, so that what you're saying is that this is a spectrum and under the Due Process Clause it's question of degree if it's a due process question at all?
speaker="stanley_buchsbaum" startTime="2159.415" stopTime="2198.640">
    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    Yes. 
    I think that's true, but I think if you're going to hold out from all your cases those which to which you must apply the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but I only see two basis for selecting the juvenile delinquency proceeding. 
    It's falling into that category. 
    One, either that it's so akin to the criminal case that requires it or two, that's a proceeding which may lead to loss of liberty and therefore requires it.

    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    That depends upon whether you're going to say that any attempt to make reform, you just look through it and we had at Rhode Island a judge who reached the conclusion that the appellant seeks and in his opinion, he said the murder is murder, burglary is burglary and we must recognize it, but that's exactly what the juvenile court system was aimed to prevent. 
    It was a --

speaker="stanley_buchsbaum" startTime="2250.159" stopTime="2304.860">
    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    There is no question that under the New York law, to start a juvenile delinquency proceeding, you must charge someone with an act which have committed by an adult would constitute a crime. 
    Now, I'm going to suggest that this constitutional question cannot depend upon that because suppose New York passes a law next year, lumps persons in need of supervision and the present juvenile proceeding on under a title deviant conduct, deviant conduct and says that you can bring this proceeding and show that the child's conduct deviates from what is regarded as a desirable norm and then proceed.

    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    That's right and in this proceeding, the things that occur in this proceeding are not to be distorted as the equivalent of his having been charged with a crime or having been found guilty of a crime and that's why it's labeled a fact finding determination and then you have a dispositional hearing which is not a suspended sentence. 
    No matter what the child did, no matter how if it serious a crime that would have been done, considered if committed by an adult, a clear cut evidence the child did it, if they find that this child does not need confinement or supervision to avoid this happening again or avoid similar conduct happening again, he is not found to be a juvenile delinquent and the case would have been dismissed.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What?
speaker="stanley_buchsbaum" startTime="2566.028" stopTime="2715.655">
    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    It said that the child may remain silent. 
    That was the one aspect in which the Gault case did touch upon this as though it was an issue of due process which would -- as to all other aspects as spoken by due process and civil or criminal cases required certain things. 
    In this respect, it said that this was analogous to a criminal case. 
    Although it went on immediately after it showed that that remark was unnecessary because in Arizona the child still could have been waived to a criminal court and tried on a criminal basis. 
    Well, what I suggest and I'm not going to attempt to cover all of the various aspects in which this juvenile court in New York differs from a criminal court, but there are these differences. 
    There is not this finding of guilt as we're told and while the places of confinement may be not be ideal and much can be done to prove it. 
    We do find in New York, there is a constant restudy on this field, there is a constant attempt to improve far too slow, far too slow and often inadequate, but there are constant changes and while I hesitate to speak of the manner of confinement without knowing precisely and it wasn't evident from the record, the brief of the Attorney General, submitted, does point out and I'm not saying that anyone is willing to go to these places, that the training schools operate under a college unit system which generally is made up of semi-independent groups, many of which a limited to 20 young people that there are in an open setting without the restraint of locks or bars, that house parents live on the premises and act as guides and mentors as well as supervisors, that home visits are made by the boys and girls on a regular basis and vocational academic features are provided. 
    Now, perhaps this is the idea that they aim at and perhaps they don't always comply but this is what they're trying to do.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As suggested by the Chief Justice and Mrs. Uviller directed herself to this, this really doesn't have much to do with the issue before us. 
    Now, except insofar as it that may go to whether or not what happened here was the equivalent of a finding of guilt and the imposition of punishment.
speaker="stanley_buchsbaum" startTime="2735.546" stopTime="2735.708">
    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    Yes

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's the -- and if it is -- if it is tantamount to that, and if the constitution requires that in a criminal case where the issue is the determination or guilt and the imposition of punishment, the due process or some other provision of the Constitution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt and Mrs. Uviller is correct and if -- but whether or not these are well or badly run institutions or how many house mothers they have and how big the cottages are and so on. 
    Except insofar as it goes, maybe its your submission that this is not the equivalent of guilt and punishment, those issues are really for the New York state legislature, not for the courts.
speaker="stanley_buchsbaum" startTime="2777.179" stopTime="2856.704">
    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    Exactly. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Marshall has suggested that the mere fact that this starts off because of an act which would constitute a crime, everything flows to it. 
    I think that's a suggestion and it must be treated as a crime and all these trimmings that you're putting on and all you've got is a criminal court trying a criminal case to put somebody of way as you do in the criminal court and therefore at least in approach, in answer to that approach, I think it's important to consider every element from the intake procedure where even though a petition is drawn up which says that the child committed an act which would be a crime by an adult and a substantial portion of the case is they review this and never even reaches a fact finding stage and they decide even though the evidence is there, this doesn't call for juvenile delinquency proceeding in this child. 
    Through the dispositional hearing, where after the evidence may be proved on a basis which go far beyond proof beyond a reasonable doubt, an absolute certainty, nevertheless, there is no finding of juvenile delinquency because the child doesn't need confinement or supervision.

    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    I have found no case that decides that issue.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Not necessarily because if you took the reasoning of Judge Fuld in New York in his dissent in this case, you would say that the -- or could argue at least that the requirement of a finding beyond a reasonable doubt was necessary to maintain the integrity of the Fifth Amendment unless a juvenile is not a person within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. 
    That was his argument, wasn't it?

    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum

speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3121.862" stopTime="3146.566">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well he ties it to the Fifth Amendment and I don't know if that's the argument, but this amendment uses the word in any criminal case, shall be compelled in any criminal case and the Sixth Amendment uses a phrase, “and all criminal prosecutions.” 
    So the question really is whether assuming that reasonable doubt standard is applicable as well as this is a criminal case or what is a criminal prosecution?

    I'm not saying that that he was.

    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    That is the essence of the question there and that's why I keep speaking about whether this is truly a criminal proceeding and why I suggest that you can't decide that it's a criminal proceeding just because the trigger that's starts it off is an act which if done by an adult would be a crime.

    Mr. Stanley Buchsbaum 
    Well, I think in justice to the other side, if that were a deliberate intent to mislead or even if would not deliberate, if in fact what you really had was a criminal case than just labeling it is not being criminal case would not get by, but it's not merely the label, it's not merely calling in a civil proceeding that makes it any less a criminal case. 
    The question is, looking at the thing as a whole from beginning to end in every feature of it, is this a criminal proceeding and I submit that while you may find a juvenile court set up in some states, where you'd reach the conclusion, this is nothing but a criminal proceeding that you cannot so find in New York. 
    Now, it's also been suggested, certainly in my arguments that if you reach this conclusion you must end up with the jury trial in the juvenile courts and if you reach it on the basis of this being a criminal proceeding. 
    And my suggestion that if you base it on loss of the liberty that this may have an impact on the insanity proceedings and the narcotic addicts proceedings and the civil contempt proceeding and not the issues before this Court but I submit that in this case, the Court will decide which path will be taken down the certain hill and it's hard for me to conceive ever going back up that hill.
