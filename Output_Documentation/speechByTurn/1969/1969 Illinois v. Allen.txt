    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    The point was raised in the respondent's brief, we replied in a reply brief. 
    And then the letter was forth coming last week from the respondent asking that it would be withdrawn as a point. 
    Turning to the instant case, Your Honor, the case which we feel is one of the first impressions certainly, factually before this Court. 
    However, a little more than 100 years ago in the federal district court in New York, when George Davis was put on trial for perjury, shortly after the onset of that trial, the defendant became unruly. 
    This was during certain statements being made by the prosecutor. 
    The defendant was removed from the court during a motion for a new trial, the trial judge ruled. 
    He was absent during a part of the opening only because of his own disorderly conduct. 
    It does not lie in his mouth to complain of an order which was made necessary by his own misconduct. 
    Now, 101 years later people in the State of Illinois asked this Court to review and reverse Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit's decision in Illinois v. Allen. 
    Allen was indicted for armed robbery in 1956, tried in the criminal court of Cook County Illinois and sentenced to a term of 10 to 30 years in the penitentiary. 
    He is presently on parole and I am informed that parole -- from beginning of the trial, Allen insisted on his right to question jurors on the voir dire examination, embarked on deliberate and knowing course of disruption outburst and threats which finally culminated in his removal from the courtroom during most of the presentation of a states' case. 
    We contend the facts are not in dispute.

    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    By both. 
    The reason we contend the facts in this case are not in dispute is that pleading of the Court of Appeals even in its majority opinion as well as in the Seventh Circuit -- the dissent of Seventh Circuit and the opinion -- per curiam opinion of the Illinois Supreme Court clearly on agreement on the nature of the conduct here. 
    Of the 10 reviewing judges who had an opportunity to examine the record all 10 agreed on the conduct only two felt constrained by the constitutional prohibition as they read it to rule that Allen was unlawfully removed from his trial. 
    Just briefly, the respondent threatened the life of the trial judge, ripped his attorney's file and arranged the court in such a way that the judge felt his removal was necessary. 
    I might add that there was a warning in all of these cases. 
    Some of the commentators on this area have suggested that if this rule of exclusion is allowed that it be appropriately done in areas where there are warning. 
    The Court of Appeals in its majority opinion found adequate warning by the trial judge and I suggest there is more than one warning included in the administrators from the trial court for the respondent to remain silent.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="340.713" stopTime="342.160">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    How long is the trial?
speaker="joel_m_flaum" startTime="342.160" stopTime="639.973">
    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe the trial took approximately two-and-a half days. 
    It was a jury trial; it was a simple case of an armed robbery of a tavern. 
    Allen was identified by the bartender and in turn Allen identified the victim. 
    The defense was insanity in -- the year-and-a-half before the defendant had been declared incompetent. 
    He had been restored and his defense from sanity was rejected by the trier of fact. 
    We are here today because we feel, we have asked this Court to review because we do not believe that the constitution in the United States compels the result which the Seventh Circuit reluctantly I might add arrived at. 
    We feel that the right of confrontation through its birth in the common law, certainly and its adoption by the Sixth Amendment wasn't meant to broaden the exceptions that the common law recognizes. 
    And this Court in 1926 in Salinger versus United States specifically mentioned that while the common law was brought into the purview of the Sixth Amendment's right to confrontation it certainly wasn't meant to make the exceptions not included in that new amendment. 
    This Court had in Diaz versus the United States in 1912 clearly addressed itself to the issue of waiver. 
    Now, in that case the murder case out of the Philippines tried on the Philippine Code, the court concluded that what they were reviewing was a substantial equivalent of the Sixth Amendment. 
    The court -- the issue in Diaz as presented or the claim made was that the Supreme Court -- in the Supreme Court here that he did not waive the right of confrontation but that he could not waive it. 
    This Court held that waiver was possible, was permissible and did obtain in that case. 
    In that case, the defendant voluntarily left. 
    The Court sent a message to the presiding judge that he wouldn't return. 
    Significant, we feel in this case are two things. 
    One, the Davis case which the only direct American president other than the prior Illinois case in 1956. 
    On this point was mentioned in Davis favorably -- in Diaz favorably and what is significant is that Diaz they're residing Davis which was an involuntary removal case. 
    We feel that if waiver is recognized, certainly the waiver by an escapee from a courtroom that the unruly defendant is not be accorded treatment different in the escapee. 
    Diaz makes it clear that a defendant walks out or escapes, waives his right to be present as the trial can continue. 
    We believe there's no difference between a defendant who walks out of the courtroom and a defendant who was ordered to move because his courtroom conduct makes a fair and orderly trial impossible. 
    If there's waiver in the prior case -- the former case, we think there's waiver in a latter. 
    Now, on the issue of whether waiver has been recognized our research indicates only the Davis case in 1869, two English cases, one a felony case, one is misdemeanor case, Rex v. Brown and Rex v. Berry, also in the 19th century. 
    But it's been never rejected by court of review as we confine. 
    Further, we suggest that this Court in dictum in the Diaz case in a subsequent case in Schneider versus Massachusetts has adopted the waiver principal and that the dictum allows for its application here. 
    I might add that in dictum, in Schneider versus Massachusetts the capital case involving whether the defendant was entitled to view the scene when the jury left to do that. 
    Mr. Justice Cardozo specifically added -- no doubt, the privilege of confrontation may be lost by consent or even at times by misconduct. 
    So, in the Schneider versus Massachusetts case that wasn't an issue when we --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="677.458" stopTime="685.478">

    Then why is it this really a question whether the constitutional right has been forfeited by the conduct?
speaker="joel_m_flaum" startTime="685.478" stopTime="689.974">
    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    Well --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="689.974" stopTime="692.511">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Isn't that at least more realistic perhaps more honest analysis?
speaker="joel_m_flaum" startTime="692.511" stopTime="791.390">
    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    Well, I think in -- if I might disagree to an extent Mr. Justice Brennan, I feel waiver is applicable in this case for this reason. 
    The dialogue between the judge and the defendant in this case was one of not a lack of communication. 
    They seem to be understanding, the warning seem to be clear. 
    Certainly when one reads the record in this case, the defendant had no problem in making his intentions known. 
    The Court of Appeals found, they set a patient and very tolerant judge. 
    I think that when the dialog reaches the level it did in this case where the inclusions of the warnings, which might result if in fact the conduct does not cease that waiver would not be stretching the concept to apply it here. 
    I think it would also lend to a more flexible rule of discretion and if I might suggest a more easy handle for courts below, if this Court so ruled that waiver was permissible in this instance. 
    We find that the commentators while acknowledging limited authority on the case seem to be pretty much unanimous in their feeling at least to the visceral one that removal is the appropriate remedy. 
    We in our study found that the development of the right to be present was early cast in jurisdictional terms and we suggest that if it has any vitality today it may only be perhaps in capital cases --

speaker="joel_m_flaum" startTime="795.779" stopTime="828.026">
    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    One of the remedies Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    We suggest that we just broaden the trial judge's discretion to include this as one along with content and what apparently has been permitted by lower court's binding and gagging. 
    Our feeling is that it doesn't fall outside binding and gagging. 
    In fact, it's a much more reasonable and much more desirable end for justice to have the exclusion when it's positive under the case like this.

    In this case, we had a man faced to the possible life sentence. 
    Our feeling is that contempt in cases like that may not live level well with a defendant bent on disrupting the trial. 
    We feel the scene of binding and gagging and I question whether the right of confrontation is any better preserved by the defendant found gagging and maniacal. 
    It brings the service to the Court that in which this action takes place.

    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    In fact, Mr. Chief Justice it preceded that because in pretrial before another judge of the Cook County Circuit Court where he made a motion for a change of judges -- substitution judges we thought is based on prejudice. 
    He again there caused some sort of a scene and we -- so you can trace it back there. 
    But, yes this started immediately and we suggest upon no propagation. 
    There's an absence totally of any dialog for example between a prosecutor and the defendant. 
    So, there's no act of -- to state apart from the judge in incurring the raft of the defendant by any spoken word in the opening statement or the like. 
    Your Honors, we would add one other fact and that is that we recognized in whenever asking this Court to acknowledge broader jurisdiction discretion and a trial judge -- that's a weighty problem. 
    However, if the police of this country can be entrusted with stock and first discretion which we suggest is a low visibility situation. 
    Certainly, the entrusting to a trial judge subject to appropriate review of the opportunity to expel and --

    Mr. Joel M. Flaum

    Right.
speaker="joel_m_flaum" startTime="1151.747" stopTime="1188.302">
    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    And recognizing that in any discretion case, there's a chance that the review is always difficult because of the area of discretion and is quite often intruded by Court of Appeals in very limited fashion entrusting great beliefs that a trial judge normally acts very fairly. We say this is not a low visibility situation. 
    We're trying to lay any fear in that regard that this will not become a wholesale tool of a judge annoyed with the look, smart talk of a defendant.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1188.302" stopTime="1218.751">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Certainly, I suppose General Flaum that all would agree that a trial judge is in trust of a great discretion and what procedures he is going to follow and keeping order in this court room. 
    No question about that but here we have a claim of a violation of a specific constitutional right that i.e, the right of confrontation. 
    So, the fact, there's great discretion really doesn't meet the claim of your adversaries, isn't it?
speaker="joel_m_flaum" startTime="1218.751" stopTime="1236.940">
    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    On that specific point Mr. Justice Stewart I would agree. 
    However, on the violation of the constitutional right, constitutional right commentators in this Court have recognized is mainly to ensure the opportunity for cross-examination and it's a collateral benefit of that, the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses. 
    Certainly, exclusion --

    They have to face the witnesses and have the witnesses on the stand facing the defendant.

    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    That's true but --

    And there are at least three ingredients for this confrontation.

    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    Well, I would suggest Mr. Justice Stewart in Barber and Page the last Sixth Amendment case, not at all on point but written by this Court in '68. 
    The first to stress that I don't mean to exclude that the third but -- in more field that first to it are the greater. 
    In this case, the counsel continued with the cross-examination -- there wasn't that denial of the right of confrontation and the demeanor of the witnesses certainly remained a possibility because none of them were excluded. 
    It seems to us that he reach a point and that constitutional right, you cannot have both -- you can't be entitled the both, the right and a ruin of it.

    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    We feel Mr. Chief Justice that's at least one of three clear indications that he -- when brought back and insisted that there would be no trial in two of the returns where the invitation of the judge that you have a record that seems to me patently clear in an attempt by the judge to bring the defendant around to reasonable conduct and a clearing decision by the defendant to in no way entertain it until and this is significant until the defense began and then there was calm. 
    In fact, we found the defendant stating in affect that he realized that his conduct was improper. 
    It can also stand as a certain reflective process that he probably had throughout the trial but just chose to use in one case --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1367.607" stopTime="1370.344">

    We find at least three and perhaps four -- for the fourth one, Mr. Chief Justice has to be a reading into statements. 
    It does include the word, “warn.” 
    Court of Appeal's majority opinion in reversing concluded that he was warned and did not spell it up.

    Now -

    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    Yes I do, I'm familiar with that case. 
    I would suggest Mr. Justice Marshall, that it's our view that not only must justice be done but there ought to be the appearance of justice and if I might in that assumption, we do a tremendous disservice to promoting that kind of a scene and in the rewarding conduct which in no way one can sympathize with. 
    If we have got an incompetent defendant then he shouldn't be on trial. 
    But certainly one which is a pure deliberate act of volition as it was in this case, it's very hard to not find that the limits of the constitutional right have been exhausted.

    Mr. Joel M. Flaum

    That's why we have leaned toward the waiver conducts also because as our reading of the dictum of cases that could preferably dealt with waiver in this Court that words like -- that he can waive it by his misconduct as Mr. Justice Cardozo said, suggest to us that was the route that we might appropriately offer up to this --

    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    The effects are not in dispute but I feel that they need some elaboration -- so that the Court can more accurately understand the situation of this trial. 
    The respondent William Allen on August 12, 1956 at about 3 o'clock in the morning walked into a tavern, went to a corner of the bar where no one was around and when the bartender came over to ask him what he wanted to drink, the bartender saw a gun -- Allen said, “I want the money,” the bartender took the money and gave it to him and Allen left. 
    A few hours later Allen was apprehended. 
    He was searched, no gun, but approximately $200.00 was found in his presence. 
    The officer said, “Where did you get the money?” 
    And Allen said, “Oh I robbed this bar this evening.” 
    With that, he was taken to the police station and subsequently there was a line up. 
    When Allen was walked in with several other suspects to be viewed by the owner of the bar and the bartender both of whom were in the bar when the robbery occurred before he could be identified, Allen said, “Hey, I recognize you, you look familiar, didn't I rob you this night?” 
    Last night?
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1898.046" stopTime="1900.760">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How is this relevant now on our issue?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="1900.760" stopTime="1929.384">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Because I'm trying to explain Allen's behavior. 
    Allen was then indicted and while in jail, there were several attempted suicides. 
    Allen had a prior mental history back in the early 50's -- he was committed and served some time in a mental hospital. 
    Subsequently, a pretrial sanity hearing was held in 1956, it was determined that he could not cooperate with his attorney and he was sentenced to a mental institution.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1929.384" stopTime="1933.179">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But that issue is out of this case long since, isn't it? 
    You haven't raised it --
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="1933.179" stopTime="1984.309">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    No, I have not raised but it bears to -- I think it's important for the Court to realize the type of person who Allen was and what the trial judge was confronted with. 
    I don't feel that the trial judge in the warnings realized that he was dealing with a person who has a prior mental history and may not -- although the issue is not before this Court and may not have been in full control of his faculties at the time he was tried. 
    And the fact that you may say to someone, if you don't sit-down and be quiet you're going to be removed and warn him once or twice and he continues to disrupt the proceedings and to remove that person -- that's different than dealing with a person who has complete control of his faculties who may realize what the Court is saying. 
    When Allen was subsequently --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1984.309" stopTime="1999.593">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Did Allen realize what he was saying when he said, “You're not going to hold any trial (Inaudible)?" 
    You have been talking about what the judge didn't understand but I mean -- do you say Allen didn't mean that when he said it?

    He did?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="2001.280" stopTime="2004.947">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    He did mean that because he wanted to conduct his own trial.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2004.947" stopTime="2008.431">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What should the Court do then? 
    Let him break up?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="2008.431" stopTime="2091.764">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Well, no. 
    Because, when Allen was brought to trial, he requested the right to represent himself and the Court granted him that right. 
    He began to conduct a voir dire examination and during the conduct of that examination -- after some 14 pages of transcript of examining the first witness, he began to make statements about his case. 
    The state objected. 
    There then became a dialog between Allen and the judge. 
    The judge warned him not to make statements, conduct himself only to the qualifications of the jurors. 
    The dialog continued, Allen said he was going to conduct this trial as he knew how the judge warned him, any statements and I'm going to deny you the right to represent yourself. 
    Some more dialog, Allen continued to be disrespectful to the court because he wanted to conduct his defense the only way he knew how. 
    He is not a skilled attorney, he is an indigent who was on trial for his life but this time he said life and the judge said liberty. 
    But the issue involved is because Allen at this time was a three time loser. 
    This was his fourth conviction. 
    And it was possible for him to be sentenced for the rest of his natural life in the penitentiary and this may explain that the court be the dialogue between the judge and Allen with respect to life and liberty but the court was arguing him.

    Well I'm saying at that stage, what should the judge do then?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="2195.567" stopTime="2209.339">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    He should recess the court, sit-down with the defendant in chambers, take five minutes out and explain to him very simply in a calm passion rather than an argumentative passion and say, “Here's what's going to happen." 
    I mean they conducted --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2209.339" stopTime="2228.977">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I would suggest that he would go in and ask the defendant, “How do you want me to run the trial? 
    Is that what you want?" 
    In that situation, the judge had a choice according to the Court of Appeals of three things and he chose one of them.

    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Well, there were two rights which --

    We have already talked of binding and gagging?

    Well no.

    Was he?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="2235.078" stopTime="2286.877">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Pardon me. 
    There were two elements, first was, denial of Allen's right to represent himself. 
    This was denied first. 
    This is what brought about the second confrontation between Allen and the court because Allen objected that he is not being permitted to continue to represent himself. 
    The court had appointed an attorney that day to sit with him to protect the record. 
    There is no evidence in the record that Allen and this attorney had any discussions about his case whatsoever. 
    Allen did not want him. 
    He refused to accept him, but the judge said, “You sit down, he is going to conduct your defense." 
    He said, “No, he is not. 
    I don't want him." 
    The judge says, “You sit down and be quiet or else I'm going to have you removed." 
    Allen refused to sit and be quiet. 
    He didn't want the attorney who was being appointed. 
    The judge says, “remove him" and he was taken out of court.

    Is that still a choice made by Allen?

    Pardon?

    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    He has a choice, after he has given the right to defend himself and that right and is now denied, just sits still and sit in a chair and have an attorney who he doesn't know represent himself, have an attorney who he hasn't talked to or who may know nothing at all about the case. 
    Is he to just sit there or is he permitted to protest when he thinks our violation of his rights. 
    And at this point in time (Voice Overlaps) --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2321.636" stopTime="2326.259">

    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Well, Allen was in custody, I am sure that this is something that was said in the heat of the dispute between the court and Allen and I doubt very much if the judge took that seriously. 
    Of course the Judge was a form of --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Harris, are you arguing that as a matter of the Confrontation Clause, there are no circumstances under which and if defendant may be removed from the courtroom for misconduct and the trial proceed without him. 
    Are you going that far?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="2379.878" stopTime="2401.630">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    I am going that far because I believe that under today's technological advances there are alternatives for dealing with the unruly defendant which will preserve his right to confront the witnesses. 
    I do not believe that an attorney without his client to communicate with him is capable of properly conducting a cross-examination.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2401.630" stopTime="2403.089">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What are the alternatives?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="2403.089" stopTime="2459.928">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    The alternatives are a glass sound proof booth which could be constructed. 
    Such a booth was actually used during a sanity hearing in 1956 in California, and I have in my possession photographs of that booth. 
    The defendant, the State of California built a booth which was 12 by 12, that was sound proof glass, it was air conditioned, there was a telephone in the booth. 
    In the booth was a guard with the defendant. 
    When the defendant first got in the booth as soon as the hearing began he picked up the chair, he was sitting in and he smashed against the glass. 
    They recessed the court and then built an iron chair which was bolted to the floor. 
    There were clamps which were built onto that chair so the defendant was then seated in the chair with the clamps around his leg, he had a telephone with which to communicate as soon as his attorney who was sitting just outside the booth.

    Mr. H. Reed Harris

    What about gagging?

    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    I feel that he should be -- if the court will not accept close circuit television or a booth then he should be gagged, he should remain in court because even though he's gagged and he can't talk to his attorney, you can still hear what's going on. 
    And it's completely different for a defendant to be in court and to hear what's going on so at a recess he can talk to his attorney rather than try and read a transcript during a recess and tell him what should or should not happen or should be set in cross-examination.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2531.816" stopTime="2541.767">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Yes.

    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    That is correct.

    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Well I think I --

    And he may by that misconduct?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="2580.148" stopTime="2670.534">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    I do not believe that we can permit or the court should permit a defendant to disrupt the trial, to cause a mistrial to delay the trial by conduct. 
    And I feel that his right to be in court is mandatory so he can see what is happening and confer with his attorney. 
    If he attempts to purposely disrupt the court, I do not think that a contempt sentence is going to be effective because assuming a series of contempt convictions over a period of time during this time there maybe witnesses who could testify, who will now no longer be available and thereby through indirection he may be serving three or four contempt terms and avoid serving a much more serious term for the charges that are brought against them. 
    I think that there are more effective ways of gagging and binding a defendant rather the one which was used in the recent trial in Chicago where the seven defendants. 
    Bobby Seals was chained with a sort of a make shift gag on his mouth. 
    Had the court used a straight jacket and the hospital gag as we used in a recent Ohio trial. 
    The defendant would have been immobile and he wouldn't have been able to bite through the gag and other noises to disrupt the proceedings.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I take it if you have a number of defendants who are equally abstract with your thought would be that each should have to have his own cubicle, state would have to provide -- what is that?

    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Well, to close circuit the trial, I mean a cubicle I think is impractical because as was done in the senate hearing in California when the defendant got in the cubicle as a last effort to disrupt the proceeding -- he then pretended to be asleep during the entire hearing which lasted two or three weeks. 
    I think the close circuit television could be -- it's mobile, it could be setup and the cost is nominal. 
    Every bank and savings and loan association and the basis of a country have closed circuit TV every time (Voice Overlaps) --

    Well, that depends on how the right of confrontation is defined. 
    He is to confront him for what purpose? 
    I think the purposes were there one so the -- he can face the witness, the defendant and cross-examine. 
    There is a second reason for the jury to see the witness. 
    And reflect on his demeanor and his testimony. 
    I don't think either of these rights would be violated if he is placed in a separate room.

    Let's say the phone is not working, that's recess.

    He was non-committal as to what he was going to do. 
    The trial began, the first thing that was done is that his court appointed attorney made a motion of good witnesses. 
    The respondent looked around he didn't see his friends who were supposed to be in court. 
    His sister -- he got up and said, “where's my witnesses? 
    How can this trial go on?" 
    And with that the judge ordered him removed out of court. 
    He was in court four times the next, that afternoon which was during the prosecution's entire case. 
    There were four witnesses. 
    Two testified -- they saw him commit the crime, two testified that he admitted to him that he committed the crime. 
    And the point in testimony was reached, “do you see the man who did that?" 
    And the witness would look around and say, “no, I don't" and the judge would say, “bring in the defendant" and they dragged this guy in with handcuffs in a prison uniform that was stenciled across the front maximum security and they'd say, “that's the man." 
    And then they say, “Remove the defendant," they drag him out again four times in and out.

    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Sure, keep him in court, but don't bring him in and out of the court every time you want to identify him. 
    I mean, even in the most primitive of identification in police line up, they just don't bring one person out and say, “is that the man who did it," they at least bring several out. 
    Here, he said, “Did you see the man in the courtroom when you look around?" 
    There are several faces, “no I don't." 
    “Okay, bring in the defendant." 
    One guy comes in, that's the man.

    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    In the reading in the record, I will acknowledge that the court appointed attorney for him did an excellent job. 
    The trial judge who was in his 70's who may have had certain preconceived notions about justice because he was a former prosecutor for many years as a first instance -- in Cook County, was also very tolerant with this defendant. 
    However, I felt that he should have been more tolerant. 
    I felt that once this dispute began, he should have taken the opportunity to sit-down with this defendant and explain to him what he was going to do in a conversational tone in chambers, the whole thing would have taken five minutes and not in the heat of argument where the defendant may not be paying attention on what's going on because he wants to preserve his right to represent himself.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What I don't understand is under your theory every other person in that courtroom has to act with demeanor in respect for the court except the defendant. 
    Is that your position?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="3419.181" stopTime="3438.900">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    I think that the defendant also has to conduct himself with respect but you can exclude a spectator from the courtroom without violating the constitutional rights of the defendant but I believe that you cannot do that to the defendant because he has the right -- the defendant was on trial.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3438.900" stopTime="3441.441">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Regardless of what he does.
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="3441.441" stopTime="3466.924">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Regardless of what he does, he has -- if he wants to go to sleep during the trial, that's his right. 
    But if he demands the right to be there, don't exclude him so he can't see what's going on. 
    And if he tries to disrupt the proceedings, don't let him be successful, deal with him, but preserve his right in the event all of a sudden he gets a change of heart that he wants to know what's going on.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3466.924" stopTime="3470.800">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    All your point is it is why he wants to be there.
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="3470.800" stopTime="3483.475">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Well, anytime a defendant is tried, that's all the court really knows it, that is there because you have no knowledge as to what he is doing in his mind whether he is thinking about the baseball game that may be going on next week or something else.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is that your idea of confrontation, he is there bound and gagged?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="3487.608" stopTime="3497.172">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    The constitution does not require that the defendant sit and be alert and pay attention to the trial -- it just requires that he be there so he has the right to confront the witnesses.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3497.172" stopTime="3502.490">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, what's the difference between him sleeping outside and sleeping inside?
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="3502.490" stopTime="3508.695">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Because, if he changes his mind that he wants to pay attention and wants to defend himself he can then do it.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3508.695" stopTime="3510.967">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, he had four chances to change his mind.
speaker="h_reed_harris" startTime="3510.967" stopTime="3669.422">
    Mr. H. Reed Harris 
    Well, no, he was warned once about conducting his trial then that right was denied him. 
    I believe he was just warned twice about his being removed and when he didn't pay attention he was then removed. 
    And I don't think those warnings were sufficient. 
    This is actually a case of first impression; this court has never really ruled on this issue. 
    The case as I cite -- the Hopt, case, the Shields to the Lewis case deal with examination of jurors or jury instruction outside the presence of the defendant and these cases rely on due process of the Fifth Amendment. 
    The Diaz case came out of the Philippines which although the Philippine Government Act had a similar provision as the right of confrontation which was supposedly based on the Sixth Amendment. 
    Diaz expressly waived his right to be present during the trial.One of the reason it was because the trial took several months and they would recess for 30 or 60 days and he has lived way far from the court and it was inconvenient from the Bean (ph) court so we said, "We'll proceed without him, there's only one or two – it's just going to be heard," "my attorney will be there, he can handle it for me." 
    I don't believe that would, what Mr. Justice Cardozo said in Schneider is applicable because that was a case involving whether a defendant had the right to go to a view of a scene with the jury under Massachusetts law that right did not exist although the right exists in most of the jurisdictions. 
    Mr. Justice Cardozo was in the violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because at this time the certain rights out of the Sixth Amendment first time have been said that and incorporated and applied to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The Sixth Amendment historically -- the right of confrontation, it's not clear where it came from. 
    Some people say that some commentators say it comes basically from the evils of the Star Chamber proceedings in England. 
    Others say it stems from the injustice which happened to Sir Walter Raleigh who was tried in 1603 for treason. 
    This in effect was really an early political trial. 
    Queen Elizabeth had died and her successor, I believe was King Charles wasn't pleased with Rollie. 
    Rollie had caused the death of the (Inaudible).

    Mr. Joel M. Flaum 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Just on the two main cases relied upon by the respondent writing in Schneider versus Massachusetts, Mr. Justice Cardozo stated Hopt v. Utah has been distinguished and limited and what was said in Hopt v. Utah under subject of the presence of the defendant was dictum and no more, we may say the same of Lewis versus the United States and if I might state the second on the state of the record Mr. Kelly who was counsel for the defendant below was appointed on October 14th the next proceedings were December 11 in the case. 
    He was granted the right to be co-counsel in his case. 
    It was only when he was disrupted during the voir dire that the judge asked that he let his counsel take over and that's when first right ensued, and leave the court with Justice Stewart. 
    The Court of Appeal's decision can be sustained only by the most slavish reading of the Sixth Amendment. 
    I respectfully ask this Court to reverse.
