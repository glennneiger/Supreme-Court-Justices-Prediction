    513, we'll hear arguments in the matter of Dan A. Spencer. 
    Now as to number 4, Younger against Harris, we'll ask counsel to standby for a while and perhaps at the half break when we're certain that we are going to have this case completed with no emergencies then counsel could be excused at 2:30 if no emergencies arise. 
    Mr. Wulf, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This contempt -- conviction of an attorney is here on appeal from the Louisiana Supreme Court. 
    There -- jurisdiction was postponed pending argument on the merits and there are some jurisdictional problems. 
    Before discussing those, I would like to describe the facts of the conviction itself because of the facts of the conviction also involved some of the jurisdictional problems. 
    The appellant in this case, Mr. Spencer is an attorney, member of the Louisiana Bar who appeared before a Judge Dixon, a District Court judge in the Louisiana courts representing one, Mr. Hopkins in a hearing in a divorce case. 
    It was an uncontested divorce suit and the purpose of the hearing was, according to Louisiana practice, to confirm default in Mr. Hopkins favor. 
    After testimony was taken by -- was given by Mr. Hopkins and witness on his behalf, Judge Dixon denied the divorce because the testimony didn't show abandonment by the spouse but showed only that Mr. Hopkins and Mrs. Hopkins have had argument and that they decided that one of them should leave and Mrs. Hopkins was the one to leave. 
    The following day after the denial of the divorce, the appellant filed a motion for a new trial on behalf of his client Mr. Hopkins on the ground that the decision by Judge Dixon was erroneous in fact and in law. 
    Simultaneously with filing the motion for a new trial, he also filed a motion to recuse Judge Dixon. 
    The motion to recuse which he filed was set out in the back of our brief.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, is it reasonable, can any inferences be drawn as to whether this was some discovery overnight or whether it was a new idea after he learned that he had received an adverse decision?

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Oh, I don't know what one -- I believe that one cannot draw inferences from the record because there isn't anything in the record at all to suggest when this impeachment proceeding was initiated, if it was initiated and was initiated and what the -- what any of the facts surrounding that proceeding were. 
    What if any of the facts are on that petition were but the --

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    We don't know it's true or false, Your Honor. 
    One of the reasons we don't know whether it's true or false is that the judge who sat on the contempt proceeding itself the year later wouldn't allow any such testimony to be entered. 
    Now the record is ambiguous as to whether any such testimony was attempted to be put in by the appellant but it becomes perfectly clear from the statement of Judge Williams himself that he was the judge who sat on the contempt hearing that -- and this is contained in the record of the case and also in the back of the jurisdictional statement. 
    He, Judge Williams in opposing Mr. Spencer's application for writs of certiorari to Louisiana Supreme Court said in and I quote, well, I'm sorry I don't quote, but in his application with -- in his opposition to the application which is in the record, Judge Williams said himself that he refused to admit any such evidence concerning the truth of the assertion in the motion to recuse.

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Well, we do know that there was then a procedure under the Louisiana Constitution, Article 9 of the Constitution which provided that upon the petition of any 25 citizens of the state in which they alleged that a judge was guilty of one of a fairly long list of offenses ranging from high crimes and misdemeanors to habitual drunkenness and including incompetency, corruption, favoritism, extortion, oppression in office, and gross misconduct that upon a filing of a petition with the district attorney by 25 citizens so alleging that the district attorney had to initiate impeachment proceedings.

speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="427.220" stopTime="478.546">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    The motion to recuse contained the following paragraphs. 
    Paragraph 4 and it's set out at page 8 of the appendix, the separate appendix. 
    It says, “The plaintiff herein, Louis B. Hopkins, Jr. and his chief witness in this case, Mr. Charles Anderson, III are presently engaged in the process of attempting to have Judge Dixon removed from office as being unfit therefore by virtue of corruption, favoritism, oppression and misfeasance in office.” 
    And the next paragraph said that because of the -- this activity by Mr. Hopkins that the Judge is therefore interested in the cause and bias, prejudice and harbors personal animosity towards the plaintiff. 
    In the motion to recuse was filed pursuant to a Louisiana statute which permits motions to recuse on allegations that filed.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="478.546" stopTime="492.525">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    At some point, will you develop what could be the nexus or what is the nexus as you see it between the allegations of corruption and the allegations of bias or perhaps indicate?

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Well, --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    If there is none, I'm puzzled by that.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="494.774" stopTime="602.941">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Well, the nexus is that judge inferentially knowing about the motion to impeach about the proceeding to impeach initiated by the plaintiff in the case would necessarily be biased against him on the fair assumption that it certainly isn't something that we're going endear the plaintiff to the judge. 
    That -- and that was the essence of the claim of bias and personal animosity, a fair implication, I would think. 
    This motion to recuse having been filed the judge several days later issued an order for a rule to show cause why appellant, Mr. Spencer what not be held in contempt. 
    And the order is set out in page 10 of the appendix, it's very brief and it says using the language of the Louisiana contempt statute that he did file a pleading which contains scandalous, insulting and abusive language and a relevant criticism of the judge of said court, which pleading is attached hereto and made a part hereof in which language particularly in paragraph 4 which is the paragraph I read relating to the impeachment proceedings thereof, impairs the dignity of the court and the respect for his authority contrary to the law of the State of Louisiana. 
    At that point the appellant here initiated collateral proceedings, United States District Court of Louisiana to enjoin the contempt proceedings. 
    I don't think that's directly relevant now.

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Well, I don't think that this position by Louisiana Supreme Court is particularly -- is directly relevant to whether we properly raised the certiorari issues here as long as we properly raised them in the applications to the Supreme Court of Louisiana for certiorari, the fact that they declined to exercise jurisdiction doesn't denigrate the fact that we properly raised them in the first place.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, the other side of it anyway, what I'm suggesting Mr. Wulf is something about this Louisiana practice that makes that form a disposition on the merits not merely a denial of review where cert would be here but when I used that form for disposition of a petition for a writ as I recall that constitutes also a disposition on the merit that no merit in the points raised.

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    But, in any case I -- if it were a disposition on the merits, obviously the case would be strong. 
    I don't think frankly it's any less weak if it's a discretionary denial because the question isn't whether or not the Louisiana Supreme Court decided it. 
    The question is whether it was presented to them, entertained and rejected either just on -- by denial of certiorari or on the merits.

    Unknown Speaker 
    I know I'm taking it too much of your time and apologize but what other cert issues are there that you think are before us?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="1236.250" stopTime="1355.380">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    These -- the three cert issues which are before us all revolved around the Holt issue and they are that the conviction violates the First Amendment right of courtroom advocacy by an attorney. 
    The whole Holt versus Virginia issue itself that denial of due process because of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and for counsel to plead and the no evidence rule. 
    And frankly all of this, Holt is the centerpiece of these three questions because I think Holt can be looked upon as something of a free speech case. 
    We looked upon as the right of free speech advocacy in the courtroom as Mr. Justices Douglas and Black once referred to in Fisher v. Pace in a dissenting opinion there. 
    So it has been treated or considered to be a First Amendment right. 
    The second issue is the square Holt versus Virginia issue vainly the right of a lawyer on behalf of his client to file relevant pleadings in order to try to secure a floor which is free of bias so that could be either a motion to recuse as in this case or a motion for a change of venue as was the case in Holt. 
    And the last issue is a no evidence issue along the line of Thompson v. Louisville which in fact was one of the grounds in the Holt case although it didn't precisely refer to Thompson v. Louisville in any of its progeny but the Court here did say in Holt that speaking of the convictions for contempt, they rest on nothing whatever except allegations made in motions for change of venue. 
    The -- each of those issues were raised below and are here properly having been raised and preserved below --

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    And grant and deal on with the merits precisely as it would've dealt with the merits of the appeal if the appeal were properly here. 
    And I just might say that with respect to the application for certiorari that this Court has -- not infrequently considered issues of contempt on law -- visited on lawyers by the bench as a very important aspect both of its constitutional duty and as its supervisory duty over the conduct of litigation on the lower federal courts. 
    There have been several dozen contempt cases here in one form or another. 
    And I would suggest that that itself indicates the significance of these kinds of cases where lawyers are held to contempt by the bench and I think that the issue quite apart from that even if there had never been a case of this sort here before that quite apart form that it is an important question on its own merits and does implicate the independence of the bar and raise serious questions about the bar being free from the imposition of arbitrary sanctions by judges and members of the bench. 
    I would just like to concentrate for a moment on the -- on this case in its relationship to Holt versus Virginia. 
    I think that -- looked at in that light, it's a very easy and that it is controlled directly and entirely by Holt versus Virginia. 
    In Holt there are two -- two lawyers were held in contempt for filing a motion for change of venue in that case in which they charged that the judge there “is now in effect and or in fact acting as police officer, chief prosecution witness, adverse witness for the defense, grand jury, chief prosecutor and judge.” 
    And it also charged that the judge had intimidate and harass Attorney Holt at an earlier hearing on the contempt proceeding and the judge thereupon hearing this motion read in open court said, “I think the plea is contemptuous.” 
    And the Virginia Supreme Court held that the language in that motion violated the Virginia contempt statute which authorized summary punishment of a person who “misbehaves” in the presence of a court so as to obstruct justice or uses “vile, contemptuous or insulting language” which is language not unlike that contained in the Louisiana contempt statute.

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    The sole basis for the contempt was this paragraph of the motion to recuse which you must note is not the words of the appellant, the lawyer himself but as merely an assertion by Mr. Spencer that his client, Mr. Hopkins, had initiated a petition for removal of Judge Dixon and that it -- and that that petition was written in terms of corruption, favoritism, oppression and misfeasance. 
    They are not Mr. -- they're not the appellant's words.

    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    There were other attachments to that petition. 
    The Supreme Court of Louisiana has its own rules as to what goes in a petition for certiorari but it does not include everything, it does not include the whole record. 
    It does not include what is printed in the appendix now.

    In fairness to appellant, there was another place other than pointed out in which an issue was raised and we refer to you on page 13 of the appendix.

    In Article 4 of his response to the rule, you said, in further defense of the rule, respondent place the truth of all the charges against Judge Dixon on the motion to recuse. 
    The hearing above describe expressions by respondent are constitutionality protected exercise of free speech. 
    That's the only other point than those pointed out by appellant that any constitutional issue was raised and I do not believe that they have been adequately raised below. 
    No, sir. 
    We would proceed then assuming that this Court had jurisdiction, first I would like to mention the statement of the case, appellant claimed in his first jurisdictional statement that he was denied the right to introduce testimony concerning the proof, the charge -- the truth of the charges made against Judge Dixon. 
    We refer the court to appendix, page 22. 
    We have a full transcript of the hearing on contempt. 
    Appellant was not denied the right to introduce any covered evidence other than evidence of testimony of the co-judges of Judge Dixon in an attempt to inquire into the motive of Judge Dixon for filing the contempt. 
    Appellant was asked by Judge Williams, “Have you anything else to offer?” 
    Appellant said, “No.” 
    At no time has appellant attempted to introduce any evidence. 
    At no time has he been denied a constitutional right.

    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    He starts out with (Voice Overlap) saying I do not think there is any other party in interest other than the official body of the court as I see it which is in the middle of page 14. 
    Which is what every contempt case is and I think that Judge Williams has done nothing more than say that. 
    That's what Sacher was. 
    That was sustained by this Court. 
    That's what Terry was cited in our brief. 
    That was sustained by this Court that came out of Texas. 
    That's what every direct contempt is. 
    It was only in the rare instance that you have an out of court contempt with proof elements that a court calls on counsel. 
    Now, throughout the nation, I don't know of any general practice of a court calling on counsel to handle direct contempts. 
    Certainly in no reported decision of this Court has that been the case that I have ever been able to find in a direct contempt case. 
    I have noticed an order from this Court doing it, yes sir in a contempt citation.

    The ruling was correct but the attorney didn't like it. 
    So the attorney wanted to try again before anther judge.

    You have omitted the essential fact and that is you judge are aware that my client thinks you are corrupt.

speaker="neil_dixon" startTime="2817.209" stopTime="2861.445">
    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    Well, let me back up. 
    The corruption is unnecessary to the first charge, is unnecessary to the plea. 
    All he has to say is, I have filed a motion for your -- or my clients are seeking your removal and I've filed a petition for your removal. 
    He never has to repeat the allegation corruption anywhere in order to achieve his ends, that is obtain the recusation. 
    Anytime he uses the word corruption under our pleading he is using a word that is irrelevant to his pleading and is irrelevant -- criticism of a trial judge.

    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    I don't think so Your Honor.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2865.911" stopTime="2867.495">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Yes, that's right.
speaker="neil_dixon" startTime="2867.495" stopTime="2907.675">
    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    And I would say this, there's talk in the brief about it being a lawyerlike language. 
    It is no more lawyerlike than to file a motion before a court saying the court should recuse itself because it's guilty of murder, burglary, rape or what have you. 
    All of these terms are lawyerlike when used in the proper context, every one of them. 
    But words that a lawyer uses in one case may not be appropriate to another case. 
    And the appropriateness of the charge is the one foundation and we submit the only foundation laid down by this Court in Holt versus Virginia, appellant has --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2907.675" stopTime="2920.550">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Did I understand you correctly that if he had said that you know that my client has publicly charged you with corruption that would be alright?
speaker="neil_dixon" startTime="2920.550" stopTime="2935.869">
    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    I think, Your Honor you -- if we take that exact quotation that you used and nothing more. 
    I think that it could be. 
    You know that my client has charged you with you corruption. 
    Now we have here a different circumstances, we say --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2935.869" stopTime="2936.429">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Yes but (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="neil_dixon" startTime="2936.429" stopTime="2945.565">
    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    -- we say, filed a -- or attempting to remove you from office but just limited to the words that you used. 
    Mr. Justice, I think that it could not be contempt.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2945.565" stopTime="2955.022">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Oh, you mean that he has filed a petition to remove him from office because he charges you with being corrupt. 
    That would be alright?
speaker="neil_dixon" startTime="2955.022" stopTime="3103.091">
    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    I do not know that it would be alright. 
    We do not have that issue but I do not think it would be alright because then the word corrupt is unnecessary to the pleading. 
    In your first time with it the word was necessary to the pleading. 
    Here it is, is not necessary. 
    The standard that this Court said in Holt -- set in Holt versus Virginia was whether or not the language was appropriate, the wording by this Court was wholly appropriate to the charge made. 
    Now we submit that our read -- in our reading of Holt versus Virginia, this Court does not reach or come close to reaching a free speech issue and that Holt versus Virginia cannot be relied on as ever having raised a free speech issue. 
    Holt versus Virginia dealt with a very basic, basic right, our right which Louisiana grants by statute and that is the right of a litigant to a trial before a fair tribunal. 
    For attempting to exercise that right in Virginia, Mr. Holt was cited for contempt. 
    Louisiana spells out the methods of exercising that right. 
    We have such things as motions for recusal. 
    We have motions for change of venue. 
    In Holt versus Virginia, the language wasn't a change of venue. 
    I would urge that your -- that Your Honors review the language used in Holt and compare it with the language used by Mr. Spencer. 
    The language used in Holt is quoted in appellants brief on page 13 and 14 and we submit is -- takes it entirely out of the realm of with what we are dealing with in the instant case. 
    The charge made in Holt was entirely appropriate to a charge of bias. 
    The strongest language used in Holt versus Virginia that could have possibly been considered as impinging upon the sensitivities of the trial judge was that the trial had been intimidating counsel. 
    But now that allegation under certain circumstances might be contempt. 
    But it could never be direct contempt when filed in a petition to recuse. 
    If a judge has been intimidating counsel, counsel is entitled to have the judge recuse.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    In the appendix.
speaker="neil_dixon" startTime="3139.633" stopTime="3258.910">
    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    Your Honor first, I would not limit it to the -- to one group of words in the motion because the order of contempt does not so limit it. 
    The order of contempt refers to the petition as a whole and then says particularly Article 4 thereof on pages 8 and 9 in which the words are repeated, corruption, favoritism, oppression and misfeasance in office. 
    The -- at the very top of page 9, corruption, favoritism, oppression and misfeasance in office. 
    These words are also conclusion, words of conclusion. 
    I mention before we are a fact-pleading state not an issue-pleading state. 
    There is no allegation in this motion connecting any corruption, favoritism, oppression or misfeasance with the trial of the separation suit then pending before the court. 
    These words do not have to be contempt if under some wild set of facts. 
    A -- the corruption of a judge has some connexity with the litigation pending before it. 
    But absent such connexity which we submit that these words are in of themselves offensive and the word offensive again is the word of this Court in Holt versus Virginia. 
    In Holt versus Virginia, they said the words of counsel are not offensive in and of themselves. 
    We submit that with these words as here used are offensive in and of themselves. 
    The fact that a word may be contained in a statute or a constitution does not mean that within all context it cannot be offensive in and of itself. 
    The fact that favoritism, corruption, murder and rape may be all statutory words does not mean that they cannot be words if used in a charge against a judge that are offensive in and of themselves.

    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    They have certainly did not made that statement in court, Your Honor.

    To my knowledge they did not. 
    May I point this out Your Honor, it takes but 25 irate litigants within a large metropolitan area to file a mandatory petition for removal with the Attorney General. 
    Such a petition was never filed.

    Only to this extent. 
    We argue it Your Honor to this extent only.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But here is a statement made and I judge that what you say, that is the basis of the conviction. 
    Now, does the record show that that statement was not true whether we just have to infer it.
speaker="neil_dixon" startTime="3456.730" stopTime="3509.591">
    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    It depends on what the line between inference and showing. 
    My view is that it shows -- I think your view would be that it infers it, Your Honor. 
    It infers it only that it no time in either the federal court proceeding which is fully reported we might add. 
    Or in this proceeding, the trial of which took place about 18 months after the occurrence. 
    Was there ever again any mention of the existence of such a petition? 
    During the federal court litigation with the intending -- with the attendant ill-publicity Judge Dixon was elected by the voters of his district to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, hardly an event consistent with an action for his removal for corruption, favoritism oppression and misfeasance in office.

    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    Mr. Spencer subpoenaed the three co-judges or four co-judges of Judge Dixon.

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3592.609" stopTime="3596.205">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I thought the court refused to let them ask any questions?

    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    To ask them the questions he's -- he was given the opportunity Your Honor. 
    Judge Williams said, “What do you want to prove by it, Mr. Spencer?” 
    He said, “Here's what I want to prove by them.” 
    The judge says, “That is not admissible. 
    Mr. Spencer, have you anything else to offer?”

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What was it he said he wanted to prove by?
speaker="neil_dixon" startTime="3611.875" stopTime="3662.331">
    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    He wanted prove that Judge Dixon had filed -- had conferred with them and filed a contempt charge without any expectation of obtaining a conviction. 
    He had had to make that condition across the street, in the federal court to bring it -- to get him a three-judge court. 
    And that he wanted to file -- he said something vaguely about his long disputation between himself and Judge Dixon. 
    Part of which is reported in the -- its not rather reported but a case that arose out of it was Spencer versus Dixon to the Louisiana Supreme Court in which the Louisiana Supreme Court held Mr. Spencer in contempt for the same situation for having called the Louisiana Supreme Court corrupt.”

    Mr. Neil Dixon 
    At no time did he put on any and there's no time once he denied the right to put on any. 
    And the last fact we submit is the significant fact that removes this from all of the constitutional issues raised by appellant.

   Rebuttal of Melvin L. Wulf
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3686.218" stopTime="3711.608">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Wulf, your time is up but I'd like to ask you a question and if you please confine yourself just to answering questions of any members of the court at this stage. 
    Do you claim that in this record anywhere, there is evidence of the filing of the kind of petition that was alluded to in paragraphs 4, 5, 6, or 7 or any other part of that petition which created all this problem?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3711.608" stopTime="3713.961">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Nothing whatsoever one way or the other?
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3713.961" stopTime="3714.791">
    Unknown Speaker 
    In the record?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3714.791" stopTime="3757.784">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    In the record. 
    However, Mr. Spencer did assert over and over again that he had been denied the right to file any evidence -- to produce any evidence of that petition having been filed. 
    And as I read on my principal presentation, Judge Williams himself in his opposition to the appellant's application for writs in the Louisiana Supreme Court, and you'll find this at page 21 of the jurisdictional statement. 
    He says, this is Judge Williams who was on the hearing, he said, “Applicant in his petition, page 5, paragraph (e), section 5, assigns this error, the trial court not allowing a defense of truth to the contempt charge.”

    What page?

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Page 21 of the jurisdictional statement which reproduces beginning at page 16, Judge Williams' response to the application for writs of certiorari in the Louisiana Supreme Court. 
    That at page 21, I just read the first sentence, the second sentence says, Judge William, and this is Judge William himself speaking in the third person. 
    Judge William refused to admit any such evidence. 
    And then he goes on to cite a case, Getro v. Getro (ph) in Louisiana Supreme Court which held in 1952, the justification is not a defense for contempt of court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3801.903" stopTime="3811.434">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You don't suggest that when -- that that's statement refers to the kind of a petition that we're talking about in the question I put to you.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3811.434" stopTime="3822.308">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Though this statement refers to the appe -- to Mr. Spencer's efforts to establish that such a petition was actually being circulated.

    And I can't read it that way?

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Well, that's why I read it. 
    The science is error. 
    The trial court --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3826.664" stopTime="3834.550">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That can relate only to the judge's refusal to let the four judges testify on the grounds that you said it --

    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    No, all of --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3836.011" stopTime="3877.335">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And if you look on page 21 of your appendix, you'll see that Judge Williams asked him whether there was anything else he had to offer and said at the top of page 21, the court feels, he will be glad to see what you have to offer. 
    And he said, he couldn't find it for a few minutes. 
    The judge gave him a recess for five minutes. 
    And all he came back with after the five minute recess was that he would like to point out some further cases, some citations, not facts, not documents, not reference to any kind of a petition that supported his statement in paragraph 4 or 5?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3877.335" stopTime="3887.400">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    Yes. 
    I don't disagree with that at all though the witness says he tried to bring back at that time had no relevancy at all to the existence or non-existence of such a petition.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I'd like to ask you a further question in view of the colloquy with your adversary, Mr. Dixon here, would you care to comment on his statement that you said was going outside the record that in fact, no petition under the section has ever been filed.
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3904.128" stopTime="3932.918">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf 
    All I can say as I was told that such a petition was circulated was drawn up and circulated. 
    It may not have been filed. 
    They may not have been able to secure the necessary 25 signatures. 
    But that isn't the -- that isn't the assertion in the motion to recuse. 
    It isn't that it was filed. 
    It was said that they're presently engaged in the process of attempting to have Judge Dixon removed, the implication being that they were trying to get the necessary 25 signatures. 
    But I'm told that such a petition was typed up and was in existence.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3932.918" stopTime="3941.172">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Don't you think it was incumbent on Mr. Spencer at some time to produce that and put it on the record so that you could have it here?
speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="3941.172" stopTime="3946.910">
    Mr. Melvin L. Wulf

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I can't see how it's possible to read Judge Williams statement as meaning what you say it means but only relating to the testimony of the four judges which he excluded on the ground that the justification was not admissible evidence. 
    But if any such document, if you wish to supplement this record, I think we would invite you to supplement the record in that regard.
