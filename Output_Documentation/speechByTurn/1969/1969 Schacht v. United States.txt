Schacht v. United States
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="49.852">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear 628, Schacht against the United States. 
    Mr. Berg, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="49.852" stopTime="131.966">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court. 
    The petitioner's case arises out of his conviction under Title 18, United States code 702, which prohibits impertinent part being authorized to wearing of distinctive parts of arm forces uniform are parts similar to distinctive parts of the armed forces uniform. 
    The appendix to our brief sets out the statutes in total. 
    The conduct that the defendant at the trial below engaged in was his taking part in a Vietnamese protest. 
    The protest took place in front of the Army Induction Center in Houston Texas on December 4, 1967. 
    The petitioner was wearing as part of the protest, parts of a military uniform. 
    His part in the protest was to discord a water gun filled with red ink at someone dressed as a Viet Cong. 
    The Viet Cong would fall. 
    He would run, shouting “Be an able American” to the fallen Viet Cong and say “My God, this is a pregnant woman.” 
    After his performance a few hours later, he was arrested tried, convicted on the charge that I've set out before. 
    His sentence was six months to be served and a $250.00 fine. 
    The case was appealed to the Fifth Circuit of Appeals which affirmed the conviction and the Supreme Court granted cert on December 15, 1969.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Has he served his present sentence?
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="133.892" stopTime="139.652">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    No sir, he has not.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="139.652" stopTime="141.870">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    He hasn't served any part of it, this --
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="141.870" stopTime="202.264">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Well, in avertedly, he did. 
    The petition was filed out of time. 
    He was committed for three weeks. 
    We lodged a motion for leave to submit out of time which was granted. 
    He was released from prison. 
    It is our contention that Daniel Schacht engaged in symbolic speech by wearing parts of a military uniform during the skit. 
    We feel that the Court's first inquiry must be made on the basis of the holding of the O'Brien decision that Draft Card Burning case. 
    That case held if we understand it correctly that there are certain areas of freedom of speech which the government may impinge upon if there's a clear and compelling interest of the government to be protected by the regulation that it seeks to enforce. 
    It is our contention in this case that there is no compelling governmental interest in regulating the wearing of distinctive parts or parts similar to distinctive parts of an Armed Forces uniform.

    The trial judge instructed on the matter, --

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Yes. 
    --that he told the jury that if they file it, it was —within the statutory exception, they should acquit him?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, so you did get the benefit of that instruction, did you?

    Yes, we did, at the trial—

    You say rightly, the government says wrongly although you're not telling us that it was at the government requests?

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    That's correct.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I still, I'm sorry. 
    I still don't follow you. 
    If you're right on the -- that you're not with -- that you're within the exception under the statute then I don't understand you, why would it be a constitutional question?
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="286.693" stopTime="301.114">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Because the statutory scheme graded by the exception itself is unconstitutional. 
    We feel that the government -- by that I mean that the constitutional scheme is one which punishes one --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="301.114" stopTime="305.123">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, but if this is a prosecution that is for violating a statute?
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="305.123" stopTime="305.621">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="305.621" stopTime="311.835">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And it's a statute which says it can't be any prosecution if you fall within an exception, is that right?

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="312.121" stopTime="317.037">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And if you fall within the exception, why isn't that the end of the case, you couldn't be prosecuted, you couldn't be convicted?
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="317.037" stopTime="326.476">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Well, in this instance, he was granted the -- he was given a submission on that issue. 
    The jury nonetheless found him guilty and we say that the entire statute is unconstitutional.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="326.476" stopTime="332.651">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, so you're up against a jury finding that that you're not within the exception?

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    No sir that we can't tell from the case either.

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    That's correct, under the holding of a straight case. 
    We don't know why this man was convicted. 
    We don't know whether he was in a play or he was in a play that discredited it?

    Yeah, well, --

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Someone wearing distinctive parts and if that be the case then that part -- we feel that part of the exception is clearly is unconstitutional.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="355.787" stopTime="358.033">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I gather the facts are not in dispute, are they?

    No sir, for the most part--

    Well, I suppose -- suppose we were to feel that on the basis of the facts there was no issue for the jury? 
    Of the investigation?
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="365.871" stopTime="368.725">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    If there is no issue for the jury on the basis of the fact--
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="368.725" stopTime="368.994">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That should fall within the exception?

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    -- as with the exception.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="370.135" stopTime="370.376">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yeah.
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="370.376" stopTime="373.695">
    Mr. David H. Berg

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I get it nice, but if we can decide that it has come within the exception, that's the end of the case, isn't it if your man is off?

    Mr. David H. Berg

    It did go to the jury.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="404.647" stopTime="406.522">

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Unless I misunderstand sir, it did go to the jury?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Alright.
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="417.882" stopTime="439.829">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Under the holding of the O'Brien decision, it's our contention whether or not he's entitled to an instruction on the statutory -- the exception to the main statute. 
    The government has exhibited no compelling interest in controlling whether or not one may wear distinctive parts of Armed Forces uniform or part similar to distinctive parts.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="439.829" stopTime="463.566">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    When -- sorry to interrupt you again Mr. Berg but when you told that my brother Brennan that there was no substantial dispute as to the facts in this case, does that mean that you do concede that your client was wearing the uniform or a distinctive part thereof of any of the Armed Forces of the United States?
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="463.566" stopTime="471.471">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Mr. Justice Stewart I would concede only that he had on parts of a military uniform but not characterize it, it was distinctive.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="471.471" stopTime="482.613">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, it has to be, that either as I read it, it has to be the uniform which I suppose would mean the complete uniform or a distinctive part thereof, isn't that what the statute said?

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Yes, yes sir.

    Well, one of the questions we raised sir is that we don't know what word distinctive part means and we don't know whether --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="495.251" stopTime="503.618">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I suppose khaki colored socks for instance would not be a distinctive part of the army uniform, although soldiers do wear khaki colored socks.

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Yes sir.

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    It doesn't to -- excuse me sir, it doesn't really matter to us if we want to characterize it as having worn a distinctive part, our point we feel is still the same. 
    That the --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I'm not sure -- I'm not sure that I understand you because -- and I'm not sure whether -- that I understand whether you do or whether you don't concede that the dress, the garment in which the petitioner was dressed at this time was within the statutory definition?
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="542.953" stopTime="549.507">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Well, if I understand the question correctly, the question is whether or not the fact is in dispute that he was wearing a distinctive part of the uniform.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="549.507" stopTime="555.875">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The uniform or a distinctive part of there. 
    That's what the statute says and if he wasn't of course he wasn't covered by the statute at all.
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="555.875" stopTime="568.756">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Alright, and it's our contention that that's one of the problems of the statute. 
    We have no way of telling sir whether or not he was wearing a distinctive part. 
    If he wasn't then he's not guilty to begin with. 
    If he was, then we still have problems with the statute.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="568.756" stopTime="571.287">

    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="572.701" stopTime="577.033">

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Your Honor, from the verdict that was returned, we can only assume that--
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="579.887" stopTime="583.835">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But there wasn't any evidence at all or whatsoever that he was wearing an entire uniform?

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    No. 
    But we don't know that they didn't convict him on these grounds that he was wearing a similar part, a part similar to a distinctive part.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="589.468" stopTime="593.931">
    Justice Potter Stewart

speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="648.337" stopTime="732.579">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Yes sir. 
    The government would seek to tell us to justify the imposition or the impingement of Daniel Schachts. 
    First Amendment rights, the right to where this parts of the uniform on the basis that government has some sort of overwhelming interest in regulating this wearing. 
    It's our contention from the facts of the trial that the government in fact sells the jobbers all over the nation, the parts of the uniform which later end up in the hands of the people who wear it. 
    This Court might take note of the fact that the army jacket is worn by many people, the army raincoat. 
    Parts that look similar, two parts of an army uniform are widespread worn by young people especially by young people. 
    And if the interest in regulating this wearing was so overwhelming, then it would appear to us that the government would not sell on a wholesale basis to jobbers across the nation. 
    If there is a government interest in the distinctive wearing, they simply have it sought to it to assert that interest. 
    We have been unable to find very many cases under the statutes where convictions at least have occurred under 18702. 
    In fact, four since 1940 and I believe the statute in one form or another has been in the book since 1960. 
    Of course --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What should we draw from that, that the government has been negligent in enforcing this statute or just what's your point?
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="739.993" stopTime="745.299">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Our point, my point that there's some evidence the government is not interested enforcing the statute.

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    In this particular case, we feel it's evidence of the government's lack of a compelling interest in impinging his First Amendment, in regulating the wear and therefore impinging his rights, constitutional rights.

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    I believe that there is a penalty for personating an officer that applies to civilian just for making a meal ticket of the uniform one way or another. 
    I raise briefly the question of the vagueness of the statute. 
    We feel that if the Court should find that there is some compelling interest in regulating the wearing of the distinctive parts of the uniform, that there is still a question under the statute, 18702 as to what authority -- authorized means under the statute to whom does one turn for authority and concomitant questions of what exactly -- what authority -- under what conditions authority will be granted. 
    We don't know what similar two distinctive parts mean. 
    It's hard to tell that would apply to a woman wearing a khaki dress with epaulets on it and is this current fashionable. 
    At the trial, Danny sought to rely on 10 U.S.C 772 at the exception to statute in the Maine. 
    The government says that he was not entitled to a submission on this issue and we say that he was. 
    We say that even if we accept the government -- the government's definition of what a theatrical production is, he may still be entitled to the submission of the issue that the trial judge, the United States District Attorney and the Fifth Circuit, Court of Appeal saw no problem with the submission of this issue. 
    At the very minimum, we feel the issue was raised by the facts of the trial.

    Going back to your point for a moment to -- about the compelling interest, I don't recall many events on but I don't recall in the last 14 years any frequency of prosecutions for impersonating a federal agent.

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    There's nothing in the evidence to indicate which way, but we feel that's not -- that that wouldn't be a question in the case because one could still fall within the proscription of the statute by wearing parts -- that are distinctive parts of the uniform. 
    This is of course, the first time -- the point I was -- I had raised before as to the constitutionality of -- or I was -- I would like to raise the question, the constitutionality of the statute under which the defendant was forced to defend. 
    If it can be agreed that he was entitled at least to a submission to the jury on the issue, then we must deal with the exception which says that one may wear distinctive parts in a play so long as that portrayal does not tend to discredit the armed force portray. 
    We feel that the words tend to discredit are unconstitutional at least on two and possibly three grounds. 
    One, there is a grant of power, a privilege to act in a play under the statute. 
    And then it's unconstitutionally conditioned on the substance of what's in the play. 
    We feel secondly that the play itself -- that one engaged in criticism of the government, is constitutionally protected and thus the effect, the net effect of this portion of the statute, of the exception of the statute is to Schacht's First Amendment freedom. 
    One really doesn't know exactly what he can say or what he can do under the prescription of the exception. 
    Finally, of course we don't understand exactly what the words tend to discredit mean anyway. 
    Tend to discredit is possibly as vague as words could be -- when words are being prohibited. 
    We are left then if we can accept the unconstitutional, the exception to the exception of being unconstitutional. 
    We are left simply with 18 U.S.C 702 and as an exception which says one may wear these parts in a play, and what does this leave us with. 
    We are left with the question of what theatrical, a motion picture production actually means. 
    And the only way to purchase certainty in this area is to go ahead and appear in what you think is a motion picture, a theatrical production and see if you're brought the trial if you're wearing a symbolic -- if you're wearing as in Danny's case parts of an Armed Forces uniform. 
    The vagueness contained therein is offensive to the Fifth and First Amendment, the Schacht's First Amendment rights and what it actually does is grant a license to whomever is in charge of bringing -- of bringing charges, it give a license to them, an official of the government to bring charges in cases where he doesn't agree with what is being said in a play or if – and he can use the vagueness of the word production to justify the imposition of this charge. 
    We judged briefly before on considerations of the verdict itself, the general verdict. 
    And the first consideration is whether or not we can tell under the exception itself, if we can agree that the exception should have been submitted why petitioner was convicted. 
    He was either convicted because first, he was wearing parts of the uniform. 
    And secondly, because he was either in a play that discredited in which case we feel he should have been acquitted or he was not in a play at all in which case we feel the holding of the street case would at least compel a reversal on this man.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Any history relevant that you could find --
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="1175.723" stopTime="1283.427">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    The only history that I've seen was in testimony that was introduced by the government in its brief which said that there was no intention to subsequently change the law. 
    If this Court were to find that the statute is constitutional on its face that petitioner Schacht was in fact -- and that petitioner Schacht was in fact not entitled to a submission on the issue that it was applied on the basis of the constitutional law by the virtue of the acts that he performed. 
    We still say that the application of this law to Schacht denied him certain fundamental freedom of speech. 
    There is evidence, a widespread wearing of the uniform. 
    There is evidence and we asked the Court to again to take judicial notice that after he's constantly, not only discredit but ridiculed the armed force that they seek to portray. 
    Dr. Strangelove is a good example of that. 
    We again point to the fact of lack of prosecution of under the statute that the fact that Danny Schacht was strangely taking part in a protest against the war in Vietnam when the law was suddenly applied to him. 
    We ask the Court to read the record and check the vindictiveness of the United States District attorney's closing argument. 
    -- Or the defendant was entitled to that offense then we would take it and run, be very happy with it. 
    The point that I wanted to make was that our defendant at the trial admitted that he intended to discredit the uniform he was wearing.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1283.427" stopTime="1286.765">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Did you know what he was wearing?
speaker="david_h_berg" startTime="1286.765" stopTime="1520.601">
    Mr. David H. Berg 
    Well he -- that of course -- with that of course is the point is to whether he was entitled to a submission, but at least he admitted that point and I was -- in my point that we -- I would ask this Court to find that that part was unconstitutional. 
    If in fact the Court does find that the words tend to discredit are unconstitutional, again, we are left with Title 18 which grants an exception in instances of plays in which one is wearing distinctive parts of the uniform. 
    There are pages and pages in the transcript which exemplify the prosecuting attorney, the defense lawyer and the judges' confusion over exactly what production means. 
    Nobody knows exactly what it means within the framework of the statute and they finally decide on the Webster dictionary definition. 
    Of course, if there -- if this kind of confusion exists for lawyers and for the judge at the trial, think of the kind of burden that imposes on anyone trying to make a good faith effort to ascertain under the statute whether or not he's going to be in a motion picture or theatrical production. 
    We say the statute fails for this reason. 
    This presents a chilling affect on First Amendment rights. 
    One must step back and just fail to exercise the right to free speech, to act in a play because you don't know whether or not you're accepted under the statute. 
    But more importantly to us, it presents an opportunity to any government official who has the opportunity to bring charges under the statute based on what he feels is a violation of the act and in cases where he doesn't feel that the production can be proved by the defendant. 
    What this means to us is that defendant Schacht was tried under statute that's seldom used. 
    Although there is widespread disuse of -- although there is widespread wearing of distinctive parts of the uniform, of parts similar to distinctive parts of the uniform. 
    He wore it in a part of the country in which dissent is not very popular. 
    We feel that the law was unconstitutionally applied to him for the sole purpose of punishing his participation in the act, any Vietnam War skit. 
    There are record references which support this contention, very short. 
    The defense attorney 209 -- the prosecuting attorney at 209 says, if the Court please, in our original charge we found with the Court, we did provide a separate charge. 
    We feel that the defendants were entitled to a charge with respect to the defense and if I may present this to the Court now. 
    The -- Mr. 2406, the defense attorney says, “Excuse me, you have the word betrayal. 
    We are getting kind of bad aren't we instead of portrayal.” 
    Mr. K, the prosecuting attorney says, “Excuse me, we have betrayal.” 
    The Court -- some people might view it as a betrayal. 
    What about the definition of those terms? 
    In the closing argument at 382, Mr. Hartman for the US government in indicating the view point, indicating the view point of this office about this sort of thing that Danny engaged in. 
    If it pleases the Court ladies and gentlemen, the only thing I gather with the argument of these defendants, they are displeased with the government and the war, but I have a single answer to that. 
    There's a plane and a boat leaving, two or three times a day for other parts of the world. 
    I could probably name you gentlemen the place to go. 
    You can leave anytime if you don't like and then you stop. 
    At 384 he says, if he referring to the defendants, comes to my house and expresses himself like this, he will not be able to walk into this Court room and be tried again. 
    And I say to you, there are many others likely. 
    I don't to rub shoulders with these two, do you? 
    We say that this is clear evidence that what we have here is not a case involving simply the wearing of distinctive parts of the uniform. 
    This case involves suppression of my client's right of free speech.

    In conclusion, we would say, having addressed ourselves we believe to the legal questions involved in this case that there is a question of social concern here. 
    We feel that the imposition of this sentence on Danny Schacht represents a certain breech of faith with young people attempting to protest certain things they feel that are wrong, certain things they feel must be rectified. 
    This Court has a perfect opportunity to rectify that situation and to correct a breach of faith that was promulgated not on the fact that Danny Schacht was wearing parts of the uniform, but on the fact that Danny Schacht dare to engage in a dissent gainst the war in Vietnam.

    Mr. David H. Berg 
    I would address myself to that point just briefly Your Honor. 
    We feel that the jurisdictional question as we understand it raised by the government is answered and the delegation of power to this Court was unrestricted. 
    No restriction placed on it, was placed on it by itself. 
    The Court in effect has said, we'll place a restriction of 30 days, and the power to make that rule being unrestricted, we feel that the Court has a right to abrogate that rule. 
    Further, there's another contention -- I hope, I'm understanding it correctly, there's another contention in the petition -- in the government's brief that in the cases where this Court has waived the rule and I think specifically the Hulson case, the government didn't submit a brief and therefore it's not bound by its holding. 
    As we understand this contention, we feel that you've failed, it's unsound and that it's the business of the Court to raise the question of jurisdiction itself and having considered that point made its ruling, we don't see any difference whether the full submission was made by the government or not?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1667.740" stopTime="1675.988">

   Argument of Erwin N. Griswold
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1776.719" stopTime="1782.032">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Solicitor General.
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="1782.032" stopTime="2069.625">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    May it please that Court. 
    I will direct myself first to the jurisdictional question which has been raised in the government's brief. 
    When I first came to my present office some time ago, I was rather surprised to find occasional briefs coming across my desk in which it said the petition was filed out of time. 
    Nevertheless, there is no reason for granting certiorari and then going on to argue the question of certiorari. 
    I raised the question with my associates and they said, “Oh, it's not jurisdictional.” 
    And I was puzzled by that, but there are lots of things that I find puzzling and don't always find answers to. 
    And I went along and noticed those cases continuing until this case came when the Court granted certiorari 131 days after the judgment of the Court below and I couldn't see any reason why if they could grant it a 131 days, it couldn't be granted at 1131 days or at anytime and I asked my associate Mr. Connelly to look into it and we dug into it rather thoroughly and I will endeavor to summarize here what we found in looking into it. 
    Of course there was originally the basic statute of 1925 which provided a period of three months for certiorari with respect to all types of judgments with a power in the Court to or a justice at the Court to extend that for 60 days on an application made within the three months period. 
    And then in 1933, Congress authorized the Court by a statute which says that the Court shall have the power to prescribe and I think prescribe has some significance. 
    From time to time, rules of practice and I think rules has some significance and by an amendment made in 1934, it was provided that the rules made as here in authorized may prescribe the times for and manner of taking appeals and applying for writs of certiorari. 
    And the committee reports at that time read in a way which sounds contemporary. 
    Existing rules of the United States, District Courts and Circuit Court of Appeals tend themselves to delay. 
    Many cases and all pending in the Federal Courts for months and even years have elapsed since the verdict of guilty. 
    And the cases have not been finally disposed of in the United States, Circuit Courts of Appeals and the accused have been at large on bail. 
    Nothing tends more to discredit the administration of criminal justice than such delays. 
    There was an article by Professor Orfield who had been a member of the advisory committee on the criminal rules which referred to the time limits in rule 11, which was adopted in Roman XI in 1934 and which fixed a single period of 30 days referred to that as jurisdictional. 
    And then the next thing that happened was that rather to my surprise and due to the very careful work of Mr. Connelly, we find that the very question was decided by the Court in United States ex rel. Coy against the United States 316 U. S 342 where a petition for certiorari was filed more than 30 days after the judgment, and the Court said on page 344, the petition for certiorari was filed too late and we are without jurisdiction.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    And the Court also referred in the Coy opinion saying “Since the purpose in adopting the rules was to expedite criminal appeals and it seems rather odd that the nod effect in this case has been a very substantial delay over the time that would have been involved where the rules not in force. 
    Now, since 1934 when rule 11 was first adopted, the rules have gone through various changes. 
    In 1946, the language was changed from shall to may and someone might think that “Well, that's just permissive and that means it isn't really binding” it says beginning in 1946, it said “Maybe made within 30 days”. 
    Another change was made in 1946 which was to grant authority to a Justice of the Court to extend the time not exceeding 30 days. 
    If the application was made “Within the 30 day period following judgment” and the advisory committee at that time in its notes said “This rule continues existing law, except that it grants to the Supreme Court or a Justice thereof the authority to extend the time." 
    And of course, the existing law included not only the text to the rule but also this Court's decision in the Coy case. 
    And at other places in the notes to the preliminary draft of the rules of 1946, of the Coy case is cited so that it was not overlooked and this Court several times in per curiam decisions, denying petition cited the Coy case. 
    The next case we have is United States against Smith. 
    Smith being a District Judge, there haven't been an application for Mandamus against him which the Court of Appeals had refused and this was certiorari to this Court to review the Court of Appeals refusal. 
    Judge Smith had granted a new trial long after the five days, put in the rule, he tempted to justify it on the grounds that he had done it sue sponte, that the rule simply said that application must be made within 5 days but it said nothing about what the judge did himself. 
    But this Court reversed the Court of Appeals. 
    I may point out too that this rule with respect to appeal also contain the may language which was introduced in 1946 both with respect to appeals and with respect to certiorari.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    The Court held that mandamus should have been granted to require the district judge to revoke its order granting a new trial. 
    And there's very interesting language in the opinion and relevant language and I quote “The rules in abolishing the term rule did not substitute indefiniteness, the policy of the rules was not to extend power indefinitely but to confine it within constant time limits” and otherwise said Mr. Justice Jackson in a phrase what seems to me to be very relevant here. 
    Otherwise, the power lingers on indefinitely and that is what we are currently confronted with, with the situation as it now stands. 
    Now, in 1954, the relevant rules were transferred to the rules of this Court. 
    On rule 22, paragraph 2 and that's where they are now. 
    But I suggest that the power to prescribe them is not derived from some inherent judicial power of this Court to manage its own business. 
    But is still derived from the Acts of 1933 and 1934 or since things have since been codified, it is not actually 18 United States code Section 3772 which carries forward in virtually identical language, the provisions of the Acts of 1933 and '34.

    Mr. Solicitor General may I ask you a question.

    That's what I thought.
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2480.141" stopTime="2575.733">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    But under the rule the Court has no jurisdiction after the time or the time as extended by an application made within time not to exceed 30 days has expired, thus the course would be entirely without prejudice to the Court by an exercise of the rule making power to provide as it has and in rule 4A of the appellate rules the Court, the rules of appellate procedure, the Court has provided that upon showing of excusable neglect the District Court may extend the time for filing the notice of appeal by any party for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by the subdivision. 
    And I would say, I don't want to pass upon it now because there maybe arguments in various way but would seem to me to be entirely appropriate for the Court to provide by rule with a fixed time limit for an extension of time even though it is not sought within the time. 
    It is the unlimited open --

    Some state criminal appeals, some federal ones, indeed I'm putting this case called Robison against United States in 390 U. S, I confessed error in the case in which the petition was filed one or two days late. 
    I may say at that time I was aware of it but one or two days didn't upset me but a 131 days, I found a rather large order and I did find the Coy case which seems to me to have decided the question and my suggestion is that in these other cases the Court has slipped or fallen or drifted or lapsed into it an error without ever having focused on the relevant materials which I am trying to present to the Court now.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Going back to this rule Mr. Solicitor General, once adopted, is it your position that has the same course as the statute in the civil cases?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2902.703" stopTime="2931.386">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Yes Mr. Justice, my position is thought the Court has the power to change the rule which it doesn't have power to change the statute that is the rule making power is a continuing power. 
    That once the Court has adopted a rule that is a piece of delegated legislation, that is made pursuant to the authority granted by Congress and what is now found in 18 U. S C. 3772.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2931.386" stopTime="2937.808">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well now, are you speaking of a rule making power where it's unilateral or where it's concurrence with commerce?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2937.808" stopTime="2953.291">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    In this case it is unilateral. 
    In the case of proceeding after verdict, congress has given to the Court power to prescribe by rule the times for filing petition for certiorari.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2953.291" stopTime="2963.513">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And the essence I gather them Mr. Solicitor General is then if we prescribe at the time period that has precisely the same effect as if it had been written into enabling law itself?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="2963.513" stopTime="3213.373">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Yes Mr. Justice that would be -- that would be my position. 
    I think that that was what was contemplated by Congress. 
    I think that's what the words prescribe by rule mean. 
    That was clearly the understanding of the informed commentators at the time. 
    Professor Orfield, for example, referred to the fact that the rule is jurisdictional and that was the almost contemporaneous decision of this Court in the Coy case. 
    Now, I referred to the fact that the language has changed to may, it also changed to may with respect to appeals and this Court in the Robinson case in 361 U. S., it is cited in our brief and involved a late filing of a notice of appeal. 
    And the Court held that the may language there was compulsory that the appeal with the appellant Court got not jurisdiction when the appeal was filed more than five days late and it quoted with approval the language from United States against Smith, the phrase of -- lingers on indefinitely. 
    And in concluding its opinion, it said something further which seems to me to be relevant here. 
    That powerful policy argument maybe made both for and against greater flexibility with respect to the time for taking of an appeal is indeed evident. 
    But that policy question involving as it does many witty and conflicting consideration must be resolved through the rule making process and not by judicial decision. 
    If by that process the Courts are ever given power to extend the time for the filing on a notice of appeal upon a finding of excusable neglect, it seems reasonable to think that some definite limitation upon the time within which they may do so would be prescribed. 
    So, it seems to me that the case is tolerably clear. 
    The purpose of the rules was to cut down delays to restrict the time. 
    Congress was not clear just how much would be workable and delegated the authority to cut down the time to the Court. 
    And then there's the language of the statutory authorization or to prescribe by rule. 
    And then there's the language of the rules themselves. 
    The rules provide that the petition should be filed within 30 days, they provide further that a justice may extend the time within 30 days. 
    And then there is a very interesting further provision in the rules of the Court. 
    Rule 34 says that whenever any justice of this Court is empowered by law to extend the time, an application seeking such extension must be presented to the Court within the period sought to be extended. 
    And there its must not may, it is specific. 
    And finally, there was the decision of this Court. 
    In the Coy case in 316 U. S. and in the Smith and Robinson cases. 
    Well now, what happened to upset this clear picture? 
    Nothing deliberate, I may point out that in the Coy case in the order granting certiorari, the Court expressly directed the attention of council to the question of the time limit involved and asked that that question be briefed and it was. 
    But at no time has the Court ever had briefing an argument in these cases in which certiorari has been granted after the time that this is filed.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3213.373" stopTime="3223.350">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask if the time Coy was decided, did the predecessor of rule 22, read as rule 22 now reads?

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3228.325" stopTime="3230.431">

    But the phrasing was the same?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="3230.431" stopTime="3244.278">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    It read exactly the same except for the change of shall to may to which I have already referred and to the fact that at the time Coy was decided, there was no part to extend the time.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3244.278" stopTime="3259.603">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The reason I asked is that's rather unusual wording, isn't it? 
    It's phrased not that a petition is out of time unless filed within 90 days but that a petition shall be deemed in time when filed within 90 days.
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="3259.603" stopTime="3275.766">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    I think that's essentially the language of the 1925 Act with respect to civil cases which they were simply carrying forward. 
    Now, --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3275.766" stopTime="3320.456">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just before you go on. 
    I think I misunderstood the least part of the argument in your brief because here in oral argument in response to a question for Mr. Justice Black you said that your argument, jurisdictional argument would be precisely the same. 
    Now you -- if this case were one day late rather than over 100 days late and I gathered from page 18 of your brief. 
    Well, I understand you make that as your basic argument. 
    I'd gather it from page 18 in your brief that you say even if you are mistaken about the one day, certainly, if the delay is more than 90 days which is the longest time allowed by the statute then clearly its jurisdictional, is it not?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="3320.456" stopTime="3337.118">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Oh yes Mr. Justice, I recognized the one day argument is a hard one and if it's too hard for the Court to accept I will fall back and say “Well, at least you got to have sometime limit on it” and the only feasible one is the old 90 day statutory one --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3337.118" stopTime="3337.315">

    Or three months.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    I think that -- I think that logically I stand by my answer to Mr. Justice Black but the rules are jurisdictional. 
    They now provide for 30 days, plus as an extension of 30 days if by the expressed terms of the rules, the application is made within the 30 days. 
    And if that is the ground upon which I stand, if the Court won't accept that ground. 
    I do say that certainly they should not be construed to leave a completely open ended.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3377.529" stopTime="3378.405">

    Beyond 90 days?

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Beyond and if it isn't completely open ended, where should it stop. 
    Well, it seems to me at the place where it was before the rules came in to the picture in which to be technical was three months rather than 90 days at that time.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3390.070" stopTime="3407.026">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or perhaps I misunderstood you then.

speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="3407.026" stopTime="3434.397">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    It at least is within the -- it is within the language of -- to prescribe by rule and you would have to read into that while congress couldn't have intended that the Court would enlarge the time or that congress was meaning was that the Court should shorten the time and that's another case which we don't have here and my guess is the Court isn't going to prescribe a rule which fixes it in two years.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    No Mr. Justice, when it was only a day or two here and there I was just puzzled but I didn't think it's was appropriate to report to Congress that the Court was violating its rules. 
    When this case came along we as I say dug into it and found quite a lot. 
    The Court fell into this error if my may put it that way in Heflin against the United States in 358 U. S. 
    Further question came up only in the most back handed way. 
    It was not dealt within the briefs of any of the parties and it is dealt within a footnote in the Courts opinion of the complete text of which is, the complete text of which is “Well because no jurisdictional statute is involved” that's all.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Well Mr. Justice, if so I apologize for the time of the Court I had taken that seems to me that if that was the over ruling of the Coy case, that the Coy case, the Coy case was entitled to be present at its own funeral. 
    And I don't think that the Court -- had nothing to indicate that the Court was aware of the Coy case at that time or that it would have dealt with it in such a completely summary fashion.

    Were there dissents in the Coy case?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="3581.024" stopTime="3631.857">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Well Mr. Justice, yes there were. 
    It's terribly hard to tell just what had happened in the Coy case. 
    It's a very intricate decision arising in criminal procedure in the District Court and the Court decided that the -- what the District Court had done was wrong but the consequence of that was to make it a criminal appeal and since it was a criminal appeal, it was too late because it was filed more than -- the petitioner filed more than 30 days and then the Court said in the footnote “But a majority of the Court feels that in order to avoid security because it was pointed out that they could go back in the District Court and start over again and raise the same question and since the point is not jurisdictional that they would hear the case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3631.857" stopTime="3664.890">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But then your premise, we've been violating our rules in other aspect namely, we have numerous applications where the application with extension is not filed within the time and those orders and outside many of them. 
    I thought there might be something to do with merits, application for extension granted subject to the approval of the full authority, we do it constantly?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="3664.890" stopTime="3764.162">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Well Mr. Justice, my argument would extend to that. 
    It would seem to me that at least in civil cases that is completely unjustifiable and I can find no reason why it isn't equally unjustifiable in terms of this Court's own rules. 
    And now, with respect to all of these things, if the rules so construed are too inflexible, then I submit that the change should come through the rule making process and not in essence by an acquiescence. 
    And if there is a change made through the rule making process, it will almost certainly have an eventual time limit and also some statement of the grounds or considerations on which such an extension will be granted. 
    In some instances, which leaves this important matter wholly at large, not even good cause shown or excuse them on neglect as things now stand, cannot with true propriety be called a rule and it is only the power to prescribe rules which Congress has given to the Court in this area. 
    Incidentally Mr. Justice Douglas, I now come, it was the Taglianetti case in 394 U.S, this not one of your dissents, where again in a footnote and wholly conclusary, the Court said the time limit is not jurisdictional citing Heflin and does not bar our exercise of discretion to consider the case.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Oh, yes Mr. Justice.

    This is a part of the power of Congress to make law as long since established that Congress can do that in certain cases and under proper conditions by delegating it to other governmental bodies and is most appropriate that this particular item should be delegated to this Court. 
    But what this Court does pursuant to that power is essentially legislative and our submission is that it should be so treated and perhaps most important of all that this Court so decided in the Coy case and has never since decided to the contrary with any indication of treatment of the issues in the problem or of the continuing validity of the Coy case itself.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, let me ask you this to pursue Justice Stewart's questions. 
    You said you were somewhat puzzled by this possible conflict between the branches but if it arises out of Article Three which gives Congress the power to define the jurisdiction I believe and would not the power to define jurisdiction include all the incidental power to define how it's to be executed? 
    How jurisdiction is to be implemented including fixing the number of days within which filing must be happening.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4185.527" stopTime="4198.568">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Article Three itself and I'm reading from it, says the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="4198.568" stopTime="4218.406">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    And in this case, the regulation of the Congress has made has been to delegate this to the Court but I suggest that the Congress never contemplated that that was a simply open ended delegation whenever the Court thinks in its a good discretion that it would be a good idea to take the case than it shall which is near as I can see --

    Even strict construction is I think believe in a certain measure of flexibility and that flexibility is one which we not only have been able to live with but which we have come to accept. 
    We find it more frequently of course in delegations to administrative bodies, but in this area it's most appropriate that there be a delegation to the Court.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    It seems to me that and what has been done in this case, the Court can if in its discretion whatever that means, it think it appropriate, it can grant a writ of certiorari to review any decision of the Court of Appeals made at anytime in the past which isn't moot for some reasons or other. 
    And that I don't think was contemplated by Congress and yet I think that's what's involved in this case. 
    I don't think that that --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="4320.517" stopTime="4326.436">

    There are bills of review which people found when there had been corruption in the Courts and they upset judgments long after the event, and in equity, you can do a lot of remarkable things. 
    Professor Chafe, he taught me that long ago but I don't -- this particular writ of certiorari is a pretty -- pretty technical term of art which I don't think comes within those others. 
    Well now, with respect to the merits of the case. 
    The first is the constitutional validity of Title 18 Section 702 and it's hard for me to see how there can be any doubt about this. 
    This is the provision which makes it a crime to for an unauthorized person to wear the uniform or any distinctive part there of it. 
    Incidentally, let me clear up one possible misconception which came from the petitioner's argument. 
    He suggested that there might be a simulation of the uniform here but actually the indictment is simply that he did wear a distinctive part of the official uniform and the trial was conducted throughout on the basis that he wore a distinctive part of the uniform. 
    There is no basis for saying that it was something which simulated the uniform.

    Now in that connection, I would call attention to page 45 and 46 of the Appendix where an Exhibit 12 was introduced in the trial, read to the jury, official army regulation and on page 46 about two inches down in quotation marks, the following uniforms and articles thereof for a male members of the United States Army are distinct. 
    Distinctive components of the uniforms are limited to caps, coats, jackets and trousers except as indicated.

speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="4495.958" stopTime="4508.857">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Well, this is the quotation from Exhibit 12. 
    Exhibit 12 is the regulation and this is a quotation from Exhibit 12. 
    I don't have Exhibit 12 in my hand --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4508.857" stopTime="4509.515">

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Indeed I haven't examined it. 
    I believe this to be a quotation from Exhibit 12 which it purports to be. 
    I would also point out that further down on the page that buttons are referred to and I would also call attention to the fact that on page 13 an FBI agent testified --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4537.753" stopTime="4538.796">

    Page what?
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="4538.796" stopTime="4583.323">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Page 13 of the Appendix. 
    In response to the question, would you just describe the jacket he had on when you saw him? 
    A green jacket with a brass buttons of the type issued associated with military uniforms and you note that jackets are one of the things that are a distinctive part. 
    And then on page 20, a US Army colonel at page, down at the bottom of the page, on his head he had the fur filled army officer's cap with the loose strap -- with the strap loose and hanging down and with an army officer's insignia upside down.

    That I believe by some stretch of the imagination Mr. Justice is a theatrical production. 
    We will argue here later that it is not -- that this was not that -- of course is given under circumstances and in a situation where everyone present knows that it is simulated.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    But given in Washington, which is close to the Pentagon and where other things have happened. 
    But there is no doubt that that is a simulation and here there was a considerable reason to doubt whether the person involved was or was not a member of the Armed Forces. 
    Now, the petitioner here, perhaps his oral argument belies this but as I read his brief, it seemed to me that he made no claim that he didn't come within the terms of the statute that is that he was wearing a distinctive part of the uniform. 
    It seems to me to leave no question which was not in substance coved by this Court's decision in United States against O'Brien, the case involving the burning of the draft card. 
    Surely, there is power in Congress to protect the integrity of the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States. 
    This is a matter, which is of importance not only to the army but also to citizens. 
    We have to be able to rely on the fact when we see a policeman that he is a policeman. 
    And these times, we have to be able to rely on the fact when we see a man in military uniform that he is a member of the military. 
    The constitution expressly gives to Congress the power to raise and maintain armies and to do all things necessary and proper to carry that power into effect.

    That seems to be the convention in --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    No, I have seen plenty with buttons on. 
    I've seen them with jackets and overcoats and the fur hat.
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="4736.850" stopTime="5079.285">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Mr. Justice, if I can get to that case soon enough, maybe I could exercise some prosecutorial discretion with respect to that case. 
    This -- that seems to me to be a situation where discretion might be appropriate. 
    In this case, where the prosecutor exercises the discretion otherwise and where two Courts below have sustained that, I found no effective way that I could proceed except by defending the actions which they have taken. 
    This Court in United States against Bernal, which involved a prosecution for impersonating an officer, a cognate question said that one of the purposes of such statute is to maintain the general good repute and dignity of the service itself. 
    And this is essentially an argument, which I made somewhat against the advise of some of my associates in the O'Brien case, where I contended that it was within the power of Congress under the necessary and proper clause in connection with the power given to raise and defend armies, to protect the dignity of the selective service process by making it a crime to burn draft cards. 
    I did that because I found it somewhat difficult myself to find that draft cards themselves were of very great importance in the process. 
    The Court took the latter ground in its opinion and thus the O'Brien case is not a decision on that point but I think that the decision reads is very close to the one which is involved here. 
    So our position would be that the criminal code provision is constitutional and that the defendant clearly came within it and was properly found by the jury to have come within it. 
    And so we come to the exemption in 10 U. S. Code 772 (f) and our contention is that the petitioner was not by any reasonable stretch of the interpretation of the words in that statute an actor in a theatrical or motion picture production. 
    Now obviously, it wasn't motion picture so you can throw that out. 
    So you have to make him an actor in a theatrical production. 
    Now originally, this statute we spelled out the history of such as it is in our brief. 
    The statute prohibited any person from wearing the uniform in any playhouse or theater or in moving picture films. 
    And it was codified I think in 1954 and the sponsors emphasized that no substantive change was intended. 
    The objective was to make it plain that television performances would be covered, which might not come within playhouse or theatre. 
    But the intention of Congress is manifested in the original language and in the revision and that is that it is confined to situations where the make believe role of the person wearing the uniform is clear from the setting. 
    Thus, it seems to me that Dr. Strangelove or the (Inaudible) mutiny come within it because everybody knows that's a simulation. 
    It doesn't mean that a performance must be given in the building, could be an outdoor theatre, could be an area set aside for it. 
    It means only that the performance wherever given must preserve some of the traditional characteristics of dramatic presentation such as the defined area set apart for the actors and an audience surprised that the events which they observed are portrayed and not real. 
    The skit here was not a theatrical production in any reasonable meaning of that term. 
    It was an intermittent event in a demonstration in the street, in front of an induction station that also included picketing and distributing leaflets. 
    Pedestrians and motorists who either stopped or passed by the demonstrating could reasonably believe that the petitioner was in fact a soldier as his wearing of distinctive parts of the uniform was intended to convey. 
    The petitioner's conduct here has all the elements of picketing and no real similarity to the theatrical production which Congress contemplated, and no one would suggest I believe that a person would be entitled without authority to wear the uniform of the army merely because he was picketing. 
    To seek to bring the petitioner's action here within the statutory language is pressing that language to it's dryly logical extreme or to use of another passage from homes of being led by technical definition to apply a certain name and then to deduce consequences which have no relation to the grounds on which the name was applied.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What you're saying really on this interpretation that I gather is that the impression (Inaudible)
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="5089.166" stopTime="5188.103">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Yes, Mr. Justice and because of that, we -- since we think that as a matter of law, that what he did does not come within the exemption in the statute. 
    But the qualification on that exemption about tending to discredit the Armed Forces is irrelevant. 
    This is a little like for example, the Lopez case which involved the defense of entrapment and the contention was made that the charge about entrapment was not quite right and the Court held where it wasn't necessary to decide that because as a matter of law, there wasn't any entrapment and he wasn't entitled to any charge with respect to entrapment. 
    And we would contend here that the defendant was not entitled to any charge with respect to the defense of actor in a theatrical production and therefore the question of discredit becomes irrelevant. 
    I would be prepared myself to defend a discredit exception to the exception to the statute if it was necessary although I agree that it's getting very close to the line but on grounds similar to those which were involved in the O'Brien case with respect to the draft cards. 
    An analogy is the copyright law. 
    After all the uniform is the uniform of the United States and the United States is entitled to have some control over the way in which it is used. 
    But as I have contended, the petitioner doesn't come within the exception in any of the exemption in any event.

    There is no doubt about that and had he simply stood outside and made a speech against the war in Vietnam wearing the uniform, I cannot see any basis upon which the fact that he was making a speech would entitle him to exemption from the statute, which makes it a defense to wear the uniform of the United States without authority.

    Mr. Justice I think not. 
    I think to be a theatrical performance you have to have something like a stage. 
    I don't mean indoors, I don't mean formal but you have to have some place where there are players and some place where there is an audience. 
    And this was in essence a demonstration not a theatrical performance.

    That would have helped in this case but indeed, if he had had a sign of in his back not a member of the army, that might have made it enough so that the jacket was not a distinctive part of the uniform, I don't know, we're very close to the line in each case.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Yes, of course that's part of the problem. 
    The government tries to protect itself in various ways and then whatever you do is either speech or a symbolic speech and the First Amendment completely engulfs it and the government's powers are sharply restricted. 
    Now obviously, there is a line, a very important line and a difficult line but it's perfectly plain. 
    It seems to me that this protest could be made and could be made without interference at that place, at that time, the problem was the making it in the way in which it was made regardless of the place and the time, including the wearing of the uniform which congress for more than 50 years has made it an offense when not authorized. 
    Well, our first submission is that the Court should dismiss this petition as having been granted without jurisdiction. 
    If we are not successful on that and I hope that we will be because I'm greatly troubled by the un-open ended situation in which we now are that the decision below on the merit should be affirmed.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would make just one last point to the Court and that we have failed at least in our opinion defined any compelling interest suggested by the government for the enforcement of the statute. 
    The government acknowledges by the testimony that it read that the uniform itself was symbolic of speech, and we submit again that absent any compelling interest to regulate that action, the impingement on the freedom of expression, the symbolic act that the petitioner took part in was -- that sort of impingement is not allowable under the holding of the O'Brien case, absent of compelling interest.
