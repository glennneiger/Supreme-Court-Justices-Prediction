    Number 271, Buie against the United States.

speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="33.557" stopTime="300.338">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case concerns the application of the privilege against self-incrimination as developed in the Marchetti, Grosso and Haynes and most recently, the Leary case, to the situation of a transferor of marihuana pursuant to the transfer, order form requirements of the Marihuana Tax Statutes. 
    Briefly, the facts of this case are that the petitioner was introduced by a friend to two federal narcotics agents acting in an under cover capacity. 
    He had no -- they had no knowledge of his existence prior to the introduction. 
    They were introduced to him simply as Mike, the petitioner's first name. 
    As a result of the introduction there were various sales of marihuana and marihuana drugs. 
    The sales were made not in pursuance of an order form issued by the treasurer of the United States as required by 26 U.S.C. Section 4742. 
    Petitioner did not request an order form from the agents, the agents had not procured such an order form. 
    Petitioner was indicted on three counts, two of which were selling, not in pursuance of an order form and was convicted on one count, not selling pursuant to an order form. 
    The case was affirmed by the Second Circuit relying solely on United States against Minor. 
    The Second Circuit held that the marihuana statute, the marihuana tax statute was for practical purposes, the same as the Narcotic Drug Act involved in Minor that there was no risk of self-incrimination to a transferor and that the transferor of marihuana was not a person inherently suspect of criminal activities and that the profession of transferring marihuana or being involved in marihuana transactions was not an inherently suspect and illegitimate business. 
    This was not a statute designed to close down a criminal activity but rather to regulate a legitimate activity. 
    Briefly, the Marihuana Tax Act statutory scheme consists of an occupational tax provision, series of provisions requiring any transferor of marihuana, anyone who deals in marihuana which is defined as to very broadly and includes selling it or giving away, to register as a dealer, to pay an occupational tax and to keep records his transactions. 
    There is also a transfer tax provision which requires a transferee, a purchaser or acquirer of marihuana to obtain an order from the treasurer of the United States. 
    He must in it pay in advance the tax on the material to be acquired, the tax is either at the rate of $1.00 an ounce or $100.00 an ounce depending upon whether the transferee is himself registered. 
    He pays the tax based upon the amount he intends to acquire. 
    In order for him to acquire that order form, he must place on file with the government prior to obtaining the form and prior to consummating the transaction, his own name and address and the name and address of his proposed transferor as well as the amount of the drug he proposes to transfer. 
    There are numerous exemptions from the order form requirement and as the Court noted in Leary, they are essentially all of the legitimate transactions that are involved in marihuana, transverse by Doctors to patients by pharmacist to costumers pursuant to Doctor's orders, by officials of the government, transactions for export, so that there is left subject to the order form requirement a residual class of essentially of illegal transactions. 
    The information obtained by the order form, he is given copies of the order form are made available to any state or local official who is concerned officially with the enforcement of local narcotics laws. 
    The mere possession of marihuana is illegal in every state of the union with certain very limited exceptions corresponding largely to the exemptions of the order form requirements under Section 4742. 
    The Leary case --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="300.338" stopTime="304.978">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That you can't get an order form from the secretary unless you show that --

    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    No.

speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="307.493" stopTime="341.830">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    No, any person may obtain an order form. 
    The marihuana statutes differ radically from the narcotic statutes in this regard. 
    Any person desiring to acquire an order form may acquire it if he is a so called legitimate purchaser, one who is registered under the occupational tax sections. 
    He pays $1.00 per ounce. 
    If he is an illegitimate purchaser, one who is not registered, he pays $100.00 an ounce, but any person off the street who wants to acquire marihuana for smoking or any other purpose may acquire an order form.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="341.830" stopTime="343.037">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Pay $100.00 an ounce?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="343.037" stopTime="498.798">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    And pay $100.00 an ounce, yes sir. 
    The Leary case, Leary case involve such a -- such a purchaser. 
    The Leary case held that the marihuana statute, the transfer of provisions as applied to an unregistered transferee, who was Leary, applied to a person inherently suspect of criminal activities and existed in an area permeated with criminal statutes particularly by virtue of the exposure of the information contained on the order form to the state authorities. 
    It held therefore that the privilege against self-incrimination applied. 
    The Court in Leary also refused to severe the statute so as to make the order form provision applicable but withdraw the information from the perusal of the states. 
    It also applied the privilege against self-incrimination to prospective act since in the Leary case, the purchaser acquired the order form prior to time that any paying transaction was consummated. 
    The petitioner here contends that the Leary reasoning applies fully to his -- to the position of a transferor of marihuana. 
    Under the same order form procedure, the acts required of the transferor in order to comply with the provisions of 4742 yield an even greater danger than they did to the transferee of marihuana. 
    I review briefly the acts which we consider to constitute the self-incrimination aspects of this thing in terms of the transferor. 
    There are four acts, some or all of which maybe present with respect to any particular transaction in relation to marihuana on the part of the transferor. 
    The act in effect, the act -- I may note again that the name and address of the transferor must be on file with the government prior to the consummation of the transaction. 
    The mechanism provided by the statute is the use of the transferee. 
    The transferee must procure the order form and give the information directly to the government. 
    We maintain however that the statutory scheme envisions the transferee as a conduit for the transfer of the required information to the government, which information demands acts on the part of the transferor incriminating to himself. 
    He must, knowing that the information is to go to the government and that it is incriminating to him provide information.

    The form is appendix b in your brief?

    The --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As you point out, this is a form quite different from the one in the last case. 
    In that, the sellers name is not when it comes from the government, is it?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="515.761" stopTime="523.077">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    That's correct. 
    In addition, the general structure of the form is a directive to the transferor but --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="523.077" stopTime="524.226">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    To the seller?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="524.226" stopTime="542.342">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    To the seller from the government authorizing him so far as federal act is concerned to transfer certain quantity of marihuana to specified transferee. 
    Again, the transferee is the government's conduit for sending this form to the transferor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="542.342" stopTime="570.972">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I suppose though, if the buyer demands, goes to a fellow that he thinks is selling marihuana and says give me your name and the seller says sorry, I won't do it, and then the buyer, where this putative buyer finds in that as a sellers name not someone else and puts it on the order form, the seller maybe incriminated, he has incriminated himself, has he?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="570.972" stopTime="573.417">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    He hasn't at that point but we contend --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    When does he ever as far his name is concerned?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="576.152" stopTime="581.221">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    The information goes to the government through the hand of the transferee.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="581.221" stopTime="598.995">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now, through his hands with, the seller has been incriminated himself. 
    The buyer's information, I don't suppose there is anything that is illegally incriminating as far as the seller is concerned and the buyer furnished some information to the government?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="598.995" stopTime="627.625">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    No, there's nothing illegal, there's no privilege itself against self-incrimination without the half of the transferee in relation to the transferor's name. 
    However, there are other acts required, assuming that the transferee finds the name independent of the transferor and delivers it independent to the -- independently to the government, and I may note in passing that the name was not revealed so far as this record is concerned to the transferee by the transferor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="627.625" stopTime="630.685">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's -- that was my next question; there is no evidence in this case?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="630.685" stopTime="631.123">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    No.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="631.123" stopTime="632.921">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The seller aggregated name to anybody?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="632.921" stopTime="634.207">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    That's correct. 
    The seller and he --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="634.207" stopTime="635.562">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- any order form at all?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="635.562" stopTime="774.045">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    That's right. 
    The seller and the buyers were strangers, they were introduced by a third party solely on the basis of first names, that is in the record. 
    However, once the transferee has obtained an order form, the transferor must accept that order form. 
    We contend that the act of acceptance is an acknowledgement and an adaptation of the information contained on the order form. 
    The informa -- the order form is an inherently incriminating device when it contains the information that the transferor has sold certain drugs illegally to a transferee, when the transferor accepts that piece of paper, even when, if he were to refuse to accept it, if he were to ask about its existence, if he were to learn of the existence of this piece of paper and then transfer drugs pursuant to it, he would be adopting the information on that paper as his own as being true and valid. 
    The statute requires him to participate to a great extent in the incriminatory act involved in the order form process. 
    It is -- in our mind, it is the same thing as signing a confession that someone else has typed. 
    The information may already be in the possession of someone else but when you take it as your own, you are acknowledging it as true, when it is possible although for practical reasons very unlikely that a transferee might obtain an order form without ever speaking to anyone. 
    Obviously, at that point, nothing has been done by the transferor to incriminate himself. 
    When he accepts the piece of paper, he has enabled the transferee to say when asked, I gave this piece of paper to the buyer and he accepted it assuming that the buyer would tell the truth, we cannot postulate that the statute will be maintained on the basis of the seller's purgery, assuming that the seller would tell that truth when asked, he would be required to say that he accepted this piece of paper. 
    In addition, he is required by the statute to retain the piece of paper which constitutes an additional piece of evidence of his criminal act for two years and to make it available to all law enforcement officials who might come to ask for it in that two years.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, which precise statute, very statutory provision on the one with the contained in your appendix, this man --

speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="785.505" stopTime="789.215">

    That's right.

    Which --
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="790.076" stopTime="799.765">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    4742 (a) is the general requirement that you may not transfer marihuana except pursuant to an order form. 
    The provisions --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you assume that there is anything wrong with that, this is a provision of the statute?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="805.116" stopTime="823.462">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    I -- insofar as the order form, the mechanism for the order -- for obtaining the order form is provision (c) and (d) of the -- of 4742 and insofar as the order form requires that information be on file which is incriminating at the time of --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="823.462" stopTime="832.496">

speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="832.496" stopTime="885.970">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    The use of an order form by itself, no. 
    If this were to be an order form of the sort contained in the narcotic -- narcotic drug statute, then we would feel that the buyer was incriminated, I'm sorry, the seller, the transferor would be incriminated by requiring that such a statute exist, such an order form exist. 
    The theory of it in the narcotic drug case is I believe that the act, the order form requirement is to see to it that unlawful people do not obtain narcotic drugs, that result is perfected by requiring the name and address of the buyer, of the transferee to be in the hands of government prior to the sale or of issuing order forms only to legitimate people. 
    But in this case, the form does require that the name and address of the transferor be in the hands of government prior to sale.

    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    I think that there's a very heavy presumption that that blank would not be filled out where the transaction not going to be completed. 
    Among other things, the tax must be paid prior to the filling out of the form, that is at the time, you cannot obtain the form without paying the tax.

    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    It is all, yes, if one were not interested in buying or selling marihuana, one would not deal with this forms at all. 
    However, the danger, the suspicion intended by the existence of the form is such that the -- I think the existence of the form would cause the attention of the authorities to be focused very closely upon this people.

    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    If the transaction were to have gone no further than that, then I believe it would be incriminating and that the statute provides that the piece of paper maybe used as evidence and existence of the piece of paper may serve to bring into initiation the process of prosecution in relation to a drug, and now presumably the transferor who did not transfer but is simply named as a transferor would be able to testify that he did not in fact ever commit any act of this sort and were he to be believed than --

    This Court in Leary considered that the correlation between the act of filling out the form and the act of selling or buying the drug was so close that it viewed the existence of the form as being evidence of a recent -- of being a recent transferee of marihuana, even though the existence of the form did not necessarily imply that any transaction had been completed at all.

    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    That's right. 
    Now, if the propose transferor accept this order form, he is acknowledging the truth of the information contained on the order form, that is that he, the perspective of the proposed transferor has transferred to this transferee the specified quantities of marihuana. 
    At that time, he has committed a self incriminatory act. 
    In addition, he must retain that form for two years to serve as further evidence. 
    In connection with obtaining the order form, the Leary case held that a transferee need no -- an unregistered transferee is protected against obtaining the order form because it is self-incriminatory for him to do so. 
    This makes it very unlikely that an illegal transferee will obtain the order for to give to a transferor unless the transferor insists upon it. 
    We maintain that if this statute is to be taken as written and interpreted by this Court, that a major part of the motivating power for getting the information into the hand of the government who will use it to the detriment of the transferor must come from the transferor himself. 
    A transferor -- a transferee under the present state of the law is very, very unlikely to procure an order form unless the transferor simply insists upon it. 
    It cannot under these circumstances say that the transferor is a passive party who need only inquire whether the order form exist. 
    If the order form is to exist, it must be because the transferor brings it about that it exist even though he himself does not ever go the treasury department and sign his name on a piece of paper.

    What's the transferor got to do with this?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="1324.307" stopTime="1402.139">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    He must see to it that the piece of paper exist when the order -- when the transaction is completed. 
    If he does not see to it, it is very unlikely either because the transferee will be incapable of doing it because he does not know the information, that is the transferor has not given him his name and address or because he does not desire to do it. 
    It is very unlikely for either of those reasons that a transferee will obtain the order form. 
    If an order form is to come into existence, it must be because the transferor has provided the primary motivation for its coming into existence. 
    He must affirmatively act to his own detriment. 
    The -- we maintain that the self-incrimination comes about through a conduit that the statute has provided. 
    The transferee is in effect the government itself for purposes of dealing with the transferor and procuring the order form. 
    The transferee would not itself would not itself procure the order form if the transferor did not insist upon it. 
    In that way, the transfer -- the transferor must see to his own incrimination with the government.

    If there had been an order form, the incriminatory act would have been completed. 
    As soon as he received the order form or learned of its existence and then transferred marihuana pursuant to it. 
    There was no order form in the Leary case either and there were no registration forms in the Marchetti, Grosso, and Haynes cases. 
    The point is that filling out the order form or acting pursuant to the order form in this case is in itself the Incriminatory Act. 
    In Leary, the incrimination that the dangerous incrimination was at the hands of the state, not at the hand of the federal government and the information came to the state authorities, not from Leary himself but from the federal government. 
    Leary provided the information only to the federal government who then provided it to other people who would incriminate, who would indict and convict Leary, this was dealt to be too dangerous. 
    I would like to make a distinction between the Narcotic Drug Act and the Marihuana Act. 
    Under the Marihuana Act, there are virtually no legitimate users of marihuana. 
    There were in the last published reports 80 registered people, people who could deal legitimately with marihuana. 
    I'm informed by counsel for the government that that number is now approximately 160, but it compares insignificantly to the approximately 200,000 registered people involved in the narcotic drug trade, this is an illegal activity and this is a set of statutes intended to cause people to expose themselves as being dealers in illegal activities.

   Argument of Joseph J. Connolly
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1603.492" stopTime="1607.879">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Diamond. 
    Mr. Connolly?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="1607.879" stopTime="1934.975">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    In the light of the preceding discussion that the principles applicable here and in Minor, my brief submission will focus on the government's view of the statute in this case and our response to the central features of petitioner's argument. 
    The petitioner contends that Section 4742 (a) which simply requires that he receive from his transferee an order form which to the transferee shall have obtained, in some way compels him to make incriminating disclosures to the government. 
    We believe that his contention seeks to establish much more than the words of the statute where its operation in fact can support. 
    The offense -- the offense defined by Section 4742 (a) does not make criminal, petitioners failure to report any previous misconduct to the government and orders the order form provision require him to make incriminating disclosures to the government in order to legalize his subsequent conduct. 
    The transferor is neither required nor entitled to apply for an order form from the district director. 
    The only duty which this statute imposes on the petitioner is to transfer marihuana only to those persons who have made their acquisition lawful by paying the tax and acquire and receiving an order form. 
    The statute punishes not a failure to disclose information but a transfer, a transfer to someone who does not demonstrate that he has complied with federal law. 
    It is our position that the statute on its face and in practice can be complied with without the transferors disclosing any information at all. 
    Petitioner's argument to the contrary is found in what he asserts to be the practical consequences of the statute. 
    He knows that the transferee must provide the name and address of the transferor in his application for an order form. 
    He then assumes that the transferee can obtain that information only from the transferor himself. 
    This assumption is essential to the success of petitioners argument for it provides the aspect of self-incrimination which is lacking on the face of the statute, unless it can be said that the transferee necessarily must obtain that information from the transferor. 
    It cannot be said that compliance with the statute infringes the transferor's right to refrain from making incriminating disclosures. 
    The petitioner offers no support for this assumption in which his argument rests. 
    If he is relying on common experience to justify the assumption, such experience in our view refutes the assumption as evidence by the many cases like this one, in which a purchaser who may previously be unknown to a seller of marihuana is introduced to him by a friendly intermediary who can supply the name of the transferor. 
    We also think it is appropriate to point out that this case seems to be a most unlikely vehicle to establish as a constitutional principle. 
    The doctrine that a transferee of marihuana can learn the name and address of his seller only from the seller himself. 
    The facts in this case show that some 10 days before the transaction on which he was convicted, petitioner sold a quantity of marihuana to narcotics agents in the kitchen of his apartment. 
    Petitioner would have the Court conclude that there was no way except from the petitioner himself that the agents could have learned his name prior to the second transaction, who we think it needs no argument, the persons who sell marihuana in the kitchens of their homes are poorly situated to conceal their names and addresses. 
    By basing his argument on assumptions as to the practical effect of the statute, the petitioner emphasizes the critical difference between this case and Leary and it's antecedes. 
    In each of those cases, the statute on its face imposed on the petitioner himself an obligation to supply certain information. It was only one way the petitioner in those cases could comply with the statute by supplying the information himself. 
    In the present case, it is clear that the transferor can comply fully and literally with a statute where he receives and order form for which he gave no information at all. 
    In his oral argument, the petitioner makes the additional contention that even if he did not supply any information to the transferee to enable the transferee to obtain the form. 
    That the mere fact that he receives an order form thus obtained by the transferee is an incriminatory act that is I think the language that he uses, that he adopts the language on the form. 
    We submit in response to that contention that there is no incrimination, there is no disclosure upon receive of the form at all. 
    The petitioners intended --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1934.975" stopTime="1953.717">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Whatever, would it be an offense under 4742 (a) for a man named John Smith to sell marihuana to somebody pursuant to order form in which the top name was Robert Jones?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="1953.717" stopTime="2019.041">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    I inquired of lawyers more knowledgeable with the operation of the statute considering that question, and the answer is not entirely clear. 
    If you look at Section 4742 (d) in the statute, the third sentence says the original shall in turn be given by the transferee to any person who shall in pursuance thereof transfer marihuana to him. 
    Thus, the statute on its phase does not prohibit a transferor from making a transfer pursuant to a form in which his own name is not listed as the transferor and we -- as far as I know and I ask there has never been any prosecution brought asserting that -- that that's a violation of the order form requirement.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2019.041" stopTime="2025.618">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Highly unlikely, casual situation except that it does go I think to the petitioner's argument --
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2025.618" stopTime="2073.590">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    That's right, if in the real world, in the lawful world of marihuana ordered forms, it's unlikely that a transferee applying for a lawful order form will change his mind and submit it to some other supplier of marihuana, so we don't often see that but I think that the government can confidently assert the statute on its face would not preclude a transferor from transferring if the order form did not -- was not addressed directly to him. 
    This I take it would exclude the situation in which the transferor was a prior party to a misstatement on the application for an order form, but it think that's far field of what you were asking.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that should have been on the Leary then.
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2391.112" stopTime="2505.360">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    In our view of the practical consequences of the illicit viewings in marihuana in any case in which an order form maybe tender to an illicit transferor like petitioner, the most reasonable assumption contrary to petitioner's assumption is that none of the information was supplied for that purpose by the transferor. 
    It is to be sure difficult to assess assumptions in either side of the case in this area because it is so very unlikely that an illicit transferor will ever be presented with an order form. 
    The 160 registered handlers of marihuana have no reason as far as we know to acquire marihuana on the illicit market. 
    The far more numerous on registered consumers are hardly likely to secure order forms, the cost of incriminating themselves and paying a $100.00 tax, when their failure to pay the tax and to acquire marihuana pursuant to an order form is not punishable under Leary. 
    So it's quite easy to say that whether -- suppose there is a transferor -- transferee who wants to acquire marihuana from an illicit seller and who is willing to acquire an order form for that purpose, then it's very difficult to translate that supposition into a factual hypothetical which makes sense in the real world. 
    Even if we're willing to accept that supposition however and to accept the further doubtful premise that a transferee of marihuana could acquire an order form, that is whether the district director lawfully could issue an order form addressed to an illicit transferor.

    That's right.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That a person needs to be registered to be a lawful seller?

    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    That's right. 
    And on that basis, we suggest in our brief that there is a serious question whether the district director will or could issue an order form to Peter Straus to acquire marihuana from Joseph Connolly. 
    When Joseph Connolly's transfer will be unlawful under another provision --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2592.908" stopTime="2605.181">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or what in fact happens when an application comes in? 
    Does the treasury check the name of the proposed transferor for the proposed seller to see if that is one of the 160 registered sellers in the country?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2605.181" stopTime="2624.588">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    I believe -- I believe that that inquiry is made but there are -- there is not a great volume of marihuana order form in the state, it might be a very difficult thing to do with under the narcotic statute would it be 400,000. 
    But under the marihuana law, some checking's may.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2624.588" stopTime="2652.225">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If there's only a 160 legal sellers of marihuana in the country with or without them having -- who are qualified eligible to sell marihuana legally under any conditions wouldn't be much of a trick to check the name on the application of the proposed buyer, the name that he gives of the seller against that list of a 160, is that done or isn't it done?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2652.225" stopTime="2672.549">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    That is done. 
    If it is as far -- the question whether, what's the district director is to do in a situation which he finds that the proposed seller is not registered apparently hasn't come up because there hasn't been an application for an order form to acquire marihuana from --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2672.549" stopTime="2686.595">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    For the counts for the fact that there are as many as 160 lawful sellers, registered sellers of marihuana in the United States, does it have medicinal uses?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2686.595" stopTime="2716.425">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Present thinking is that it does not have medicinal uses but there's still a great deal of experimentation being conducted in it, about a 140 of the 160 registrants are Doctors in private practice and Doctors in research facilities who are seeking to determine conclusively whether it does have.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2716.425" stopTime="2727.441">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I can understand how those people would research positions might be purchasers but I don't see why there could be sellers, why they would want to be sellers.
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2727.441" stopTime="2736.936">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    They might not be sellers except among research institutions, they might be transferors and it's broad to say --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2736.936" stopTime="2743.976">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- selling, is it as selling, transferring and several other terms.
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2743.976" stopTime="2769.121">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    The statute which prohibits unregistered trafficking in marihuana has the list of various activities dealing and selling, administering and giving away. 
    Section 4742 which deals and Section 4741 which imposes the tax speaks of a transfer which that statute defines as any exchange of possession except --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2769.121" stopTime="2775.490">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So that would include possession giving it to a patient or a research center, that would be a transfer?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2775.490" stopTime="2916.126">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    That's right. 
    That is a transfer under the statute exempted fro the order form and tax and the transfer tax requirements. 
    To continue on with the question whether the transferor is likely to supply any information to the transferee in order to enable the transferee to get an order form, we think that any assumption along those lines contradicts the transfer, the seller's basic instinct to avoid having this transaction come to the attention of the government at all. 
    It's virtually impossible for us to have conceived of the situation in which the transferor would cooperate with the transferee who would express an intention to get an order form. 
    We would not expect Mr. Diamond to deny that for an illicit transferor and petitioner's possession in order for him is just about the last thing that he wants. 
    And if the transferee does produce an order form which he can might have obtained without the knowledge of the transferor, we believe that the transferor undoubtedly would refuse to complete the transaction pursuant to that form because it would be subject to intense scrutiny. 
    If that is true, then we see no reason to believe that an illicit transferor would as a means of complying with the statute provide any information to his transferee but in short, we conclude that this statute does not impose upon the transferor of marihuana any duty to make an incriminating disclosure which is then transmitted to the government. 
    I think that's the significant difference between this case in Leary that whatever characterization you might want to give to the transferor's consummating the transaction pursuant to this document, that act involves no matter of communicated by him or by the transferee to the --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2916.126" stopTime="2932.117">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if the law said that no sellers shall sell on an order form unless he writes his name on the order form? 
    Would that make any difference? 
    I've guess -- I'd guess it wouldn't under your argument.
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2932.117" stopTime="2934.962">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    No. 
    It would -- no, it wouldn't make any difference if --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2934.962" stopTime="2937.576">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And still has the choice of not of -- does not sell it?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2937.576" stopTime="2944.949">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    No, well, -- that's one choice which we would -- we'd like to preserve whatever is left of that argument.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2944.949" stopTime="2947.814">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    There isn't much after Leary?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2947.814" stopTime="2964.764">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    But the more important matter is that it's not communicated. 
    That he may comply with the statute, he may have full and literal compliance with this statute without any communication.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2964.764" stopTime="2980.781">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But if the law said you don't sell without an order form unless you write your name on it before you sell it then give a copy to the buyer, you would still say no violation of Fifth Amendment? 
    Or would you say that --
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2980.781" stopTime="2983.367">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    I don't the -- that's a bit harder case because you give it about --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2983.367" stopTime="2993.386">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you think is this harder? 
    You think there's a difference between that case in just receiving the form and symbolically saying yes I'm so and so.
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="2993.386" stopTime="3039.470">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    I -- my position stands. 
    I don't think that involves the Fifth Amendment violation, regarding the more you get me involve in communication directly to the buyer then I'm worried about the next step but I don't believe that there's any Fifth Amendment violation because in that situation I can't see any communication, I can't see any communication in this case. 
    What incriminates the transferor in this case is not anything that he says but what he does by selling marihuana, that's what subjects him to possible prosecution under the law and it's not on the basis of any disclosure which is made incident to this transaction.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3039.470" stopTime="3057.575">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And in this say you probably already covered this but I want to be sure I get a distinction. 
    In this case, it is not an obligation of the transferor to send in an copy of the order form to the government, it's only its obligation to keep it on -- keep it in his possession subject to an inspection for a period of time.
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="3057.575" stopTime="3073.860">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    That is the only statutory obligation. 
    You point out that there is difference between what the regulations contemplate under the narcotics laws and what the statute contemplates here and for the reasons which we set forth in our brief. 
    We believe that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3073.860" stopTime="3079.238">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I don't make any difference anyway because that's a separate regulation statute or so. 
    But there is that difference between this investigation?
speaker="joseph_j_connolly" startTime="3079.238" stopTime="3081.670">
    Mr. Joseph J. Connolly 
    Yes sir. 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of David A. Diamond
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3081.670" stopTime="3087.774">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Connolly. 
    Mr. Diamond, you have about three minutes left.
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="3087.774" stopTime="3113.218">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    May it please the Court. 
    With respect to Mr. Justice White's question, I believe that acceptance of the order form does more than acknowledge the man's name, that acknowledges the fact that he has transferred a stated quantity of marihuana and if he is an illegal transferor as was the petitioner here and is -- as would be virtually anyone prosecuted under this act, he would be acknowledging that he has broken the law.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3113.218" stopTime="3115.189">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But to whom does he acknowledge it?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="3115.189" stopTime="3123.071">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    He must acknowledge it to any person who comes to inquire of any official who comes to inquire about this matter. 
    I believe that he acknowledges it --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3123.071" stopTime="3126.209">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    When he gives money, when he receives the order form?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="3126.209" stopTime="3127.129">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    That's right --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3127.129" stopTime="3131.609">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Under your -- under your submission he acknowledges that he has then sold a quantity of marihuana?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="3131.609" stopTime="3132.419">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    That's right, that is correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3132.419" stopTime="3138.469">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But he's acknowledge it at best only to the -- only to the buyer not to the transferee that -- who is not the government?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="3138.469" stopTime="3145.594">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    He has put himself in the position of being required to acknowledge it to the various state officials who come around as a result of that order form.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3145.594" stopTime="3150.139">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, because that's of a separate obligation to keep the order form in his possession on file?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="3150.139" stopTime="3189.460">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    I believe that it is the obligation to which this statute looks, that is the purpose of the buyer's name on the order form is to deal with the second purpose stated in the legislative history of this act, that is to expose all details of marihuana transactions to the scrutiny both of the federal and state officers. 
    If this -- if the purpose of this transfer of provision was only to prevent transfers to unlawful people, the buyer's name would be irrelevant. 
    The purpose is to expose the existence of the seller as well as the buyer to all scrutiny which may follow the coming into existence of the order form. 
    I believe that there cannot be any segregation of this statute --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3189.460" stopTime="3194.377">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do the statute requires him to disclose this information to anybody who comes around?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="3194.377" stopTime="3232.063">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    To any official of the state, local, or federal official who comes around, he must produce his copy the order form. 
    It would be a frivolous I think for him to say something like at that point he need not expose it, there would be no purpose in his having to take it in the first place if he didn't have to display it when the officials come around since this serves more than the valid -- possibly valid purpose of seeing to it that these drugs go only to a legitimate purchaser. 
    They see to it that the seller is also exposed to official scrutiny and that -- that is done by seeing to it that he maintains a copy which he reveals to appropriate --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3232.063" stopTime="3251.117">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you say the law says to him if you want to sell any narcotic which maybe legal under federal law but illegal under state law, the federal law tells you that you must make a record of this sale illegal under state law, preserve it and then a state official would ask you for the record, you got to disclose it?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="3251.117" stopTime="3261.649">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    That's correct. 
    We feel that's an integrated, that's fruition of the entire buyer -- the entire seller information of the transfer order provisions of the marihuana act.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3261.649" stopTime="3279.029">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let's cut that in pieces now. 
    Suppose he have the record but when the state officer called on him and ask for its exhibition, he simply stood on his claim of the Fifth Amendment and decline to do it and proceeded to test it out?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="3279.029" stopTime="3308.103">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    I think that that would be rendering the entire transfer provisions pointless. 
    There is no point to him taking the order form at all since the buyer part of it is already taken care of by the buyer's name if the seller's point is to have any purpose, it is to expose and reveal the seller if the seller were to decline to disclose the order form and he were sustained on that, there would be no point in making him take the order form in the first place.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3308.103" stopTime="3321.969">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And are you suggesting that the federal government has no legitimate interest in knowing the sources independent of the prosecutorial aspect that simply knowing the flow of the material?
speaker="david_a_diamond" startTime="3321.969" stopTime="3359.940">
    Mr. David A. Diamond 
    They perhaps do but they may not make the man himself, the man incriminate himself in relation to that legitimate interest. 
    They require him to register and maintain records of the different sort and under different provisions under this law and those provisions are perhaps valid but they cannot then require that he in effect commit another crime by refusing to reveal that he has violated the first position, the first provisions. 
    We feel this case comes directly under the Alberts and Marchetti very line. 
    In addition, the order form are all used as evidence. 
    The statute describes it as such. 
    Thank you Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3359.940" stopTime="3367.693">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Diamond. 
    Mr. Diamond and Mr. Connolly, we thank you for your submission. 
    The case is submitted.
