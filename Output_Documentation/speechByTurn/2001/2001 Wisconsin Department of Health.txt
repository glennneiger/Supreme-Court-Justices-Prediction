Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services v. Blumer

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number oh oh nine five two, the Wisconsin Department of Health and Human Services versus Irene Blumer. 
    Ms. Flanagan.

speaker="maureen_m_flanagan" startTime="13.950" stopTime="142.090">
    Ms. Maureen M. Flanagan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    In nineteen eighty-eight, Congress enacted the spousal impoverishment protections of the Federal Medicaid Act, forty two US Code section thirteen ninety-six R five, to accomplish two competing purposes. 
    First, Congress sought to protect spouses living at home from impoverishment when the other spouse is institutionalized and requires long-term nursing home care. 
    Secondly, Congress sought to ensure that married couples seeking Medicaid bear a fair share of the cost of such care. 
    This case concerns whether States have the discretion to achieve those competing goals by taking into account at the time Medicaid eligibility is determined available income which the nursing home spouse is permitted to use after eligibility to support the at-home spouse. 
    When the nursing home spouse applies for Medicaid, section thirteen ninety-six R five permits the community spouse to retain certain income and resources to mit- to meet his own monthly maintenance needs. 
    The statute permits an increase in the standard resource allowance, however, if the at-home spouse can show at a fair hearing that the allowance will be inadequate to provide him with income at the State-protected level once the nursing home spouse qualifies for Medicaid. 
    When making this determination, Wisconsin, like more than thirty other States, first considers whether income available to the at-home spouse from the nursing home spouse will be sufficient to ensure the protected level of income once Medicaid eligibility occurs. 
    This method of determining whether to increase or to substitute the standard resource allowance is called the income-first rule.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    You your argument in in the event that we find ambiguity is I guess boils down simply to the fact that for a variety of reasons it would frustrate the congressional policy behind the act itself if we held against you, and yet in a in a way, haven't you provided a an answer to that, a counter to that argument in in your answer to a question a few moments ago? You you said, and I I think have to say, that if if the States lose on the particular issue before us here, the States as a practical matter can get to the same kind of rough dollar and cents result simply by adjusting the the the the the amount of resources, that is the the the the th- the baseline amount for the community spouse to retain and the amount of income which is thought to be necessary for the community spouse to to live decently, so it it it almost seems as though it doesn't very much matter, necessarily, to the enactment of whatever policy Congress had, whether the flexibility comes in income first versus resource first, or whether it comes in setting the the the allowances for income and assets.
speaker="mitchell_hagopian" startTime="2671.998" stopTime="2716.907">
    Mr. Mitchell Hagopian 
    Well, I think that the answer to that is that the resource-first allowance, refor- resource-first rule was placed in a provision that is what we call the fail safe provision.

    but in...

    this is kind of an exceptional case kind of mechanism, regardless of how you set income and resources.

    Mr. Mitchell Hagopian 
    Absolutely.

    Mr. Mitchell Hagopian 
    That's right, and and to stress the exceptional case component of it, you have to remember how you get one of these hearings.

    Yes, that's certainly one of our arguments against it.

    Mr. Mitchell Hagopian 
    Well, because our position is that the position they're taking is totally unreasonable, no, you don't owe any deference to the agency.

    Not necessarily.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Would you comment on on c one of the questions I asked Mr. Lamken, whether the background rule is the name-on-the-check rule, or as he puts it, the ri- the better view is the background rule is one of deeming, and so that we should start from the premise that it's okay to treat one spouse's income as part of the other spouse.

    That's right, but I think those decisions are made at a time when long-term care is not necessarily in the immediate offing, and maybe usually at age sixty-five or thereabouts, long before nursing home stays may be inevitable, and so the couple is making an informed choice about how best to maximize their income stream.
