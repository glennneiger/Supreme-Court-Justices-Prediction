    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    This case concerns fees for lawyer who successfully represent in court clients seeking Social Security old age survivors or disability benefits. 
    How those fees should be determined is the question that has divided the Court of Appeals. 
    Congress has provided that when an applicant for Social Security benefits prevails in court, reasonable counsel fees may be awarded subject to two limitations: first, fees are payable only out of benefits already past-due awarded to the claimant; and second the fee awards may not exceed 25% of the past-due benefits. 
    The petitioners in this case sought Social Security disability benefits. 
    They were unsuccessful at the administrative level but they prevailed in court. 
    Each had signed a standard form contract agreeing to pay his or her attorney 25% of all past-due benefits recovered. 
    Petitioners, more accurately their attorneys, urged that the 25% calculation should control subject to downward adjustment if the resulting fee proves too large judge by the size of the benefit recovered or the quality of the lawyers representation. 
    The Social Security Commissioner on the other hand urges counsel fee determination by the lodestar method that is the method now widely used on the statutes that unlike the Social Security Act provision at issue shift the obligation to pay counsel from the prevailing party to the losing party in the litigation. 
    Under the lodestar method fees are determined by multiplying the hours the attorney reasonably spent on the case by an hourly rate reasonable for the lawyer’s work. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit whose judgment we review held that the lodestar method governed. 
    We reverse that judgment for reasons detailed in the Court’s opinion. 
    We conclude that Congress designed the Social Security Act's provision for counsel fees to contain but not to override the agreements between lawyers and Social Security benefits claimant. 
    Accordingly, we hold that the attorney-client agreement controls if it yields a fee that does not exceed 25% of past-due benefits and is otherwise reasonable. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.
