    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
    When the respondent’s husband failed to pay his federal income tax, a federal tax lien attached to all his property and rights to property. 
    At the time that respondent and her husband owned a piece of property classified by Michigan Law as tenancy by the entirety, a unique form of co-ownership reserved for married people. 
    The question before the Court is whether her husband had property or rights to property in the tenancy by the entirety to which the tax lien could have attached. 
    The Sixth Circuit held that under Michigan Law, respondent’s husband had no property right in the entirety’s estate. 
    We now reverse. 
    Because the federal tax lien statute itself creates no property rights, this court looks initially to State Law to determine what rights the taxpayer has in the relevant property. 
    Ultimately however, whether these rights constitute property for purposes of the federal tax lien as a question of federal law. 
    If property is as they say a bundle of sticks, a collection of individual rights which in certain combination may constitute property, State Law determines which sticks are in the taxpayers bundle, while federal law determines whether the label property may attach to those sticks. 
    Whether a State Law would also label those sticks as property is irrelevant. 
    Michigan Law gave respondent’s husband rights in the tenancy by the entirety’s property consisting of the right to use the property, the right to exclude others from it, the right to receive income from it, and the right to alienate (or otherwise encumber) the property with the permission of his spouse. 
    We hold that these rights are sufficient to constitute property for the purposes of the federal tax lien statute. 
    If they were not considered properly, the entirety’s estate would have no longer, a result that not only seems strange but with also facilitate tax evasion. 
    It is true that Michigan Law exempts entirety’s property from the reach of State Law creditors but we have elsewhere held that State Law exemptions do not bind the federal government and they should not do so here. 
    Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia have joined; Justice Scalia has also file a dissenting opinion which Justice Thomas has joined.
