    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The second of the cases I have to announce is No. 00-730, Adarand Constructors, Inc. versus Mineta. 
    We granted certiorari in this case to review whether the Court of Appeals was correct when it concluded that the Department of Transportation’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program is consistent with the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. 
    In a Per Curiam filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. 
    The Court of Appeals reviewed a race conscious program that governs procurement of Federal Transportation funds to states and localities. 
    We presumed that the certiorari states that we would be able to review this same program but upon full briefing and oral argument, it is clear that petitioner is challenging a very different race conscious program, one relating to direct procurement of Federal Transportation funds to private contractors. 
    Because this program is governed by a different set of statutes and regulations than the program reviewed by the Court of Appeals, there is no decision below addressing the constitutionality of the only program petitioner now challenges. 
    We are a court of final review and do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below. 
    To do so here would be especially unwarranted since the Court of Appeals found petitioner lacks standing to challenge the statutes and regulations relating to DOT’s direct procurement program. 
    Yet, petitioner’s brief did not challenge this ruling. 
    Petitioner points out that this case presents questions of national importance calling for final resolution by this court. 
    The importance of an issue, however, should not distort the principles that control the exercise of our jurisdiction. 
    We find on the record before as to these principles preclude review of questions upon which we granted certiorari. 
    We dismissed the writ accordingly. 
    The opinion of the court is unanimous.
