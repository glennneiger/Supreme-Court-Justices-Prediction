    Justice David H. Souter 
    These cases come to us on writ of certiorari of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
    In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress sought to promote competition in local telephone markets in part by requiring incumbent companies with local monopolies to list elements of their telephone networks to competitors. 
    To implement the Act, the FCC promulgated the regulations at issue which prescribed pricing of elements for lease and additionally requires incumbents to combine or connect the elements as necessary for the entrants to provide retail services. 
    The Eighth Circuit invalidated both the FCC’s pricing rule and its additional combination rule as inconsistent with the plain meaning of the Act. 
    The FCC’s pricing rule prescribes a forward-looking rate setting method on the basis of what it calls Total Element Long-Run Cost or TELRIC for short, and that refers to the most efficient technology and network configuration available at existing wire centers. 
    The Circuit of Court read Section 252(d)(1) of the Act which governs pricing to allow forward-looking methods of rate setting as a general matter but not TELRIC. 
    Because even though TELRIC did not resolve the confiscation of the incumbent’s property, it did not take into account the incumbent’s actual cost of leasing out an element. 
    The Eighth Circuit also invalidated the additional combination rules as plainly inconsistent with Section 251(c)(3) of the Act, which sets forth the general duty of incumbents to lease network elements. 
    We granted certiorari and in an opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we affirm in part, reverse in larger part, and remand. 
    We affirm the Eighth Circuit’s holdings that the Act permits forward-looking rate setting methods and that TELRIC does not effect an unconstitutional taking of property, absent of showing of actual confiscatory rates. 
    We reverse, however, the Circuit’s invalidation of TELRIC and the additional combination rules. 
    Neither is foreclosed by the statutes plain meaning and each deserves deference as a reasonable interpretation of what the Act requires. 
    The word cost in plain language or in the technical vocabulary of public utility regulation is not limited to the actual historical cost incurred via providing incumbent. 
    For example, a merchant who is asked the cost of providing the goods he sells may reasonably quote the current wholesale market price not the price he paid for the particular items he happens to have on his shelves. 
    In concepts, such as reproduction cost and traditional rate making were similarly independent of actual cost. 
    Hence, the legitimacy of the FCC’s choice of a forward-looking not a rigidly historical pricing methodology, nor was it unreasonable for the FCC to pick TELRIC as the means to implement the Act’s goal of promoting local competition. 
    As a threshold matter, TELRIC does not make the assumption of a perfectly competitive market as the incumbent’s claim while it does make explicit allowance for adjustments of rates by state commissions in individual cases. 
    Although the incumbents have argued that TELRIC will discourage not promote investment in facilities by competitors entering the local markets. 
    Facts on the record are at odds with this claim. 
    The entrants of indicated in the incumbents do not dispute that the TELRIC regime has facilitated $55 billion in competitive capital spending in local telephone markets. 
    As for the additional combination rules, and the Section 251(c)(3) of the Act does not say that entrants must do any and all combining but rather that the incumbent shall provide unbundled network elements in a manner that allows requesting carriers to combine such elements in order to provide a telecommunication service. 
    The rules placing a limited obligation, nonetheless, on the incumbents to do some combining, a reasonable attempt to make the incumbents statutory duty to lease elements a practical one by giving entrants who are unable to make a connection of equipment that they need to do business, the option of paying incumbents to make the connection for them where that is technically feasible. 
    Justice Scalia joins part 3 of this opinion and Justice Thomas joins parts 3 and 4. 
    Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, part 6 of which Justice Scalia joins.
