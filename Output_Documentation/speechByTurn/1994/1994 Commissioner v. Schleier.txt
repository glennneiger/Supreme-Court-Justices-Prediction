    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    As it evidence from the title of the case, this is a tax case. 
    The respondent is a former employee of Untied Airlines who along with pursuant to the policy of the company was discharged when he reach the age of 60. 
    He and other employees bought sued against United Airlines alleging that the termination has violated the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967. 
    Eventually the case was settled and he received a $145000.00 half of which was attributed to back pay and half to so called liquidated damages. 
    The question in the case is whether he has to pay income tax on the recovery that turns on the further question whether the amount he received was ?damages received on account of personal injuries or sickness within the meaning of the Internal Revenue.? 
    The Courts of Appeals have divided on the question in this case the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the income was not taxable. 
    We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict and for reason stated in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the Court of Appeals and conclude he must pay income tax on both portions of the settlement. 
    Justice Scalia has concurred in the judgment. 
    Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined entirely in which Justice Souter has joined part II.
