    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    First Options, a securities company said that MKI, an investment company owed it some money and that MKI’s owners; the Kaplan should make up any deficiency. 
    There was no agreement on this. 
    The whole thing went to arbitration. 
    The Kaplans protested; they said, “We never agreed to arbitrate.” 
    The arbitrators bet, “Oh yes, you did” and then they went to court and the court said “No, the Kaplans didn’t ever agree to arbitrate” and we agree to review two questions growing out of this. 
    The first question is should a court review an arbitrator’s decision like this one saying, “You all agreed to arbitrate”? Should a court review that independently or should it defer to the arbitrator? 
    Now, this question is not about the merits, it’s not even about whether the merits are arbitral, it’s about who should basically decide whether the merits are arbitral, the court or the arbitrators? 
    The answer to the question is easy. 
    It depends upon what the parties agree, what do the parties agree who should decide the matter? 
    That's because arbitration is a matter of contract and the courts normally look to the party’s intentions as with any other contract. 
    It isn’t quite like any other matter. 
    As the law does assume if there is silence, if there is ambiguity, the court assumes that the parties want the judges to decide the matter independently unless they clearly indicate it to the contrary that's because this matter is rather arcane, the parties probably didn’t think about it and this presumption more or less in the general rule accords with their likely intent. 
    The Kaplans here did not clearly say they wanted the arbitrators to decide arbitrability so they win. 
    The second question is what standards did Courts of Appeals use when they review a District Court decision confirming in arbitration award? 
    One circuit says especially lenient standard. 
    The other circuit say normal standards. 
    We decide that that single circuit a voice crying in the wilderness is wrong. 
    We agree with the other circuits. 
    A court should use normal standards not some special lenient standard, that's because the way Courts of Appeals review District Courts is really a function of their comparative expertise and function not a question of the desirability of some substantive outcome. 
    The judgment of the Third Circuit is affirmed. 
    The opinion is unanimous.
