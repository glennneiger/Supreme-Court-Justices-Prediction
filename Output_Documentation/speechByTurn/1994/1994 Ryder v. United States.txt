    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The second case I am going to announce is number 94-431, Ryder versus the United States, and here the petitioner was convicted of a drug offense by a Court Marshall convened by the Coast-Guard. 
    He appealed his sentence to a three-judge panel of the Court of Military review of the Coast-Guard. 
    The Court rejected his challenge to the appointment of two of those judges, based on the Appointments Clause of the Constitution and it affirmed his conviction. 
    On further appeal, the Court of Military Appeals held that the appointment of those judges had violated the Appointments Clause, but it upheld petitioner's conviction anyway. 
    It reasoned that the actions of the improperly appointed judges were valid de facto. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk of the Court today, we reverse the ruling of the Court of Military Appeals. 
    The de facto officer doctrine confers validity on actions performed by a person who acts under the color of official title even though it's later discovered that the legality of that person's appointment is deficient. 
    Cases in which this Court is applied, the doctrine defined the action of judges and criminal matters valid de facto have involved technical violations of designation statutes, where the defendant didn?t raise the timely objection to the officer's title. 
    Unlike those cases, the petitioner here did timely object to the appointment of the appellate panel in a claim grounded in the Appointments Clause, and that clause by preventing the diffusion of appointment power is the constitutional provision designed in part to benefit litigants and so, to preserve the incentive to raise such challenges with respect to questionable judicial appointments we hold that a defendant is entitled to a decision on the merits of the question and whatever relief maybe appropriate. 
    The opinion is unanimous.
