    Justice David H. Souter 
    Now, this case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 
    As an infant, the respondent the Margaret Whitecotton experienced symptoms of an injury to the brain shortly after receiving the vaccination. 
    She subsequently filed for recovery under the National Childhood Vaccine Act, which provides that a claimant establishes a prima facie entitlement to compensation, when she shows that the first symptom of certain injuries occurred within a specified time period after vaccination. 
    The Special Master denied respondent's claim finding that she had experienced symptoms of her injury prior to receiving her vaccine. 
    The Court of Federal Claims affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a claimant makes out a prima facie case whenever she shows that symptoms of her condition occurred within the post vaccination period, identified by the statute, even if there was evidence of her condition before the vaccination. 
    In a unanimous opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we reverse the judgment of the Federal Circuit and hold it under the plain language of the Act, the demonstration that a claimant experienced symptoms of an injury after receiving the vaccine, while necessary, is insufficient to make out a prima facie case. 
    The claimant must also show that the symptoms were her first and hence that no evidence of injury appeared before the vaccination. 
    Justice O'Connor has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Breyer joins.
