    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    This is a case that arrives under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. 
    When a worker is covered by the Act sustains an injury, the Act has a comprehensive scheme to compensating for loss in wage-earning capacity. 
    There are two kinds of injuries, one is an injury which is on a schedule usually for the loss of a limb and the other is so-called non-scheduled injuries, which is what's involved here, the employee injured is back. 
    He received an award because of the injury heâ€™d lost wage-earning capacity. 
    He then attended a school for training as acrane operator and for operating heavy equipment, and he became a crane operator and his earnings capacity is a result increased, he increased quite substantially. 
    The employer sought a modification of the award and cited the statute but says an award can be modified if there is achange in conditions. 
    The employee, the worker said changing conditions means only physical condition and my back is still injured. 
    The employer said, no, it means also a change in your wage-earning capacity. 
    We took the case up because the circuits are in disagreement on this point. 
    We agree with the employer that a change inconditions under the statute, he includes a change in wage-earning capacity. 
    Disability is an economic concept not a medical concept. 
    Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit where this case rose and remanded the case for further proceedings. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a dissent.
