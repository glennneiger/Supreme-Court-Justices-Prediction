    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes to this court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    We took the case to resolve rather a lopsided conflict among the Courts of Appeals. 
    In the opinion filed today we hold that the drug conspiracy statute ยง 21 U. S. C. ยง 846 does not require the government to prove that a conspirator under the Drug Conspiracy Law has committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
    Unlike the general conspiracy statute ยง 846 follows the common law definition of conspiracy which requires only that the conspirators enter into an agreement to commit an unlawful act. 
    Accordingly the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. 
    The opinion is unanimous.
