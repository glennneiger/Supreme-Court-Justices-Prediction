    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion of the court to announce in number 93-6060, Arizona versus Evans. 
    During a routine traffic stop, Phoenix police officers arrested the respondent when their patrol car computer indicated that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest. 
    Incident to the arrest, the police discovered a bag of marijuana in respondent’s car. 
    Because the computer record upon which the police had relied was erroneous, there was in fact no outstanding warrant. 
    Respondent moved to suppress the marijuana as the fruit of an illegal search. 
    The Arizona Supreme Court determined that the exclusionary rule applied to the marijuana seized even if before the computer record was attributable to an error committed by a court employee. 
    We granted certiorari to determine whether the exclusionary rule encompasses such evidence and in an opinion filed with the court today we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona. 
    The exclusionary rule is the sanction that is appropriate only where the rule’s deterrent function is served. 
    It historically was not designed to deter a conduct by a court employee. 
    There is no evidence that court employees are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment and there is no basis for believing that implication of the exclusionary rule will have a significant deterrent of the fact on court employees. 
    Finally application of the exclusionary rule could not be expected to alter the conduct of the arresting officer in this case, because there is no indication that he acted unreasonably when he relied up on the computer record. 
    We conclude that the exclusionary rule does not require a suppression of evidence, seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, where the police rely upon an erroneous computer record, attributable to a clerical error by a court employee.
