    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the opinion of the Court to announce in United States versus X-Citement Video. 
    In this case the respondent X-Citement Video shipped videotapes depicting an underage pornography star to an undercover police officer. 
    They were convicted for violations of the Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977 which prohibits persons from knowingly transporting, shipping, receiving, distributing or reproducing any visual depiction. 
    If that visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed their convictions reasoning that the statute was facially unconstitutional because it did not require the defendant to know that the performer was a minor. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today we reverse the ruling of the Ninth circuit and hold that the term "knowingly" in the statute applies to the minority status of the performers. 
    The statute as constitute by the Court of Appeals allows prosecution of persons who handle a visual depiction. 
    Although they maybe completely unaware that the contents depict any short of pornography at all, we are certain that Congress do not intense such absurd results. 
    In reading the statute to avoid these results we recognize that our past decision had usually found a scienter requirements, scienter meaning "knowingly requirements" for all statutory elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct. 
    Even though, no such requirement appears on the face of the statute and the minority status of the performers in this statute is such an element. 
    Finally, we note that the statutes are to be read when fairly possible to avoid substantial constitutional doubts. 
    In the light of all these principles of fair reading of the text and history of the statute dictate that the statute requires knowledge of the performer's minority status and therefore is not facially unconstitutional. 
    Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which he is joined by Justice Thomas.
