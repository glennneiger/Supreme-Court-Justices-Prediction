    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Mr. Johnson sued five policemen; he said they have wrongly arrested him and beaten him. 
    Three of the policemen then asked the District Court for a summary judgment. 
    They claimed there wasn’t any evidence showing really they had been around. 
    The District Court said no, and they wanted to appeal; to appeal before the end of the case; an interlocutory appeal. 
    The Court of Appeals said, “There is no interlocutory appeal; you have to wait till the end of the case.” 
    And that’s what we had to decide; can they appeal before the end of the case or not? We think they cannot. 
    Now, they agreed, normally, you can’t appeal from the denial of the summary judgment until the end of the case, but they point out they are special, because they are policemen with the defense of “qualified immunity.” 
    They’ll get off if the law was not clearly against them; and they say the policy behind that should permit them to take an interlocutory appeal here. 
    We decide however that the policy does not extend to this kind of case. 
    This is a kind of case where the appeal would be heavily fact-laid. 
    Where they have an appeal, it is a question primarily and purely of law. 
    We explain in our opinion how that distinction fits within the words of the appellate statute and prior case law to deny them an appeal here. 
    The opinion is unanimous.
