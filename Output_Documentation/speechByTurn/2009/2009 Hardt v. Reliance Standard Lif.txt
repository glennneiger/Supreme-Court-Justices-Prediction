    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Justice Thomas has our Opinion today in case 09-448, Hardt's versus Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company and he has asked that I announce the opinion. 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    Petitioner Bridget Hardt's sued respondent Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company after it denied her request for long-term disability benefits under a plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 known as ERISA. 
    Hardt and Reliance filed cross-motions for summary judgment. 
    The District Court denied both motions but found that Reliance had failed to give Hardt's a claim, the full and fair review that ERISA requires. 
    The District Court instructed Reliance to conduct a proper review of Hardt's Claim within 30 days and warned that if Reliance failed to do so, the Court would enter judgment in Hardt's favor. 
    After Reliance conducted the review as instructed, it awarded Hardt the long-term disability benefits she sought. 
    Hardt then moved the court to award her attorney's fees under 29 United States code section 1132 (g)1, a fee shifting statute that gives Courts discretion to award attorney's fees to either party" in most ERISA lawsuits. 
    The District Court granted Hardt's motion for fees but the Court of Appeals vacated that judgment concluding that Hardt was not eligible for fees under the statute because the District Court's order instructing Reliance to reconsider Hardt's benefit claim did not make Hardt a prevailing party. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    The term Prevailing Party is a legal term of art, that does not appear in section 1132 (g)1. 
    The Court of Appeals thus erred in holding that Hardt had to qualify as a prevailing party to receive a fee award. 
    Applying the interpretive method we employed in a case called Ruckelshaus versus Sierra Club, we conclude that a fee claimant is eligible for attorney's fees under the statute as long as she has achieved some degree of success on the merits of her claim. 
    Once the claimant has established eligibility for a fee award the District Court has broad discretion to award fees under section 1132 (g)1. 
    As more fully explained in our opinion, we conclude that Hardt established her eligibility for fees award and that the Court of Appeals erred by vacating the District Court's judgment. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
