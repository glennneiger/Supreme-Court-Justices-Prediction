    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    First of the decisions I will announce is number 08-1394 Skilling v. United States. 
    In 2001, Enron Corporation, then one of the world's leading energy companies crashed into bankruptcy. 
    This opinion considers two questions arising from the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime top Enron Executive, for crimes committed before the corporation's collapse. 
    First, did pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevent Skilling from obtaining the fair trial of the Sixth Amendment guarantees and second, was Skilling properly charged with and convicted of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. 
    The Fifth Circuit answering no to the first question and yes to the second, affirmed Skilling's convictions. 
    We agree with the Fifth Circuit's ruling on Skilling's fair trial claim, but we disagree with that court’s opinion on Skilling's honest services conviction. 
    We therefore affirm in part and vacate in part. 
    On the fair trial issue, Skilling argues that his prosecution never should have proceeded in Houston, Enron's home base. 
    Pointing to the heavy media coverage and the community outrage attending Enron's collapse, he urges this Court to presume that prejudice infected his jury. 
    Critical differences, however, separate Skilling's trial from those in which we have presumed juror prejudice. 
    First in contrast to the small-town settings at issue in prior cases, Houston is the fourth most populous city in the nation, the suggestion that 12 impartial jurors could not be found there is hard to sustain. 
    Second, news stories about Skilling reported no smoking gun evidence, nothing comparable to the murder confessions broadcast in prior cases. 
    Third, media attention diminished somewhat in the four years between Enron's collapse and Skilling’s trial and finally Skilling's jury acquitted him of nine insider trading charges. 
    Those not guilty verdicts hardly suggested jury incapable of weighing the evidence impartially. 
    We conclude in short that no presumption of prejudice should have disqualified Houston as a place appropriate for Skilling's trial. 
    We further hold that no actual prejudice contaminated Skilling's jury. 
    The jury selection process, we are satisfied, adequately detected and defused potential juror bias. 
    The District Court initially screened venire members by using a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling’s counsel. 
    That 77-question, 14-page document was designed to probe potential jurors’ exposure to pretrial publicity and their opinions about Enron and Skilling. 
    During voir dire the court questioned each venire member individually, focusing on questionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible bias. 
    Once done, the Court allowed counsel to ask follow-up questions. 
    Careful consideration of the questionnaires and voir dire of the seated jurors satisfies us that the fact triers in Skilling’s case were largely uninterested in and personally untouched by Enron's collapse. 
    Accordingly we reject Skilling's claim that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury. 
    We next consider whether Skilling was improperly convicted of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. 
    To understand how honest services fraud works, consider the following example. 
    A mayor accepts a bribe from a third party in exchange for awarding that party a city contract. 
    If the contract terms are the same as any that could have been negotiated at arm's length, the city suffers no tangible loss of money or property, but the citizens are harmed because they have been deprived of their right to the Mayor’s honest services. 
    Beginning in the 1940s, the Court of Appeals one after the other upheld fraud convictions of both public and private employees based on facts resembling those in the bribed Mayor's example. 
    By 1982, all Federal appellate courts had embraced the honest services theory of fraud. 
    In 1987, this Court’s decision in McNally v. United States blew the whistle on honest services prosecutions. 
    The mail and wire fraud statutes, we held, proscribed only deprivations of money or property not honest services. 
    The next year Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 1346 to override McNally. 
    That statute provides that the term scheme or artifice to defraud are used -- as used in the mail and wire fraud proscriptions, includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services. 
    Skilling contends that the Honest Services statute is unconstitutionally vague and therefore violates due process. 
    His vagueness challenge we acknowledge has force. 
    No doubt Congress intended Section 1346 to reinstate pre-McNally honest services' decisions, but those decisions are hardly models of clarity or consistency. 
    Nevertheless, the Court must, if possible, salvage not condemn Congress’ enactments. 
    Section 1346, we conclude, is amenable to a reasonably confined construction, one that limits the statute scope to the paradigm pre-McNally cases. 
    The vast majority of the pre-McNally honest services prosecutions involved offenders who in violation of a fiduciary duty participated in bribery or kickback schemes. 
    Indeed McNally itself, the case which spurred Congress to enact 1346, presented a classic kickback scheme. 
    Beyond doubt, Congress intended 1346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks engineered by persons in positions of trust. 
    Leaving the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct, we acknowledge, would raise due process concerns. 
    To save the statute of running afoul of constitutional limitations, we now hold that Section 1346 criminalizes only the bribe and kickback hoar of the pre-McNally case law. 
    Because Skilling's misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback, he did not conspire to commit honest services fraud under our confined construction of 1346. 
    We leave for remand the question whether the error is harmless in light of other theories supportive of Skilling’s conspiracy conviction. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justices Kennedy and Thomas join. 
    Justice Alito has also find -- filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Sotomayor has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justices Stevens and Breyer join.
