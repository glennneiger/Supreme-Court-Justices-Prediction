    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th circuit 42 U.S.C section 1988 authorizes courts to award a reasonable attorney's fees for prevailing parties in civil rights actions. 
    In awarding fees in this action in this record calculated the so-called load-star amount, the hours worked multiplied by a reasonable hourly fee and enhanced that amount by an additional 75% for superior performance and results obtained. 
    For the reasons set out in our opinion, we conclude that the load-star amount may be increased due to superior performance but only in unusual circumstances under which the load-star does not adequately account for performance. 
    In addition any enhancement must be based on a reviewable methodology and must be supported by specific evidence because the Court of Appeals did not apply these standards in this case we reverse and remand for the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
    Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas have filed concurring opinions, Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justices Stevens Ginsburg and Sotomayor have joined.
