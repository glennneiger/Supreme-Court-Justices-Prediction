    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Under Illinois law and certain circumstances, the police can seize a car or cash without a warrant; I suppose they were arresting somebody and they didn't have time to get the warrant. 
    Now the question in this case was, whether Illinois law provides such a person with a sufficiently speedy opportunity to have a hearing, so he could contest that the law -- that he -- that it was an unlawful seizure. 
    Well when oral argument was taking place here, we learned that all the real arguments between the parties have ended. 
    The state returned the cars. 
    The disputes over the cash had been settled. 
    The case was not a damages case, not ongoing. 
    It wasn't a class action. 
    It didn't involve the kind of threat of repetitive action that might evade review. 
    So we have to say there is no continuing controversy and have to conclude that the case was moot. 
    Now there is still an issue, because ordinarily when a case is moot what we do is we order the judgment below vacated and we remand the case to the lower court with instructions to dismiss. 
    But there was a question here because in a case called Bankcorp, we said we'd let that lower court judgment stand, we wouldn't vacate it. 
    When the mootness occurred because the parties settled the underlying case, we thought it seemed somewhat unfair to permit a party to moot a case, say deliberately or intentionally just by settling it to avoid our decision, understandable but we did it, but sometimes, but here however the termination of respondent's underlying forfeiture case in the State Courts were not really settlements as the case Bankcorp meant to use that term. 
    We explain in our opinion that the termination of those forfeiture cases seem to have nothing to do or very little to do with any effort to avoid a decision here so we ended up saying we will follow our ordinary practice. 
    We vacate the judgment below. 
    We remand to the Court of Appeals with instructions to dismiss the case. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
