    We'll hear argument next in Case 08-645, Abbott v. Abbott. 
    Ms. Howe.
speaker="amy_howe" startTime="7.511" stopTime="67.516">
    Ms. Amy Howe 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Hague Convention exists to ensure that custody disputes are resolved by the courts of the country of habitual residence rather than through abduction. 
    It thus generally requires the return of a child who is abducted in violation of a right of custody. 
    So too, a ne exeat right permits a parent to require that the child reside in the country of habitual residence, thereby rendering international abduction illegal. 
    Ne exeat rights are not only rights of custody under the text of the convention, but they also track the convention's vital purpose of ensuring that children are not subject to international abduction. 
    Under the convention, Mrs. Abbott cannot evade the jurisdiction of the Chilean courts by abducting the child to Texas and then asking a Texas State court to nullify the rights granted to Mr. Abbott under Chilean law. 
    That's the sound view of the great majority of signatory courts to consider the issue as well as essential authorities in both the United States and Chile.

    You would be on absolutely sound ground if this were a convention on the mutual recognition of jurisdiction and judgment, but it's not. 
    You -- you said the whole question is deferring to the courts of habitual residence, but this statute is not raised in terms of court jurisdiction. 
    It's in terms of the right of a custodial parent.
speaker="amy_howe" startTime="97.048" stopTime="122.411">
    Ms. Amy Howe 
    Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and Mr. Abbott has a statutory ne exeat right as well. 
    The fact that he also has this right under the order is irrelevant, we believe, because no one is arguing for -- that -- the question is whether or not he has rights of custody under Chilean law, and it's Chilean law that confers the ne exeat right. 
    The fact that he also has this right under the order is -- is irrelevant for this case. 
    If Mrs. Abbott--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="122.411" stopTime="124.891">

    You're not relying on the order; you're just relying on the statute?

    --We are relying just on the statute.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    If that's so, imagine a well-educated American woman marries a man from a foreign country X. 
    They have a divorce. 
    The judge says, the man is completely at fault here, a real rotter. 
    The woman is 100 percent entitled to every possible bit of custody, and the man can see the child twice a year on Christmas Day at 4:00 in the morning. 
    That's it. 
    Now, there's a law like Chile's that says you can't take the child out of the country without the permission of the father too, this person who gets to see the child twice a year. 
    And you're saying that that's custody. 
    It's custody, and -- and what is the woman supposed to do? 
    She can't get a decent job worthy of her education. 
    The -- the -- all the courts said that she's entitled to the child. 
    She has to choose between her life and her child. 
    And -- and is that what this -- this convention is aimed at?

    --Yes.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --Is why interpret it that way, where all that you have is a rule of law that applies to everybody, even in the case I've tried to imagine, where to say it's a right of custody would ruin the life of the woman, would give the husband something which he should -- certainly shouldn't have in any moral term, it would seem, and she comes back to the United States and is forced to give her child back to whatever this country is. 
    I have called it X. 
    Now, why give that kind of interpretation to this statute, which seems to have a purpose that's looking after women and children?

    Ms. Amy Howe 
    Certainly. 
    The -- the statute that you hypothesize in this case, Justice Breyer, reflects the domestic country's judgment that the child should remain in the country, unless the father agrees to its departure.

    --Exactly, Justice Sotomayor. 
    Under Chilean law and presumably under the law that you've hypothesized as well, Justice Breyer, the woman could go to court and ask for permission to leave the country, and that's precisely what Mrs. Abbott could have done in this case.

    Ms. Amy Howe 
    Well, the right to determine whether your child will remain in the country or go to another country is a very important right, and it's simply that that's the -- if that's the law that the -- that the country has decided to establish, the convention doesn't look to why that is. 
    And the drafters expressly envisioned, Justice Breyer, that there would be cases in which one parent would have physical custody of the child, the other parent would simply have the right to determine the child's place of residence.

    Ms. Amy Howe 
    There may be a presumption. 
    We have researched, and we don't believe that that's actually particularly common, Justice Breyer. 
    But certainly in many countries, there's now a presumption of joint custody. 
    And so, in all of those cases, under the convention, the left-behind parent would be entitled to the child's return. 
    And the convention, again, doesn't look to the purpose. 
    It doesn't look to -- there's nothing in the convention, certainly, that requires that there be one category of parents who have rights of custody and are entitled to the return and another category of parents who are not entitled to the return remedy.

    I've read through that, and I'll tell you that, on the basis of my reading through all that stuff, my mind is in equipoise.

    Ms. Amy Howe 
    --Okay. 
    The -- the convention was drafted on the premise that the best interests of children are served by their return to the country of habitual residence, so that the courts in that country can make the decisions. 
    The convention--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --Ms. Howe, wasn't the -- the problem that gave rise to this Abduction Convention just the situation that Justice Breyer brought up? 
    That is, the parent that has visitation rights snatches the child, takes it to that parent's home country, and then you are relying on only the court order. 
    That's why we have the Hague Convention on the Abduction of Children. 
    It wasn't for the -- I mean, this -- this case is not the usual case. 
    The usual case is the noncustodial parent takes the child out of the country where the custodial parent lives. 
    And, internationally, there was a huge problem of getting the child back, and that's why we have the Hague Convention on Abduction, because courts weren't enforcing foreign court orders.
speaker="amy_howe" startTime="807.447" stopTime="856.457">
    Ms. Amy Howe 
    --That's right. 
    They were -- they were not enforcing foreign court orders, and it's true, Justice Ginsburg, as you say, that the sort of prototypical case that was present when they drafted the convention was that one parent, usually the mother, would have sole physical custody and the father would have just visitation, and it was intended to address that problem. 
    But at the time that they drafted the convention, they also had in mind the increasing prevalence of joint custody and included that in the convention. 
    And they also recognized, as I said, that there would be scenarios in which one parent would have what we'd consider to be physical custody of the child; the other parent would have other rights, such as the right to determine the child's place of residence. 
    And they did intend for the parent who did not have physical custody but had other important rights relating to the child, such as the right to determine the child's place of residence, to be--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="856.457" stopTime="908.546">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, what is the -- what is the significance of their breaking down the two categories? 
    One is the rights of custody, and the other is rights of access. 
    Because I take it that under your view of the Chilean law, given that the noncustodial parent will always have this right to block taking the child out of the country, then there's really no difference between the two categories, because every, say, father with the right of access -- not custody, just access -- would automatically by virtue of the law of Chile have this one custodial right; that is, to block taking the child out of the country.
speaker="amy_howe" startTime="908.546" stopTime="925.334">
    Ms. Amy Howe 
    --It's true. 
    But again, Justice Ginsburg, you don't look at why the country attributed those particular rights. 
    You just look at whether the parent has those rights. 
    And I think it's helpful to think of the Chilean system, in effect, as a -- as a form of joint custody, just as some countries have a presumption of what we would regard as joint custody.

    Ms. Ginger D. Anders 
    I agree that Chile has by law decided that the ne exeat right should arise automatically in any parent who has visitation rights.

    Ms. Ginger D. Anders 
    I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. 
    I think the convention -- the explanatory report makes clear that the convention is designed to protect all of the ways in which joint custody can arise and be awarded under domestic law. 
    And I think we have a variety of situations in every country in which joint custodial rights arise automatically. 
    For instance, in the United States, when two parents are married and separated, and there has been no custody order yet, we would say that both of those parents have automatic joint custody rights in the child. 
    In civil law countries, there are a variety of automatic joint custodial decision-making--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1040.583" stopTime="1053.658">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But is there a distinction between the -- what's before us in this case and the different case in which the order specifically said custody shall be joint? 
    The same -- would that not be a different case, in your view?
speaker="ginger_anders" startTime="1053.658" stopTime="1060.373">
    Ms. Ginger D. Anders 
    --It would not be a different case, because the convention protects rights of custody, and it specifies that those rights can be awarded jointly.

    But the decree says that custody -- the mother is the one who has custody.

    Ms. Ginger D. Anders 
    The mother may have most of the custodial rights, what we would think of as physical custody, but the convention protects rights of custody. 
    And I think what's particularly important is that it separates out the right to determine residence as the most important custody right with which it is concerned.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What they seem to be thinking of -- this is -- maybe you can get at what is bothering me. 
    I'm perhaps not articulating it very well. 
    But the -- where there's any kind of a custody right, I normally think there was a human being called a family law judge who has a very tough job, and he has looked at the situation of these two people here and the child. 
    And he said, at least: Smith and Mrs. Smith, you are each going to have a little bit, at least. 
    Now, but in a situation where he says to Mr. Smith, nothing, I want to give you nothing -- he thinks this is Frankenstein's monster; he does not want to give him a single thing -- that, on your interpretation of this statute, that doesn't matter. 
    Just because Chile has a general law that says you can't take anybody out of the country without permission, just because of that, even Frankenstein's monster is considered to have custody for the purposes of this, though the human being who looked at this, called the family law judge, said: Don't let him near that child. 
    All right? 
    Now, that's -- don't pick up on my errors in that I know I haven't stated it quite right, but look at what I'm driving at. 
    And that's what's bothering me.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I know there are ways out, but why should we include custody to be a situation where the human being who looked at this couple thought that that individual, the husband, should have nothing but visit him occasionally on Christmas? 
    Why should we interpret the word "custody" in this treaty to include even that situation, which turns the treaty into a general "return the child" no matter what?

    Ms. Ginger D. Anders 
    --Well, I think the convention's fundamental principles actually are in line with your concerns, because what the convention says is that anytime that the child has been abducted in violation of a decision-making right that the -- that one or the other parent has, then the child should be returned. 
    But the return remedy is not a determination that the child should live with the left-behind parent or that he should live out the rest of his life in Chile. 
    It's simply a determination that the courts of the country of habitual residence should decide what should happen with the child going forward. 
    That's the fundamental premise in it.

    Ms. Ginger D. Anders 
    I think it would generally be an individualized determination.

    --Well, it would be the -- it would be the courts in the country of residence that would be making that determination.

    Can you include that under great psychological harm, so that the child wouldn't have to go back?

    But the fact that it was a typical case means that it wasn't the only type of case, and as -- as family law has developed over the past 30 years, joint rights of custody have become more and more prevalent, and we, therefore, think that this is a joint right to determine residence under the convention, because it gives the father the right to withhold or grant consent to the child's removal from the country.

    Mr. Karl E. Hays 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rights of custody and rights of access are very different and distinct substantive rights. 
    The Hague Convention makes a distinction between those two sets of rights and provides the automatic return remedy only in those situations where there has been a breach of a right of custody. 
    What Mr. Abbott is seeking in this case is to have the Court define a bright-line rule, saying that in any instance where there is a statute or a provision which limits the rights of the custodial parent to remove a child outside of -- of the particular jurisdiction, that any time there is a statute or ordinance or order to that effect, that you confer rights of custody upon an individual who would otherwise only have rights of access.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1674.432" stopTime="1696.545">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, you could say -- you can say that the mother did not have full custodial rights. 
    One custodial right is certainly to determine where the child will live. 
    And the mother did not have that right with respect to taking the child out of the country.
speaker="karl_e_hays" startTime="1696.545" stopTime="1717.837">
    Mr. Karl E. Hays 
    The mother did not have the right to take the child out of the country without either obtaining the permission of the father or obtaining permission of the court to do that. 
    That was a limitation on her exercise of custodial rights. 
    It did not, in and of itself, grant a right to the father. 
    The father was not granted a custodial right.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1717.837" stopTime="1735.419">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, you could say that the limitation on the custodial right is the right of the husband to visit once a month or 3 -- 3 weeks a month.

    Let's assume there's a law that says joint custody; mom can determine the place to live; mom can determine the education of the child; dad can visit when he wants; dad can review choices but not veto them. 
    But we consider this joint custody. 
    Under your view, what defines custody under the convention in a way that would justify an American court saying, that's not a custodial right; even though the law of that domestic jurisdiction defines that and says, that's our terms of joint custody, but we create this kind of joint custody?

    --It's actually not -- it -- and that's -- and that's the position that Mr. Abbott wants this Court to -- to take, is that, well, it's a right, and since it's not a right of access, it has to be a right of custody. 
    It's -- it's actually not a substantive right. 
    It is a means of doing two things, which is what the United States recognized at the time of the drafting of the convention. 
    It is a means of preserving the jurisdiction of the court. 
    It is also a means of enforcing access rights. 
    It's a procedural right; it is not a substantive right. 
    And the -- the Hague Convention clearly makes a distinction between substantive rights of custody and substantive rights of access. 
    But what -- what the -- Mr. Abbott wants--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2133.962" stopTime="2153.998">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    It just says that the right of access is the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child's habitual residence. 
    There's nothing about procedure or substance in this; it says this is what right to custody is, and this is what right of access is.

    Mr. Karl E. Hays 
    --Actually, Your Honor, what the -- what the convention does is not specifically define either term. 
    The -- the terminology is -- is it includes these particular rights, because they didn't want to get specific as to what exactly rights of custody entailed, what exactly rights of access entailed.

    --Textually, when -- when you examine article -- when you examine article 5 in conjunction with article 3 and article 13, that doesn't -- that doesn't follow, because article 3 and article 13 both provide that the rights had to be actually exercised. 
    And when you -- you read the Pérez-Vera report, which is analyzing both of those sections, it -- it's clear that the intent of the drafters at the time was that you had to have actual physical care of the child, because the purpose of this -- of this convention was to prevent the situation that this Court has already discussed, and that is, a parent who has custodial rights, full custody of a child -- the other parent kidnaps the child and takes them to another country in order to seek a -- another court order. 
    In this case, you don't have that situation.

    Mr. Karl E. Hays 
    For purposes of the convention, determining the house where -- where the child lives, determining the issues relating to the care of the child, because that was what the convention was intended to protect, that relationship, because you were having situations where a parent who had a custodial relationship with the child would have that relationship severed by the other parent taking the child, going to another country, and then seeking a court order. 
    And there is one thing that I think needs to be corrected here. 
    When Mrs. Abbott went to Texas, she did not attempt to obtain a court order that would have stripped Mr. Abbott of his rights. 
    In fact, in Texas the presumption is joint managing conservatorship. 
    And she asked for sole managing conservatorship, which would have been the equivalent of what she was granted under Chilean law.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2389.930" stopTime="2416.123">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Why would the signatories of this convention have wanted to regard a parent as having custodial rights if the parent has the right to veto a change of address within a country, but not when the parent has the authority to veto the future nationality and cultural background of the child?
speaker="karl_e_hays" startTime="2416.123" stopTime="2486.439">
    Mr. Karl E. Hays 
    They very well may not have intended either of those instances to create a -- a joint right of -- of custody. 
    At the point in time when the convention was being drafted, joint custodial rights were -- were basically a new concept, and there were -- there was not a lot of experience in the exercise of joint -- of joint custodial rights. 
    The -- the focus of the convention was ensuring that the parent who had the primary relationship with -- with the child, that that relationship would not be severed by someone taking a child out of -- of the country. 
    And that was the focus of -- of the convention, which is why there was a distinct difference drawn between protecting rights of access and protecting rights of -- rights of custody. 
    Rights of access were given different protection mechanisms under -- under the convention, as opposed to the mandatory return that was -- that was envisioned by rights -- by--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2486.439" stopTime="2501.900">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    I don't want to belabor the point too much, but maybe you could just give me an example of a court order that you believe would give a parent the right to determine place of residence and, therefore, would constitute custody within the meaning of the convention.
speaker="karl_e_hays" startTime="2501.900" stopTime="2567.264">
    Mr. Karl E. Hays 
    --Typically -- typically in -- in Texas, Texas adheres to a position of joint managing conservatorship. 
    The presumption in Texas is that both parents have equal ability to make decisions regarding their child. 
    And so the courts will routinely enter orders to say both parents get to decide education, both parents get to decide medical issues. 
    Even in that instance, though, the court will attribute the right to determine the primary residence of the child to one parent or the other, and will impose a -- a restriction on the exercise of that right. 
    They will impose a geographical restriction and say, you can establish residence only in this county or -- or contiguous counties. 
    That's in the nature, though, of a -- of a joint managing conservatorship or joint custody situation. 
    What we have in this case, though, is an instance where all of the custodial rights, all of the decisionmaking authority was given solely to the mother. 
    The--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2567.264" stopTime="2595.863">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Not according to the -- what is it, the Chilean central authority, you know, the letter that was sent to the Second Circuit, I think in the Duran case. 
    The -- the authority within Chile that is responsible for the implementation of this Hague Convention said that it regarded that statute to create a custody right for purposes of the Hague Convention.
speaker="karl_e_hays" startTime="2595.863" stopTime="2657.464">
    Mr. Karl E. Hays 
    --Actually, Your Honor, that -- that statement in the briefs is a -- is a misstatement of what happened in the Beaumont case. 
    In Duran v. Beaumont, there are -- there are distinctions that have not been made by -- by Mr. Abbott. 
    Most importantly, there was no court order in that case. 
    And, when there is no court order, under Chilean law, it is a situation where there is joint custody as a matter of law. 
    Secondly, the actual affidavit -- and the language of the affidavit is quoted in the dissent to that case. 
    The actual affidavit states both parents have the guard and custody of their daughter, and the decisions of major importance must be adopted by both parents. 
    So, clearly, the Chilean authority was referencing in their -- in their affidavits they provided in that case, to the fact that this was a joint custody situation. 
    And they -- they didn't decide it solely on the basis of -- that this ne exeat statute created a right of custody. 
    Also--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I thought there was a sentence in there -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- that said that the statute, under Chilean law, amounted to a right of joint custody.
speaker="karl_e_hays" startTime="2674.142" stopTime="2722.998">
    Mr. Karl E. Hays 
    --The wording -- the wording of -- of the sentence, it includes the statute. 
    It's like the statute, comma, the guard and custody, and also decisions of major importance. 
    It's -- it's a number of things. 
    It's not just singled out the way that Mr. Abbott has -- has presented it to the court. 
    They don't make a statement saying, this statute equates to rights of custody. 
    It's a situation where they say, you take all of this together, the fact that they had the guard and custody of their daughter and the decisions of major importance must be adopted by both parents -- you take all of that together as the finding of the Chilean authority that, in fact, the parent in that case had joint decisions and had -- had rights of custody that were being breached.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2722.998" stopTime="2793.814">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So if I -- if I think, as Justice Alito was starting out, that if the -- a court order in the divorce case says the father and mother will jointly decide what house to live in, that the father has a custody right, if it jointly says the father and the mother will decide what State to live in, that that's a custody right. 
    That it says that the father and mother will decide what city, same. 
    The father and mother will jointly what country to live in, same. 
    But suppose that there is no such decree; rather, the jurisdictional statutes of the nation, without considering this family, have a rule that says they have to live in Chile without Court permission. 
    Is there any way I can draw a line, in terms of this statute, between the two situations, the one being where the divorce judge actually focused on the needs and circumstances of a family, the other being where there was no more than a jurisdictional law in a nation that tried to protect the jurisdiction of its courts?

    Mr. Karl E. Hays 
    Actually, that's incorrect, Your Honor. 
    There was not a custody proceeding in -- in Chile at the time. 
    There were three proceedings going on. 
    There was a protective order proceeding. 
    There was a request by Mr. Abbott to increase his visitation rights, his rights of access. 
    And then there was a child support action where my client was attempting to get some $23,000 in past-due child support. 
    Those were the actions that were pending. 
    There was no attempt at that time by Mr. Abbott to change custody. 
    Just as I was saying, there was no attempt by my client to change custody when she moved to Texas.

    Thank you, counsel. 
    Ms. Howe, you have 4 minutes remaining. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Amy Howe
speaker="amy_howe" startTime="3390.356" stopTime="3540.854">
    Ms. Amy Howe 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    With regard to the child support, there was an ordinary dispute over the amount of child support that's not addressed in the record and which was finally resolved and which Mr. Abbott paid. 
    The question of criminal charges -- we are not aware on any charges pending in Chile. 
    Mr. Abbott has no intent to bring such charges if Mr. Abbott -- if Mrs. Abbott returns to Chile. 
    And with regard to article 13 and the question about the child's age, article 13 is discretionary rather than mandatory, so all that the court in the United States would be doing would be to send the child back so that the courts there could resolve the dispute. 
    Turning to the -- the issues about -- the question of both "determining" and "the place of residence". 
    As, Justice Alito, you alluded, this is an international convention. 
    The convention doesn't care if Mrs. Abbott moved with the child from one address in Chile to another. 
    The convention cares very much when a child is abducted from one country to another. 
    And as regards the definition of residence, it's not defined in article 5(a), but it also appears in article 5(b), which refers to rights of access. 
    It refers to the right to take the child to a place other than the child's habitual residence. 
    And the drafting history on this point makes quite clear that this refers not only to the right to take -- take the child from the home, but to the right to take the child out of the country. 
    In the convention context, the word Mrs. Abbott would attribute to it. 
    The convention contemplates that rights will be held jointly and requires parents to work collaboratively. 
    So in this case, the Abbotts, by virtue of the ne exeat right, by virtue of the ne exeat statute, had a shared, enforceable right to determine whether their child would remain in Chile or would move somewhere else. 
    And despite what Mr. Hays has argued and has argued in his brief, it is a substantive right. 
    The parent who holds the right has the right to ensure that his child remains in the country of habitual residence, which has huge implications for the language and culture in which the child will be raised, and it ensures that the courts of Chile can resolve any disputes relating to the child. 
    It's certainly not a mere enforcement mechanism for Mr. Abbott's access right. 
    With regard to the question of whether or not Mr. Abbott needed to have care and control of the child to invoke rights of custody, article 5(a) of the convention is what defines rights of custody. 
    There is nothing in the text of that statute that requires the person invoking the convention to have physical care of the child.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3540.854" stopTime="3548.275">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Can we read that exception there to say -- "grave injury" and so forth -- can we read it as in essence saying, look, do what's best for the child?
speaker="amy_howe" startTime="3548.275" stopTime="3565.269">
    Ms. Amy Howe 
    That -- you could read that as a form of a best interests of the child standard. 
    I believe that we would regard it as a little bit narrower and a grave risk of harm to the child or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation. 
    But it is a form of the best interest standard, certainly.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3565.269" stopTime="3576.499">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you, do you agree with your opponent, putting aside removing the child from the country, that within Chile itself the custodial parent had the full right to determine the place of residence?
speaker="amy_howe" startTime="3576.499" stopTime="3577.638">
    Ms. Amy Howe 
    We do agree, yes.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3577.638" stopTime="3586.911">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I'm sorry, I'm a little taken aback by your answer to Justice Breyer. 
    You think the grave prosecution standard means whatever is the best interest of the child?
speaker="amy_howe" startTime="3586.911" stopTime="3595.517">
    Ms. Amy Howe 
    No, I believe it's a stricter standard than simply the best interests of the child. 
    It's the -- you know, it's a -- I believe it speaks for itself. 
    It is a grave risk of psychological harm to the child. 
    The convention--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3595.517" stopTime="3604.263">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    And you agree with what I understood to be the Solicitor General's position, that that's an individual-specific and not a culture-specific determination?
speaker="amy_howe" startTime="3604.263" stopTime="3641.185">
    Ms. Amy Howe 
    --Yes, we do. 
    Article 13 is simply an affirmative defense to the -- once a judge has found that rights of custody exist and have been breached. 
    There's certainly nothing in the history of the convention that reflects any intent by the drafters to narrow the meaning of 13. 
    And finally, Mr. Hays cannot point to anything other than a single French trial court decision that holds squarely in his favor, and when that trial court decision was raised at the 1993 Special Commission meeting, it garnered no support from the delegates.
