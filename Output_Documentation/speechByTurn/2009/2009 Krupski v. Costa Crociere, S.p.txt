    Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs when an amended pleading “relate backs” to the date of a timely filed original pleading and is thus itself timely even though it's filed outside an applicable statute of limitations. 
    Where an amended pleading changes a party or party’s name, the rule requires among other things that within a certain time period after the pleading was filed, “party to be brought in by amendment knew or should have known that the action would've been brought against it but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity”. 
    In this case, the plaintiff, the petitioner here was a passenger on a cruise ship when she tripped and broke her leg. 
    To recover for her injury, she sued a company called Costa Cruise which had issued her ticket. 
    Costa Cruise responded that she should have sued a related company called Costa -- I am going to ask my colleague Justice Scalia to say it right.

    Crociere-- I want to put the Spanish accent on it. 
    Crociere instead after the statute of limitations had expired, she amended her complaint to add Costa Crociere but the District Court held that her complaint did not relate back because she had chosen to sue Costa Cruise instead of Costa Crociere and thus had not made a “mistake concerning the party of the proper party's identity.” 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed on two grounds, it first held that rule 15(c) was not satisfied because the plaintiff knew or should have known of the proper defendant before filing her original complaint. 
    The court also held that relation of that was not appropriate because the plaintiff had unduly delayed in seeking to amend. 
    We hold that neither of these reasons was a proper ground on which to deny relation back, relation back under rule 15(c) depends on what the party to be added knew or should have known, not on the amending the party's knowledge or timeliness in amending, this is clear from the text of the rule which focuses on what the party to be added knew or should have known. 
    Moreover that a plaintiff knows of a party's existence does not preclude her from making a mistake with respect to the party's identity, making a deliberate choice to sue one party instead of another while fully understanding the factual and legal difference between the two parties is the antithesis of making a mistake concerning the proper party's identity. 
    However a plaintiff may choose to sue one defendant over another, based on a misunderstanding about their own identities that kind of deliberate but mistaken choice should not foreclose a finding that rule 15(c) has been satisfied. 
    Similarly there is no support in the rule for the conclusion that a plaintiff’s dilatory conduct can justify the denial of relation back under rule 15(c). 
    The rule sets forth an exclusive list of requirements and the plaintiff's diligence is not among them. 
    Under these principles, the court below erred and in denying relation back. 
    The plaintiff's original complaint explained that she meant to sue the company that “owned, operated, managed, supervised and controlled the ship on which she was injured”. 
    That complaint also indicated mistakenly that Costa Cruise performed these roles because Costa Crociere had constructive knowledge of the complaint within the time period specified by the rule, it should have known that it was not named as a defendant in that complaint, only because of the plaintiff's misunderstanding about which Costa entity was in charge of the ship. 
    Clearly “a mistake concerning the proper party's identity”. 
    Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
