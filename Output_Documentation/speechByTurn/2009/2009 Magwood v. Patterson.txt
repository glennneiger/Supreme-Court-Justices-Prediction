    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    The Second case I have to announce number 09-158, Magwood versus Patterson. 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
    Petitioner Magwood murdered a sheriff and was sentenced to death in 1981. 
    The state courts denied relief, but the Federal District Court granted a conditional writ of Habeas Corpus on the ground that state trial failed to consider Magwood's metal problems when sentencing him to death. 
    The state trial court held a complete and new sentencing hearing, took Magwood's mental problems into account and entered a new death sentence in 1986. 
    The Alabama courts denied relief from the new sentence, but the District Court granted another conditional writ of habeas Corpus. 
    This time the District Court found that the Alabama law at the time of Magwood's crime did not provide them with fair warning that the crime made him eligible for the death penalty. 
    The state appealed, arguing that Magwood's fair warning claim should have been dismissed under 28 U.S.C., Section 2244(b), a provision of the federal habeas corpus statute that restricts review of claims presented in second or successive Habeas applications. 
    Agreeing with the state, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the District Court's decision granting relief on the fair warning claim. 
    We granted certiorari and now reverse. 
    Magwood presented his fair warning claim in his first application challenging his new death sentence. 
    And a first application challenging a new judgment cannot be second or successive under Section 2244(b). 
    Accordingly for the reasons more fully explained in an opinion filed with the clerk today we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
    Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justice Stevens and Sotomayor join. 
    Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Ginsburg and Alito join.
