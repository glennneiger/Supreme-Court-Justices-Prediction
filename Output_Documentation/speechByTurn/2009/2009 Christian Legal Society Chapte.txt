    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    This case presents a novel First Amendment question, may a public law school condition official recognition of a student group, on the group’s agreement to open membership to all students, who want to join. 
    We hold that a law school may maintain such an open access policy to meet First Amendment measurement the school need not provide a religion based exception. 
    Respondent Hastings College of Law is a state operated law school, part of the University of California system. 
    Hastings extends official recognition to student groups through its “Registered Student Organization” or RSO program. 
    Several benefits attend RSO status, prime advantages of RSO qualification in addition to access to school facilities and methods of communicating with students. 
    There are subsidies for the organizations events. 
    This funding comes from mandatory, student activities fees, imposed without exception, on all students. 
    To gain recognition, RSO’s must agree to comply with Hastings Nondiscrimination Policy, that policy tracking California Law, bars discrimination on several bases including religion and sexual orientation. 
    Hastings interprets the policy to require RSO’s to accept all-comers. 
    For example, as the parties have stipulated to be true, a Democratic group cannot exclude students holding Republican political police. 
    Hastings policy is not unique, other law schools, for example, Georgetown University Law Center adhere to similar all-comers policies. 
    At the beginning of the 2004 academic year, petitioner Christian Legal Society or CLS sought to become an RSO at Hastings. 
    CLS accepts as members only students who share the society’s religious beliefs and views about sexual conduct. 
    Because CLS does not welcome all-comers, Hastings refused to grant it, RSO status but allowed the society to engage in expressive activities on campus using CLS’s own resources. 
    CLS filed suit contending that the First Amendment required Hastings to accept the society as an RSO. 
    The District Court affirmed by the Court of Appeals granted summary judgment to Hastings. 
    We affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment relying on the party’s stipulation of the undisputed facts we hold that Hastings all-comers policy does not unconstitutionally inhibit CLS’s freedom of speech or expression. 
    CLS asked us not to focus on Hastings’s all-comers policy but on the school's written Nondiscrimination Policy. 
    We decline to do so, CLS stipulated in no uncertain terms that Hastings embracive all-comers policy governs RSO’s because CLS is bound by that stipulation we consider only whether the all-comers policy complies with the Constitution. 
    This Court's decisions regarding limited public-forums provides the framework for our analysis. 
    A state creates such a forum when it confines use of its resources to certain groups. 
    State regulation of speech in a limited public forum must meet two conditions; it must be both reasonable in light of the forum’s purposes and viewpoint neutral. 
    Hastings’s all-comers policy we are satisfied meets these criteria. 
    First, the policy ensures that the educational and social opportunities afforded by RSOs are accessible to all students. 
    RSOs as I just noted, are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student activity fees. 
    The policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member. 
    Second, the policy enables Hastings to police compliance with the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy, without inquiring into an RSO’s motivation for membership decisions. 
    Third, the policy to the extent that it brings together individuals with diverse beliefs, encourages tolerance, cooperation and learning amongst students. 
    Fourth, the policy incorporates and advances the state-law antidiscrimination prescriptions. 
    Hastings’s policy is all the more creditworthy given the alternative channels open to CLS communication with students. 
    Hastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct meetings and to advertise its events. 
    CLS, in fact hosted a variety of activities the year after Hastings denied it recognition. 
    Attendants at CLS events that year far from dwindling notably increased. 
    As to viewpoint neutrality, it is hard to imagine a more viewpoint neutral policy than one requiring all student groups to accept all-comers. 
    CLS ultimately contends that the all-comers policy is pretextual and selectively applied but the Courts below did not address CLS’s pretext claim and this Court is not a proper place to air the issue in the first instance. 
    On remand, the Ninth Circuit may take up CLS’s pretext argument, if and to the extent that the argument was properly preserved. 
    Finally, and of overarching importance, in mounting this lawsuit, CLS seeks not parity with other organizations but preferential exemption from Hastings’s all-comers policy. 
    The First Amendment shields CLS against state prohibition of its expressive activity, exclusionary as that activity may be but CLS, we hold enjoys no constitutional right to state support of its selectivity. 
    Justice Stevens and Kennedy have filed concurring opinions. 
    Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas join.
