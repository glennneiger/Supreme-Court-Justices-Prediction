    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Section 1291 of the judicial code confers on federal courts of appeals jurisdiction to review final decisions of the district courts. 
    Although the final decisions typically are ones that trigger the entry of judgment, we have recognized that they also include a small class of Prejudgment orders that resolve important questions collateral to the merits of an action and are effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment. 
    In this case, petitioner Mohawk Industries attempted to bring a collateral order appeal after the district court ordered it to disclose certain confidential information on the ground that Mohawk had waived its attorney-client privilege. 
    The Court of Appeals dismissed Mohawk's appeal for want of jurisdiction. 
    The question before us is whether disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine. 
    We hold that they do not. 
    We readily acknowledge the importance of the attorney-client privilege. 
    By assuring confidentiality the privilege encourages full and frank communications between clients and counsel which in turn promotes a well functioning adversarial system. 
    The crucial question, however, is not whether the privilege is important in the abstract. 
    It is whether deferring appellate review until final judgment so imperils the vitality of the privilege as to justify the cost of allowing immediate appeal of all adverse, privilege rulings. 
    In our estimation, traditional post-judgment appeals generally suffice to protect the right of litigants and to assure adequate incentives for candid attorney-client consultation. 
    Moreover when litigants are confronted with particularly novel or injurious privilege rulings, they have several potential avenues of immediate review apart from collateral order appeal, including interlocutory appeal, pursuant to section 1292 (b), a mandamus. 
    In short, the benefits of extending the collateral order doctrine to attorney-client privilege rulings are likely to be minimal while the cost might well be significant. 
    Authorizing litigants to pursue successive piecemeal appeals of all such rulings which disrupt the orderly progress of ongoing litigation and needlessly burden the Court of Appeals. 
    Accordingly we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
    Justice Thomas concurs in part and concurs in the judgment.
