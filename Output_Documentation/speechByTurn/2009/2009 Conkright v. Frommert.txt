    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I have our Opinion this Morning in case 08-810, Conkright versus Frommert. 
    This is a case arising under a Federal Law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or ERISA. 
    That law governs pension plans; under ERISA, the companies setting up such a plan can specify that the administrator of the plan has discretion to interpret its terms. 
    In such a case, the Court construing the plan must defer to the administrator's interpretation as long as it is reasonable. 
    Now here the Lower Courts determined that the administrator's interpretation of a plan provision was unreasonable and they explained the basis for that decision. 
    The question is whether the Courts should go ahead and decide the correct interpretation of the plan on their own, how the plan should be read once the erroneous interpretation is taken out of the plan or whether the issue should go back to the administrator to exercise his discretion anew, now that he has been told what was wrong with his original interpretation. 
    So in other words, is the rule one strike and you're out or try again, for the reasons set forth in an opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that the rule is for the administrator to try again. 
    We think such an approach is more consistent with the principles that cause us to defer to the reasonable interpretation of administrators in the first place. 
    Now of course, if there are signs of bad faith or an administrator just keeps adopting unreasonable interpretation, courts will not have to defer but one honest mistake should not mean that courts can take over the administrator's job. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded it for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
    Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito joined the opinion. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens and Ginsburg have joined. 
    Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
