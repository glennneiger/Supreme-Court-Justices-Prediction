    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I next announce the decision in Number 08-876, Black versus United States. 
    As In Skilling the defendants in this case were charged with fraud. 
    At trial the Government pursued alternative theories, money or property fraud and honest-services-fraud. 
    The government sought to pinpoint the theory or theories on which the jury relied in the event of a conviction. 
    To that purpose the government proposed special verdict forms asking the Jury to say whether the verdict rested on money or property fraud or honest-services-fraud or both. 
    The defendants resisted and the government ultimately acquiesced in submitting the case to the jury for an unelaborated general verdict. 
    On appeal the defendants urged the invalidity of the honest-services-fraud instructions. 
    The Seventh Circuit found no infirmity in those instructions but went on to move that in any event the defendants had forfeited their objection to the instructions. 
    Defendants did show the Court of Appeal said by opposing the government proposed special verdict forms which would have revealed whether the jury found honest-services-fraud or only money or property fraud. 
    We reverse the Seventh Circuit's judgment under our decision today In Skilling; the honest-services instructions given to the Jury in this case were incorrect. 
    By timely objecting to those instructions at trial, the defendants secure their right to challenge them on appeal. 
    The defendants did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in the government proposed special verdict forms. 
    As In Skilling however, we leave for consideration on remand, the question whether the instructional error was ultimately harmless. 
    Justices Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Kennedy has also filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
