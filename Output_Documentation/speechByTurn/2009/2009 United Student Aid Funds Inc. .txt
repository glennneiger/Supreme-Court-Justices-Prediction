    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us on the writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    The bankruptcy code provides that, a debtor in Chapter 13 proceeding may obtain a discharge of certain student loan debts, only if the failure to discharge that debt would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and his dependence. 
    According to the Federal rules of bankruptcy procedure, the bankruptcy court must make this determination of undue hardship in an adversary proceeding which the parties seeking the termination must initiate by filing a summons and complaint on those who could be adversely affected by the discharge. 
    Francisco Espinoza, the debtor in this case filed a Chapter 13 plan with the Bankruptcy Court and that proposed to discharge a portion of his student loan debt but he failed to initiate an adversary proceeding to determine undue hardship. 
    His creditor United Student Aid Funds received notice of his plan but did not object to its contents or Espinoza's failure to initiate an adversary proceeding. 
    The Bankruptcy Court confirmed Espinoza’s plan as written and United did not appeal. 
    Years later United filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60 (b) (4), asking the Bankruptcy Court to declare its confirmation order void. 
    United argued that the order was void for two reasons. 
    First, because it was premised on a violation of the bankruptcy code and rules, specifically the bankruptcy court's failure to find undue hardship in an adversary proceeding and second because United’s Due Process rights were violated when Espinoza failed to serve United with the required summons and complaint. 
    The Bankruptcy Court ruled on the motion and parties sought review in the District Court and ultimately in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    The Court of Appeals ruled for Espinoza. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm that judgment. 
    The Bankruptcy Court's order confirming Espinoza's plan is not void under rule 60 (b) (4), the rule is a narrow exception to finality that applies only in rare instance in which a judgment is premised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or on a violation of due process that deprives the party of notice or the opportunity to be heard. 
    The error alleged by United falls in neither category. 
    United does not argue that the bankruptcy court’s error was jurisdictional and Espinoza's failure to serve united with a summons and complaint did not violate United's due process rights because United received actual notice of the filing and contents of Espinoza's plan. 
    For reasons set out in our opinion we decline to expand the availability of relief under rule 60 (b) (4), to cover other types of judgment defects. 
    The opinion of the court is unanimous.
