    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The False Claims Act, which was enacted during the Civil War, authorizes not only the Attorney General, but also private parties known as qui tam relators to recover from those who make false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States. 
    Since 1986, the Act has contained a provision known as the public disclosure bar that forbids qui tam suits when the underlying information has already entered the public domain through certain channels. 
    In particular, the 1986 Act bars qui tam suits based on allegations disclosed “in a congressional, administrative, or GAO report.” 
    The question in this case is whether that public disclosure bar extends not just to federal administrative sources, but also to state and local sources. 
    For reasons set forth in an opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that the bar does apply to nonfederal sources and therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case. 
    In a portion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted a few days ago, Congress adopted an amendment to the False Claim Act that expressly limits the disclosure bar to Federal Administrative Reports. 
    Because that amendment is not retroactive, it does not affect our decision today. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Breyer has joined.
