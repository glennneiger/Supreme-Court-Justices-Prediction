    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    The Sixth Amendment secures to persons charged with crime, the right to be tried by an impartial jury drawn from sources reflecting a fair cross section on the community. 
    The question presented in this case was that right accorded to responding Diapolis Smith, an African-American convicted of second degree murder by an all white jury in Kent County, Michigan in 1993. 
    In Duren v. Missouri a 1979 decision, this Court described three showings essential to prove a violation of the Sixth Amendments fair cross section requirement. 
    A defendant must show that a group qualifying as ‘distinctive’ is not fairly represented in jury pools and that the under-representation is due to systematic exclusion in the jury selection process. 
    The defendant in Duren readily met all three measures. 
    He complained of the dearth of women in the Jackson County Missouri jury pool. 
    Women 54% of the jury eligible population, but only 14.5% of those in the pool from which jurors withdrawn. 
    Identifying the systematic cause of the under-representation, Duren pointed to Missouri's law exempting all women from mandatory jury service and to the manner in which Jackson County administered the exemption. 
    We have reviewed the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, holding that Smith satisfied the criteria established by Duren and granting him Habeas Corpus relief. 
    The disparity in smith’s case was not so dramatic as in Duren. 
    At the time of Smith’s trial African-Americans were 7.28% of the County’s jury eligible population and 6% of the pool from which jurors were drawn. 
    Warranting heavyweight, the Supreme Court of Michigan in a cogent decision had held that Smith’s evidence failed to prove systematic exclusion. 
    Relevant to our appraisal in 1996 in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Congress placed tight constraints on federal Habeas review of state court convictions. 
    Nevertheless the Sixth Circuit found the matter settled, a decision contrary to its own that's what it said would involve an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. 
    We reverse the Sixth Circuit’s judgment. 
    No decision of this Court clearly establishes Smith’s entitlement to Federal Court relief. 
    The Sixth Circuit featured Kent County’s practice of assigning prospective jurors first to local district boards. 
    Only after local needs were filled did a county assign persons remaining on the master list to the countywide circuit court, the sole court competent to hear felony cases like Smith’s. 
    The Michigan Supreme Court however had rejected Smith’s principle plea for lack of proof that the assignment procedure in fact posed significant under-representation. 
    As that determination was not at all unreasonable the Sixth Circuit had no warrant to disturb it. 
    Smith also urged that a host of factors combined to reduce systematically the number of African-Americans appearing on Kent County jury list, for example, Kent County’s practice of executing people without adequate proof of alleged hardship and the refusal of Kent County police to enforce court orders for prospective jurors to appear. 
    This Court it suffices to observe has never held or even hinted that a bare cross section claim can be grounded in generally applied jury selection process features of the kind Smith lists. 
    Our decision reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is unanimous. 
    Justice Thomas has also filed a concurring opinion.
