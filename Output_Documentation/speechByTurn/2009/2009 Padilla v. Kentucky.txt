    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    A petitioner Jose Padilla is a non citizen who's been a lawful resident of the United States for more than 40 years. 
    He now faces automatic deportation because he pleaded guilty to transporting marijuana in Kentucky. 
    Padilla claims that his attorney not only failed to advise him that his guilty plea would lead his deportation, but also told him that he did not have to worry about his immigration status since he had been in the country so long. 
    He now seeks to vacate his plea alleging that it was the product of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. 
    The Supreme Court of Kentucky rejected Padilla's claim, concluding that the Sixth Amendment does not protect a criminal defendant from erroneous advice in this context because deportation is just a collateral consequence of the criminal prosecution. 
    We disagree. 
    In this case the consequences of Padilla's plea could easily have been determined from reading the statute that governs remove. 
    His deportation was presumptively mandatory and his counsel's advice was incorrect. 
    Padilla has thus demonstrated deficient attorney performance. 
    Whether he is entitled to relief, depends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter that we do not address because it was not reached below. 
    We therefore reverse the judgment of the Kentucky Supreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings. 
    Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment that is joined by the Chief Justice. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion that is joined by Justice Thomas.
