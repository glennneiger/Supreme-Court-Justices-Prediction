    General Kagan.

    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Establishment Clause does not prohibit the sensible action Congress took in enacting Section 8121 and thereby divesting the Federal Government of the property at issue in this case. 
    The district court gave Congress two basic options when it found the Sunrise Rock War Memorial unconstitutional. 
    First, Congress could accede to permanently removing the memorial, ending the dispute, but also doing away with a memorial that for 75 years had commemorated America's fallen soldiers and had acquired deep meaning for the veterans in the community. 
    Or, second, Congress--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    General Kagan, just as a factual matter, is there any other national memorial that consists of a solitary cross, just that one symbol and no other?
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="67.426" stopTime="111.031">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --I don't believe that there is, Justice Ginsburg. 
    There are national memorials that have some religious content to them. 
    There is, for example, a statue of a Catholic priest holding a very large cross, but most national memorials are -- are not religious. 
    Some are. 
    The -- the -- you know, I think that it would even be possible, for example, to make a church or a synagogue a national memorial. 
    If -- if Dr. King's church were selected as a national memorial because of -- in order to honor Dr. King, I think that would be permissible. 
    If--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="111.031" stopTime="127.058">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, I was just curious as a factual matter whether this lone cross, if -- if there was any other memorial like that, and your answer is no, but there could be other religiously oriented memorials?
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="127.058" stopTime="134.272">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --Yes, and there is at least one religiously oriented memorial that I know of, which is a priest holding a cross.

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    What are the practical consequences of something being designated as a national memorial?
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="139.272" stopTime="163.058">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Very little, Justice Alito. 
    In fact, it has no consequences in terms of the government's supervision of the land. 
    National memorials can be on private land or on public land. 
    If they are on private land, nothing goes along with the designation by way of more extensive regulation or supervision by the National Park Service.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="163.058" stopTime="176.270">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Is the -- is the private property owner who has this designation free to destroy it after it's been designated a national memorial?
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="176.270" stopTime="186.674">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 
    The Veterans of Foreign Wars here could in fact take down this memorial once it is transferred to them, if the Court allows that transfer.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="186.674" stopTime="191.793">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Could they then substitute whatever other memorial they chose?

    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    The--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="192.624" stopTime="194.902">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Or would there have to be some government approval?
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="194.902" stopTime="209.708">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --No, no, no. 
    The reversionary clause which is at issue, which is a part of the transfer legislation, says that the VFW will have to put up a veterans memorial, but the content of that veterans memorial is entirely up to the VFW.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="209.708" stopTime="224.904">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But it wouldn't automatically require acquire a national memorial status, would it, when the government hasn't seen it, hasn't -- I thought that to get national memorial status, the government has to approve what you put up.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="224.904" stopTime="280.267">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Yes, that's correct. 
    If the VFW took down this memorial and substituted a different memorial, that memorial would not at that point have national memorial status. 
    There is a little bit of a dispute as to whether the -- the VFW could in fact take down the memorial or whether it's designation as a national memorial would prevent them from doing that. 
    I think it's quite clear, if you look at the statute, that the Section 1369, which is what the Respondents point to, would not prevent the VFW from taking down this memorial, if it so wanted to, because 1369 applies only to national memorials which are on public property. 
    If the transfer were to take place, of course, it would not be on public property, or it would not be under the supervision, in any way, of the Federal Government. 
    So--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="280.267" stopTime="318.096">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    General Kagan, before you go -- go on with your argument, you presented it as -- as though the issue before us is the -- the conveying of the land. 
    But is it? 
    What this was was simply an affirmation of the prior injunction. 
    The court of appeals said the prior injunction had not been mooted by the -- by the transfer of the land. 
    So isn't really the issue whether that -- that prior injunction, when the land did indeed belong to the government, whether that prior injunction was valid?
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="318.096" stopTime="328.731">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --Well, there is a question in this case whether the prior injunction was valid and was the display itself a violation of the Establishment Clause.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="328.731" stopTime="329.011">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="329.011" stopTime="337.493">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    But the government argued below that that question had been mooted out because of the passage of the transfer legislation.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="337.493" stopTime="339.118">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But didn't the court of appeals say no?
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="339.118" stopTime="341.587">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    The court of appeals did say no, but it remands the government--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="341.586" stopTime="351.659">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So -- so what we have before us is the court of appeals' affirmation of the prior injunction, which applied to a cross on public land.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="351.659" stopTime="371.278">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --Well, I think what you have before you, there were of course two stages in this litigation, and the first stage declared the display unconstitutional, and then the second stage declared the transfer as well unconstitutional or at least a violation of the prior injunction.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="371.278" stopTime="376.994">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Of course, if I -- if I thought the display wasn't unconstitutional, the transfer would a fortiori not--
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="376.994" stopTime="407.902">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Well, that is correct. 
    We do think that the issue before the Court now is the congressional legislation which has been passed, which is the transfer legislation, that that has essentially changed the situation on the ground, so that no longer is the question whether the display from the -- whether the display by the government would be constitutional, but only whether the government has the ability to transfer this property and -- and to give up all supervision, all control over it. 
    So that the message--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="407.902" stopTime="520.766">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I don't see why that's the issue before us. 
    Look, procedurally this is a little boring, but it seems pretty well established in the law. 
    I read a case called Toledo Scale and then there are a bunch of cases on jurisdiction, which I'm not going to name them because I'm sure you looked at them, but Travelers Indemnity, et cetera. 
    And it seems to me they make absolutely clear that once a litigant, you and the others, have had an opportunity to raise a matter and now the case is over, done, but for an injunction that stays in, all those issues that they previously raised or could have raised are gone; that the only question left is whether the government has complied with the injunction. 
    So I read the injunction. 
    The injunction says the government is enjoined from permitting the display of the Latin cross, period. 
    Once this law takes effect and you follow it, you are violating that injunction. 
    You don't need nine proceedings to see that. 
    You are violating it. 
    Now, if you don't like the injunction because you think the statute has so changed the circumstances there is no need for it, there is a remedy. 
    You go back to the district court and you say: Judge, change the injunction. 
    But you haven't done that. 
    And therefore, the only question before us is whether the Ninth Circuit is right in saying when you carry the statute into effect, you are violating this injunction, which I think no one could say you aren't. 
    Now, now, that -- that's a very technical boring issue. 
    I don't know why we heard this issue, but I don't see how we could reach any other issue in this case.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="520.766" stopTime="576.424">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --Justice Breyer, I think we are in perfect compliance with the injunction and have been since the day it was issued. 
    Now, in fact there were two injunctions issued. 
    As I said, there were two stages of this litigation. 
    The first stage ended in an injunction that said do not display the war memorial. 
    In compliance with that injunction, the next day the war memorial was covered. 
    So we were in compliance from the -- from the moment that the decision issued. 
    Now then, Respondents went back to the district court and asked for additional relief, because what -- during the first court of appeals hearing, Congress had passed this transfer statute. 
    And so the Respondents went back and said: In addition to the injunction that you previously gave us, we essentially need a new injunction and that injunction will be to stop the transfer.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="576.424" stopTime="578.362">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But that's not what I'm talking about.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="578.362" stopTime="635.587">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I thought the Respondents asked to have the injunction enforced. 
    It is typical, you get an injunction -- and I'm glad that the government has recognized that that was indeed a final decision because you appealed it to the Ninth Circuit under 1291 as a final decision. 
    Then the question is, are you complying with the injunction. 
    One side says, the winner -- who by the way has unquestioned standing to enforce the injunction that is now final that that party obtained -- the winner says: Court, please enforce the injunction. 
    They are not asking for a new injunction. 
    They say this injunction, as Justice Breyer just explained, says, do not permit the cross. 
    The party comes in and says: Here's my injunction; court, all I want you to do is enforce it.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="635.587" stopTime="638.445">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Justice Ginsburg, this is much more than an enforcement action.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="638.445" stopTime="651.907">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    We are talking about the first. 
    We are talking about the first injunction. 
    The first injunction says that the government may not permit display. 
    You've covered it up, so you are not permitting display. 
    You are in compliance.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="651.907" stopTime="652.363">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    That is correct.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="652.363" stopTime="676.836">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But what the plaintiff here said is that when you comply with this statute, you will not be in compliance, because you will turn it over to the VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted it to be displayed. 
    Now, that I can see is an issue before us. 
    But I don't see any other issue before us.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="676.836" stopTime="707.214">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Justice Breyer, again, the Respondents had to go back to the district court in order not just to enforce the injunction, which said don't display the statue, but to get additional relief, which was don't transfer the statue. 
    If the transfer had taken place, it would no longer have been the government's property, the government would not have permitted or not permitted the display because it wasn't the government's property to permit or not to permit the display.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="707.214" stopTime="723.942">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --It seems to me unreasonable to read the injunction to say the government shall not permit anybody to display a cross on that land no matter who owns the land. 
    I assume the injunctions meant you will not permit the cross to be displayed on this parcel of government land.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="723.942" stopTime="771.704">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    And the Ninth Circuit specifically said -- when this came to the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit was asked by the Respondents. 
    In order to rule on the transfer legislation, the Ninth Circuit specifically said: We are not going to do that; that's a decision for another day, a separate decision. 
    Because of that, the Respondents had to go back to the district court and had to get the district court essentially to modify the injunction and to provided additional relief. 
    Now, there is some question as to whether the standing question here, just the standing question is precluded, and our view is that it is not preclude, because the way the government views this is it's one entire litigation in which all issues are open.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="771.704" stopTime="808.780">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Do you know, General Kagan, any case in which there has been a permanent injunction ordered, final, no more appeals are possible, where -- and standing was in question, raised, litigated, and decided, and then when the party who won the injunction comes to the court and says, court, please enforce the injunction, that you can say, now we can go back to square one and argue again about standing? 
    I don't see how you can revive what has been determined by a final judgment.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="808.780" stopTime="822.090">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Well, either this is one litigation, in which all cases are before the Court, or it's too entirely separate litigations, in which case the Court has an obligation to independently consider the standing question.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="822.090" stopTime="830.681">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, we know it isn't that because, as I think you pointed out, the same docket number. 
    This wasn't a new complaint. 
    This was a motion to enforce the judgment.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="830.681" stopTime="845.486">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    It couldn't have been a motion to enforce the judgment because the government was in compliance with the judgment and because the Ninth Circuit had said that the question that respondents were raising was an entirely separate issue for another day, according to the Ninth Circuit.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="845.486" stopTime="886.002">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I would suppose -- I guess I don't agree with your dichotomy, either it's the same action or it's entirely separate. 
    I would suppose it could be some issues carry over and are the same, and perhaps standing is one of those. 
    Other issues are completely new, such as the effect of the legislation, which couldn't have been before the district court since it hadn't been passed. 
    But standing is different. 
    I mean, once it's been determined that there is standing and that is reflected in a final judgment, then I think the later aspects are simply whether the person -- once it's embodied in a judgment, I think that is the basis for standing and not the earlier questions of whether he visited it enough or planned to visit enough.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="886.002" stopTime="923.781">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, we could not have taken the standing question to this Court in the -- in the procedural posture that the case was at at that point. 
    It would have been really an irresponsible action on our part to ask this Court to address the standing issue after the first court of appeals judgment where -- where we knew that we were going to relitigate the question of the validity of the transfer. 
    We couldn't have come to you, we wouldn't have come to you, as the Solicitor General's Office and asked you to adjudicate a decision that was as likely as not going to be irrelevant.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="923.781" stopTime="958.409">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    I don't understand -- I don't understand that point at all. 
    If you thought that he didn't have standing to challenge the cross at all and that the injunction itself directing you to cover up the cross was wrong, you should have come to the Court. 
    It was a permanent injunction. 
    You were told you have interlocutory appeal rights, you have final judgment rights. 
    At any point you could have come and said: The order for us to take that flag -- to take that cross off this land was just plain wrong.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="958.409" stopTime="977.824">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    I think, Justice Sotomayor, you are right that we could have, but I don't think that we would have used our discretion, in a sense knocking on this Court's door, the Solicitor General's Office discretion, in order to ask you to decide a question that was as likely or not going to be completely irrelevant depending on what happened with respect to the transfer statute.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="977.824" stopTime="1023.523">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    But interlocutory appeal or finality doesn't matter what you are going to do to get away from the injunction. 
    The issue is did you give up any rights to challenge any of the issues embodied in that injunction and you haven't answered why not. 
    You may have a right, and you do, to challenge a modification of that injunction. 
    That's what you are here to do, to say the Ninth Circuit erred in modifying the injunction and stopping the transfer. 
    Perfectly legitimate point, because the injunction has been changed. 
    But you can't go back and relitigate whether he had standing to challenge that -- the presence of that cross.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1023.523" stopTime="1069.848">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Well, Justice Sotomayor, I appreciate the distinction that you are making between the standing question and the merits question and I think you are exactly right as to that point. 
    But whatever the question as to whether we have given up the standing question, certainly there is no such question on the merits of this -- of the validity of this transfer. 
    But with respect, I think that the standing question is -- is not the way you described it. 
    And it's partly because we couldn't have come to this Court or we wouldn't have come, is a better way to say it. 
    We would have thought that it was not the right kind of position to ask the Court to take certiorari on a question that basically was very likely, we thought, was very likely to go away.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1069.848" stopTime="1088.199">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but that -- that's because -- that's because you assume the act is going to be valid. 
    You could have come here and said: This is such an important case Congress is taking action, and therefore, you should hear our standing argument to avoid the necessity of the Legislative Branch having to come in. 
    You could have said that.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1088.199" stopTime="1098.947">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Well, but we didn't, because we did think that Congress had acted appropriately and that the congressional act was valid, and continue to do so, continue to think that this--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1098.947" stopTime="1145.862">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Yes, but the standing issue was independently important to the government, because the government can face this kind of question again, and if you right -- if you were right on the standing point -- I mean, I don't understand why the government would not have had a strong incentive to say, we want to get rid of these cases on the standing ground, we think the Court was wrong on standing. 
    But in any case, you didn't do that, and I think that you started your argument this morning in the right place when you said, let's talk about this law. 
    Congress said, accepting arguendo that the Court was right, here's a law that cures the constitutional defect. 
    And that's where you were -- that's where you started your argument. 
    Maybe you can pick up with that. 
    But--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1145.862" stopTime="1191.081">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But just I want to just get this clear procedurally. 
    I'm sorry. 
    It'll take one more second. 
    As I read this, there is no modification of any injunction. 
    What the -- what the Respondent asked for, he said: Judge, either hold that the transfer violates the current injunction, or modify the injunction. 
    Then what the district court did do is he said the proposed transfer violates the permanent injunction. 
    The permanent injunction is in the, like, the third paragraph of the July 24th order, and it says, you are permanently enjoined from permitting the display of the Latin cross. 
    Therefore, he rejected the need to modify it, and held that--

    --Justice Breyer.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1191.393" stopTime="1216.069">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --this violates the injunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that. 
    So is there any question in this case of modifying? 
    Is there any question other than the one that I think Justice Scalia was taking a good argument about, whether the proposed statute violates the July 24th injunction? 
    That's what the case is about. 
    Or why am I wrong?
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1216.069" stopTime="1248.478">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    You -- you are incorrect, Justice Breyer, because in addition to saying this violates the previously given injunction, the district court said, you are enjoined from transferring this property in accordance with this statute. 
    And so there was additional relief, additional relief that the Ninth Circuit said was additional relief that it wasn't deciding in the first go-round, and that's -- and that places the question, the merits question of the validity of this transfer, directly before the Court.

    Mr. Chief Justice, there are certainly limits to the way that the government can transfer property, and I would give you a few of them. 
    If -- if it was not a bona fide sale, so that there wasn't proper consideration; if -- if there was only religious purpose, so that there was no secular purpose involved; or if after the sale the property was indistinguishable from government property, so that everybody naturally thought that this was government property.

speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1358.105" stopTime="1396.325">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    We do not, Justice Stevens. 
    The government has argued -- argued below that there was no violation prior to the transfer statute, and that remains the government's position, although, as I said to Justice Scalia, we think that that position has been overtaken by events and that the only question before the Court is the transfer statute. 
    I was going to go on to say to the Chief Justice that, in addition to the fact that private inholdings just riddle the preserve, the government is perfectly happy to put up signs which make clear that the -- the plot in question will not in fact be the government's, but will be the VFW's.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1396.325" stopTime="1409.115">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, isn't that an interference or it's singling out someone, private property owner, who's using his property in a particular way, a religious way? 
    You are going to be putting up signs only for people putting up religious symbols.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1409.115" stopTime="1421.391">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    I don't think that that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I think that the preserve would put up signs for various historic or cultural or otherwise important--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1421.391" stopTime="1440.054">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    But it hasn't done anything like that. 
    It doesn't say for other property owners that have maybe something that -- you know, a ramshackle shack, that they want people to know this isn't the government's property. 
    They don't do anything like that. 
    It's -- under your hypothetical, it would be only religious property that would have these special warning signs.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1440.054" stopTime="1458.720">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --Well, I suspect that there are a great many identification signs throughout the preserve, although I don't know precisely what they are. 
    And this would be one of those, saying essentially that there is this war memorial, that it was put up by the VFW, that it is maintained and owned by the VFW.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1458.720" stopTime="1484.615">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --Who would see it, General Kagan? 
    Who would see it? 
    I mean, the Seventh Circuit case, it was -- it was on level ground, lots of people used the area, and I think the Seventh Circuit required a fence and a sign. 
    But here, this cross is high on a cliff in a desolate area. 
    And if you had a little sign, who would be -- you would have to climb up to it.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1484.615" stopTime="1509.933">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    I actually think, Justice Ginsburg, that it would be easy to do. 
    I was out there three or four weeks ago. 
    The superintendent drove me to the site. 
    There is virtually nobody who could see this war memorial in any other way than by going in one of two directions on Cima Road. 
    And you could put signs up on Cima Road that said exactly what you were going to see, you know, in 100 yards or a mile or whatever it was.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1509.933" stopTime="1523.897">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    How is the question of -- I don't want to get into your rebuttal time, but briefly, how is the question of whether signs are or aren't valid or required before us in this case? 
    There are no signs there, and you are asking us to consider whether the statute is valid or not.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1523.897" stopTime="1559.382">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that if we were not going to put up signs, it would still be valid. 
    So I should make that completely clear. 
    And as I said, there are many, many private holdings within the preserve, people who could put up whatever religious symbols they wanted to. 
    One simply wouldn't know whether it was on private land or on other land. 
    But I will say, in addition to that, that the preserve's superintendent himself would like to put up a sign essentially telling preserve users what the war memorial was and what its provenance was. 
    If some--

    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --That's correct, Justice Sotomayor. 
    But I have to say that that's more of the kind of sign that maybe Justice Ginsburg had in mind, which is, it's smaller and you would have to go right up to the war memorial in order to see it. 
    I think it would be very easy to put up signs just on the road to make clear that anybody who was in the area would know that this was land--

   Argument of Peter J. Eliasberg
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1641.861" stopTime="1673.458">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Justice Breyer, I would like to direct my beginning remarks to you. 
    I believe you've correctly stated the procedural posture exactly right. 
    The only question, point that I would make, is that I don't believe we did -- there was a modification of the injunction here. 
    Any time a defendant passes a piece of legislation after an injunction is first entered, there may be a question as to whether that new statute or legislation is consistent with the injunction. 
    But it's not new relief.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1673.458" stopTime="1704.147">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I see what the judge did. 
    He said: The motion to enforce the July 24th injunction is granted. 
    He said: Buono's motion to amend it is denied. 
    Then he did two other things, which he listed some people and he said they are enjoined from implementing the law. 
    Now, I take it that those paragraphs 3 and 4 are an implementation of the July 24 injunction which he granted, not a new injunction.
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1704.147" stopTime="1705.364">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    That's exactly correct.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1705.364" stopTime="1725.215">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So that's the issue here that we were just possibly debating. 
    The issue in the case is whether the district judge might lawfully enforce an old injunction in the manner he did, which was to add paragraphs 3 and 4. 
    That question you concede is here.
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1725.215" stopTime="1729.185">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    I believe that's -- that is here and that is really the only question that is here.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1729.185" stopTime="1742.226">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    So that under your approach that this is looking to see if the injunction is being enforced or violated, we would be reviewing an act of Congress under an abuse of discretion standard, not -- not de novo?
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1742.226" stopTime="1743.915">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    That's correct. 
    But for this--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1743.915" stopTime="1745.319">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Have we ever done that before?
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1745.319" stopTime="1745.787">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    --I--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1745.787" stopTime="1752.158">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Have we ever said that an act of Congress is unconstitutional without a de novo review of the merits of the constitutionality?
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1752.158" stopTime="1761.139">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    --I am not aware of that, but I am also not aware of a situation where the act of Congress is being put forth as the response to an already adjudicated constitutional violation.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1761.139" stopTime="1822.052">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Eliasberg, I thought that the Ninth Circuit the first time around had taken meticulous care to make certain that the issue of the validity of the statute would not be before the Court in the first round. 
    Judge Kozinski wrote: 
    "We express no view as to whether a transfer completed under Section 8121 would pass constitutional muster, but leave this question for another day. " 
    That's on page 104a of the petition. 
    And then the district judge said: Yes, I recognize the Ninth Circuit didn't touch the validity of that statute, left it for another day. 
    The day has come. 
    So it is for the first time that the Court is deciding the question of whether section 8121 passes constitutional muster.
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1822.052" stopTime="1832.936">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    The only thing I would disagree with you on that point, Justice Ginsburg, is that the question is whether the act of Congress remedies the already adjudicated constitutional violation and is consistent with the injunction.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1832.936" stopTime="1841.573">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    So when you get to the consistent with the injunction part -- I thought it was your position that we should review this question solely under an abuse of discretion standard?
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1841.573" stopTime="1842.747">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    It is our position--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1842.747" stopTime="1849.353">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Because while the Court did not decide the validity of the act in the first case, it certainly did in the second case, which is why we have the case before us.
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1849.353" stopTime="1916.218">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    --That is correct. 
    We believe -- but may I make two points, Mr. Chief Justice? 
    First, we believe in the enforcement context where the question is, is this a violation of an already entered injunction that was part of a final judgment, that that is traditional equity principles that you review for an abuse of discretion. 
    Nonetheless, we believe that we win even under a de novo standard. 
    So -- and if I could set forth some of the reasons for that. 
    I think, Justice Breyer, that you have it exactly correct, that what the government has done here by selecting a particular transferee who has been given preferential access to the land in the past to the exclusion of others who wanted to erect other symbols, that the government is taking affirmative steps to permit, through this transfer statute, the display of the cross that they are enjoined from doing. 
    Now, Justice Scalia, I believe your point is at some point if this is on private land and the government is not making any efforts to further this display, that it couldn't possibly be that the injunction forbids that. 
    And that may well be correct, but that is not the case we have in front of it. 
    The government in this transfer statute has made a significant number of affirmative steps to ensure that the cross remains up. 
    It has selected--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1916.218" stopTime="1922.340">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    When this injunction was first entered the statute -- nobody contemplated that this statute was going to be enacted; isn't that correct?
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1922.340" stopTime="1925.183">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    --When the district court entered the injunction, that is correct.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1925.182" stopTime="1941.533">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    So isn't the sensible interpretation of the injunction that it was prohibiting the government from permitting the display of the cross on government property, and not on private property that happens to be within the Mojave National Preserve?
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1941.533" stopTime="1958.746">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    I don't believe so, Justice Scalia -- excuse me -- Justice Alito, for a couple of reasons. 
    One of the bases for the entry of the injunction in the first instance was the way that the government had favored one party to come on, contrary to the government's own regulations, and erect a permanent symbol, while not allowing others.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1958.746" stopTime="1971.848">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Wasn't your argument that this was a violation of the Establishment Clause because it was on government land? 
    Did you make the argument that even if this was on one of the ranches within the Mojave National Preserve, it would still be a violation of the Establishment Clause?
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1971.848" stopTime="1975.349">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    We did not make that argument because it wasn't presented to the Court.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1975.349" stopTime="1990.375">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Yes, it was a totally -- so the situation completely changed and the district court either modified the injunction -- it seems to me modified the injunction by interpreting it to mean something quite different from what anybody contemplated it meant when it was originally entered?
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="1990.375" stopTime="2008.741">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    Well, I think that, as is traditional equity principles, the district court is at some level the master of its injunction and that's why we give an abuse of discretion standard. 
    The district court very clearly said: I see this as an attempt by the government not to abide by my injunction; they are favoring the same parties they favored when -- that was part of the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2008.741" stopTime="2032.404">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, of course, it was that, but the question is whether it was a permissible amendment by the government of the situation. 
    Of course, I will stipulate that the government was trying to arrange it so that the cross could remain there. 
    But that doesn't mean that it was -- it was evading the injunction. 
    I mean, that's--
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="2032.404" stopTime="2034.260">

    --Unless the injunction clearly applied to the erection of a cross on private land that the government had -- had transferred.

    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    --Well, but it's not the erection of the cross. 
    It is the transfer of something where the government has a reversionary interest. 
    It very much directs the way the VFW is likely to use the land. 
    It selected a particular transferee who has been favored from the beginning. 
    They didn't say: We're going to neutrally sell the land in order to allow this constitutional violation to be--

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Can -- can -- what, what -- let's start from the beginning. 
    Can -- would it be proper for the government or would the government be alleged to have violated the Establishment Clause if on another ranch that cross -- a cross went up?

speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="2100.280" stopTime="2120.070">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    All right. 
    So really your argument is that the reason this Court -- this cross on private land, if it becomes private, is offensive to the Establishment Clause is because of the government's prior history with respect to that cross, correct? 
    That's -- that's your argument?
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="2120.070" stopTime="2137.625">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    That is one part of my argument. 
    But there is another part. 
    The government has taken the step of designating this cross one of 49 national memorials in the whole country and the only national memorial commemorating American service in World War I, even though it's clear in the record--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="2137.625" stopTime="2151.371">

    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    --We are alleging that under the totality of the circumstances, which includes the national memorial designation, the government's asserted purpose to make sure that the cross remains up, the government's favoritism of the same parties that it has always favored in this case to the exclusion of others, and the maintaining of the property interest in the land in the form of a reversionary interest, all of those things--

    I think that there are very significant obstacles to their doing that. 
    One, I don't -- I disagree with the General's -- General Kagan's description of the criminal statute that prohibits the defacement of memorials on private land, because one of the provisions is that we will consider it a situation that is covered by the statute that the land be under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. 
    Well, the land -- the statute that designated the Mojave Preserve very clearly says that the land is being transferred from the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management to the National Park Service and the Secretary of the Interior, so it is therefore clearly under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. 
    So I think that there is -- there are possible criminal violations. 
    There is also a significant question--

    It certainly would be a barrier to the VFW's thinking, well, no risk to us if we tear this cross down. 
    In addition, the government is required, as I believe one of the Justices and I don't remember which -- the government has been required to go back and put up a plaque that says: This cross erected in honor of the foreign war dead.

    What about the government's argument that suppose the government took down the cross, gave it back to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, sold them the land in exchange for land of equal value, and then the Veterans said, fine, the cross was ours to begin with. 
    Now the land is ours, so we just put it back. 
    If that would be consistent with the injunction? 
    The government now has nothing to do with the cross. 
    It's all the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and it can't be regarded a sham because it was originally the Veterans of Foreign Wars who put it up, the government didn't put it up.

    Then we are talking about something that is rather formal rather than substantial. 
    If -- if all the government would have to do is say, Congress, you didn't get it right. 
    You should have just made the land swap. 
    And then the government would take down the cross in compliance with the injunction, and then it goes right back the next day.

    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    Well, I think if there -- if there were -- I think it's not just formalism, Your Honor, because one, the reversionary -- I am assuming that in your hypothetical the reversionary interest is gone. 
    That is continuing government ownership, future ownership in property, and one of the government's principal arguments is when we sell to it a private owner everyone presumes that the private owner is the speaker. 
    But when the government maintains a substantial future property interest, they haven't sold the land. 
    They've sold part of their interest in the land. 
    So if you take away the reversionary interest and you remove the national memorial designation and then the VFW independently does choose to put up the cross, it's more than formalism. 
    It is the--

    But there is also the point that I don't think you stressed, that if the reversionary interest was activated -- say they abandoned or destroyed it, the property would come back to the government. 
    And if I read the -- the designation of the national memorial statute correctly, the Department of Interior would have to rebuild the old cross and put it up. 
    There's an affirmative duty to replace the cross if there is a reversion.
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="2842.078" stopTime="2871.483">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    --I believe that that is correct, Justice Stevens, and that's an important point that is intertwined with the fact that the reversionary interest also continues the government's ownership in the land, when their whole position is, if we privatize it, as Justice Scalia pointed out, if it's just a private owner, then we don't associate this cross with the government. 
    We associate it with the private owner. 
    But the government hasn't done that. 
    It has maintained an important ownership interest in the land through that reversionary interest.

speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="2902.019" stopTime="2974.394">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    Well, I do think that Washington is, certainly, a seat of power, and there is, obviously, a close tie between something that is put on the National Mall in the seat of government, but I do think that the designation of a national memorial is also significant. 
    So, even though this may be an area that is not nearly as populated as Washington, D.C., it is very significant that Congress has taken the step with this particular symbol, one of only 49 in the country, grouping it with other iconic statues and memorials in this country and tied it. 
    So I don't think that the distinction, although it might have some bearing in the Court, in thinking of the context, I don't think it would change the result. 
    Justice Kennedy, I want to go back to -- to one question you had asked earlier about the posture, and I just want to reiterate. 
    You, very clearly, said, when the government was saying, well, we didn't have a good reason to bring this to the Court, and that's why we didn't, I think your question recognized that the government had very good reasons. 
    But -- but in addition, it's not really important, when you have a final judgment, why a party chooses not to try to take the last step of appeal on a final judgment, and that's the United States v. Munsingwear case. 
    The government chose not to make that step. 
    The judgment was final, and there, certainly, is no basis for this Court to reopen the issues about whether Mr. Buono had standing in the first instance.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2974.394" stopTime="3055.718">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Well, wasn't -- isn't this very different from the situation in Toledo Steel because -- Scale, I'm sorry -- because, if the merits issue that was before the Ninth Circuit was, if not technically moot, nearly moot, by the time they reached it, because of the passage of the new statute. 
    This wasn't -- they said it's not moot because this is simply the voluntary cessation of conduct that's been held to be unlawful, but that is typically applied in the situation where there is a legitimate fear that the -- the party that has been held to be violating the Constitution may simply return to its bad old ways, once the litigation is over. 
    But, here, you have the intervening enactment of a statute by the Constitution -- by the Congress of the United States, and I think it would be quite far-fetched to presume that Congress is simply going to repeal the statute and go back to the way things were, once the litigation is over. 
    So you have a merits issue that's not -- if technically moot, nearly moot. 
    The real merits issue in the case is -- is expressly not decided by the Ninth Circuit. 
    They say, take that back to the district court. 
    And you say that the standing issue goes away because the government didn't appeal the standing issue at a time when the real merits issue in the case had not been decided.
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="3055.718" stopTime="3104.575">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    Well, two points, if I may, Justice Alito. 
    First, the first reason that the Ninth Circuit gave for why the case wasn't moot was not voluntary cessation. 
    The government conceded the land transfer could take up to two years to effectuate, so in the Ninth Circuit, that this case is far from moot. 
    Two years is more than enough time to file the government to file the petition for certiorari and had a ruling, both on the merits of the land on -- the cross on government property, but more important, as a number of Justices had pointed out, the question of standing to bring an Establishment Clause case, the government always have an interest in saying, this case should never have been brought. 
    We never should had have had a judgment entered against us. 
    For the government to say, we didn't really care at that point because, two years from now, the transfer might be effectuated is not basis for them to argue that there was no final judgment and no reason for us to appeal.

    I think General Kagan recognized that there isn't an example of a final injunction, where, after it's final as it can be, you can come back and say, but, now, I want to reargue the standing question that's already been determined. 
    But there was something that I did want to ask you about, Judge O'Scanlon's opinion. 
    He said, if -- if you prevail and you are right, what happens in Arlington Cemetery, where there's the Argonne Cross Memorial and the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both right here in Arlington, what happens to them?
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="3146.511" stopTime="3195.458">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    Going back, Justice Ginsburg, to the merits on the earlier question about a cross on government property, I believe that the Argonne Cross in the national -- in memorial cemetery is extremely different. 
    There are, in the national cemeteries, the -- the VA offers, to veterans and their family, a choice of putting up 39 different emblems and beliefs on their tombstones. 
    In Arlington, there is a cross that is surrounded by a sea of tombstones with symbols of the faith of all of the different service members. 
    In that context, I don't think anyone would perceive that the government was favoring one particular religion because of the variety of choices and religious symbols expressed there. 
    That's very different from a stand-alone cross of one religious symbol that is not surrounded by any other context, other than--

    So that question is not properly before us, but context matters, and I do think, in other circumstances, there may be religious symbols. 
    There may be a myriad of religious symbols and the context of the situation will matter. 
    But I think if, in Arlington, for example -- with respect to Justice Ginsburg's question. 
    If, for example, a foreign government -- let's take the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, which the government has put in its brief, was donated by a foreign government to honor people -- Americans who fought for Canada and the British Empire, in I believe it was World War I, if the State of Israel made a similar request to the United States, we would like to honor the Jews who fought in Operation Iraqi Freedom because we believe that that was an important defense of the State of Israel, and the United States said, no, we are not interested, I think that that would create a quite significant constitutional violation -- or constitutional question, but it's not the case in front of us.

    But, again, I think -- I agree with General Kagan that, if we honored Martin Luther King, who was a priest, or we honored -- we did something with the Old North Church which had significant historical significance, that would create a very different issue than simply a stand-alone cross, where, when the National Park Service asked its own historian to determine whether it had historical value necessary to bring it within the National Register of Historic Places, the Park Service's own historian said, no, it did not.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Counsel, this probably doesn't have anything to do with anything, but I'm just kind of curious, why is this cross put up -- you know, in the middle of nowhere? 
    [Laughter]
speaker="peter_j_eliasberg" startTime="3460.816" stopTime="3478.543">
    Mr. Peter J. Eliasberg 
    Because the man who originally put up the cross -- not this one, because it has been replaced a number of times, but the man who put up this particular cross, I believe was a homesteader in the area when the land was owned by the Bureau of Land Management, and I believe was a miner on the land. 
    I hope that is correct historically. 
    I believe it is.

   Rebuttal of Elena Kagan

    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    To pick up right there, this stand-alone cross was erected as a World War I memorial by veterans of World War I who had gone to the desert in California to recuperate and to restore their lives. 
    And it was that situation that the -- that the Congress was presented with, was when the Ninth Circuit ruled and said that this memorial was unconstitutional, Congress had a choice. 
    And the choice was to take down that memorial, which meant an enormous amount to veterans in the community, or to completely dissociate the government from that memorial. 
    And what Congress did was to completely dissociate the government from that memorial while allowing some war memorial to stand.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3529.288" stopTime="3537.536">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    How can you say that when there's a reversionary interest? 
    How can you say it's completely dissociated? 
    There is a reversionary interest if they don't maintain the cross, which is the monument, it goes back to the government.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="3537.536" stopTime="3546.329">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    Justice Stevens, with respect, the reversionary interest says that the holder, the VFW, has to maintain a war memorial. 
    It does not--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3546.329" stopTime="3549.515">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but the particular memorial described by Congress was this cross.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="3549.515" stopTime="3556.026">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --No, the reversionary interest simply says: A war memorial. 
    It does not have to be this war memorial.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3556.026" stopTime="3560.979">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but then it doesn't -- I don't think it's fair to interpret Congress's interest to being and preserving this memorial.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="3560.979" stopTime="3568.177">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    To the contrary, Justice Stevens. 
    When Congress wanted to say 2002 act.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3568.177" stopTime="3568.759">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="3568.759" stopTime="3598.511">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    In the 2004 act, it said something very different. 
    That was after the injunction had issued, so it was a completely different set of circumstances. 
    Congress understood that an injunction against this war memorial had issued. 
    Congress said: We are going to give this back to the VFW, but it's going to be the VFW's choice now as to what to do with it, consistent with it being some kind of war memorial. 
    A reversionary interest of a kind that Congress often uses to -- when it transfers land. 
    Congress -- it's a completely--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3598.511" stopTime="3603.210">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you think anyone thought there is the remotest possibility they would put up a different memorial?
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="3603.210" stopTime="3621.722">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --I think it's left to the VFW, and it's entirely the VFW's choice. 
    So if tomorrow or ten years from now or 50 years from now the VFW decides, along with Respondents, that a cross is an inappropriate war memorial, then they can take down that war memorial. 
    It's no longer the government's message.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3621.722" stopTime="3632.418">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    How can they say it's an inappropriate war memorial when Congress has designated the national memorial as, quote, "the five-foot-tall white cross" and so forth and so on? 
    That is what is the memorial.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="3632.418" stopTime="3644.226">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    But there is no -- there is no prohibition on the VFW taking down this memorial. 
    We will just have one fewer national memorials. 
    And--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3644.226" stopTime="3646.133">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you really think there is any possibility that would happen?
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="3646.133" stopTime="3649.116">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --Again, I think it is entirely up to the VFW.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3649.116" stopTime="3649.693">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That is not my question.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="3649.693" stopTime="3677.839">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    I don't know, because I am not the VFW. 
    It is up to the VFW as to what happens to this war memorial. 
    That's also true of the plaque, that the plaque could -- the VFW could take down the plaque once the -- the VFW gains title to this property. 
    So what the government has done here -- and Justice Stevens, I don't want to -- of course, you are right that Congress started out thinking they--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3677.839" stopTime="3686.645">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    They not only started it out, but they authorized the use of $10,000 in money in order to replace the very cross they had designated as a memorial.
speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="3686.645" stopTime="3732.784">
    Ms. Elena Kagan 
    --Justice Stevens, you are, of course, right that Congress thought at the beginning, prior to the injunction, that this war memorial should not be taken down, that there was an attachment to it in the local community, and that it was -- that it should be retained. 
    Not an unnatural thing for Congress to want, to preserve war memorials. 
    When the injunction issued and when the court found that the -- when the Congress found that the courts had declared this display of this memorial unconstitutional, Congress said: How can we preserve this -- preserve a war memorial, very possibly this war memorial? 
    How can we preserve a war memorial but have it not be our choice?

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Thank you, counsel. 
    Counsel, counsel.
