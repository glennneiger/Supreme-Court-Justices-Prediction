Berghuis v. Thompkins

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in case 08-1470, Berghuis v. Thompkins. 
    Mr. Restuccia.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="7.090" stopTime="77.963">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In rejecting Mr. Thompkins's Miranda claim and ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the Michigan courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established Supreme Court precedent. 
    I plan to focus on the Miranda claim. 
    Now, with respect to the Miranda claim, there really are two distinct inquiries at issue. 
    The first is whether Mr. Thompkins impliedly waived his rights under the Fifth Amendment and, second, whether he invoked his right to remain silent during a police interview. 
    Regarding the waiver question, this Court established in Butler that there may be an implied waiver, even where a suspect remains silent after having received his Miranda warnings, where that suspect knowingly receives his rights and there is a course of conduct that indicates waiver. 
    The Michigan courts here did not unreasonably conclude that Mr. Thompkins had impliedly waived his rights where he expressly acknowledged his rights under -- from his form. 
    After having read out loud from that form, he participated in a limited fashion during the interview.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="77.963" stopTime="90.582">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But he didn't -- he didn't waive them. 
    And quite unlike Butler -- Butler, if I have it right, said, "I'll talk to you". 
    So that was a statement--
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="90.582" stopTime="92.629">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    But--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="92.629" stopTime="104.453">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --that he was waiving the right to remain silent. 
    He volunteered to talk. 
    Here there was no such indication that there was a waiver of his right to remain silent.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="104.453" stopTime="133.691">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Although in Butler this Court noted that -- that Butler himself had remained silent and did not answer the -- answer at all, or remained silent when asked whether he wished to waive his right to counsel. 
    So the -- the standard that was established from which the Michigan courts relied is really on this -- this language of the standard established from Butler, that you can -- you can imply waiver from the knowing reception, and then a course of conduct, because the -- the inference can be drawn from the words and actions of the person interrogated. 
    And here--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="133.691" stopTime="148.529">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Could you tell me without more detail, which is what the circuit court said, about what the limited responses -- I'm using your word -- were. 
    How do we -- how can we imply waiver?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="148.529" stopTime="148.981">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Well--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="148.981" stopTime="167.991">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Meaning if all he said was, yes, I want them in, that's much different than saying, if someone had asked him, do you want to leave, and he shakes his head no. 
    The latter might imply to me that he waived, but the former certainly would be neutral.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="167.991" stopTime="181.188">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --I have to carefully delineate between waiver and invocation. 
    So here the waiver occurs at the time that he is asked the series of questions: Do you believe in God? 
    Do you pray to God? 
    Did you pray for forgiveness--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="181.188" stopTime="186.030">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    That happened about 2 hours and 15 minutes into the exercise, didn't it?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="186.030" stopTime="187.137">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --That's right. 
    It happened near the--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="187.137" stopTime="192.698">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Okay. 
    So -- so what we have here is a course of conduct, 2 hours and 15 minutes of saying nothing.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="192.698" stopTime="193.415">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Well, we--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="193.415" stopTime="197.054">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Would you say that that's -- that's gone past the point where--
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="197.054" stopTime="209.392">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Well, this -- if you're looking at what has been clearly established for this Court, this Court has never -- I mean, one of the arguments raised against the position I'm advocating is that there is an immediacy requirement. 
    Well, this Court in Butler didn't say that the waiver had to occur immediately.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="209.392" stopTime="214.142">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --In Butler he said: I will talk to you, but I am not signing any forms.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="214.142" stopTime="222.386">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    That's right. 
    But if you look at what's the clearly established law -- this Court identified the standard, what can be inferred from the words and actions of the person interrogated. 
    And if you look at what the two--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="222.386" stopTime="232.727">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What they say is, "a course of conduct" -- we will not hold -- 
    "This does not mean a defendant's silence, coupled with an understanding and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion. "
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="232.727" stopTime="233.413">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Right.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="233.413" stopTime="235.632">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --But the prosecution's burden is great.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="235.632" stopTime="252.217">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    Right. 
    And if -- if you look at the two aspects of what constitutes a waiver, it's knowing and intelligent, and voluntary. 
    At the time that Mr. Thompkins gave his answer to that series of questions, there's nothing in the course of that interview that suggested that no longer did he know that he didn't have to answer questions.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="252.217" stopTime="259.618">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, is there anything during the 2 hours and 15 minutes that could suggest a waiver?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="259.618" stopTime="271.161">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    The -- the -- the waiver occurs at the time that he answered the question. 
    So the answer is that he didn't waiver before then, but that -- it still is evidence to show that that course -- that nothing the police had done -- there were no threats--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="271.161" stopTime="277.767">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    So what do we do with our case law that says that you can't infer waiver simply from the confession?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="277.767" stopTime="279.159">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Well, the--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="279.159" stopTime="283.156">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    I mean, we have said that. 
    So that's pretty clearly established statement--
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="283.156" stopTime="283.702">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Well, the--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="283.702" stopTime="284.049">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    --by the Court.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="284.049" stopTime="291.887">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --The courts on direct review have allowed -- where there's a knowing reception of one's rights, have allowed the answers themselves to provide the evidence that the person did waive his rights. 
    In fact--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="291.887" stopTime="302.489">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Well, I think certainly in -- in Butler, if someone in their confession says, I know I don't have to talk to you, but I want to, that that would be using those words.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="302.489" stopTime="302.801">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --But that would be--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="302.801" stopTime="303.254">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    So how can you say--
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="303.254" stopTime="303.893">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --That would be an express waiver, though.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="303.893" stopTime="313.732">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    --How can you say that an appeal to someone's religious position after 2 and a quarter hours is a voluntary waiver?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="313.732" stopTime="330.694">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    Well, if you look at what this Court has provided in terms of guidance regarding what constitutes a lengthy interrogation, Miranda notes that a lengthy interrogation would be strong evidence against there being a valid waiver. 
    But what this Court has determined to be a lengthy interrogation were interrogations of much longer duration. 
    In fact, Miranda even talks about--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="330.694" stopTime="343.485">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    We didn't say -- we don't have any decision that says the police are home free for 2 and a quarter hours. 
    You said that that this was not lengthy interrogation.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="343.485" stopTime="343.765">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Right.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="343.765" stopTime="363.524">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But we -- we have no decision that says that the police, faced with a silent suspect, goes after that suspect, questioning him incessantly for 2 and -- 2 hours and 15 minutes, that that is not lengthy.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="363.524" stopTime="373.394">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    Well, I think it's important to remember that the factual record here was established by the State court, and the factual record isn't that he remained absolutely silent, but that he participated--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="373.394" stopTime="375.597">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    He said "yeah", "no", and "I don't know".
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="375.597" stopTime="380.421">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Right. 
    But he was participating. 
    There's a fundamental difference between remaining absolutely silent and participating--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="380.421" stopTime="386.076">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Wait. 
    Do -- do we have any case that says that 2 and a quarter hours is too long?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="386.076" stopTime="387.249">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --No, and in fact--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="387.249" stopTime="389.904">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And that there can't be a waiver after 2 and a quarter hours?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="389.904" stopTime="391.137">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --No, there's no case law to that effect.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="391.137" stopTime="395.072">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And, therefore, there's no clearly established Supreme Court law that 2 and a quarter hours is too long.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="395.072" stopTime="396.448">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    That's the position that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="396.448" stopTime="397.306">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Isn't that the name of the game here?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="397.306" stopTime="397.852">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --That's the position--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="397.852" stopTime="409.457">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is there a clearly established rule that in all of the circumstances of the case, we can find that there is coercion, time being one aspect of those circumstances?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="409.457" stopTime="411.582">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --I think that's right. 
    And what -- one of the--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="411.582" stopTime="418.718">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And so that is a clearly established rule, and then it's a question whether 2 and a half, 3 and a half, 4 and a half suffices.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="418.718" stopTime="439.210">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Right. 
    The -- the case that I cited was Frazier v. Cupp, in which the interview started at 5:00 p.m. and it finished at 6:45 p.m., and the Court called that an interrogation of short duration. 
    And it is important to remember that this Court has stated expressly in Davis that once you have knowingly received your rights, that the knowing reception itself dispels the inherently coercive aspect--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="439.210" stopTime="439.553">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    The question--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="439.553" stopTime="448.283">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But your -- your position is that if -- same facts, but it's 10 hours instead of 2 and a half, is that a closer case, at least? 
    For--
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="448.283" stopTime="464.046">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --That's a very different case, because there is case law -- like I cited Blackburn was an interview that ran 8 or 9 hours, and this Court found that that person was probably incompetent or insane. 
    But that duration is -- there's been guidance about that kind of long duration, whereas in our--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="464.046" stopTime="469.760">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --And does that show that -- that the circumstances are coercive, so that even if there were a waiver it would be--
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="469.760" stopTime="476.038">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Right. 
    That's the suggestion from Miranda, that a lengthy interrogation preceding the waiver can suggest the waiver was not valid.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="476.038" stopTime="489.266">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --The question, of course, is not whether we think 2 and a quarter hours under all the circumstances is -- is too long under our precedent. 
    The question is, instead, whether it would be unreasonable for the State court to determine otherwise.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="489.266" stopTime="511.895">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    That's right. 
    And, ultimately, the question is what guidance is there to the State of Michigan in applying the implied waiver doctrine to indicate that the implied waiver couldn't come after 2 hours and 15 minutes of interaction in which it concluded that the -- that the suspect had been a willing participant. 
    The testimony from detective Helgert, which -- he was the only person to testify at the evidentiary hearing, is that--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="511.895" stopTime="517.612">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I thought Miranda held that you can't question a person unless he waives his right.
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="517.612" stopTime="519.456">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --No, Miranda in fact talks about--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="519.456" stopTime="527.154">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    You can question him even after he -- it's clear that he hadn't waived his right. 
    Is that -- that's Miranda? 
    Or at least that's unclear? 
    Is that--
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="527.154" stopTime="531.794">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Warnings -- warnings is a prerequisite to questioning, but the waiver is not. 
    In fact--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="531.794" stopTime="552.208">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --No, I'm not talking about the waiver. 
    I'm saying, imagine that it's clear that a person hasn't waived his right. 
    Now let's suppose he says, 
    "I do not waive my right. " 
    Okay? 
    Now, is it clear law that once he says 
    the police cannot continue to question him?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="552.208" stopTime="552.988">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --If there is a--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="552.988" stopTime="554.626">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Is that clear law, yes or no?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="554.626" stopTime="556.424">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Yes, that if there is--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="556.424" stopTime="574.822">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Okay, yes. 
    If that's clear law, would you say that at some point before the 2 hours and 15 minutes expires where they're continuously asking him questions and he says nothing, that it has become clear that he has not waived his right?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="574.821" stopTime="576.959">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --No. 
    The factual record--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="576.959" stopTime="613.197">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    For the question is not this. 
    The question is whether, after 2 hours and 15 minutes of silence, it is clear -- it's nothing about Supreme Court law. 
    Supreme Court law is clear: You cannot question him after he makes clear he hasn't waived his right. 
    So then the question becomes, is it reasonable for a State court to say -- after 2 hours and 15 minutes of asking questions and he says nothing, is it reasonable to hold that he has not -- conclude that he has not waived his rights? 
    Is that the question?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="613.197" stopTime="646.775">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Yes. 
    The question as I see it is that -- let me see if I understand. 
    Let me see if I understand your question. 
    There's a difference between refusing to waive, saying I will not waive my rights. 
    Essentially if you make it an expressed statement that you are unwilling to waive, then essentially it is in that case -- I want to keep this separate, but that would be an invocation: I do not wish to answer your questions. 
    If you make a crystal-clear statement like that, it's a different question. 
    But here Mr. Thompkins didn't say he was unwilling to waive. 
    He's participating. 
    Now, you suggest that there was silence--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="646.775" stopTime="650.258">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --You're saying there's a difference between a waiver and a failure to assert?
speaker="b_eric_restuccia" startTime="650.258" stopTime="661.831">
    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    --Yes, exactly. 
    Here -- the fact pattern here is he did not say 
    "I am unwilling to waive, I do not wish this interview to go forward. " 
    He doesn't do that. 
    He just doesn't assert--

    You want to change the Miranda rule to say: Tell someone their rights, and unless they explicitly say

    then they implicitly under virtually any circumstance haven't.

    --But -- but this language from Miranda that says the silence of the accused after warnings are given would not be sufficient, that's right, but Butler then fully explained. 
    And think about the State courts are coming in that they then -- this Court then made clear that even silence after having received Miranda warnings -- that if you knowingly receive your rights and there is a course of conduct that indicates waiver, that there can be a waiver. 
    That's exactly what the Federal courts have done on direct review. 
    Now, thinking about the Michigan courts and trying to determine what's -- how these rules are to be applied, the Federal courts have found, in the absence of a waiver, where a suspect knowingly receives his rights and then answers questions implicating himself, that the answers themselves can serve as the basis for the finding of a waiver. 
    That's what the -- the conclusion that Mr. Thompkins waived here is a reasonable one. 
    It's not objectively unreasonable. 
    And, of course, you have to recall the overarching habeas law that governs this, that not just does a Michigan court decision have to be incorrect, it has to be objectively unreasonable.

   Argument of Nicole A. Saharsky
speaker="nicole_saharsky" startTime="987.077" stopTime="1055.599">
    Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's confession was properly admitted at his trial. 
    I'd like to go right to some of the questions that this Court had about the language that was used in the Miranda decision and in the Butler decision. 
    Both -- all of this language comes up in Butler. 
    Now, Butler was a case not about the waiver of the right to silence, but a waiver of the right to counsel. 
    So the suspect said "I will talk to you", but the North Carolina Supreme Court said: Well, we don't know if he waived his right to counsel, and that's why the court got into a question of implied waiver. 
    So the Court in its analysis in Butler first reviewed this language that the Court has talked about this morning from Miranda that says 
    "A valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained. " 
    And this is our understanding of that language: First, it is not the case that a failure to invoke Miranda rights will be taken in the Miranda context as a waiver. 
    Now, Justice Scalia, I think you alluded to the fact that the normal rule for the Fifth Amendment at trial is that you assert your rights or they are waived. 
    But Miranda's an exception to that, that the failure to assert we are not going to take as a waiver. 
    The government has to do something more.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1055.599" stopTime="1066.124">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So do you read -- yes. 
    So do you read Miranda as saying that there cannot be questioning unless there is a waiver? 
    Then we'll go on to -- or do you--
speaker="nicole_saharsky" startTime="1066.123" stopTime="1066.468">
    Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky 
    No.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1066.467" stopTime="1068.277">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --Okay, you do not.
speaker="nicole_saharsky" startTime="1068.277" stopTime="1068.870">
    Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky 
    No.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1068.870" stopTime="1080.066">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So are you going to go on -- because this is right where you are. 
    Are you going to go on to say that, in the Miranda context, the failure to assert can -- can suffice to allow the questioning to proceed?
speaker="nicole_saharsky" startTime="1080.066" stopTime="1129.703">
    Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky 
    As long as the warnings are given, the accused has been told of his rights, and that the police will respect his rights, and questioning can proceed. 
    The Court said in Davis and said in other cases, Moran versus Burbine, that the primary protection afforded by Miranda is to level the playing field by letting the accused know of his rights and that the police will respect them. 
    And after the point that he gets his rights and understands them, the police can question him. 
    You'd have to overrule Butler to say that there has to be a waiver before any questioning. 
    Just to get back to the second thing that the Court said in Miranda that was picked up in Butler, it said: We are not going to assume that there is a waiver simply from the fact that a confession was eventually obtained; there is a burden on the government. 
    And the way that we understand that is that the government can't just go into court and say: Look, we have a confession; we know he waived his rights.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1129.702" stopTime="1136.920">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But why isn't that language that you quote a negative inference that there must be a waiver?
speaker="nicole_saharsky" startTime="1136.920" stopTime="1166.284">
    Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky 
    Well, if you look back at the language -- the other language in Miranda, it says that a waiver is a prerequisite to the admission of the evidence at trial. 
    We know that to be able to use that evidence we have to know that he made a knowing and intelligent and voluntary decision to talk. 
    But that he -- that doesn't mean he has to make the decision to talk right away. 
    He might want to listen to what the police have to say about the benefits of cooperation or the evidence that they have in his case. 
    And that -- those are the kinds of things the police could say that could be understood to be custodial interrogation.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1166.284" stopTime="1174.277">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So there's a difference between waiving at the time of the interrogation and then waiving it at the time of trial? 
    I don't understand that.
speaker="nicole_saharsky" startTime="1174.277" stopTime="1226.523">
    Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky 
    I'm sorry. 
    I didn't mean to suggest that. 
    What I'm saying is at the time the Respondent makes his statements, that waiver -- there has to be a waiver and it has to be a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary one. 
    That at the time he makes his statement -- here when he admitted that he shot the boy down, he had to understand what his rights were and there had -- those statements had to not be the result of police coercion. 
    And no court here has found that they were the result of police coercion. 
    There is no question about voluntariness here. 
    So what we understand this language in Butler to mean about an implied waiver is the fact of a confession itself is not enough to show the government has met its burden. 
    When the Court talked about a course of conduct, it talked about the same standard that it's always used in the Miranda context, that came up again recently in this Court's decision in Shatzer, which is that the ultimate question is a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver. 
    The course of conduct doesn't mean anything more than that. 
    It means that at the time the guy spoke--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1226.523" stopTime="1231.304">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But in this case, it was the fact of the concession -- the confession that constituted the waiver.
speaker="nicole_saharsky" startTime="1231.304" stopTime="1265.647">
    Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky 
    --That shows that he decided to talk, but the confession itself isn't enough. 
    We needed to have -- the State needed to have evidence that he understood his rights, which he said he did, and that there was -- that the confession was not the product of police coercion. 
    And I think that that comes through directly in the language that's at issue in Butler. 
    The Court said 
    "an express written or oral statement of waiver. " 
    --to remain silent or the right to counsel -- 
    "is strong proof of the validity of the waiver but not inevitably necessary. " 
    "The question is not one of form, but whether the defendant, in fact, knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in Miranda. "

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Why do you say it would change the police's behavior? 
    Inbau and Reid and, you know, the -- the NAC -- the Defense Lawyers' brief here is filled with quotations from typical police manuals, and they all seem to say things like you have to have at -- once the waiver is given, the police may proceed with interrogation. 
    That seems to be what police today are instructed across the country. 
    It says you cannot question people until he indicates after the warning is given a willingness to answer questions. 
    That's the police manual. 
    So why do you say this would extract a price on law enforcement when the typical police manuals seem to say what the Petitioner here is saying?
speaker="nicole_saharsky" startTime="1363.104" stopTime="1364.122">

speaker="nicole_saharsky" startTime="1364.918" stopTime="1379.458">
    Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky 
    --manual says that. 
    That brief itself cites many examples going both ways. 
    It is often the case, and it is often the case in Federal law enforcement, that the police try to seek a waiver immediately after giving rights because we want to avoid the problems of proof that come up at trial if we don't have a written waiver.

    Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky 
    I'm sorry, I don't -- I don't have the specific citations from the brief. 
    I -- I know from asking the Federal law enforcement agencies -- DHS, the FBI, and the DEA -- that the DEA does not invariably seek a waiver and that we don't understand that we need to get an immediate waiver. 
    And, again, that was what Justice Brennan said in -- in dissent in Butler, is that the police should have to seek an immediate waiver. 
    And the Court said, no, the Fifth Amendment right is -- compel -- about compelled statements being introduced at trial. 
    We don't need this protection, that the police have to seek an immediate waiver. 
    In fact, if you adopted a rule like that, it would essentially take any burden off the suspect to invoke his rights. 
    He wouldn't need to invoke his rights, because the police would just -- if the police didn't seek a waiver.

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Excuse me. 
    As I read this transcript, the police's tactic, by their own statement, was to approach him and say: This is our evidence. 
    Explain yourself -- that's the words the officer used -- but he's entitled to an alternative explanation. 
    Tell us. 
    What's clear is that at no point did he answer those questions, because nothing about the nods of the head or anything else showed a willingness to confess. 
    And even in the responses he gave, he answered a series of questions with a "yes", but not with an explanation, which was what was being requested. 
    So my question is, how does one infer a voluntary statement from a situation in which someone's really not talking? 
    I've never understood how a yes or a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit said, to questions that we don't know what they were about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know that -- can reflect voluntariness? 
    And I understand that in Butler when someone says I don't want to sign that, but I'm going to spill my guts now, and does, that's a course of conduct one could view as voluntary.

    Right.

    Butler, I think, is an interesting case, because Butler is mostly aimed at the right to counsel. 
    When you talk about the right to counsel and the right to remain silent, you have really two different kinds of rights. 
    And there's an assertion requirement in the right to counsel. 
    You can't exercise that right without getting some help from the police. 
    But the right to remain silent -- we don't require that it be asserted. 
    It is a presumption. 
    And that presumption remains.

    And I look at the cases that have been cited, and I know that there are three kinds of examples. 
    One is the person walks into the police Station, and he says I want to confess. 
    That's a voluntary confession. 
    You don't have to assert anything. 
    He's -- he's going to confess. 
    If you have a steady stream of speech in which he says, I don't want to talk but I'll tell you about this, again, you have somebody acting voluntarily. 
    Someone who says I'll only talk about drugs but I'm not going to talk about murder -- he's implied he's waived his right to that.

    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    Well, Davis is a case that talks about the assertion of the right to counsel, but does not apply to the right to remain silent. 
    So I think as long as you still have the presumption of -- the presumption of the privilege against self-incrimination as a presumptive right, the police have to do something to move you off square one in order to make it voluntary. 
    Am I answering your question, Justice Alito?

    It depends on what you -- what you need to make "it", it depends on what "it" is. 
    If -- if you mean the ultimate confession, I think I don't agree. 
    Ultimately, if he confesses and hasn't been coerced, it's voluntary. 
    But if by the "it" you mean to make the continuation of the interrogation voluntary, that's a different question. 
    And I don't know that our cases establish that you cannot continue the interrogation until there has been a waiver.

    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    Well, Justice Scalia, I just read you page 475 from Miranda that says the requirement is warnings and waiver, and that's not, as they said, a preliminary ritual. 
    That means more.

    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    In Butler the -- the waiver, the voluntary act of the person being interrogated really occurred very, very early. 
    There wasn't any kind of a gap. 
    He said, I don't -- I believe he said, I don't want to -- I don't want to do something in writing, but I'll talk to you. 
    Now, that is a voluntary act: I'm going to talk to you. 
    That is clearly a waiver. 
    That isn't what we've got in this case. 
    You have a young man who is sitting in a chair, looking at the ground; he's sullen.

    The Sixth Circuit found that when the Michigan Court of Appeals said the defendant continued to talk with officers, the Sixth Circuit said that that was an objectively unreasonable finding because there was no continuation, there was no talking. 
    They also found unreasonable that the defendant talked with officers sporadically. 
    The Sixth Circuit said that that was a misrepresentation of the record. 
    The last fact that they talked about is the Michigan Court of Appeals said that the defendant made eye contact several times or a number of times. 
    And the Sixth Circuit said, quote -- this is what the -- they said that that was incorrect. 
    What the officer said at the hearing is that eye contact came only at the end, one of the very -- one of the very first times came only at the end. 
    So -- but those are important facts. 
    The fact that he was not continuing to talk -- he wasn't talking at all.

    Of course, those facts are relevant only if we accept your -- your principal assertion, which is that you -- you don't have to invoke the right and interrogation must cease immediately.

    But if we think that, until you invoke the right, the police can continue to ask you questions and it's up to you to answer or not, then those facts are really not relevant at all, are they?

    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    Well, my theory is that you don't get past the failure to get the waiver.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Exactly, exactly.

    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    Yes. 
    Returning now to -- to the idea of the pre-interrogation waiver, I would suggest to the Court that that would return this -- this Court back to the kind of test that Miranda stopped, which was the applying the totality of the circumstances test, and that you would then, again, revert to pre-Miranda law, where -- and this I believe is what the Wayne County prosecutor amicus wants to do, is just apply totality of the -- the circumstances test to whether in fact someone has waived their rights. 
    And I would suggest to you that Miranda has not been a failure, that this bright-line rule -- you give the rights, you get the waiver, then can you talk -- that that's--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2619.129" stopTime="2636.934">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I must say I've never understood that to be the law, and I don't think it's generally understood to be the law, that unless you get a waiver right at the outset, you have to -- you have to terminate interrogation. 
    I think there are a lot of police departments that don't -- I've never understood that to be the rule.
speaker="elizabeth_l_jacobs" startTime="2636.934" stopTime="2642.479">
    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    --Justice Scalia, the opposite of that then becomes the ability to keep the defendant in a room, and the longer--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2642.479" stopTime="2653.784">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm not saying it isn't a good rule. 
    It may be a good rule. 
    But the issue here is whether it is so clearly established that it was unreasonable for the State court to think otherwise.
speaker="elizabeth_l_jacobs" startTime="2653.784" stopTime="2664.781">
    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    --And we would just suggest that the State court applied Moseley incorrectly and applied Miranda, that those are the clearly established law in that case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2664.781" stopTime="2677.322">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I like clear rules. 
    Your rule is a clear one. 
    Another clear one would be just the opposite of yours; that is, that interrogation can continue unless he asserts his right. 
    That's another clear rule. 
    We can go either way, and it will be clear.
speaker="elizabeth_l_jacobs" startTime="2677.322" stopTime="2707.200">
    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    But if interrogation continues, the longer it continues the less likely that the statement that is taken is going to be the product of my client's free will. 
    So the government is going to have an even greater burden in trying to prove that this statement was voluntary or that the waiver of rights is voluntary. 
    So this Court should not adopt a pre-interrogation waiver rule, especially not one that -- that ends up being as long as this case is, and just in case--

    Well, Moseley says that the longer that you question someone, that -- Moseley is the persistent questioning case, where you keep questioning the guy and questioning the guy. 
    And this is very clearly a Moseley case. 
    You've got two officers in that room, and they talk about the fact that they are both questioning and they talk about the different themes they used. 
    And the very fact that they had to change themes showed that the defendant was not being cooperative and not -- and was not engaging in this conversation willingly.

    They don't even have to ask him to sign the waiver, although I think the waiver is proof positive. 
    Once he signs the waiver, you know, I haven't got much to argue in terms of the admissibility of the confession. 
    But if they create the ambiguity, then according to Miranda, that ambiguity is resolved against them.

    Because they are leaving -- they're not moving off of square one. 
    They're leaving this, where they are not looking for an answer to whether the rights want to be waived and they are immediately, as they did in this case, going into interview mode. 
    They are going to start to question him. 
    And this gets to Moseley, where, in fact, you end up where you are badgering somebody, and in this case, they used many different tactics: the softening technique -- here, have a mint.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, I guess this gets back to a question I had earlier. 
    I thought there was no dispute on this record that there was no involuntariness.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm willing to talk to you, I'm willing to listen to you. 
    It seems to me you're confusing a -- a waiver of -- of the right to remain silent with a waiver of the right not to be interrogated, which is the right that you are asserting here, a right not to be interrogated, unless going in you say, I waive my right to remain silent. 
    That's -- that's the new right that you are asserting.
speaker="elizabeth_l_jacobs" startTime="3038.724" stopTime="3039.708">
    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    Well, it's not a new right.

    A right not to be interrogated.

    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    It's -- it's not a new right. 
    It's not a new right. 
    The police cannot interrogate the defendant unless they read him his rights and my understanding of Miranda is that they obtain a waiver of those rights. 
    Without obtaining the waiver, questioning cannot ensue, because then the rest of the questioning becomes trying to talk the defendant into waiving the rights, trying to talk the defendant into confessing, and you have badgering and you have persistent questioning, and you don't end up with a volitional waiver or a volitional statement.

    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    Well, it's -- the implied waiver case is North Carolina v. Butler.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, that's right. 
    Now, getting back to Ms. Saharsky's point, she said if you prevail, you have to overrule Butler. 
    And it seems to me that that's the point we're at.
speaker="elizabeth_l_jacobs" startTime="3086.171" stopTime="3103.114">
    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    But Butler -- I don't think you have to overrule Butler, because Butler really was a right to counsel case. 
    It did talk about the right to remain silent, but most of language has to do with the fact that this gentleman did not waive the right to counsel. 
    So, I don't think you have to. 
    I think you can still have implied waivers.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3103.114" stopTime="3107.800">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    So, there's -- so, there's no implied waiver with respect to the right to remain silent?
speaker="elizabeth_l_jacobs" startTime="3107.800" stopTime="3158.951">
    Ms. Elizabeth L. Jacobs 
    That's a hard question, and I don't have -- I don't have an easy answer or a hard answer for you. 
    I -- I don't think that -- I don't think that you want to hog-tie the police. 
    I agree with that. 
    I think that the police should be able to talk to a defendant, but there's got -- but it's got to be voluntary, and that in order to do that, you really have to get a waiver. 
    U.S. v. Cardwell I think is an implied waiver where the defendant starts to talk to the officer there -- they're in a police car, and the defendant starts to talk to the officer after an hour and a half of silence, although that, again, isn't a custodial situation, but the police found -- but the court found that that was, in fact, a waiver. 
    So if there are no further questions, I'll cede my time.

    So the question is whether during those two hours by not answering a -- a number of questions, did he indicate in any way that he wished to remain silent?

    Mr. B. Eric Restuccia 
    Right. 
    That this -- so if you look at the implication analysis, did he make it clear that I don't want to participate in this interrogation? 
    Detective Helgert's testimony--

    Then it says that any -- in any manner that he wished to remain silent. 
    And until the 2 hours and a half later when he did answer the three questions, that's pretty -- it's at least arguable that his silence indicated he wished to remain silent.

    --Well, what happens, though, in Davis, this Court made clear for the purpose of invocation, that the invocation has to be unambiguous because the police have to know when they have to cut off their questioning. 
    The -- so, if it's ambiguous, it's ultimately, for the question of invocation, his burden to assert the right to take an affirmative action to show, I don't want to answer any questions. 
    Detective Helgert believed, through his limited responses, the give and take of part of this interview, that he was a willing participant in the interview. 
    This is the factual record that was established by the State courts. 
    It's important to remember that this case being reviewed in habeas that those factual determinations are entitled to deference unless disproven.
