    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    This case comes so us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
    If an unsecured creditor or a bankruptcy trustee objects to the confirmation of the Chapter 13 debtors plan for the repayment of deaths, 11 U.S.C., Section 1325(b)(1) requires the debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to pay all “projected disposable income” to be received by the debtor over the duration of plan. 
    We hold that a bankruptcy court may calculate projected disposable income by taking into account foreseeable changes in the debtor's income or expenses. 
    This approach is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the undefined word projected which does not require courts to assume that a debtor's past income and expenses will necessarily continue unchanged into the future. 
    It is also consistent with Congress' use of the word projected elsewhere in the United States Code as well as with bankruptcy practice before Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which did not eliminate judicial discretion to take into account known or virtually certain changes in the debtor's income or expenses. 
    An alternate interpretation of projected disposable income premised upon a mechanical extrapolation of the debtor's past income and expenses into the future would clash with certain terms of Section 1325 and lead to anomalous outcomes in which, in cases in which a debtor experiences unusually high or unusually low income during the period immediately preceding the filing of the petition. 
    We therefore affirm. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.
