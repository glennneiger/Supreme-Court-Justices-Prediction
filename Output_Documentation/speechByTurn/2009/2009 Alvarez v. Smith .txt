Alvarez v. Smith

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-351, Alvarez v. Smith. 
    Mr. Castiglione.

    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Mr. -- excuse me. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Despite the holding in Von Neumann that the civil forfeiture hearing itself is all the process that is due for the seizure of personal property, the Seventh Circuit struck down Illinois's Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act specifically because it does not require an additional adversarial hearing that takes place post-seizure but before the forfeiture hearing. 
    As far back as this Court's decision in Gelston v. Hoyt and Slocum v. Mayberry, this Court has recognized that the civil forfeiture hearing itself is the single unitary hearing, where all persons having an interest in the property are present and the following questions are resolved: One--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="50.448" stopTime="75.308">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Is there any other area -- is there any other area of law where we permit a prejudgment attachment and/or seizure of property without a neutral magistrate reviewing the reason for that seizure? 
    We don't permit a pretrial attachment, do we, except in some narrow circumstances?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="75.308" stopTime="88.255">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --Except in some narrow circumstances, and I note -- and certainly in garnishment cases and in replevin cases that you would have to have that type of hearing. 
    But the interests are different here. 
    The State's interests in the -- in the seized property takes--

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    But that's--

    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --I'm sorry.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="90.677" stopTime="104.703">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    --I don't deny that there's a State interest. 
    The question is who tests that interest? 
    In what time frame? 
    Meaning you can assert an interest, but someone has to determine whether it really exists or not.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="104.703" stopTime="113.746">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Your Honor, historically, that has always been at the civil forfeiture hearing, and that's going -- as I say, going back to Gelston, because what -- what Gelston recognized is that--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="113.746" stopTime="119.225">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Castiglione, you have been asked to address the mootness question -- both counsel.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="119.225" stopTime="119.791">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="119.791" stopTime="130.659">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Have forfeiture proceedings occurred in the plaintiffs' cases? 
    Is there any lingering question concerning the status of the property?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="130.659" stopTime="135.424">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    No -- Your Honor, the forfeiture cases have concluded, it's true. 
    We--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="135.424" stopTime="137.581">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Have concluded?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="137.581" stopTime="182.687">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --They have concluded. 
    The -- there are three -- three of the Respondents sought the return of cars. 
    Three had had cash seized. 
    In the three car cases, the cars had actually been returned. 
    In two of the cash cases, the Respondents defaulted, and in one of the cash cases, the -- the State and the Respondent reached an agreement. 
    So those cases are over. 
    But we would submit, Your Honor, that this case is not moot because, subsequent to the Seventh Circuit decision in this case, the plaintiffs filed an amended motion for class certification, and that's at Docket 49 -- Docket Number 49 of the Northern District docket, filed on June 19th, 2008, specifically asking for damages and restitution, in addition to declaratory and injunctive relief.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="182.687" stopTime="195.102">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Well, has there ever been a case in which this Court has considered the merits of a dispute where the individual claims of the named plaintiffs expired before we heard argument and a -- and a class had not yet been certified?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="195.102" stopTime="208.754">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    That's not the case here, Your Honor. 
    At least one of the -- one of the Respondents, a certain Tyhesha Brunston -- her forfeiture case ended in 2009, so at the time the amended motion for class certification was filed asking for damages and restitution.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="208.754" stopTime="211.893">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    No, but that wasn't my question. 
    The class has not yet been certified, has it?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="211.893" stopTime="213.749">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    No, it has not, Your Honor. 
    That's true.

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    And the -- the claims of all the named plaintiffs are -- have expired?

    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Well, the injunctive claims may have expired, with the possible exception of the two Respondents whose -- whose cash cases were defaulted. 
    But, no, the damage claims, I think were--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="229.635" stopTime="234.975">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    There were no damage claims when the final judgment was entered in the district court?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="234.975" stopTime="236.740">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="236.740" stopTime="254.234">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So it was a final judgment, and it went up on appeal. 
    And at what point did they seek to -- I mean, while the case was in the court of appeals, the final judgment dismissing the case, there was nothing for the district judge to do.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="254.234" stopTime="274.850">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Well, but after the -- the Seventh Circuit reversed the district judge's decision granting the motion to dismiss, upon -- upon remand, the plaintiffs -- then, at that point, asked for a certification of the damage class and a restitution class and expressly stated that they wished to pursue a claim -- a claim for damages and restitution based on--

    And--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So you have nobody before this Court with a live claim, neither the original named plaintiffs nor a certified class.

    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --I would -- well--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So who's here?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="288.872" stopTime="297.744">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --For -- for mootness purposes, Your Honor, I think the -- the fact that plaintiffs were allowed to ask for damages and -- and filed a pleading asking--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="297.744" stopTime="300.521">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --They did not ask for damages originally.

    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --No, they did not.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="301.397" stopTime="314.422">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So as the case comes to us, we have a district court final judgment dismissing the case. 
    The case was only for injunctive relief. 
    It goes to the Seventh Circuit. 
    It's in that shape. 
    We are taking the case from the Seventh Circuit.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="314.422" stopTime="315.217">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Yes.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="315.217" stopTime="321.561">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I -- I suppose, if the case is moot, then you are entitled to a Munsingwear order.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="321.561" stopTime="321.998">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    I would--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="321.998" stopTime="323.745">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    So there's no controlling authority.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="323.745" stopTime="325.497">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --We would -- that's our position, Your Honor.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="325.497" stopTime="335.351">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    And then I suppose the district court doesn't know whether to award damages or not until it gets a final decision from -- or a decision from the Seventh Circuit or this Court.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="335.351" stopTime="363.544">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    I mean, the -- whether or not a damage claim could go forward would depend on the -- on the validity of the Seventh Circuit decision. 
    And our view, Justice Scalia, is that the -- when -- the -- upon -- even though they did not formally amend the complaint -- that's true; we acknowledge that, but in the -- in the motion for class -- in the amended motion for class cert, I think the assertion of the claim for damages, at least for mootness purposes, is enough to give this Court jurisdiction over -- over those claims.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="363.544" stopTime="374.759">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    If it been there originally, but the problem is it wasn't there. 
    The case comes to us on a complaint that is simply for injunctive relief. 
    And that is moot.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="374.759" stopTime="389.126">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    That -- with the possible exception of the two Respondents whose claims defaulted, Your Honor, in that it's unclear what it -- to the extent they were seeking the return of their property, their situation has not changed. 
    Their property never was returned.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="389.126" stopTime="391.390">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What were they seeking to have enjoined?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="391.390" stopTime="407.276">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    They were seeking, Your Honor -- they were asking the court to declare that the Illinois statute was unconstitutional for not providing an interim hearing, and an injunction preventing -- preventing Illinois from enforcing the statute.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="407.276" stopTime="417.724">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But -- I -- since they defaulted in the -- in the final hearing, how can -- can they possibly have any claim left with regard to an interim hearing?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="417.724" stopTime="433.937">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Well, I just think the nature of their claim hasn't changed. 
    To the extent they were seeking the return of their property through such an injunction, that hasn't changed for those two plaintiffs, Yunker and Williams. 
    But we rest our -- our response, Your Honor, and we will--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="433.937" stopTime="444.432">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    So am I forgetting, but didn't this start out as a class action and wasn't the claim -- wasn't the class action denied?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="444.432" stopTime="446.400">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --It was denied as moot, that's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="446.400" stopTime="447.773">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    And you didn't appeal that?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="447.773" stopTime="464.690">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Well, we didn't -- we didn't appeal at all. 
    The plaintiffs appealed the district court's order, which -- it was a single order that granted -- I'm sorry -- that granted our motions to dismiss and denied plaintiffs' motion for class certification as moot. 
    That was the order.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="464.690" stopTime="468.265">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And the plaintiffs -- the plaintiffs didn't appeal the denial of certification.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="468.265" stopTime="477.227">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    The two -- well, no, Your Honor, they did not. 
    They appealed the order -- they appealed the denial of the motion to dismiss -- I'm sorry -- the granting of the motion to dismiss. 
    Excuse me.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="477.227" stopTime="487.959">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, maybe we should -- we should ask the plaintiffs about that. 
    But you're saying that the two cases that were defaulted are not moot? 
    Isn't a default the end of it?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="487.959" stopTime="504.953">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    I'm saying they may not be moot, Your Honor, in that the claim for relief has not -- and they defaulted before, in at least one of the cases, before the complaint was even filed. 
    So nothing has really changed in the status of their case. 
    I believe Mr. Williams -- nothing has changed in his case from the time the complaint was filed.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="504.953" stopTime="544.373">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    You said in your opening that there is just the one proceeding, and that's the petition for forfeiture. 
    But in your brief you suggested that there is a means that these plaintiffs could get back their property pending the ultimate forfeiture proceeding. 
    You mentioned a Slocum type hearing, a petition for return of their property. 
    So I don't understand your argument that there's one and only procedure, the forfeiture procedure, when on the other hand you are telling us that there is a means.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="544.373" stopTime="581.500">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Well, maybe I can explain, and I think it also goes to the -- what is -- why the 8,850 -- the use of 8,850 and the Barker speedy trial factors makes sense. 
    The one hearing where these issues are resolved is a civil forfeiture hearing, it's true. 
    But I think what Slocum does, just in a similar way to how speedy trial factors operate, it gives the claimant an opportunity to come in and ask the court to tell the government to fish or cut bait. 
    So you either file an action or release the property. 
    I think it operates much the same way that the speedy trial factors would operate in a criminal case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="581.500" stopTime="585.793">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And they -- and they can do that before the -- before the time period has expired?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="585.793" stopTime="592.731">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Absolutely, Your Honor. 
    And they can certainly do that. 
    That's a remedy that's available up until -- up until the forfeiture case is filed, and from that--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="592.731" stopTime="615.313">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    But surely your position is going to be that the statutory procedure pre-empts and takes the place of any Slocum hearing, isn't it? 
    I mean, somebody comes in and files a petition saying, here I'm raising this right under, you know, an early 19th century procedure, and you're not going to say, okay, here's our position or here's the property. 
    You are going to say, wait until the forfeiture proceeding that is provided under Illinois law.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="615.313" stopTime="626.169">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --Well, I -- the -- what Slocum does, Your Honor, we think -- we believe that Illinois has recognized for at least over 50 years that a property owner has a common law right to come in.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="626.169" stopTime="629.012">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But that was before the statute was enacted.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="629.012" stopTime="631.215">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    That's certainly true, Your Honor, but that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="631.215" stopTime="643.881">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The statute is a dead letter if you allow a Slocum action. 
    All you -- all you need is a Slocum action, and the fact that the statute says you have to wait for -- you know, that the government has 40 days, is meaningless.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="643.881" stopTime="648.221">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --Well, Slocum I think is a way of getting into court, getting the government--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="648.221" stopTime="650.424">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Exactly. 
    It's a way of defeating the statute.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="650.424" stopTime="668.057">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --Well, once -- once the government does act, Your Honor, then at that point I'd say if in fact the government's being -- once the government files a forfeiture action, if the government's dilatory, there's remedies under -- under Illinois law, our Code of Civil Procedure, or even perhaps a motion to dismiss for--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="668.057" stopTime="677.522">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But the statute says the government isn't dilatory until -- until the time period, 40 days. 
    It has 40 days. 
    What does that mean if it doesn't mean that the government has 40 days?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="677.522" stopTime="694.513">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --Oh, the -- I think -- I think certainly, Your Honor, the government does have the time periods. 
    Yes, I agree with that. 
    The government certainly has the time periods. 
    But if the case were to somehow to fall through the cracks and nothing would happen, I think what -- what the common law remedies provide is a safety net for property owners to be able to get into court.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="694.513" stopTime="696.154">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Before the 40 days?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="696.154" stopTime="698.072">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    No, I would say after the 40. 
    I would say--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="698.072" stopTime="715.379">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Oh, okay. 
    Well, that's a different story. 
    These people are asking for a hearing before the elapsing of the 40 days, and if all -- if all you say that Slocum provides is a hearing after the 40 days have elapsed and nothing has occurred, that doesn't satisfy what they are asking for.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="715.379" stopTime="722.518">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --Well, I would say Slocum provides a hearing after 40 days, Your Honor. 
    I would say, if the government does nothing, it's a way of getting into court.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="722.518" stopTime="726.267">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It doesn't have to do anything for 40 days, is what the statute says.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="726.267" stopTime="728.204">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    And we don't dispute that. 
    And--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="728.204" stopTime="740.261">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But you say if it -- you don't dispute that doesn't have to do anything, but you -- you assert that if it does nothing, you can bring a Slocum action. 
    I mean, which is it? 
    One or the other?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="740.261" stopTime="753.317">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --Well, Slocum is an equitable remedy. 
    If someone can establish -- I don't think before the time has run out in our procedures one could probably establish that, but it's possible if a case were to -- were to fall through the cracks, and it gives--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="753.317" stopTime="767.952">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Slocum then is the answer to a very different case. 
    It's a case where you have a class action of people whose cases fell through the cracks and never got the procedures they were entitled to. 
    It doesn't seem at all responsive to the claim that they are entitled to procedures before it falls through the cracks.
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="767.952" stopTime="782.571">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    --Well, our position, Your Honor, is that the -- the statute -- is the regime that Illinois has adopted with the time periods, does -- does comply with due process. 
    It provides a way of dealing with some number of the issues Respondents have raised.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="782.571" stopTime="787.211">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But isn't the basic argument that you make that a forfeiture hearing is all the process that is due?

    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="787.929" stopTime="799.690">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Now, let me ask you this question: Suppose your statute said there shall be a forfeiture hearing with all the procedures you want, but the forfeiture hearing shall take place 1 year after the seizure. 
    Would that be adequate?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="799.690" stopTime="806.436">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Under this Court's view -- decision in FDIC v. Mallen, I don't think you would look to the outer limits, Your Honor. 
    But I think--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, I'm saying the minimum. 
    The hearing will take place 1 year after the seizure, nothing earlier or nothing later.

    I ask you this about the government's interest involved here and the practicality of the situation, and I want to put aside the innocent owner defense, which I hope to ask your adversary about. 
    But putting that aside, let's take what I envision as sort of the typical case where the police officer arrests someone in a vehicle for a drug offense and -- without a warrant -- and then has to file a complaint in court. 
    What -- what is the government -- what is the burden on the government, and what would be the burden on Chicago or the State of Illinois in a requirement that within some reasonably brief period of time after that that there must be the equivalent of the filing of a complaint in court, just as you would for the arrest of an individual without a warrant, where the only issue would be whether there was probable cause for the seizure, not whether there, you know, is some innocent owner defense, but just whether there's probable cause?

    Look, I thought this case, though I grant you I could well be wrong, is not about a final forfeiture hearing where you have to show that it's more probable than not that the car was used for drugs. 
    But under the Illinois law, just as Justice Alito said, you can seize a car without a warrant.

    But in the Florida statute that Justice Thomas wrote about, it said that a person whose car it is, is entitled to a hearing, I thought, in a brief time to see if there was probable cause, just as a person arrested. 
    You have to bring them before a magistrate within a short time to see if there's probable cause.

    Well, first of all, Justice Breyer, we say the complete deprivation of one's liberty is not the same as the deprivation of property. 
    The way we do it under our statute -- the way we deal with this issue is there's -- the statutory regime really has two concepts, one for property, seized property, that -- whose value exceeds 20,000, and one where--

    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Forty-five of those days, Your Honor, is what would be the property owner deciding whether to file a claim. 
    And if -- I mean, one of the possibilities -- it's at section 6 of our statute, which is actually nonjudicial in rem forfeitures. 
    If one were to simply file -- a property owner simply file a claim but not a cash bond, then there wouldn't be a judicial proceeding. 
    It would just be informal negotiations with the State's attorney. 
    One could always go to court by filing a cash bond.

    I would like to answer this question. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    For bond, about 80 to 85 percent of our cases are cash, seizures of cash, and as the Seventh Circuit recognized, posting a cash bond for cash is an absurdity. 
    With respect to cars, Your Honor, the problem is the State's duty is to be able to preserve and prevent the destruction or dissipation of the property prior to the forfeiture hearing. 
    If we bond it out, we can't guarantee that at the ultimate forfeiture hearing, that property would be -- would be preserved.

    Mr. William M. Jay 
    --I would be happy to begin with the mootness question, Your Honor. 
    And I -- although I think that it's, to some degree, a question for the Respondents what precisely they are seeking. 
    Because there are two Respondents, Yunker and Williams, who have lost their property. 
    The property is in the possession of the State. 
    And if their position is that unless a hearing is held within 10 days, which is what they originally asked for in their complaint, a probable cause hearing within 10 days, if after that no forfeiture is possible because timely post-deprivation process has not been afforded, if that's their claim, then it appears their claim is still alive because the State still has their property. 
    If, however, their claim expires when the forfeiture proceeding is actually held, then that proceeding is over and we agree that their injunctive claims are moot.

    It's not entirely clear from their complaint, Your Honor. 
    They were -- they were asking for the imposition of this 10-day hearing requirement, but it -- and they are -- they were contending -- now, each of these was filed after the 10 days had run. 
    The most recent seizure had occurred 2 months before the class action complaint was filed in district court. 
    So it appears they were contending that they wanted the forfeiture proceeding stopped because a hearing had not been held within 10 days. 
    So the complaint doesn't make perfectly clear what kind of injunction they were seeking except that they wanted the imposition of this 10-day procedure.

    There happened to be some big drug crime nearby, and the policeman took my car. 
    In my opinion, there was no probable cause. 
    I would like my car back. 
    Now, I take it that in Illinois there is no proceeding, as there was in Florida, so that I can claim there was no probable cause, and I -- none at all. 
    I never get that determination made; and, moreover, I have to wait, for 6 months possibly, before I get a different determination made, which is whether they had -- more likely than not, whether that's entitled to forfeiture on the merit.

    Mr. William M. Jay

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Okay. 
    So nobody gives you -- they go around taking cars even without probable cause. 
    There's no way to do -- it happens in every State. 
    What's the constitutional justification for making a person wait for 6 months before he gets a neutral judicial official to say whether there was even cause to take his car?
speaker="william_m_jay" startTime="1482.017" stopTime="1507.881">
    Mr. William M. Jay 
    --The constitutional justification, Justice Breyer, requires that a reviewing court look at each step in the process, and it's not just a matter of 6 months from beginning to end. 
    That process in Illinois and in many other systems has different steps.

    The -- and then the second step is deciding whether to pursue this. 
    The third step is completely in the hands of the claimant, where the claimant decides whether to pursue a judicial hearing.

speaker="william_m_jay" startTime="1510.553" stopTime="1532.759">
    Mr. William M. Jay 
    --Your Honor, there's more to investigate than just the probable cause to seize. 
    In many cases, the probable cause to believe the car is forfeitable is ironclad, but there is more to investigate because, for example, an innocent owner in Illinois by statute is entitled not to have her car or her gun or her personal -- other personal property -- it could be currency -- forfeited. 
    And that--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="1532.759" stopTime="1587.115">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    But -- but you are -- but you're sort of begging the question. 
    You are saying to me that initial period is for the government to figure out if it made a mistake or not, and we're entitled to that time. 
    You're not entitled, meaning you, property owner, to go to a neutral magistrate who will make that decision without a personal interest in the outcome, because the person who seized does have an interest of some sort. 
    Many local police departments do in seizing property, because they keep the proceeds. 
    So what you're saying is that constitutionally it's okay for the party holding on to property without a warrant to decide whether or not it wants to give something back, whether or not there's -- there's a viable defense. 
    I'm a little confused.
speaker="william_m_jay" startTime="1587.115" stopTime="1691.914">
    Mr. William M. Jay 
    --Let me respond to that in a couple of steps. 
    And the first is to respond to your point about the incentives that local police departments may face. 
    There is no incentive to -- to hold property longer than necessary because, while the property is being held, there is no ability to access that property. 
    If it's currency, for example -- as Mr. Castiglione pointed out, 85 percent of their seizures are -- the currency is held in a suspense account and is not accessible by the -- by the seizing government at all. 
    So the government has no interest in delaying longer than necessary, especially for cars. 
    The government has to take care of the car, maintain it in a lot, you know, preserve it from -- from harm. 
    Second, on the basic question of what is the government doing during this time? 
    The government has a due process obligation, especially in an in rem proceeding like this one, which deals with a piece of property to which there may be competing claims. 
    The government has a -- itself has a due process obligation to notify everyone who has a claim to this property that it's in the government's custody and that there will be a proceeding to adjudicate the competing claims to it. 
    I mean, this Court in Robinson v. Hanrahan, a decision in 1972, held that Illinois under its forfeiture statute had violated due process by not providing notice to the owner -- to the registered owner of a car, because it sent notice to that owner at his address when in fact he was in the custody of the State of Illinois in a criminal proceeding. 
    The State has an obligation to notify -- to investigate, especially after a seizure, even if it is a car which only a minority of seizures are -- even if it is a car. 
    Identifying the driver is not enough to identify who has a claim to that car. 
    There may be a registered owner. 
    There may be -- there may be a security interest. 
    In currency cases, it's even more difficult, because on the face of currency there is no indication who owns the currency--

    Mr. William M. Jay 
    --My answer, Justice Stevens, is that it might well be unconstitutional as applied. 
    And the Court, in 8,850, says--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1718.978" stopTime="1720.179">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Wouldn't it be unconstitutional on its face?

    Mr. William M. Jay 
    --It wouldn't be unconstitutional on its face, Justice Stevens, because sometimes the State has a valid interest in holding property for more than a year, as Mr. Castiglione said. 
    In 8,850 itself, the property was held for 18 months. 
    The Court has said in any due process case--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1735.811" stopTime="1740.873">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Would that justify a statute that says in all cases it shall be held for at least 18 months without telling the owner?
speaker="william_m_jay" startTime="1740.873" stopTime="1791.867">
    Mr. William M. Jay 
    --I think, Your Honor, that if the State responded to an 8,850 defense and said -- and said nothing other than the statute says 18 months or 10 years, and -- you know, and we have done nothing during that time, I think that it would be unconstitutional as applied. 
    But as a practical matter, States and the Federal Government are not sitting around doing nothing after seizing property. 
    They are actively investigating who has a claim, they are notifying all claimants, they are allowing -- allowing those claimants to file claims if they wish. 
    A majority of all seizures are uncontested. 
    And then whenever a claimant wants one, that claimant is entitled to an in rem judicial hearing, where all -- all claimants come into court and have -- have the government's right to seize the property adjudicated and also the affirmative defenses, such as the innocent owner defense. 
    Now--

    Suppose a situation in which the property taken is really essential to the -- to the living of the person from whom -- who owns it -- a car -- and the person needs a car to get to work every day. 
    And -- and there is really no reason why the -- why the government has to wait that long. 
    Is there no procedure by which he can say, you know -- do it quickly. 
    You don't have to wait so long.

    --I think that as the Federal framework reflects, that is the kind of situation that is -- that can be addressed by legislation. 
    And the Federal hardship provision, 18 U.S.C. 983(f), is a good way of illustrating that; that the government has competing interests in all these cases that compete with the claimants' interests and in cases such as currency, where the government can't be secured against the possibility that the property will disappear, then -- then there's no hardship exception. 
    And -- but the government -- Congress, after extensive study, has made a hardship provision for other forms of personal property.

   Argument of Thomas Peters
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="1871.398" stopTime="1943.928">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is not moot. 
    It's not moot because at the time that the plaintiffs filed the case they clearly had standing. 
    They immediately moved for class certification. 
    And although their motion for class certification was denied, it was denied because the merits of the case were simultaneously denied. 
    And, in fact, this Court has addressed a situation remarkably similar to this in United States Parole Commission v. Geraghty. 
    In the Geraghty case, the class was not certified. 
    It was denied, as it was here. 
    The case became moot because the plaintiff in that case was a Federal prisoner, had been released on parole, and nonetheless the Court allowed the case to proceed. 
    And the reason the Court allowed the case to proceed, as I understand it, is that the 
    "capable of repetition, yet evading review. " 
    doctrine was invoked. 
    Once that document is invoked, the claim -- the standing relates back to the time of the filing of the complaint. 
    At the time of the filing of the complaint, there was standing, and the putative class--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1943.928" stopTime="1953.393">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And you say it was likely to -- these same named plaintiffs were likely -- likely -- to face this same situation again?
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="1953.393" stopTime="1956.235">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --No, that's not what I'm saying, Your Honor. 
    What I'm suggesting--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1956.235" stopTime="1967.232">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, if you are relying on -- on, you know, 
    "capable of repetition, yet evading review. " 
    that's -- that's the test, whether -- whether indeed these people stand a chance of having the same thing happen.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="1967.232" stopTime="1990.657">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --I respectfully beg to differ, Your Honor. 
    With respect to class actions and cases where the plaintiff has timely requested to certify a class, the "capable of repetition" relates to the class. 
    There is right now today a class of people in the city of Chicago who have their cars impounded. 
    That -- their claims are repeating daily.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1990.657" stopTime="2002.401">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You are begging the question. 
    That is, you are assuming that the class is a valid class. 
    It hasn't been certified. 
    How -- how can you make that -- that argument when there is no class?
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2002.401" stopTime="2004.979">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    Well, I -- I can make that argument--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2004.979" stopTime="2007.199">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Just an asserted class on your part. 
    There's no class.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2007.199" stopTime="2011.383">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --Yes, and that was also true in Geraghty, Your Honor. 
    There were -- the motion for class--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="2011.383" stopTime="2017.770">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    No, it wasn't. 
    The appeal in Geraghty included an appeal of the denial of class certification.

    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --Yes, it did, Your Honor.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="2019.521" stopTime="2030.468">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    So both issues -- both the merits and the denial of the class certification -- were still active before the Court. 
    Here you didn't appeal the dismissal of the class certification or the mootness of it.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2030.468" stopTime="2034.904">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    Well, we couldn't, Your Honor, because it was inextricably linked to the merits. 
    In Geraghty--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="2034.904" stopTime="2057.569">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    But -- but in many appeals parties plead in the alternative and say, if you -- if we win on the merits, reverse the dismissal of the class certification because we still want to proceed as a class. 
    You didn't do that. 
    You waited for the merits to be adjudicated and then filed a new class action. 
    It's a very different procedural step.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2057.569" stopTime="2095.285">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --I don't think that it is significantly different when one considers the concerns that animated the Court's decision in Geraghty. 
    The concerns that were at issue in that case were the fact that the plaintiff was representing a class that was going to continue to exist and that as to that class there was constantly going to be a claim repeating; and that that person, even though the class was denied -- in that case it truly -- it was denied on the merits, because he had an opportunity to litigate the merits. 
    We did not have a -- opportunity to litigate the merits of the Rule 23 issue.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2095.285" stopTime="2124.753">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Peters, I think the Court in Geraghty said it split the interests. 
    And they said his interests in challenging the denial of class action status continued even though he was no longer incarcerated. 
    So they were concentrating on his right to appeal the denial of class action certification. 
    And that's what you don't have here. 
    And that's what distinguishes this case from Geraghty.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2124.753" stopTime="2162.567">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    I -- I certainly agree that it is not an identical situation, Your Honor. 
    But I think -- as I said before, I think again that the concerns that caused the Court to reach that position in Geraghty are in fact the same because in this case the -- there is a continuing activity with respect to the class. 
    There is some -- there are a group of people who are aggressively pursuing the rights of that class. 
    There is a live controversy between the government and that class. 
    So in all of those respects, which are similar to what--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2162.567" stopTime="2181.203">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But we must take it as it came into the Seventh Circuit, which is no appeal from the denial of class certification. 
    So we have individual plaintiffs who are seeking to overturn the denial of injunctive relief. 
    And that's all that's before the Seventh Circuit.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2181.203" stopTime="2221.684">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --That was -- that was all that was before the Seventh Circuit because I don't -- it seems to me that it is just sort of a gratuitous gesture to say, I am appealing the denial of the class certification ruling, when the class certification ruling is itself based entirely on the denial of the merits. 
    If there had not -- if there had been any inkling, any ruling that suggested that the Rule 23 aspect, the class aspect, was being denied on class-related grounds, then of course there would be an appeal. 
    But what--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2221.684" stopTime="2228.259">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    As it turns out it -- it wouldn't have been gratuitous. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2228.259" stopTime="2231.051">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --Well -- I understand Your Honor's position, although I--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2231.051" stopTime="2338.796">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But if I have a different position, which is I'd like to see if it's practical to decide this case now, two things stand in the way in my mind which I'd like you to address. 
    The first is your opponents are saying, no, you shouldn't really address this issue now because there are three Illinois statutes which actually give them, anyone who wants it, a right to a hearing at least on probable cause. 
    And that's a matter of Illinois law. 
    And although the statutes don't seem to say it, they might. 
    And the second is that this seems mixed up in my mind -- not necessarily your fault; it may be my mind -- but it seems to me there are two quite separate questions: when you are entitled to a final hearing of whether forfeiture is right or wrong; and whether you are entitled to a preliminary hearing on whether there was probable cause under the statute to obtain the car. 
    Now, that latter question I think might be impractical in many cases to work out until there's been a trial of an individual who's accused of a crime, which may be much later. 
    But the former question is where I think you have a point, that there are five instances here in this statute where a policeman could seize a car without a warrant and he has to have probable cause under most of them nonetheless. 
    So your clients might say: He did not have probable cause; I want a neutral magistrate to contest it. 
    Now, in my mind that reaches -- that's a different question than the final hearing about who's entitled to the car. 
    And I also see the three statutes and now I see a case where here in front of me everything is mixed up. 
    So I think -- perhaps I'm just seeing it that way, but those issues are mixed up confused and not separated out. 
    So why don't we wait? 
    What's your answer now?
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2338.796" stopTime="2369.673">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --I think that -- that waiting would be the prudent thing to do. 
    And it's unquestionably true that what we're suggesting with respect to the preliminary hearing is not identical to the final hearing. 
    The final hearing is -- is on the merits. 
    It decides where the property is going to, finally and ultimately. 
    The hearing we are talking about is a conditional release hearing, similar to what happens in Krimstock, similar to what happens under the Civil Asset Forfeiture Review Act.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2369.673" stopTime="2379.094">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, but then if it's -- if it's money that is being conditionally released, there's no security for the government. 
    If it turns out later on it shouldn't have been released, it's probably gone.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2379.094" stopTime="2402.097">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    Well, there -- there could be grounds for -- there could be ways of getting security for it. 
    I mean, perhaps a person would post some other collateral because they desperately needed the cash at that moment. 
    I certainly agree with Your Honor that the bond procedure is much more in tune with and much more likely to work with cars than with other property.

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    I have two questions: Must it be an adversarial hearing, and must the State disprove the innocent owner defense?
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2433.956" stopTime="2455.699">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    No and no. 
    I think that the -- with respect to whether it's an adversarial hearing, I -- what we envision is a hearing similar to what happens in Krimstock where basically the government's burden is met by having police reports which on their face establish probable cause to at least seize the car.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2455.699" stopTime="2488.841">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Well, but my understanding of Krimstock is that a lot of those seizures -- and others know more about this than I do -- were for DWI, and that it is possible to assert an innocent owner defense there. 
    And that's where I see a great impracticality in this. 
    I -- I don't see how you can expect the State to come into court within such a short period and have any burden of contesting an innocent owner defense without compromising a criminal investigation.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="2488.841" stopTime="2509.942">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    Well, if there was -- my answer to that, I think, Your Honor, is in two parts: One is the Federal Government is already doing something like that with the CAFRA. 
    There are hardship provisions, and part of the hearing could include showing by the car owner or the property owner that they are in fact likely to prevail as an innocent owner. 
    Now--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2509.942" stopTime="2518.248">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

    Joe is arrested on a drug offense driving a car, and there are drugs in the car. 
    But Joe isn't the owner of the car; John is the owner of the car. 
    Then John comes in 10 days later or 14 days later and says, well, you know, I never had any inkling that Joe was using the car to deal in drugs and had no reason to know that.

    --There would have to be -- first of all, we don't know how that would administratively be handled because of the posture of the case, but my suggestion, Mr. Chief Justice, would be this: That the likely result in a case -- in this case, is that there should be hearings for all car owners and that there should be a baseline dollar value below which a person is not entitled to a hearing.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    So just to get back to the cars, I thought your answer to Justice Alito was a little abstract. 
    In the absolute concrete case, where the drug -- the suspect is driving the car, there are drugs in the car.

    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    Well, in -- in those circumstances and that's the only car, I would say, most likely, the property should be returned to the car owner. 
    However, I would add that, if the government has some concerns about -- for example, that they need additional time to investigate this innocent owner claim, then by having the hearing in front of a neutral and detached person--

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, aren't they always going to say that? 
    They are going to say, well, we don't know if the registered owner is involved in the drug conspiracy. 
    We don't know how closely he is tied with the owner, so it's reasonable to assume he knew what was going on, and besides, we've got a lot of other bigger fish to fry during this period. 
    We are trying to find out the scope of the conspiracy. 
    We are trying to find out where the sales were going to take place.

    They may have him on wiretaps.

    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.

    I can understand the argument that you have to have the filing of the equivalent of a -- of a complaint when you -- that has to be filed when someone is arrested without a warrant, where it's not adversarial and you establish probable cause for the seizure. 
    But when you start to go beyond that in drug forfeiture cases, at least, not -- not DWI cases, I just don't see how that's workable.

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Counsel, can you unpackage for me this hearing? 
    Because there is a confusion in it that appears, both in your papers and in this argument. 
    There's a probable cause component, which is the police coming before a neutral magistrate and saying, this is the reason I seized; I have probable cause to believe that this car was involved in an illegal activity, and this is why. 
    And then there is what sounds like, to me, a sort of remission-type component to the hearing you are looking at, which is a magistrate saying, okay, you have probable cause, but there's no reason for the seizing authorities to keep the car because you can post a bond instead, or something else should be done to mitigate the damage to you during this process of forfeiture. 
    Am I correct that there are two components to your request? 
    And if there are, I understand the probable cause component, but I'm not sure how you get to the second component of how and why due process would require the State to have a -- I'm calling it remission -- but a remission-like proceeding?

    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --Yes, Your Honor, but let me go back in response to your question and, I think, in part to Justice Alito's. 
    The Seventh Circuit hasn't ordered any specific hearing, so I am, at this point, advising the Court of what I think this hearing should look like. 
    It could well be, upon remand and discovery, that what I am suggesting the -- the hearing should look like, it may -- it may not look like that at all. 
    It could be that--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Isn't that one of the problems with the Seventh Circuit decision? 
    That it covers the waterfront. 
    It covers cash, as well as any property. 
    It's not concentrated on cars. 
    And what your complaint asks for -- you said it was as applied, but you are asking for a declaration that defendants must hold a post-seizure probable cause hearing within 10 business days, and you are asking the Court to enjoin the defendant's current practice of seizing property and retaining custody without a judicial determination of probable cause. 
    That sounds, to me, like a facial challenge to this statute, and you are asking for a declaration that the statute is invalid, not as applied to any particular person.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Go back to what Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor were asking. 
    This statute gives a policeman the right to seize some property without a warrant if it's a circumstance where you could seize a person without a warrant. 
    That's basically what it says, doesn't it?
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="3293.158" stopTime="3293.610">

    All right. 
    In that kind of situation, I would think maybe you are entitled to a quick hearing where the only subject would be: Was that language carried out? 
    Was that policeman right? 
    Was there probable cause, or wasn't there? 
    Now, if that's the issue, I don't see why you give up at all on the baseball card. 
    I mean, if somebody comes into my house and takes a baseball card, and he's supposed to have probable cause and he doesn't, I don't see why I can't go get a judge or a magistrate, determine whether he had at my baseball card, and pretty quickly, too.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --If you go to the other, which is whether there's an innocent owner or whether in fact you should give bail to the property -- I mean, that's -- I know we give bail to people, but I don't know that we give bail to property. 
    Maybe real property, but that seems a much more complex argument. 
    So I want to know: What's your authority that we should give bail to the property and have a hearing on that?
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="3361.279" stopTime="3362.328">

    I don't--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3362.328" stopTime="3367.214">

    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --Well, I wouldn't like to give up my favorite baseball card, but the reason that I said that, Your Honor, is this: The Mathews criteria, which we are espousing here, require a cost-benefit analysis, and if the value of the property under that -- using that criteria does not warrant a hearing, then as to that property, there shouldn't be a hearing. 
    So there doesn't have to be a hearing in every case. 
    There may--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3400.028" stopTime="3419.456">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    So it's as -- so it's as applied in every case, which I think ties in a little bit to the mootness question that we began with. 
    Because it focuses on the circumstances of the individual claimants, and if the individual claimants have already had their property returned, I think it accentuates the mootness issue.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="3419.456" stopTime="3437.682">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --I -- I continue to maintain, Your Honor, that the -- as long as there was standing when the case was filed, and as long as there is a live class that could be represented by these class -- or putative class--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3437.682" stopTime="3440.244">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    "My potential class", you should call it.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="3440.244" stopTime="3511.102">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --Potential class. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Then there is standing on -- and I believe that the standing can be established through the Geraghty decision. 
    I agree that it is not literally identical to Geraghty, but I think the underlying circumstances that animated the Court's decision in that case are the same and that, therefore, these people maintain standing. 
    If, however, in response to a question that you asked Mr. Castiglione earlier, if the case became moot as a result of the return of the property, then it wouldn't be a Munsingwear situation. 
    It would be a Bancorp v. Bonner situation, because if it became moot as a result of the settlement of the case after the Seventh Circuit's decision, then the Seventh Circuit's decision should stay in place. 
    So if -- I do not agree that the case is moot, but if hypothetically the case were moot, then we are not in a Munsingwear situation; we are in a Bancorp situation, because the mootness--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3511.102" stopTime="3520.398">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, that's an interesting -- that's an interesting question. 
    I mean, is it becoming moot through their voluntary cessation or activity when the State law requires them to take particular action?
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="3520.398" stopTime="3558.399">
    Mr. Thomas Peters 
    --No, what -- what I'm saying, Your Honor, is if we're -- if we're defining mootness as the ultimate return of the property, then the property was returned pursuant to settlements in four of the cases. 
    The plaintiffs agreed, we'll pay $400 instead of $20,000, if you return our car. 
    The car was returned. 
    So if the case was settled and became moot because of the settlement, it is not a situation in which the Court can adopt the Munsingwear position. 
    It really is a Bancorp situation, and the Seventh Circuit's decision remains--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3558.399" stopTime="3588.508">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, all of these problems really arise out of the fact that the effect of the court of appeals' decision basically was to overrule the motion to dismiss, left everything open on remand. 
    So if we said it is moot, you'll just get another plaintiff and bring another lawsuit, which is what you do if the Court -- we are trying to get into the case much earlier than we should, it seems to me. 
    Just let the proceedings go ahead on remand and find out what all the -- all these factual answers that -- or these questions that should be answered.
speaker="thomas_peters" startTime="3588.508" stopTime="3594.067">
    Mr. Thomas Peters

    --Well, the narrowing, as I perceive it, Your Honor, is this: I believe the Court said at different times whether an appropriate remedy can be fashioned. 
    The Court did not say for whom. 
    It didn't say it must be for everybody. 
    It didn't say what would be necessary to trigger the right to the hearing. 
    It didn't say how much time would elapse. 
    It left -- it did leave, in that sense, everything open, but by leaving everything open, it also allows the court to narrow the categories of people who would be entitled to this hearing that -- in such a way that it would be an effective practical remedy.

    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Our position, Your Honor, is that the settlement wasn't in response. 
    We didn't settle the Federal -- we didn't settle the Federal litigation. 
    The -- the underlying forfeiture case was -- was resolved.

    I thought your answer is that they didn't all settle.

    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    They all didn't settle. 
    That's right. 
    In fact, that's a better answer, I think, Your Honor.

    Well, what good would a Munsingwear order do, anyway? 
    They'll just file another lawsuit, won't they?

    They could.

    Yes.

    And then if the district judge said -- having read this opinion, which was vacated, says, well, I guess it states a cause of action, I will deny the motion to dismiss -- we would be exactly where we are now.

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Can I just get clarification? 
    Under your State law, there is no way for an owner to come in and challenge probable cause to seize?

    There is not, Your Honor.

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    All right. 
    And, second, is there any procedure under your State law to do the second half of what your adversary said he was looking for, a remission-type proceeding that would balance the government's need to hold the property and the individual's need for it, and whether there is a bond that could be posted or not?
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="3872.348" stopTime="3881.317">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Not that we -- Illinois doesn't provide for a bond, Your Honor. 
    As we indicated, there are problems with bonds, certainly for cash and for -- and for other personal property as well, but--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="3881.317" stopTime="3901.965">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Well, that may be part of the Mathews issue, that once you prove probable cause, giving away -- giving back money just never would probably be rational to hold a hearing about, but that might not be true for real property, correct? 
    Under -- even under Mathews, under -- in a Mathews analysis.

    --the multifaceted item would say for the seizure of cash, maybe only the hearing has to address probable cause, but for real property it has to go further. 
    Not real property, in the sense of real personal property. 
    It has to go further, because there has to be some sort of protection of the interest of the individual, pending--
speaker="paul_castiglione" startTime="3925.971" stopTime="3954.129">
    Mr. Paul A. Castiglione 
    Let me attempt to address that. 
    The -- the statute does contemplate, Your Honor, section -- especially section 6 of DAFPA, nonjudicial remedies, and then essentially if the amount of property is under 20,000 or if we are dealing with a car, which falls under section 6, those cases are routinely dealt with by negotiation, Your Honor. 
    And I think that's the best way to deal with hardship -- the hardship examples given -- is that both through negotiation and a speedy hearing--
