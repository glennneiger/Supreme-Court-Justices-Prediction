    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The Washington Redskins football team has its own trade name and trademarks as to each as do each of the 31 other teams in the National Football League. 
    Since 1963 however, all 32 teams have used a jointly owned corporation, National Football League properties, NFLP to market their intellectual property. 
    For almost 40 years NFLP granted non-exclusive licenses to a number of different vendors, one of which was the petitioner in this case American Needle. 
    In 2000 however the teams authorized a NFLP to grant exclusive licenses which it did, because they declined to renew petitioner's license it brought this action against the teams and NFLP seeking treble damages under the Sherman Act. 
    The District Court granted summary judgment to the defendants, holding in effect that the defendants constituted a single economic enterprise incapable of conspiring with itself. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    We granted certiorari and now reverse. 
    We do not reach the question whether petitioner has alleged a violation of the Sherman Act but we reject the argument that the 32 teams constitute a single entity for antitrust purposes. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that their conduct must be judged under the rule of reason. 
    Our opinion is unanimous. 
    I also have the disposition to announce in number 08-6261 Robertson against Watson. 
    The Writ of certiorari is dismissed as an improvidently granted, The Chief Justice has written a dissent in which Justices, Scalia, Kennedy and Sotomayor had joined. 
    Justice Sotomayor has also filed a brief dissenting statement that Justice Kennedy has joined.
