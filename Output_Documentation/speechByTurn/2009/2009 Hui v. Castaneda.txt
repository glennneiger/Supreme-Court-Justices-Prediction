    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    This case arises from Francisco Castaneda’s claim that petitioners the U.S Public Health Service personnel repeatedly denied him necessary medical treatment, while he was in immigration detention. 
    Immediately after his release from detention, Castaneda was diagnosed with cancer. 
    He filed suit in Federal District Court, raising medical negligence claims against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act and constitutional claims against petitioners under Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents. 
    After Castaneda died, respondents were substituted as plaintiffs. 
    Petitioners moved to dismiss the Bivens claims on the grounds that 42 US code section 233(a) makes them immune from suit. 
    The District Court denied the motion and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 
    Based on the plain language of section 233(a) we hold that PHS officers and employees are not personally subject to Bivens actions from harms arising out of the conduct described in that section. 
    By making the remedy against the United States provided by the FTCA “exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding" for harms resulting from the performance of medical or related functions within the scope of PHS employment. 
    Section 233(a) grants PHS personnel, absolute immunity from suit for harms arising from such conduct. 
    For the reasons discussed in our opinion, we find respondent’s counter argument unpersuasive because the Ninth Circuit held that section 233(a) does not immunize petitioners from suit in these circumstances. 
    We reverse the judgment of that Court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
