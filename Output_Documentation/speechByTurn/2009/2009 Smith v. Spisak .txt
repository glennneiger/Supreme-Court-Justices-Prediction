    General Cordray.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="7.152" stopTime="24.161">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Because this case arises under the deferential standards of the AEDPA statute, Mr. Spisak must show that the Ohio Supreme Court's decision was contrary to Mills v. Maryland or that it unreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="24.161" stopTime="42.934">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Why? 
    I -- I have been trying to figure out why the State court would know in its decisionmaking that Mills commanded a different result when Mills was issued after the State denied its petition for rehearing.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="42.934" stopTime="55.428">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    It's a bit of a conundrum, Your Honor, because Mills was issued after the Ohio Supreme Court's decision here, but before it became final on direct review when cert was denied by this Court in March of 1989.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="55.428" stopTime="78.872">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Well, finality in that sense is generally looked at in terms of AEDPA statute of limitations. 
    Why should the same rule apply to the question of whether a State has acted contrary to or unreasonably in light of Supreme Court precedent when the precedent didn't exist at the time it was rendering its decision? 
    How can a court act?
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="78.872" stopTime="118.499">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    I'm perfectly willing, Your Honor, to back it up a step and say Mills was not clearly-established law at the time that the Ohio Supreme Court decided, although the issues were current at the time. 
    But I would go further and say the extension of Mills that the Sixth Circuit's ruling made here is not clearly-established law even today, more than 20 years later. 
    There is a -- the vast majority of Circuits, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, have rejected the position the Sixth Circuit took here, and in fact, this case is quite distinct from Mills even if Mills were applicable. 
    But I would take your point and I would agree with it that it's kind of tough to impose on the Ohio Supreme Court Mills when--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="118.499" stopTime="125.307">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    We don't have to go any further if we simply address the question, at what point in time are we talking about a State court's decision, correct?
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="125.307" stopTime="156.418">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    --Fair enough. 
    Fair enough. 
    Yes. 
    But I would say this case is distinct even from Mills, where the Court determined that the jury instructions gave the jury to believe that they could only consider mitigating factors that they had determined unanimously to be present. 
    And in this case, none of that was done. 
    The verdict form was quite different, and in fact the jury was only instructed to be unanimous on the ultimate question of whether the aggravators outweighed the mitigators, a common instruction and one that's upheld around the country consistently. 
    Second--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="156.418" stopTime="200.725">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    General Cordray, under the charge that was given, what happens if there is a juror who thinks that the aggravating circumstances don't outweigh the mitigating circumstances? 
    Under Ohio's current instruction that means no death penalty. 
    But under the instruction that was given here, that all 12 must agree on -- on the aggravators outweighing the mitigators, what is the consequence of a failure of the jurors to agree on that question?
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="200.725" stopTime="203.649">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    --Even at the time, if the jury effectively hung--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="203.649" stopTime="204.944">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Yes.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="204.944" stopTime="260.668">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    --on that question, the consequence would be that the court would then impose some version of a life sentence. 
    The issue is whether the jury was required to be instructed that at the time, whether they were required to be instructed something that might push them away from unanimity. 
    This Court has never so held, and in fact, in Jones v. United States the Court rejected that rule in a ruling that was not dissented to by anyone on the panel. 
    Your dissent in that case at footnote 20 took no issue with the -- with the notion that the jury did not have to be instructed in ways that would push them away from rendering unanimous verdict on the ultimate question. 
    Since that time, as a matter of State court practice the Ohio Supreme Court in State v. Brooks did say: We are now going to add that instruction. 
    But they later themselves rejected that that was required by the Eighth Amendment in State v. Davis, and that also has been the consistent holding of most circuits, that that is not required. 
    If I could move--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="260.668" stopTime="280.002">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    It would be -- under the charge that was given in this case, you say it would be -- then the judge would be obliged to give one of the two life sentences. 
    It would not be a deadlock requiring a resentencing hearing.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="280.002" stopTime="319.796">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    --I believe that's the case at the time, Your Honor. 
    At the time, the instructions pushed the jury toward unanimity one way or the other. 
    Do the aggravators outweigh the mitigators or do they not? 
    Since that time, the Ohio Supreme Court as a matter of practice has been willing to go further and instruct the jury, or have the jury be instructed, that if a single one of you feels that the aggravators do not outweigh the mitigators, that will preclude a death sentence. 
    But that has never been constitutionally required by this Court. 
    It is an extension of Mills v. Maryland that has never been so held by this Court, and in fact is a source of a -- of a significant overwhelming majority of circuits the opposite way. 
    If I could move to the--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="319.796" stopTime="364.511">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Isn't your adversary's position -- I'm sure they will speak for themselves, but their position would be that this is a step further than Jones or other cases because if in fact -- what you are tilling us is that if the jury hangs, the court will have to impose a life sentence or some form of it. 
    But the jury could believe that they could -- that it's either death or life, and one holdout juror would say: Well, I don't want to let this guy out; because those are the only two choices and 11 people want to go for dead -- death and I'm the only holdout, I have to vote for death to make sure that he is restrained in a way that I find acceptable.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="364.511" stopTime="433.342">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    --This, as Your Honor notes from your time on the trial court, is the jury dynamic in the jury room. 
    It is the push towards unanimity. 
    The issue here is whether the Constitution requires an instruction to be given that would encourage a single juror to hold out and try to avoid reaching a unanimous verdict. 
    The Court has never held that that is constitutionally required, and if they did so hold in this case it would be an extension that is a new rule and would not be applicable on AEDPA review here. 
    Second, on the ineffectiveness claim, Mr. Spisak loses sight of the fact that this was no run-of-the-mill trial. 
    His crimes were among the most infamous in Ohio history. 
    At the trial he groomed himself to look like Adolf Hitler, and on the stand he celebrated his victims' deaths, spewed his racist beliefs, and pledged to continue his own brand of personal warfare against society. 
    In the sentencing phase, defense counsel reasonably took the only tack available to him. 
    He used the sheer depravity of his client's crimes and his disturbing character to tell a story about his client's mental illness, and he asked the jury to forego the death penalty for Mr. Spisak because he is mentally ill and thus, under the mitigating factor, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.

    General Cordray--
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="434.372" stopTime="435.074">

    That is not sufficient--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="435.074" stopTime="469.513">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --in reading that closing argument, it is disjointed. 
    It goes off on tangents that have nothing to do with the sentence that the defendant is getting. 
    I mean, it really is quite a stream of consciousness. 
    And what's remarkable about it is at no point did counsel say, give him a life sentence. 
    He said that either one would be acceptable, either death or life would be acceptable.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="469.513" stopTime="551.458">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    --First of all, I would disagree with that characterization of the closing. 
    It was not a perfect closing, but it had three identifiable pieces to it. 
    The first was, he -- he did go back and recapitulate the nature of the crimes, something this Court said in Yarborough is an acceptable defense strategy. 
    That's the elephant in the room. 
    The jury heard weeks of testimony about this crime. 
    The prosecutor was surely going to highlight that. 
    He was attempting to take this sting out and identify with the jury that he understood how they would react to the crimes. 
    The second piece of the closing -- this is at petition appendix, approximately 339a to 344a, he goes into the mitigating factor of mental illness. 
    He had presented three mental health experts in the sentencing phase to demonstrate that his client was mentally ill. 
    He had made a continued argument that there was a larger jar of not guilty by reason of insanity that he had not been able to fulfill, even though he had tried at trial, and that evidence had ultimately been struck by the trial court, which found they have not made out a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity. 
    But he pursued the same theme here in sentencing, presenting evidence and saying: We have at least fulfilled the smaller jar of mental illness, diminished capacity to intend, and because we are a humane society our general assembly has made that a mitigating factor that you should apply here, and you should not execute someone who has a diminished ability to intend.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="551.458" stopTime="558.427">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    General Cordray, may I -- may I -- you are basically arguing that he was not-- 
    not deficient in performance.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="558.427" stopTime="558.755">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    That's right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="558.755" stopTime="589.506">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Assume I am persuaded that there was deficient performance, for all the reasons your adversary argues, and I am focusing on the prejudice issue. 
    I think you make a very strong argument that this guy would have gotten the death penalty anyway. 
    But what if -- what if the deficiency had been even worse? 
    Supposing the defense counsel had got up and said: I wish I could make an argument, but I really think you ought to give him the death penalty -- just outrageously sided with the prosecutor. 
    Would that mean that we could still find no prejudice?
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="589.506" stopTime="607.546">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    I think in Cronic the Court said that if there is effectively a structural breakdown -- I mean, if in fact counsel had gotten up and argued solely a prosecution argument and not pivoted at all to mitigating circumstances, perhaps it would be possible to presume prejudice in that situation. 
    That's not the situation in this case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="607.546" stopTime="613.996">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, I -- I understand that. 
    But -- so you really are saying the question is whether Cronic or Strickland controls?
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="613.996" stopTime="615.852">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    That's one of the questions.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="615.852" stopTime="616.304">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="616.304" stopTime="690.653">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    Although in our cert petition question 2, we also argue that the Sixth Circuit erred by not deferring to the Ohio Supreme Court's application of Strickland v. Washington. 
    And on the prejudice issue, this is Landrigan. 
    That is the case this Court decided and then granted, vacated and remanded this case back to the Sixth Circuit. 
    If you look at the prejudice discussion in Landrigan -- and I would direct attention to the quote near the end where the Court says that the court of appeals panel got it right, and what they said was that the -- the testimony was chilling. 
    The person in Landrigan had repeated -- had committed repeated murders and tried to kill again and again. 
    The same with Spisak in this case. 
    He had been unrepentant in the court and in fact had flaunted his menacing behavior, just as Spisak went on for days on the stand expressing his white power views and how he would continue to war if he had the opportunity, if given the chance. 
    In Landrigan this Court approved the court of appeals statement in the end that any further, minor mitigating evidence that could have been presented in the wake of that record could not have been helpful; there is no prejudice. 
    That prejudice holding in Landrigan I believe controls this case. 
    In fact, this case may be even a stronger case than Landrigan for no prejudice.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="690.653" stopTime="710.939">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But does your argument really depend on any deference to the State Supreme Court? 
    It seems to me that your argument is just sort of as a fresh matter there wasn't prejudice here. 
    And -- and isn't it also true that we really don't know what the Ohio Supreme Court's basis for its decision was, whether not competent, incompetence, or lack of prejudice.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="710.939" stopTime="747.595">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    I would say three things, Your Honor. 
    First of all, I would agree with Yarborough, where this Court said that the -- the determination about deficiency and prejudice is doubly deferential through the AEDPA lens. 
    We would defer, as Yarborough said, to reasonable tactical decisions made in closing argument, but we would be doubly deferential under AEDPA because we have to hold that the Ohio Supreme Court's rejection of the ineffectiveness claim was itself objectively an unreasonable application of Strickland. 
    So that's one. 
    Number two, the Ohio Supreme Court did reject this claim. 
    It cited Strickland v. Washington. 
    It did not go on in detail.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="747.595" stopTime="750.468">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But we don't know which prong of Strickland it relied on, do we?
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="750.468" stopTime="783.204">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    We don't. 
    But this is not a case like Rompilla, where the -- where the Court was faced with a court that had held only on one prong and had disclaimed any attempt to review under the other prong. 
    If the court simply gives a summary affirmance or summary disposition and doesn't specify which prong, I think the Court has to give deference under both prongs, because the alternative would be to give deference under neither prong, which is inconsistent with the -- the AEDPA statement that we have to did defer to an adjudication on the merits by a State court. 
    And so I think that is -- that is fair here. 
    But I certainly think--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="783.204" stopTime="788.858">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So you'd say a State supreme court is entitled to more deference if it doesn't tell us the basis for its decision?
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="788.858" stopTime="790.855">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    --It -- it may seem a little odd, Your Honor.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="790.855" stopTime="791.136">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="791.136" stopTime="812.739">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    If they disclaim a prong, then I think it's de novo review, and Rompilla did say that. 
    If they don't disclaim a prong, I think that the Court has to defer because the alternative is it gives no deference to summary dispositions, and -- and that has been the general tenor of courts under AEDPA, is if there is a question you err on the side of giving deference. 
    That clearly was Congress's intent in enacting that statute.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="812.739" stopTime="873.759">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Counsel, there are two extremes. 
    One is no defense whatsoever, Justice Stevens' hypothetical. 
    The attorney just comes in and says, kill him, okay? 
    And then there is another, which is your very eloquent explanation of this attorney's strategy. 
    If he had done what you did here, we may not be having this appeal. 
    But at some point you can have a strategy and execute it so poorly, so incompetently, that you're providing ineffective assistance of counsel. 
    You are not accepting that that can occur, you are saying the minute an attorney says, I had a strategy, that that is effective counsel, regardless of how that attorney executed that strategy. 
    That appears to be your argument.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="873.759" stopTime="970.998">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    We, of course, Your Honor, don't have subjective testimony from the counsel as to what his strategy was. 
    But I think it's quite apparent from the record. 
    He at trial attempted to establish a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity. 
    He was set back, he and his trial team, because in the end the trial judge rejected that defense and struck that testimony. 
    He renewed his effort at the sentencing phase by bringing several mental health experts and having them testify on the stand to show that at least they had met the lower standard of mental disease or defect under the Ohio Revised Code. 
    He then argued, perhaps not as eloquently as -- as one might, you know, as -- as Justice Jackson once said, you know, in their bed that night, but he argued about: Yes, these crimes were brutal. 
    He went on at some length about that. 
    But these crimes were brutal and the jury had heard all that and clearly had that in their minds. 
    He then pivoted to five pages of closing arguments, in addition to days of presentation on the subject, to say: We have shown at least mental illness; it is a mitigating factor; the General Assembly made it a mitigating factor and we as a humane people should be proud that we do not execute someone who has substantial deficiency in ability to intend. 
    He then went on to handle some rebuttal points that he was -- he was feeling the heat on from the prosecutor's presentation. 
    For example, that he had not necessarily met with these experts before they came and testified at trial; that he had perhaps shopped for experts and other matters of that sort; that maybe the -- the jury was going to hold against him and his defense team their deficiency as counsel, because they had made this effort to get not a -- a not guilty by reason of insanity plea and the judge had knocked that out.

speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="978.867" stopTime="1007.341">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    I have not read a great number of defense summations, but this was derogatory. 
    But frankly, the bed that was made was made by his client, who got on the stand for days on end and spewed his racist propaganda, made it clear that he was not only unrepentant but was triumphant; that one or more of his murders were slick, pretty neat; that he celebrated the killings; that he went out to kill again, that if he had the opportunity now he would again go out to kill again.

    That's the context.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1008.573" stopTime="1029.390">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    --goes so far as to say: Don't look to him for sympathy because he demands none. 
    But isn't that exactly what he has to appeal for in order not to get a death verdict, sympathy based on -- on mental illness, despite the horrific crimes that this person committed and the things that he said on the stand.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="1029.390" stopTime="1183.232">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    No, Your Honor. 
    And I think again counsel in the context of this proceeding judged, perhaps rightly, that it was very unlikely this jury was going to have sympathy for his client. 
    Instead he appealed to the jury's own sense of humanity and pride: We have this mitigating factor under the law, we are a civilized people, we do not execute people who have substantial diminished ability to intend; and I appeal to you, you jury, even though I can sense that you are not feeling sympathy for my client, do what -- what makes you a humane people, what makes us proud as a people, and do not give the death penalty to a person who is sick, demented, twisted, as my client has shown himself to be here on the stand. 
    I think it's a coherent strategy. 
    In fact, I don't see easily how he could have done better. 
    And as in Landrigan, if he had said, give him sympathy, give him a life sentence, which was the thrust of the entire proceedings, I don't think that that created -- that lack of saying that created any prejudice on this record, which was very thoroughly established, in part by his client 's own testimony. 
    I would also say in Yarborough, on the deficiency point, this Court said that focusing in on one particular theme may well be a preferable strategy, and there has to be broad deference given to closing, which is only a part, after all, of the entire sentencing proceeding, in that taking an understated approach that -- that emphasizes the jury's autonomy. 
    In Yarborough, if you remember, the defense counsel did not actually ask specifically in so many words for a life sentence. 
    The Court said that's not deficient. 
    He could count on the judge's charge to the jury. 
    They were going to charge the jury as to how to handle the evidence. 
    It was the thrust of the whole proceedings. 
    He presented three mental health experts to show mental illness and diminished ability to intend. 
    And he argued that as part of his closing. 
    I think it was not deficient, and I certainly think on this record, this stunning record created in part by his client's crimes, which were acknowledged and undisputed and there was no factual dispute about them and their heinousness, and then by his client's testimony on the stand, which graphically and at great length reinforced his, again, triumph in his -- in his warfare against trying to kill as many black people, Jewish people and gay people as he could find, and that he would continue that warfare if given the chance. 
    I think it's impossible to find that there is prejudice on this record for the -- for the -- for the -- even the medium-sized quibbles that are being raised here 20 years after the fact. 
    If I -- if I may reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Sixth Circuit evaluated performance of trial counsel in this case and found deficient performance for three primary areas. 
    First, counsel presented and argued to the jury nonstatutory aggravating factors as reasons to impose the death sentence on Mr. Spisak. 
    In Ohio, the jury is allowed to consider only the statutory aggravator factors, not nonstatutory factors. 
    The counsel specifically identified and argued four reasons to execute Mr. Spisak. 
    He then proceeded to tell the jury what was not mitigating evidence in this case, including factors that have long been accepted as mitigating factors like performance in prison, adaptive skills and the issue regarding his family upbringing and childhood. 
    Finally, the lawyer turned to what he argued was the only mitigating evidence that they were going to be arguing, and that was the issue of the client's mental health. 
    He then--

    Mr. Michael J. Benza

    But I guess it gets back to the -- the point, we are talking about what a jury would think and isn't it possible. 
    You are suggesting, I think, he -- he should grasp any straws that are there, this might help. 
    But isn't it possible that that would have a negative effect on the jury? 
    In other words, they see this lawyer telling them this guy is going to do well in prison and the lawyer's credibility is -- is shot.

    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    If there is no evidence to support that, that would be correct. 
    The problem that this case presents -- and this is what the Sixth Circuit found -- that had the lawyer then said, yes, for all of these reasons they may weigh in favor of death, but here are the reasons why you should consider life, we would have a very case than we have here today.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Benza, do you know of any case where ineffective assistance was found on the basis of a closing argument alone? 
    General Cordray pointed out that this lawyer had put on a number of witnesses to testify to the defendant's mental illness, and that he did play that theme in the closing. 
    Do you know of any case where the closing, not tied to the way the case was presented at trial, was held sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel?
speaker="michael_j_benza" startTime="1408.691" stopTime="1417.220">
    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    No. 
    And that's because this case is such an outlier. 
    I have been litigating capital cases since 1993. 
    I have never seen a closing argument like this.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What would you have done? 
    I mean, I'm -- I'm not experienced in this. 
    But I mean, I have heard the other side and I have read the argument. 
    And it makes sense logically to say he has the worst defendant he has ever seen. 
    He's murdered lots of people in cold blood. 
    He gets up on the stand and says: I'm going to kill a lot more. 
    He sounds totally bonkers. 
    And -- and he says to the jury, I can't tell you that what he did was not aggravating; it was terrible. 
    I can't tell you that there's anything here that should make you feel better about him; there is nothing. 
    But we are a nation of people who are humane and our law says don't put a person to death when he fills with his nuttiness that third prong, which is a lower standard of insanity than I had to meet. 
    But it's clearly met and here are the experts; I point to their testimony, and that's what they said. 
    So be humane. 
    Now, you think he should have said something else. 
    What?

    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    He -- what he should have done is what this Court recognized in Penry v. Lynaugh, is that mental health evidence is a double-edged sword.

    No, he -- he said why.

    He said: We don't execute people who are crazy and this guy is crazy. 
    He might not be crazy enough to meet the standard of not guilty by reason of insanity. 
    He's not crazy enough to meet the standard of incompetency, but you just heard three experts tell you that he's seriously crazy. 
    And if you don't -- if you doubt them, don't doubt your own eyes. 
    I don't see -- how can I sit -- and we have courts, two courts who said, yeah, that was okay.

    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    --For whatever reason we had the State court decision that affirmed this. 
    We have no idea why. 
    The issue is, however, once the lawyer decided that this was the mitigation strategy that he was going to present, this was the evidence that he had available to argue to him, it is the role of the defense counsel to advocate. 
    So once the lawyer makes the strategic decision, I am going to present the closing argument focused -- based on mental health mitigating evidence, then the lawyer's job is to stand up and explain to the--

    I accept all of that, but even if you feel that way, I thought it was a brilliant closing argument. 
    You said you've -- you've conducted many capital cases. 
    Have you ever conducted a capital case in which the defendant takes the stand with a Hitler moustache and says he's glad for what he's done and he will do it again?

    It's rambling, you have to -- in order to get Mr. Cordray's very succinct explanation, you have to go through a couple of pages and drift it out, as Justice Sotomayor said, his argument was fine, and Justice Breyer -- but that is not the argument we have.

    Here's why you should give this guy sympathy. 
    Here's why. 
    Here's -- he's a good guy. 
    I mean, there is -- even standing at that podium, there is a different strategy that people sometimes employ, which is sort of the understated -- you know, well, he did some terrible things, don't -- I'm not asking for sympathy for these things, but -- you know, we are very proud of the fact that we don't execute -- you know, it seems to me that this disagreement is over different styles of advocacy.

    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    But that's what we do under Strickland.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    You just told me that, under Strickland, under anything, there has been no case in which there has been a decision for the defendant, based on the inadequacy of the closing argument alone. 
    So you are asking us to take a new tact and inviting arguments focused exclusively on the closing argument, to see if it meets the Strickland standard.

    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    Yes, but this court has already recognized that the Sixth Amendment applies, the right to counsel applies at closing argument. 
    In Yarborough v. Gentry, at page 5 of this Court's opinion, the Court specifically stated that the right to effective assistance extends to closing argument. 
    So this is not a redevelopment or an expansion of Strickland.

    Why -- why isn't it the Strickland analysis that you read the charge in the context of the case that was presented at trial, and, here, the case was. 
    The only thing going for the defendant were the witnesses to his mental illness and whether, eloquently or not, that theme was played to the jury. 
    This is a mentally ill man.

    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    --That's -- that's correct, and that's the theme that defense counsel said he was going to implement at the closing. 
    What -- the failure of the lawyer was to adequately and effectively make that closing to the jury.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1925.494" stopTime="2002.834">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, he talked about nothing else. 
    And I understand -- look, I am not an expert. 
    I haven't argued these things to juries, and I recognize some lawyers tell me, okay, this was very rambling. 
    I didn't think it was rambling. 
    I thought he was trying to spend a lot of time explaining away to the jury some prosecutorial remark, that you shouldn't pay attention to the expert because you, yourself, the lawyer, didn't talk to them enough. 
    And so you describe that for a couple of pages and why it was irrelevant, and the reason he talked about the -- I thought, the reason he talked about the -- how you will feel when you go out of here, is because he recognizes this is the most sensational case in this community, ever, and all your neighbors are going to congratulate you. 
    But what you are doing here is you are applying a standard, and you are proud to be an American, and that standard, as an American, is a humane standard that requires you to not give the death penalty when the man's insane. 
    Now, I agree that he repeated that 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 times, but it was the same point over and over. 
    And how can I -- since there is a lower court that seemed to find this adequate, how can I sit here and say it wasn't?

    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    No, this Court has never addressed how to apply 2254(d) to a summary decision. 
    In Knowles v. Mirzayance, the Court noted that this was in fact an issue and reserved that for another day. 
    In Early v. Packer, this Court recognized, though, however, that AEDPA constraints are looking at not just at the outcome of the lower court's -- the State court's decisions, but the reasoning behind it, because if you are going to have an unreasonable application of -- of a binding law from this court, the lower courts have to be able to apply it and explain, how did we apply it? 
    Otherwise every decision of the State court would be insulated from Federal habeas review, making the writ available but unavailable. 
    Because no decision would therefore ever be unreasonable if the standard is for a district court judge to say: Can I imagine a reasonable way for the State court to have reached this result? 
    I have; I'm a reasonable judge; the State court must have done what I have done; therefore, the review is limited, and the writ -- and the writ is denied.

    In case of doubt, he loses. 
    Now, AEDPA could have been written differently. 
    It could have been written the way you want. 
    The Supreme Court shall evaluate the reasonableness of the Supreme Court opinion.

    It simply requires the Court to say that when you have summary disposition, that when evaluating the State claim, the State court decision is given the deference that it is due, and that is that we simply cannot determine whether or not it properly applied Federal law, and therefore, it does not get the safe harbor of AEDPA evaluation.

    Most common thing in the world, summary judgment denied, motion denied, this denied, denied, denied. 
    And if I'm going to start doing this for State cases, wouldn't I also have to do it for Federal cases whenever a Federal judge doesn't give all his reasons, which is the most common thing in the world?

    We did? 
    I mean, I've reviewed thousands and thousands of them and I've always thought that a trial judge doesn't have to spell out all his reasons.

    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    --And that would be the evaluation that would continue on in habeas review of these claims, is evaluating the State court decision without, though, simply saying, well, we're going to -- and this is what happens in the lower courts. 
    When you have these summary decisions in 2254(d) analysis, those circuits that have applied this say, what we will imagine a way in which the State court could have reasonably applied this law to reach this result, and therefore, since that is a reasonable way, because of course we as Article 3 judges have reasonably come up with that, it must be reasonable, it's not an unreasonable application, and the writ is denied. 
    The problem that we face is when you look at that in comparison to cases like Wiggins and Rompilla where the State courts affirmatively denied applying Federal standards, you get a different level of review. 
    And so you end up encouraging State courts in these types of cases to simply issue postcard denials: Appeal denied.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So you are saying -- I mean, this is very helpful to me for a variety of reasons, but is -- in your view, the correct role of the habeas judge vis-à-vis the State judge there is the same as the Federal appellate judge vis-à-vis the district judge? 
    That is, I'm thinking of a district judge makes a finding, doesn't fully explain it. 
    Now, I would think it would be unlawful if it's an unreasonable application of a Supreme Court case.

    What you have in this particular case is the totality of the jury instructions were such that a reasonable understanding of the instruction was that the jury had to be unanimous as to the understanding and the existence of a mitigating factor before it could even be considered.

    Mr. Michael J. Benza 
    --No, this Court has maintained that the issue regarding the application of -- of controlling established -- what -- clearly established law by this Court is going to be determined by Teague, and Teague determines that Mills v. Maryland decision applies to this claim. 
    In -- it was adjudicated on the merits in State court. 
    Now there is another -- underlying this is another AEDPA concern, is how does the Federal -- or the State court adjudicate the constitutional claim since Mills had not been presented. 
    It decided the merits of the claim were -- were to be rejected but it did not decide the case under Mills v. Maryland because of course Mills had not been decided and we know from this Court's decision in the Banks case that Mills was a new law.

    --Actually they -- they were told that, because they were also told that that included their decisions as to all disputes of fact. 
    The existence of a mitigating factor is of course a question of fact. 
    So the jury was in fact specifically instructed to be unanimous to every decision that they made including resolving disputes of fact. 
    They were told by both lawyers for the defense and lawyers for the prosecution that the first question they had to answer when they got into the jury room was to the existence of mitigating factors. 
    If they -- if they reasonably understood that they had to be unanimous as to that fact they would have rejected the mitigating factors, even if 11 of them had agreed that the mental health evidence in this case was a mitigating factor.

    But the -- the jury instruction issue is entirely knocked out by the fact that this case is an extension of Mills that goes beyond anything this Court has ever held in the jury instruction context. 
    It is an extension of Mills that has been rejected by the majority of circuits to consider it, even today 20 years later, and it couldn't possibly be understood to be clearly established law. 
    The reference to page 326a and the jury instructions, that's quite distinct from the passage where the jury was told specifically they have to be unanimous only on the ultimate question, whether aggravators outweigh mitigators. 
    This was very different from the jury form in Mills which was itself was somewhat cryptic and -- and later was explained further in McKoy. 
    If I could return then to the ineffectiveness issues. 
    Counsel argued that there was deficiency on a couple of different grounds. 
    First of all, that -- that defense counsel should have argued about family background and performance in prison. 
    The family background was uncontested; it was humdrum; there was nothing special there. 
    Performance in prison was an issue that was raised at trial. 
    The prosecutor read to Spisak on the stand a letter he had written from prison. 
    I am not going to foul the record with his specific verbiage but it was after a card game in which he had gotten into a fight with inmates and said he would like to kill them. 
    When that was read to Spisak on the stand his response was to say "Heil, Hitler" and give the Nazi salute to the jury. 
    So the notion that we should be referring back to his performance in prison and that somehow would have helped mitigate the jury's consideration of the death sentence to me is -- is fanciful. 
    In terms of the argument that defense counsel here argued, nonstatutory aggravators, that is a characterization that I don't think is accurate and it's not accurate as a matter of Ohio law. 
    In our reply brief we cited State v. Hancock which indicates that the nature and circumstances of crimes are always relevant in determining whether the aggravators outweigh the mitigators, and in fact the main aggravator here was that Mr. Spisak engaged in a course of conduct that involved the purposeful killing of more than one person -- two or more persons, or the attempt to kill two or more persons which he had done here and which certainly was going to be and was, in fact, in fact if you read the prosecutor's closing, the heart and soul of the prosecutor's closing. 
    As to whether the mental health presentation was, quote, "not strong enough", obviously it wasn't strong enough in the end to sway the jury. 
    But you cannot judge by hindsight, this Court has said it again and again, counsel's performance. 
    The court said that in Strickland v. Washington itself, emphasized that tremendously in rejecting the deficiency claim in that case. 
    And then in Yarborough as applied to closing arguments, the Court said very specifically we have to be doubly deferential to -- to strategic decisions made at closing, even if we might had made them differently or might have executed them somewhat differently, and particularly through the AEDPA lens.

    What -- what is your answer to your friend's explanation that it's hard to defer when they don't even say anything?
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="3363.446" stopTime="3423.671">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    I think that we have to read the statute. 
    The statute -- the AEDPA statute, 2254 says we defer to what? 
    We defer to an adjudication by the State court on the merits. 
    There is no suggestion here that this adjudication was on some procedural grounds or default grounds. 
    It was a merits adjudication. 
    It wasn't a lengthy, eloquent, you know, long explained adjudication, but it was an adjudication on the merits and deference should be given. 
    The alternative is that if they don't explain which prong they are using that you defer to nothing, and that seems to be not consistent with what Congress clearly intended under AEDPA, nor is it consistent with the language of the statute. 
    The claim was made that the deference only applies when the State court, quote, "has done its job". 
    Under the statute the job is to adjudicate a claim on the merits, not to provide a lengthy discourse in doing so. 
    As to the prejudice point which I think is finally decisive and was the basis on which this Court GVR'd in -- in Landrigan, this is Landrigan--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Can we just go back to that one point.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="3425.293" stopTime="3425.636">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    --Yes, sir.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3425.636" stopTime="3433.713">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Would your deference be exactly the same if, instead of listing all 47 claims or so, they simply entered a one-line order saying, "Affirmed"?
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="3433.713" stopTime="3453.577">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    I believe, Your Honor, under the statute, it would be the same, although here they did more than that -- you know, they cited Strickland. 
    We have to assume they applied Strickland. 
    And, as for the prejudice claim, we have findings from the Ohio Supreme Court that, I think, bear on the prejudice claim. 
    In its decision -- this is 309(a) through 311(a) of the appendix--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3453.577" stopTime="3455.094">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Let me -- let me go back to the question.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="3455.094" stopTime="3455.422">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    --Yes, sir.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3455.422" stopTime="3461.029">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you think they are entitled to more deference because they did cite Strickland if they -- than if they did cite nothing?
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="3461.029" stopTime="3466.431">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    I think that the Ohio Supreme Court is entitled to deference because it adjudicated a claim on the merits, so--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3466.431" stopTime="3469.884">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So it would be exactly the same deference whether they say it's Strickland or not.
speaker="richard_cordray" startTime="3469.884" stopTime="3580.333">
    Mr. Richard Cordray 
    --I would agree with that. 
    However, if the Court was inclined to make gradation -- this is a gradation beyond simply an unexplained order. 
    Yes. 
    As to prejudice, the Ohio Supreme Court at 309(a) through 311(a) itself independently reweighed the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors, which is something the Ohio Supreme Court does under Ohio law. 
    There had been some issues of merger of some of the aggravating circumstances. 
    On direct appeal, they had dealt with those issues, and then they went back and reweighed, and they found that, on this record, the aggravating factors heavily -- lie heavily and beyond a reasonable doubt to outweigh the mitigating factors. 
    That is, in fact, the same kind of determination that the Court would make in trying to determine if there was prejudice here. 
    As to the implementation of the strategy here, it is coherent in understanding what counsel was trying to do. 
    Was it a bit rambling? 
    Perhaps. 
    You know, were there -- were there side issues that he tried to take up, which he thought went to his credibility with the jury and the credibility of the mental illness defense with the jury? 
    But the strategy was twofold. 
    It was to reference the crimes, make it clear to the jury he understood the nature -- the horrific nature of the crimes, as he thought the jury understood it, and then pivot to the mental illness -- mental disease or defect prong as the mitigator that the -- that the jury should apply in not giving the death penalty in this case. 
    I think the strategy was coherent. 
    I'm not sure what else defense counsel could have done in this case, where his client had both committed these horrific crimes, undisputed, and then had reveled in them, in his flamboyant testimony from the stand. 
    In the context of that and given the doubly deferential lens this Court has laid out in Yarborough, I think that there is neither deficiency, nor could there be prejudice on this record. 
    If there are no further questions, Your Honor, thank you for your time.
