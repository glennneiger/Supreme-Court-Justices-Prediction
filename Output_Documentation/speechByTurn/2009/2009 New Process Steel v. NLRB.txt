    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In December of 2007, The National Labor Relations Board had one vacancy and four members. 
    The board expected two more members, two more vacancies at the end of the year just a few away, which would leave the Board with only two members. 
    Too few to meet the quorum requirement in The National Labor Relations Act which requires three members. 
    The four sitting members attempted to preserve the Board’s ability to function by delegating all of the Board’s powers to a group of three members with the expectation that when the term expired for one of the group members a few days later, the remaining two members could continue to issue decisions, as a quorum of that three-member group. 
    For the next 27 months, the Board issued decisions with only two members. 
    Petitioners sought review of two of those decisions challenging the authority of the two member board to act. 
    The Seventh Circuit ruled that the government including that the two members could properly act for the entire board. 
    We granted certiorari to resolve the circuit split on this issue. 
    For the reasons stated in opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that the two remaining board members could not exercise the board’s authority. 
    The portion of the Act that allows the board to delegate its authority to a group of no fewer than three members must be read to require that the group maintain a membership of three in order to continue to exercise the board’s powers. 
    The contrary reading allowing two members to exercise authority as a quorum of the defunct three-member group would allow permanent circumvention of a quorum requirement for the board which demands three members. 
    We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor have joined.
