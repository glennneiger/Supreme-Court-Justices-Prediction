    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The petitioner is a lawful permanent resident who's lived in the United States since he was five years old. 
    He faces deportation under federal law because he committed two misdemeanor drug offenses in Texas. 
    For first offense possession of less than 2 ounces of marijuana, he received a sentence of 20 days in jail. 
    For the second offense, possession without a prescription of one tablet of a common anti-anxiety medication, he received a sentence of 10 days in jail. 
    After the second offense the federal government initiated removal proceedings against him, he conceded that he was removable. 
    The claims that he was eligible for discretionary relief from removal under section 1229b(a) of the immigration statute. 
    So to decide whether he's eligible for cancellation or removal, we have to decide whether he is guilty, whether he has been convicted of an aggravated felony. 
    For reasons stated in my opinion for the Court and in opinions concurring in the judgment of by a Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, we unanimously hold that he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony.
