Holland v. Florida

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Now the second case is Holland versus Florida that a Federal Habeas Corpus statute with certain exceptions gives a state prisoner one year from the time a state court conviction becomes final, until the time he must file a Habeas petition in Federal Court. 
    The answer in this case, two questions related to the running of that one year period. 
    First, is that statute of limitations subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling? 
    That doctrine means that a judge can toll i.e postpone the running of the statute for strong equitable reasons. 
    The doctrine would permit a federal judge to extend the one year Habeas Corpus time limit, provided there are sufficiently strong equitable grounds for doing so. 
    Eleven Courts of Appeals upheld that the doctrine of equitable tolling does apply. 
    Federal statutes of limitations are normally subject to this kind of tolling and we can't find any good reason here for departing from that nor. 
    To the contrary, the underlying subject matter Habeas Corpus is itself an equitable remedy and that fact makes application of the equitable tolling doctrine a particularly suitable thing to do. 
    So like the others, we hold it applies. 
    Second, did the Court of Appeals properly apply the doctrine in this case? 
    The Court of Appeals said that where a prisoner seeks equitable tolling on the ground that his lawyer behaved badly, the petitioner, the prisoner can succeed in showing he needs equitable tolling only if he proves quote bad, faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment and so forth. 
    In our view this standard is too rigid. 
    Equitable doctrines are by their very nature, more flexible and we believe that the Court of Appeals should have applied a more flexible test set out in our prior cases i,e equitable tolling may be justified, one, in extraordinary circumstances as long as, two, the petitioner has been indulged in seeking his remedies. 
    We believe there is adequate judicial precedent to guide this for courts in applying this more general standard. 
    Given the facts of this case which we set out in our opinion, the petitioner maybe entitled to equitable tolling under this more flexible standard. 
    So we remand the cases to the Court of Appeals so that it can reconsider them. 
    Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas joins in part.
