            <text syncTime="21.177" offset="261120">I'd first like to start by emphasizing three points to the Court, first that the Government's interpretation... the Government's... construction of the statute in this case is extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.785" offset="303543">It allows the INS to lock somebody up, potentially for life, just simply because their country of origin will not take them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.740" offset="339383">Secondly, our clients are in no way challenging their orders of deportation, or the Government's plenary power to create categories to deport them, and to deport them.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.117" offset="376894">They are simply asserting their Fifth Amendment right to liberty, which they retain until they are deported from this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.801" offset="399673">And third, the Government has other alternatives in this case, in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.235" offset="425378">They are not left unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.848" offset="431856">The INS retains a substantial statutory and regulatory authority to supervise Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas and those similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.005" offset="476473">In stark contrast to the Government's statutory construction, the circuit court suggested a reasonable construction of this statute that allows for the detention beyond the removal period for a reasonable time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.916" offset="536137">This interpretation, this construction is consistent with the silence of the statute, which, as explained by the circuit court, invites the question of what time period are we talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.662" offset="583053">The Government would seek a time period of "indefinitely", that word to be read into the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.988" offset="860369">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the Chevron deference simply doesn't apply when you're applying the constitutional avoidance doctrine, because I believe that agencies are not... while they may have expertise at interpreting their own statute, they don't necessarily have expertise in interpreting the Constitution, and even most recently this past term this Court in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County did not grant Chevron deference when there was a constitutional problem indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="4591.225" offset="18541296">No, that is absolutely correct, but the... again, coming back to the central issue in this case, all that is at issue here is whether the Attorney General's detention pursuant to expressed statutory authority is reasonably related to the goals that have been advanced, and as long as the person was found by the Attorney General to be dangerous or a flight risk, the detention is reasonably related, and that detention is subject to periodic, automatic review by the Attorney General every year, and in intervening periods the alien can request a review of his status by presenting changed material circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.818" offset="18683716">In that situation, we think that is a very reasonable response on behalf of the two political branches about how to deal with the severe problem of dangerous criminal aliens in our midst.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.559" offset="18738677">It is an inherent part of the sovereignty of every nation to protect itself against aliens who that nation does not believe should be in its presence for purposes of national sovereignty, national security, but also the safety of the populace of that country, and that is what Congress and the Attorney General are responding to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.590" offset="18810775">Safety is not simply a question to be addressed by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.784" offset="18827598">When it comes to aliens in this country, it is Congress' responsibility, not that of the States, or in addition to that of the States, to protect the populace of the United States against the presence of dangerous criminal aliens in the United States, and that is what has been done here on the basis of a criminal prosecution and administrative procedures that unquestionably satisfied due process, and the only remaining... in terms of giving Congress an interest with respect to aliens, it is the equivalent of a State's interest with respect to the mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.115" offset="18956852">In that situation, it is directly parallel to the interests of a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.730" offset="18975347">When does a State come in and intervene with respect to the liberty interest of an individual?</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.932" offset="18992170">With respect to civil commitment, it is in the context of mental illness which gives the State a right to come in and look after the individual and protect the individual and the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.126" offset="19028950">With respect to aliens, it is Congress' plenary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.159" offset="19041071">That has been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.661" offset="19047027">That has been permanently extinguished, that liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.992" offset="19056431">All that remains, then, is the question of dangerousness, and, as this Court has held in the civil commitment cases, a State may place on the alien the burden of showing that he is no longer dangerous at the end of a particular period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.250" offset="19105436">There have been no questions here about the statutory authority of the Attorney General to detain the aliens, but we think it is clear that the Attorney General has that authority conferred by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="4755.023" offset="19196552">I have just four points I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.809" offset="19207627">The first is that the administrative process in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.527" offset="19218494">What 's fundamentally wrong about it, it takes absolutely no consideration that deportation is not foreseeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.181" offset="19249110">If it did, and if the agency weighed foreseeability with actual and real evidence of dangerousness and flight risk, we would have no quarrel with the agency applying that constitutional test in reviewing these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.024" offset="19300519">Secondly, as I just said, the test in any case has to be, is detention excessive in relationship to the legitimate Government's interest, and we feel like the district court in Mr. Ma's case had the proper test, balancing foreseeability of deportation with dangerousness, real evidence of dangerousness and flight risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.088" offset="19380767">We would draw the line at, is deportation foreseeable, and say on balance everyone would get out on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.492" offset="19406367">This Court may disagree, and want to allow a broader balancing test where actual foreseeability might be a gradiated scale and allow for different balances to be drawn, but in any case, that's the test that should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.315" offset="19461642">Third, that there's no authority for this Court to expand Mezei.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.703" offset="19483272">The decision in Wong Wing is over 100 years, and that stands as a general rule that informs the Mezei narrow exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.225" offset="19513365">Witkovich is similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.259" offset="19521515">Individuals who've been ordered deported did not lose their constitutional rights.</text>
