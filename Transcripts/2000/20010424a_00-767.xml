            <text syncTime="50.117" offset="354926">In this case, there are questions both of jurisdiction and of the merits of whether the Attorney General reasonably construed the act to conclude that petitioner in this case, oh, excuse me, respondent in this case is ineligible for discretionary relief under the repeal of 1182(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="69.786" offset="433607">I do want to make sure that I'm able to address the merits question, but I did have a few things that I wanted to address with respect to habeas corpus and the constitutional question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.325" offset="479792">One recent decision of this Court which I think is instructive on the question of when, what sorts of claims Congress must make a judicial forum available to, is the Court's decision two terms ago in American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee v. Reno in which the Court concluded that a constitutional claim of selective enforcement was not a judicially cognizable defense to a final order of removal, and in our view, if Congress could provide under the immigration laws that that sort of claim does not give right to a personal right to have a final order of removal set aside, then it follows a fortiori that Congress is not required to provide a judicial forum for a failure by the Attorney General to grant discretionary relief from removal that is purely statutory in form and particularly here where the objection is a non-constitutional objection to the failure to grant discretionary relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.798" offset="1009659">We think that the statute provides for judicial review of the two fundamental points at issue in a removal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.228" offset="1039335">Is the person an alien and is the person subject to removal?</text>
            <text syncTime="224.572" offset="1052709">The statute provides for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.005" offset="1062531">The Zipper clause that this Court referred to in the AADC v. Reno provides that all questions of law and fact, including statutory interpretation and constitutional interpretation can be heard only on judicial review of a final order of removal in the Court of Appeals.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="243.807" stopTime="366.614">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="243.807" offset="1129718">Well, you go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.748" offset="1137451">With respect to habeas corpus, it is not at all the case that Congress overlooked even in Section 1252 the possibility of habeas corpus relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.665" offset="1173082">Subsection (A)(1) of Section 1252 establishes the general rule of Court of Appeals review but it specifically carves out an exception for situations in which an alien is in expedited removal proceedings and as to that, Subsection (e) of 1252 specifically provides for judicial review by habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.560" offset="1252703">So Congress knew when to provide and preserve habeas corpus by name in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.928" offset="1274123">It did it for that limited category and did it in no other and 1252(b)(9), the Zipper clause says that unless that it's specifically provided for in 1252, the review is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.195" offset="1319263">And if there could be any doubt as I mentioned even before IIRIRA, Congress in AEDPA had repealed the provision of the prior judicial review provision in Section 1105a(a)(10) that said that, provided for custody review of aliens of their deportation orders, that that was specifically eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.115" offset="1406930">So Congress knew very well what it was doing in eliminating habeas corpus as such but providing a fully adequate substitute, constitutionally adequate substitute in the court of appeals, something that this Court said in Swain Congress can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.687" offset="1465235">I have a question that perhaps the statute answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.691" offset="1481222">I just don't have it clearly in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.170" offset="1491148">If there had not been the provision, the specific provision for habeas in the accelerated review cases, would habeas review have been necessarily postponed in those cases until after the court of appeals had finished?</text>
            <text syncTime="353.982" offset="1570352">In other words, I guess my question is was the provision for habeas review in the accelerated cases in effect the provision of kind of an alternative forum that otherwise wouldn't have been available until the conclusion of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="381.269" offset="1679544">In the prior law, it was frankly unclear to what extent habeas overlapped with court of appeals review, and this was I think part of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.845" offset="1717891">Some courts have held that in habeas the alien could not get review of the merits of the deportation order but could just challenge the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.276" offset="1747566">Some courts have allowed some review of the deportation order, which, of course, would have provided for duplicative review in the courts of appeals and the district courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.437" offset="1792184">No, I think the reason under the new law was one of expedition, to not have two stops in the court but only one petition for review in the courts of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.946" offset="1914228">Well, as we explain in our brief, the provision in the INA was necessary to preserve that habeas corpus because the prior act was worded, the judicial review is in the courts of appeals under the Hobbs Act except, and as this Court said in Stone there were a series of exceptions that follow that, one of which was the specific exception for district court habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.600" offset="2000850">Now, whether one views that exception as itself a grant of habeas or a preservation of habeas under 2241, we think is essentially irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.742" offset="2101473">And so, in the period of when you could go one place or the other, wasn't it the 1105 that was used to get into the district court?</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="495.287" stopTime="672.130">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="495.287" offset="2135642">Some courts said it was 2241.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.895" offset="2142015">Some said it was 1105(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="498.752" offset="2149434">Some courts didn't explain it and there was really no reason to.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.179" offset="2163227">In our view, probably the best way to look at it is that 1105(a) preserved general habeas jurisdiction but you could look at 1105(a) as a specific grant, but in either event, it was an expressexception to what otherwise would have been an exclusive court of appeals jurisdiction which the legislative history we set out in our brief of the 61 Act shows that Congress was aware that habeas corpus would have been precluded if the statute had been permitted toward... to be worded that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.272" offset="2283599">I also want to just briefly just touch on the notion that there is an unconstitutional suspension of habeas corpus if the Act operates in the way that we describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.727" offset="2321320">And we think that that is clearly not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.244" offset="2331455">As this Court said in Felker, first of all, habeas corpus is available only insofar as it's provided by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.393" offset="2356011">The courts are not free at large to address that question and the Court also reiterated in Felker that Congress, that it's essentially up to Congress, at least in the first instance, to exercise the judgment as to what the scope of the writ should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.080" offset="2418809">Beyond that, in this context we think that's especially so because Congress has plenary power over immigration and has to be able to balance the need for access to the courts against, in this situation, what Congress saw to be a critical need for expeditious removal of criminal aliens who have already had a chance to test their criminal convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.195" offset="2495295">And finally, this Court has also said that Congress, deference is owed to Congress with respect to what due process procedures are appropriate for people generally, and again, that's something where deference we think is especially appropriate in the immigration context.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.510" offset="2556526">For all of these reasons, we think Congress's judgment as to what sorts of things should be subject to review and what should not is due extraordinary deference by this, by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.694" offset="2601248">And, in particular, we do not believe that Congress is required to provide for judicial review of a power that it has granted in the discretion of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.468" offset="2644298">This is not worded as a personal right of the alien, much less a personal right that is so fundamental that an alien should have access to courts, must have access to courts, to litigate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.068" offset="2690691">Congress should not be put to the choice or put in the all or nothing position of granting discretionary powers to the Attorney General only at the cost of buying into a system of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.800" offset="2741682">As this Court said in AADC v. Reno, there are a number of discretionary determinations the Attorney General makes all the time with respect to whether to institute proceedings in the first place, whether to drop them along the way, whether to perhaps not execute the order of removal at the end of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.130" offset="2806988">Those are all discretionary and surely Congress is not required to provide for judicial review of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.248" offset="2827468">Congress could conclude that this should be regarded in the same way.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.434" offset="3104157">So, the general thrust of the INS's enforcement efforts has been that but I certainly can't represent that it would never decline to remove someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.670" offset="3145117">And the fact that in Accardi again an unexplained decision, this power may well once have been exercised should not prevent Congress from revisiting the question, revisiting the question of how discretionary relief should be thought of in saying for these purposes, it is constitutionally equivalent to the sort of discretion to institute proceedings in the first place that was unreviewable in AADC v.

            <text syncTime="857.685" offset="3585228">If I could turn to the merits question of whether the Attorney General reasonably determined that the repeal of 1182(c) does not provide a basis for relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.376" offset="3627965">First of all, Congress specifically addressed the temporal applicability of all of Title III-A of IIRIRA of which this repeal is a part in Section 309 of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.736" offset="3677388">In 309(a) Congress specified what it called a Title III-A effective date, which was six months after IIRIRA was enacted, the delay obviously being put in place to allow the Attorney General to set up the new procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.951" offset="3738306">And then Congress, in 309(c) specified what is the operative event for applying that effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.555" offset="3764637">What it said was that for people in exclusion or deportation proceedings, note not removal proceedings, an exclusion or a deportation proceedings as of the Title III effective date, the amendments made by Title III shall not apply but instead, the prior law, the INA as in effect prior to Title III-A shall apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.353" offset="3851886">It follows for people like the petitioner here, excuse me, the respondent here, who was put in removal proceedings after the Title III-A effective date that Congress intended that the Title III-A provisions would be applied and Congress enacted them as a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.367" offset="3915939">As I mentioned, it eliminated deportation and exclusion and replaced it with removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.478" offset="3940389">It repealed specifically 1182(c) and replaced it with cancellation of removal and it provided a new system of judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.259" offset="4015517">And suppose after I got through reading all these complex arguments technically on both sides, I got to the situation where I thought I want to assume Congress would have wanted to do what was basically fair in terms of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.113" offset="4078943">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.599" offset="4084899">Then I thought there'd be, what's gone is the Attorney General's discretion to deal with a sympathetic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.005" offset="4106528">I've thought of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.741" offset="4113424">A man, 40, 45 years old, had several children, the bread-earner of the family when, in his youth, once stole a pair of tennis shoes in Massachusetts... an aggravated felony under this statute, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.466" offset="4176327">Another time, on another occasion he stole some fruit from a passing train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.122" offset="4199002">All right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.404" offset="4204122">Now, what would seem to be the fair thing is at least you give him a shot so that we he was 20 years old and was going to steal the fruit from the train, he would know that that might mean deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.952" offset="4254277">And so, if we're going to assume Congress would have wanted to do the fair thing, why wouldn't we assume that at least it would give these people a shot so that the second time they know the likely consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.729" offset="4313418">Hence, we would apply this so that it applies to people whose second felony, aggravated felony like stealing a pair of tennis shows, I say slightly sarcastically but it's within that, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.445" offset="4364200">So that they'd at least know when they did that what's going to happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1112.381" offset="4604004">First of all, we don't think it's technical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.321" offset="4611736">We think the statutory specification of an effective date and what events that effective date attaches to couldn't be clearer from looking at Section 309 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.435" offset="4652174">Congress identified the commencement of proceedings as the operative event and that makes sense because what cancellation of removal as it's now called is something that is a forgiveness of a ground of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.810" offset="4705673">It's something that only arises after the removal proceedings have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.845" offset="4725839">So, we think the statutory answer is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.240" offset="4735452">With respect to fairness, it depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.182" offset="4743184">Congress is looking at fairness from a broader perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.359" offset="4755932">It was looking at fairness from the perspective of a large number of criminal aliens in this country who had not obeyed our laws and it wanted to do something about it and Congress also, and importantly, concluded, made the judgment that the Executive Branch was granting far too many applications for discretionary relief under 1182(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.331" offset="4839837">What Congress did here spoke to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.424" offset="4852167">It did not speak to any supposed rights of individual aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.934" offset="4866169">It was responding to what it regarded as excessive, and even referred to as abuse of the power that was granted by the Attorney General and they wanted to take that away, and they wanted to take that away now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.285" offset="4911622">The only effective way they could do that was to stop now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.764" offset="4921548">It wouldn't have made any sense to grandfather in people who may have committed crimes 10 or 20 years ago if what they wanted to do was to stop the Executive Branch from granting too many applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.146" offset="4971077">At the close of our reply brief, we had citations to a colloquy between Senator Abraham and Senator Hatch and if you read that colloquy, it responds directly to your point, Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.430" offset="5028233">We don't set it out at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.544" offset="5032621">But, importantly, in IIRIRA Congress actually drew back a little bit on the disqualification for discretionary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.059" offset="5062714">Under AEDPA the disqualification under 1182(c) for criminal aliens was broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.176" offset="5083194">In IIRIRA for a permanent resident alien, Congress confined it to aggravated felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.876" offset="5317983">Well, that's the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.611" offset="5328954">But even then, what Congress, what he explained is that Congress made them eligible for cancellation of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.998" offset="5354450">He didn't say that Congress had somehow carried forward 1182(c) relief, which, as we point out, was expressly repealed in Section 304(b) of IIRIRA, and it was repealed because it had been replaced with the provision for the cancellation of removal which Congress intended to be applied as part of a package dealing with the institution of removal proceedings and then the cancellation of removal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.376" offset="5459984">Congress did not intend a hybrid sort of thing where discretionary relief from inadmissibility could somehow be applied in the proceeding where that didn't even make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.243" offset="5507423">But beyond the statutory answer to the question that we think Congress supplied in Section 309, this change in the law is not retroactive within the meaning of this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence and there are a variety of ways in which that could be understood but they all point in the same direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.212" offset="5583282">And I would like to identify them because they're different ways of coming at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.889" offset="5598015">First of all, this Court has said in Lopez-Mendoza and most recently again in the AADC case that the enforcement of the immigration laws is inherently prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.323" offset="5643782">It looks to the question of whether aliens will be permitted to remain in the United States in the future, whereas the Court said in AADC, deportation is necessary in order to bring to an end an ongoing violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.954" offset="5694251">And the reason why this is so is that part of the justification for Congress's plenary power over immigration is as this Court said in the Harisiades case, that Congress has to take into account the contemporaneous policies with respect to aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.103" offset="5754855">It has to decide at any particular moment in time who that is an alien in this country should be permitted to remain and who should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.739" offset="5785470">Removal is not punishment or regulation of past conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.415" offset="5800099">It is a determination of who should be permitted to stay in the United States in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.550" offset="5820683">Another point that can be made about 1182(c) and Congress's repeal of it is that it operates much like the repeal of the authority to grant injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.224" offset="5863315">When the Attorney General grants, under the prior law, granted 1182(c) relief, it was essentially an injunction against carrying out an order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.883" offset="5901976">Well, this Court has made clear than when Congress most recently in Miller v. French that when Congress changes the authority for granting prospective relief, that that change in the authority for granting prospective relief has to be applied by the Courts at the time that it is applied, that it arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.029" offset="5982538">Another point is that this statute speaks to the power of the Attorney General not to any rights of the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.632" offset="6008974">This provision has never been worded as a right of the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.636" offset="6024961">It is again an act of grace or like a pardon as this Court has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.126" offset="6047008">And this Court has made clear in its retroactivity jurisprudence and in Kansas v. Hendricks, for example, even in considering the ex post facto clause, that a statute is not retroactive simply because it arises in a case that is based on antecedent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.042" offset="6118584">You have to look to see whether it is punishment or a penalty for the past conduct or whether what's going on is simply regulating someone's current ability and in Kansas v. Hendricks it was a current ability to be at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.698" offset="6177307">The statute, though, was triggered on the basis of prior conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.706" offset="7261284">I want to address first a few remaining issues on the jurisdictional question before I turn to retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.279" offset="7283540">Again, an analogy to the exercise of the pardon power is simply not applicable here because that deals with the exercise of discretion, not with the question of legal eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.887" offset="7325963">We raise no claim regarding the exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.942" offset="7338188">Our claim is regarding the Attorney General's decision to exclude from eligibility an entire class of individuals based on the Attorney General's decision to apply the new statute retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.998" offset="7386463">That question of whether the new statute applies retroactively is a pure question of law and is one that's governed by the Landgraf principles and they're for courts to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.573" offset="7424706">By the very nature of the inquiry, it's an inquiry that must be decided by a court because it turns to what Congress intended pursuant to the default rules that this Court enunciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.347" offset="7467860">Secondly, the American Arab case, we think, doesn't speak to the question here because the American Arab case dealt with whether claims could be raised in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals or whether an issue had to await resolution until there was a final order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.118" offset="7530972">There is a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.521" offset="7536510">This is not about the fragmentation of procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.833" offset="7545810">This is a question about whether any court at any time will be able to review this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.287" offset="7571619">And as we've indicated in our briefs, we believe it's appropriate to construe the statute to allow review in the Court of Appeals of this pure question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.370" offset="7607981">That does not lead to delay of proceedings or delay of removal; it's a pure question of law that needs to be interpreted as to what the statute means.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.467" offset="7932317">But this particular claim I was thinking of is like a claim of no jurisdiction because it's saying there's a provision of the statute, a whole big section, that just doesn't apply because the time hasn't come yet for it to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1968.615" offset="8028971">It certainly is analogous in the sense that the Attorney General has decided what issue he has jurisdiction over and he's decided that he has no power to even consider these claims for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.497" offset="8080484">So, in that sense, it certainly goes to the Attorney General's determination of what the statute means and what class of cases he has jurisdiction to consider discretion and in that respect it's certainly similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.764" offset="8125519">I just want to note that the final order continues to be contingent on the adjudication of discretionary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.646" offset="8177033">It has been like that since 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.996" offset="8186437">It continues to be like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.565" offset="8192706">The new cancellation provision is still the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.455" offset="8204304">The regulation that I referred to earlier is at 212.3, I believe it is, and there is also a regulation at 1229 under the regulations implementing 1229(b) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.458" offset="8256340">One goes to the 1182(c) form of relief that we're asserting here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.916" offset="8274104">The other one goes to the existing cancellation of relief that's available for people whose convictions occur after the effective date but it continues to be the case that these applications for relief have to be adjudicated before a final order of deportation can be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.543" offset="8344634">And I want to go back to the Accardi case for another moment because it is the case that Accardi was decided by this Court in the term immediately following the Heikkila decision and in Heikkila the court went back and reviewed the entire sweep of decisions that this court had decided in relation to review of deportation orders during the time when the review was extremely limited and was limited to that that was available in habeas corpus and Heikkila reviewed all of that and it did it in detail and at the conclusion of that review, it said that the only scrutiny that was available was that which was required by the Constitution and the very next year this Court looked at the Accardi claim and in that context held that the claim raised there, a claim regarding discretionary relief, was reviewable and the dissent went back and cited the very same case that the court in Heikkila had said restricted review to the minimum, the Ecku case, and said that's the scope of review that we think is appropriate and habeas should not cover that claim and the Court rejected that and exercised jurisdiction over the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.049" offset="8626652">So, Heikkila and Accardi together, I think, establish that this claim is reviewable if it falls within that and it clearly does.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.363" offset="13379893">Right, that's certainly one of the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.205" offset="13387312">And it's not analogous to an injunction because this is not an ongoing prohibition against deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.468" offset="13416360">And that's, this is a one time negating the immigration consequences of a prior criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.725" offset="13449379">That's what the waiver does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.839" offset="13453767">It is not on ongoing injunction against deportation and that also distinguishes this circumstance from the other cases that the government was speaking about that were discussed in AADC... prosecutorial discretion, an after the fact decision by the Attorney General not to actually implement the deportation or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.174" offset="13531194">Those are discretionary acts and we recognize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.387" offset="13539971">And those are not in the same category as this particular form of relief from deportation which has been in the statute since 1917 and upon which the final order of deportation is contingent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.928" offset="13594202">So, deferred action, and prosecutorial discretion, those other kinds of things are very different and that might be a unilateral hope but eligibility for a waiver of deportation is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.073" offset="13638714">I believe that the question this Court faces is whether a pure question of law decided by the Attorney General that will determine whether deportation becomes mandatory for persons who committed offenses many, many years ago at a time when the eligibility for relief was in the law and their likelihood of receiving it was at least fifty-fifty, whether that pure question is reviewable in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.660" offset="13797121">The Attorney General has decided that he lacks all authority, not because he doesn't want to grant relief, not because he thinks it might not be appropriate in many, many cases but because the Attorney General determined that he lacks the statutory authority because Congress took it away from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.833" offset="13865771">We believe that legal ruling is wrong and that there is nothing in the statute that manifests the clear and unambiguous intent that this Court has repeatedly held in the retroactivity context is mandatory to impose those kinds of drastic new legal consequences on long time legal permanent residents who have made their lives, who have established their families, and who have done nothing wrong but that one offense, one time in the past and ever since complied with the law and are now swept up in this change and subject to mandatory deportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.091" offset="14022819">Yes, with respect to the cases that I would rely on for nonretroactivity, Justice Stevens, I would mention Kansas v. Hendricks where the Court said there was no ex post facto violation because the act wasn't retroactive even though it operated. One of the triggers was a prior conviction, but it looked to current and future of status. Also, the Cox case mentioned in Landgraf itself gives a description of some such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.201" offset="14119263">With respect to attaching new legal consequences, that has to be proximate legal consequences in the sense of the statute like Title VII itself imposing penalties on prior conduct. The immigration laws do not regulate and penalize prior conduct. They look to someone's current status and decide whether he shall remain in the United States. There's no pre-existing right to remain in the United States so a new ground of removal does not interfere with any pre-existing rights. In particular, there was no right to expect to be granted relief from deportation. So, even if a new ground, substantive ground, for removal would be retroactive, and this Court's opinions would refute that, certainly taking away a discretionary power in the Attorney General to grant relief in the future is in no way retroactive. We think this case comes down to a question of deference to the Attorney General under this Court's decision in Aguirre and Aguirre and Chevron and the Attorney General has reasonably construed the act not to allow discretionary relief. With respect to jurisdiction, Congress was not required to recognize this form of relief as the sort of fundamental personal right that habeas has to be available for.</text>
