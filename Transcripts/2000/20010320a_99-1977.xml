            <text syncTime="6.399" offset="180578">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.083" offset="191340">Qualified immunity has an important role to play in Fourth Amendment unreasonable force cases just as it does in Fourth Amendment unreasonable search cases and in other constitutional contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.971" offset="238883">The decision below effectively merged the qualified immunity and Fourth Amendment tests in the case of unreasonable force cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.722" offset="273887">The court reasoned that because both tests are framed in terms of objective reasonableness, the qualified immunity test had nothing to add to the underlying Fourth Amendment test.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.867" offset="318504">This Court rejected a virtually indistinguishable line of reasoning in Anderson against Creighton and with good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.183" offset="343791">The Fourth Amendment and qualified immunity tests are distinct and serve different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.128" offset="367510">The Fourth Amendment test governs primary conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.728" offset="377959">It looks at the force used and asks whether that force was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.352" offset="396453">The qualified immunity test by contrast looks at the preexisting law and asks whether that preexisting law would have put a reasonable officer on notice that his or her conduct was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.818" offset="446295">Qualified immunity thus recognizes that even competent officers will make reasonable mistakes and government officials should not be held personally liable when they make reasonable judgment calls just because their judgment turns out to be mistaken.</text>

            <text syncTime="88.050" offset="507213">Could you tell me how the test works?</text>
            <text syncTime="90.834" offset="518393">I take it qualified immunity is presented initially to the trial judge as a basis for dismissing and then if he rules, is the jury also instructed about qualified immunity?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="105.678" offset="577743">Well in many cases, once the case is... the issue of qualified immunity is brought before the judge, the judge can rule on whether there's a qualified immunity protection in the case and there'll be no issue that needs to go to the jury in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.310" offset="628316">Now suppose he overrules the qualified immunity defense, does the jury then determine both qualified immunity and, in this case, whether or not the force was reasonable?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="128.794" offset="670217">It would depend on the circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.479" offset="680979">In some cases, the judge may want to try to isolate the factual issues that are at stake in the qualified immunity context and just have the jury focusing on those factual situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.399" offset="732597">Well that may actually end up being the only issue that jury really needs to focus on.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.312" offset="752241">If I could give you an example, in a recent Tenth Circuit case called Cruz against City of Laramie, the Tenth Circuit decided that the use of a hog-tie restraint was unreasonable when used with an individual who exhibited signs of diminished capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.446" offset="808770">In that same opinion, they reserved the question about whether that restraint was unreasonable when used on an individual who did not exhibit signs of diminished capacity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="172.263" stopTime="182.377">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="172.263" offset="844088">I mean the reason I'm asking is that, if the jury hears both questions, I want to know what the instructions sound like, and whether or not the jury can make this distinction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="182.377" stopTime="259.281">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="182.377" offset="884525">In many cases, I think the jury will not really, if there's no liability... I'm sorry, if there's no issue about injunctive relief, it may just be a situation where the court can simply decide what the clearly-established law is and instruct the jury on that clearly-established law and then the jury can make its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.953" offset="958818">To pick up the example from the Tenth Circuit case, if in a subsequent decision, the Tenth Circuit extended its rule and applied the rule to all individuals, saying the hog-tie restraint is never reasonable, I think because the court had previously expressly reserved the question of whether the hog-tie restraint was reasonable when applied to an individual who did not exhibit signs of diminished capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.244" offset="1048052">In that case, the issue for the jury would be whether or not the individual who was arrested exhibited signs of diminished capacity and that would really be the only issue the jury needed to decide because if the individual had exhibited signs of diminished capacity, under the court's prior decision in Cruz, that... that conduct would be not only unlawful but clearly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.306" offset="1128300">On the other hand, if the jury decided that the individual had not exhibited signs of diminished capacity, then in that instance, although the conduct was unlawful, by virtue of this hypothetical second decision, the conduct would not be clearly established and there'd be no liability in that situation.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="259.281" offset="1192143">So you're saying the only situation in which the two increase in effect will be exactly the same, is the situation in which the general standard has, by course of judicial decision, been reduced down to a kind of pinpoint specific rule for certain cases, e.g., hog-tie cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.691" offset="1265809">And in the case in which immunity is claimed, the facts in that case are precisely duplicative of the facts, which have been found to result in this pinpoint rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.035" offset="1315128">That's the only I case, I take it on your view, in which the two increase will, in effect, reach precisely the same result necessarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.892" offset="1358595">I think that in Anderson against Creighton itself, this Court noted that there's not a requirement that the previous case law be on all four--</text>

            <text syncTime="309.148" offset="1391614">Oh, I'm not saying that there is a requirement, but I'm saying that, if in fact the previous case law has got to the pinpoint stage and the facts claimed by way of defense precisely fall within that pinpoint, then the two increase will not be different, but that's the only case I take in which that will be true on your view.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.614" offset="1477505">--I'm not sure if that's the only case where that's going to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.495" offset="1492969">I think there other cases where the preexisting law, although not showing the way with pinpoint accuracy, it still provides the officers with sufficiently clear notice that there's no real rule for qualified immunity in those particular cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.779" offset="1550125">Mr. Clement, it might help if you gave us, what would be the... suppose the judge thinks, I don't want to decide the qualified immunity myself because I think there's some fact questions involved about what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.102" offset="1607490">So let's take this very case and the judge wants to charge the jury so they'll understand the difference between excessive force that violates the Fourth Amendment and qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.303" offset="1664228">How would the judge charge in this very case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="379.986" stopTime="434.311">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="379.986" offset="1674991">I think the judge in this case would charge by using the language from this Court's previous qualified immunity opinions, language from cases like Malley and Hunter against Bryant and would charge the jury with finding... in order to find liability in this case, the jury would have to find that the individual officer exhibited... either was plainly incompetent or exercised judgment that was outside the range of professional judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.993" offset="1778958">I'm not sure it would really be necessary in a case where the only issue is liability to really direct the court's attention a great deal to the liability standard because that issue's going to effectively drop out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.138" offset="1823575">To be sure, the jury may need to be instructed on what the relevant law of excessive force is, but once that instruction is put in place as sort a background instruction then the real question that the jury needs to focus on is the question of whether or not the officer's conduct was so unreasonable that it put it outside the range of professional--</text>

            <text syncTime="440.727" offset="1917929">Now you say, ordinarily the... something will drop out of the liability phase, but I didn't quite follow that.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.057" offset="1947291">--All I meant by that is that since there will be no liability imposed in the ordinary case without a finding that the officer's not entitled to qualified immunity, it'll be the qualified immunity question that will really be the ultimate focus of the jury's attention because that'll determine whether or not they find sufficient cause to award damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.859" offset="2270478">And after all, as this Court emphasized in Harlow against Fitzgerald and subsequent cases, the qualified immunity is not just an immunity from liability, but it protects the officers from the chilling effect of the inconvenience of having to stand trial in those situations where prior decisions have not clearly marked the individual's conduct as being unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.410" offset="2444662">And then the jury would also be asked, if that is the case, was that use of excessive force so obvious?</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.917" offset="6594684">I would like to walk this Court through the process and the steps so that there's an understanding of how Anderson and Graham are being used effectively now in the trial courts in order to weed out insubstantial cases and to have the jurors decide these issues in a way that both the individual's right to a remedy and provides the insulation that the officers need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.520" offset="6693113">Now the starting point is with a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment and at that point and I know this both from representing police officers and from representing plaintiffs at trial in the federal trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.926" offset="6750687">The first step is, you move to dismiss on the defense side and you take out Anderson and you say could the officer have... whether the officer could have reasonably believed that they could use the amount of force that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.641" offset="6801573">Anderson sets that straight out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.076" offset="6811291">And then the next thing you do is you take Graham to inform the decision, which is why the opinion is such a brilliant one, because it provides the specifics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.960" offset="6842847">It provides a three-step test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.012" offset="13491115">Because, Your Honors, it's in the... there are moments when it's up to the judges to decide to make sure that the rights are not deteriorating and that's exactly what's happened here both with Judge Jensen and with Judge Thompson in the unanimous decision of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.134" offset="13563526">And so we would urge this Court to follow the decisions of the Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth and D.C. Circuits that strike the proper balance between preserving the remedy for the individual and insulating the police officers in the performance of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.710" offset="13637818">With that I have nothing further and I thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.136" offset="13651611">Thank you, Mr. Boyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.962" offset="13654850">Mr. Clement, you have three minutes... or four minutes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="3380.164" stopTime="3482.332">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3380.164" offset="13675644">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.816" offset="13682331">Like to make three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.508" offset="13689018">First for those of you who have reviewed the videotape, the very fact that this Court could disagree with Ninth Circuit about whether there was excessive force used in this case underscores the need for qualified immunity for officers in the field because clearly Graham against Connor did not answer every case and did not provide officers on crystal clear notice of where the lines were in the excessive-force context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.965" offset="13778880">The second point I'd like to make is simply that jury instruction issues and the question of what goes to the jury and what the judge should decide, those issues are not unique to the excessive-force context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.739" offset="13822034">Those same issues arise under probable cause and exigent circumstance in Anderson against Creighton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.857" offset="13842409">And Mr. Boyd's actually correct that some of the Circuits have taken divergent views on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.944" offset="13858814">It may be appropriate for the Court eventually to take up that issue, but as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, this case would be an incredibly poor vehicle to do so since we're here on summary judgment and the Ninth Circuit's denial of summary judgment and the Government's position continues to be that that grant of... that denial of summary judgment was inappropriate and this Court should reverse that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.173" offset="13939689">Finally, I want to clarify that despite what may have been said here it is not accurate to say that the Ninth Circuit, or at least Graham itself, incorporates the test of Anderson against Creighton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.092" offset="13991412">Graham itself does allow officers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to reasonable mistakes of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.697" offset="14017848">It doesn't grant them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to reasonable mistakes of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.783" offset="14034148">And it doesn't incorporate into its reasonableness test the notion of what the preexisting law was and it's a good thing that it doesn't because if that were the case, then the Fourth Amendment law would be frozen in place.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3482.332" offset="14084408">It seems to me that what you're asking is to say that the police officer is entitled to know in every case precisely what he must do and I'm not sure either under qualified immunity and then certainly under general Fourth Amendment principles we can do that.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3497.647" offset="14145639">I don't think that's what we're asking, with all due respect Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.787" offset="14158178">I think what we're asking is that the officers be put on fair warning that their conduct is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.838" offset="14178344">Justice Souter in an opinion for the Court in United States against Lanier addressed this issue in the context of 18 U.S.C. 242 and made clear that what's required in that context, and he noted that the same rule applies in qualified immunity, is the officers have fair warning because the principles, the general principles, have been made specific is the term he used, by application through prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.872" offset="14270504">The Eleventh Circuit in a case called Lassiter against Alabama A&amp;M expressed the same concept by saying that what you need is the prior case law that's materially similar.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.276" offset="14308120">Well, if the standards are the same, sometimes by coincidence it could turn out that the qualified immunity standard and the underlying substantive standard are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.903" offset="14346677">And if so, there's only one question to ask and if not there are obviously two questions to ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.879" offset="14374576">All right, I thought all they're arguing is that this and the Ninth Circuit says by coincidence they happen to be the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3565.447" offset="14416790">--Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.985" offset="14418984">Absolutely, because Graham against Connor itself does not build in reasonable mistakes of law or take into account what the preexisting law was.</text>

            <text syncTime="3575.273" offset="14456078">That's exactly right, because if it were otherwise then the very fact that prior law didn't put an officer on notice and there was unclarity would itself mean that the conduct was lawful and then there'd be no mechanism for the law to provide clarity in the Fourth Amendment context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.936" offset="14510726">It's the same idea as to why this Court asked lower courts to deal with the liability... the constitutional issue first and only the immunity question second.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.888" offset="14542595">The last point I'd like to make is in response to Justice Ginsburg's question about what the rationale of the Ninth Circuit below was in a subsequent case decided last week.</text>
