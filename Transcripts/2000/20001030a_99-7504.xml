            <text syncTime="13.226" offset="202835">This case comes to you out of the State of South Dakota, and I'd like to briefly put the setting for all of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.427" offset="227599">This is from Yankton, South Dakota, which was the first territorial capital of the Dakota Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.216" offset="254766">As a result of that, certain institutions were created, one of which was Yankton College.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.329" offset="275246">It was the oldest college in the Dakotas and Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.627" offset="288412">It's now closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.715" offset="292801">It closed in the 1980's, and it's now a Federal prison camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.870" offset="309414">That Federal prison camp has no walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.109" offset="322371">It looks like Yankton College did for over a century until it was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.439" offset="339716">At that place resides today Chris Lopez.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.849" offset="353300">Chris Lopez came to the Yankton prison camp from the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.867" offset="373362">He drove across the State of Iowa and was allowed to do so by the district court to self-report to this college campus, now Federal prison camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.825" offset="413173">We're here today to talk about 18 U.S.C. 3621(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="71.171" offset="434593">That statute at the time that Chris Lopez was a convicted person, before he was a prisoner, unambiguously grants to him an incentive, and before he knocked on the door to be let into prison it said to him, if you are a drug abuser, which he admits he is, and if you agree to undergo the program, which he does, if you've been convicted of a nonviolent offense, Congress has made a deal with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.459" offset="567713">We will allow you, if you successfully complete the program, to be let out of prison up to 1 year early.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.662" offset="604598">He had 72 months to serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.600" offset="624347">The statute says the Bureau of Prisons may reduce the sentence up to 1 year.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.833" offset="693205">The legislative history is clear that that was considered by Congress, and Congress did not wish to make it a right that if you simply go through the program yet you led the gang on the campus, or you created other disciplinary problems, that the Bureau of Prisons shouldn't have control over the prisoner while that prisoner was incarcerated, but this is something I'd like--</text>

            <text syncTime="194.404" offset="927576">3621(a) is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.908" offset="941578">3621(a) tells the Bureau of Prisons that they may not release a prisoner until the expiration of the term imposed, or there's a good conduct section 3624, so when (e) was enacted... and the legislative history is Congress also amended section 3621(b), which says the bureau shall make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each prisoner the bureau determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.604" offset="1104373">All right, they enact that.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.694" offset="1108657">But 3621(a) would not allow anyone to be released early, so they enacted subsection (c), which is entitled, substance abuse treatment, so section (e), Your Honors, had to be amended to give permission to the Bureau of Prisons that if people took the substance abuse treatment there would be some incentive.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.994" offset="1305934">I urge Your Honor that until the enactment of (e), if you had substance abuse treatment, if you had an incentive, the Bureau of Prisons could not turn anyone loose under any circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.193" offset="5402665">First of all, subsection (e) on substance abuse had never been the law of the land until Congress identified that this was a serious problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.620" offset="5436415">So they've got to enact substance abuse treatment, which they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.048" offset="5450103">They require the Bureau of Prisons to treat 100 percent, or make available 100 percent all prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.165" offset="5482600">Then they recognize, this is a tough program, let's give an incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.640" offset="5500467">At first it was to all prisoners, then it was... the Senate created two categories, violent and nonviolent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.595" offset="5532337">Then it came down to substance abuse treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.298" offset="5547070">They added the incentive that said... and they couldn't give them any time off up until the passage of part B, period of custody, and they created two categories, violent, nonviolent, and they said to the Bureau of Prisons, as we have given you the discretion over the years on good-time decisions, we give you that discretion as well in determining who successfully completes a treatment program, but we don't want to go the next step and make it a right of release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.271" offset="5679041">We want the discretion for successfully completing the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.440" offset="5695654">So the common sense reading appears to be, you don't have to, you can take into other considerations, but nothing in that step-by-step process said, Bureau of Prisons, you may create additional categories that categorically exclude prisoners based on preconditions.</text>
