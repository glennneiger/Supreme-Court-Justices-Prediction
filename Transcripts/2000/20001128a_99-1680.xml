            <text syncTime="3330.651" offset="13474699">I think you can look at the Court's decision in Freedman as essentially saying that the... saying that either a judge has to grant a stay in each one of these cases regardless of the merits, or there has to be a prompt judicial determination within a very short period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.379" offset="13585563">That's correct, but I do think the difference is that in the initial... whether, in... under a procedural due process analysis there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.642" offset="13614611">For the First Amendment the question is, is that speech occurring during that period of time, and how long a period of time can that be allowed to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.009" offset="13644182">The decisions that the city makes in a scheme like this are decisions about things like whether there were minors in the store, what was the age of the people, were they there, were they not there, were the booths covered or were they not covered so that you could be able to tell what was going on inside them, was there sexual activity that some of the patrons were engaging in or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.182" offset="13732789">Those are very, very different from the kinds of decisions that were made in the Freedman context, and since those decisions are the kinds of things that municipalities make in generally in enforcing police power type ordinances, there's no reason for them not to be given, in fact, when they make them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.506" offset="13818157">If I'm operating a radio station and the city takes my license away because I've let the fence around my tower get into slight disrepair, and my defense is that the provision of the ordinance that says you can lose your license for having your fence in disrepair slightly is unconstitutional, I can't even raise that defense until I get to court, and if I don't get prompt judicial review or a stay of the status quo and be allowed to operate until my judicial decision, I will in all likelihood be out of business and I won't have any effective judicial review on that constitutional defense, and the administrative process can't touch that constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.184" offset="13980848">This Court's decisions are clear that delay in a licensing process can lead to content based censorship just as easy as lack of standards, even in a situation where licensing decisions are not expressly based on the content of the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.317" offset="14061410">Lakewood I think also warns us that an ongoing business is a more likely target of content based discrimination in the licensing process at the administrative level.</text>

            <text syncTime="3490.935" offset="14115849">Then I don't understand why the proper answer isn't, because there is this danger, the court will look at it case by case and if, indeed, this is a situation where the administrator is abusing authority to disguise what is really content based regulation, the court can say in that situation, we put a freeze on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.823" offset="14223369">We allow you to keep your license pending the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.595" offset="14238520">But if there's no basis for that, so that it is just a time, place, and manner type restraint, why should you be able to maintain the status quo, which is, allowed to go on with the business, in face of very serious charges of violations that have nothing to do with the content of the books and tapes that are sold?</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.562" offset="14386373">Nonrenewal is required for one single, trivial violation of a provision of the ordinance that may well be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.116" offset="14416570">We can't test the constitutionality of that provision on the face of the ordinance until we get to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.771" offset="14435170">There are really large numbers of people out there, highly motivated, with influence in municipal affairs, who are waiting for this Court to give them an opening for the covert censorship of sexually explicit speech through delay of licensure, or through any other method that allows room for indirect action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.866" offset="14531509">Not only my client, as an adult book store, but other people who are engaging in unpopular speech and mainstream media ask this Court not to create that opening for covert censorship by delay of the judicial review until that delay becomes fatal to many businesses who won't have meaningful judicial review because they'll just die on the vine while they're waiting for a judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.152" offset="14640701">A temporary injunction that they have to take the burden of getting in circuit court is not going to be an answer. First of all, it's the kind of cumbersome and time consuming and expensive measure that, as Justice Harlan, concurring in Shuttlesworth, said, you shouldn't have to engage in to pursue your free speech rights, and second, it's a flawed process because you have to wait for the administrative record to prove you've got a chance of prevailing.</text>
