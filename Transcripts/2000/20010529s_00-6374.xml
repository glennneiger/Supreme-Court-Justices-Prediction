            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="6.153" offset="117151">The first case is Becker against Montgomery, the No. 00-6374.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.032" offset="148707">In the Federal Court system an appeal from a District Court, the Trial Court to a Court of Appeals starts with the filing of a notice of appeal in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.224" offset="197399">If such a notice is timely filed, but is not signed, maybe appeal thereafter be perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.676" offset="227283">That is the question this case presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.096" offset="236896">We hold that for want of a signature on a timely notice the Appeal is not lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.011" offset="264586">Petitioner Dale G. Becker an Ohio prisoner instituted a pro se Civil Rights Action in the Federal District Court contesting conditions of his confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.805" offset="315786">Becker’s complaint was dismissed for failure to state of claim on which relief could be prohibited and Becker sought to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.843" offset="347865">Using a government printed form, Becker timely filed a notice of appeal that contained all of the requested information.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.782" offset="383705">On the line tagged counsel for appellant Becker, who had no counsel typed but did not hand signed his own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.905" offset="420172">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit docketed Becker’s appeal and set a briefing scheduled.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.609" offset="447025">Becker filed his brief more than two weeks in advance of the deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.517" offset="466565">He hand signed both the cover and the last page.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.363" offset="482029">Some six months later on its own motion the Court of Appeals dismissed Becker’s appeal for want of a handwritten signature on his appeal notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.826" offset="527900">Becker asked for reconsideration, and attached to his request a new signed notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.783" offset="559665">The Court of Appeals denied the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.248" offset="573563">In that court’s view, the absence of the signature on the original notice was jurisdictional, and therefore, incurable outside the time allowed to file the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.234" offset="625494">We granted review and now reverse the Sixth Circuit’s judgment dismissing Becker’s appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.118" offset="649004">The governing federal rules direct that the notice of appeal like other papers filed in District Court shall be signed by counsel or if a party is unrepresented, by the party himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.260" offset="705533">But the very same rule that requires appeal notices to be signed, instructs that any signature omission maybe corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.683" offset="763316">Becker provided just what the rule directs.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.546" offset="786722">His original appeal notice was timely filed and adequate in other respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.642" offset="811068">By promptly correcting the signature omission, Becker secured his right to a decision on the merits of his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.688" offset="843251">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
