            <text syncTime="2853.297" offset="11556329">I would also say that under the property prong of mail fraud individual prosecutors have discretion on what level of case they are going to bring, and the competing obligations and case loads of Federal prosecutors tend to send those cases to the wayside, but there are small cases brought even where the State is defrauded of a relatively small amount of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.497" offset="11649116">And one of the reasons why that is is because frauds against the State often involve State actors in collusion with the private parties, and the Federal Government there serves a very valuable role in coming in and being able to prosecute when the States themselves seem to be less able to do so, and this case itself had a corruption component in it involving charges against State Senators, which the jury ended up rejecting, but there was a reason why the Federal Government was involved in this case in the beginning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.165" offset="11951823">The key distinction is that there this Court was able to find prior law that recognized confidential business information as property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2972.970" offset="12035101">There was substantial prior law indicating that confidential business information was protected as property under the civil law, so the Court was not required to announce a new theory of property in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.629" offset="12109707">The right to exclude is mentioned over and over again in property cases as one of the bundles of rights that's a property right, and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3016.931" offset="12210853">Well, this Court has pointed out that there's no precise or universal definition of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3026.552" offset="12249410">But isn't it true that the right to exclude is referred to in many, many property cases as a strand of property right?</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.649" offset="12277726">--Yes, but I don't think that from that one could conclude that every right to exclude is a property right, because here you have the breadth of it, that the licensing and approvals and permits and certifications and registrations that the Government issues is truly extraordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.732" offset="12350138">It's never been thought that those are property rights that the Government is exercising, and property law has been formed... is based a lot on history and tradition, and not merely on characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.811" offset="12406458">There's no one characteristic, such as the right to exclude, that can be focused on and is the be all and end all of whether there's a property right.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="3075.138" offset="12443761">Well, because in this case or in any regulatory case, as distinct from the case of private ownership or private property, there are two capacities, I suppose, on the part of the supposed property owner, and one is a regulatory capacity and one is arguably a proprietary one, and I suppose... I mean, wouldn't it be your argument that the right to exclude would have to be classified on the regulatory side rather than the property side?</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.995" offset="12559118">So in other words, the right to exclude is here, but the reason it isn't property in the case of the Government is that the Government holds it in a different capacity as regulator, which is a capacity that the private property owner doesn't have.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.460" offset="12608959">I think that's exactly right, and that's why the Government prohibits all types of things, excludes people from all types of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.140" offset="12639679">The mere fact that the Government is excluding something does not mean it's exercising a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.917" offset="12662876">One has to look at the nature of the decision and see whether the Government is acting in a regulatory or proprietary capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.893" offset="12690775">As we cite in our briefs, the courts have always viewed licensing decisions and revocation decisions as regulatory rather than proprietary.</text>
