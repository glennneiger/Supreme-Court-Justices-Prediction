            <text syncTime="579.952" offset="2467990">Your Honor, the origins of that case, I think, have been a little obscure with time, but here is the background there.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.195" offset="2496934">That case dealt with what were then called the five civilized tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.584" offset="2518459">There were a number of Attorney General opinions and judicial opinions that said that those tribes had the power to exclude non Indian intruders from their lands and therefore had the power to impose a licensing fee upon them if they decided to do business within those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.792" offset="2607379">At the turn of the century, the last century I'm talking about that ended in the late 1800s... as Congress began to open up those lands, it gave the settlers the right to remain on their lands and essentially not be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.563" offset="2670387">But at the same time there was a specific statutory and presidential and treaty framework that dealt with the problem of the licensing fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.684" offset="2706854">There was an Act called the Curtis Act which said that any ordnance, including this ordnance that was adopted by the tribe, would have to be approved by the President, wasn't valid until it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.052" offset="2764323">And then there was a treaty that followed when they opened up the land and said there wouldn't be removal that eliminated certain licensing fees and did not eliminate others.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.798" offset="2819389">In Morris v. Hitchcock, this Court looked at that situation, and what it said is that we can see from the surrounding laws and treaties an intent to preserve that original power to charge the license fee for these tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.689" offset="2882919">And it said that quite clearly in Morris v. Hitchcock, and that theme is then picked up in Buster, which is, yes, originally there was some inherent power here coming from the ownership dominion over the land to charge a license fee as a condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.120" offset="2948643">And we can see that in this case, Congress by what it did, the President by what he did, and the treaties by what they did, intended to carry that forward and, therefore, the license fee is still valid even as to settlers who can't be removed.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.755" offset="3095138">The central question is still the same... whether the tribe is governing itself or not... and the exceptions have to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.034" offset="3128261">Thus in Strate, this Court said that the Montana rule would apply broadly to forms of civil jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.092" offset="3156578">And in Montana itself, this Court referred to taxation as one form of regulation that might be permissible where a consensual relationship was sought... shown.</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.800" offset="13811402">This Court has repeated that if Congress is going to... if there's going to be an expansion of the inherent powers of the tribes, it must be done by an expressed congressional delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.977" offset="13860094">And if we apply that standard to this whole problem with the Indian trader statute, it becomes relatively easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.324" offset="13889456">To the extent that the traders are trading directly with Indians, then perhaps there would be some form of consensual relationship where the tribe would have some degree of power, and these statutes and regulations may deal with it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles G. Cole</label>
            <text syncTime="3452.293" offset="13957374">--Well, right, but the United States is arguing that these statutes in this regulatory scheme gives the tribes additional powers over nonmembers on fee lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.893" offset="14003768">And in order to have that, there has to be an expressed congressional delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.177" offset="14024875">We don't have that here... mostly we've had a discussion of regulations, and I won't go into the clarity of those regulations but, at best, they are regulations... they are not statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.042" offset="14064372">And the statutes themselves don't purport to give the tribes additional powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.948" offset="14087987">They may give the Secretary some powers, but they are not an express delegation of additional powers for the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.674" offset="14114841">So on that basis alone, there is no basis for saying that the tribe has some sort of privilege here it can grant or deny, a power given to it by the Federal Government that it can use to extract this tax on transactions between non Indians on fee land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.333" offset="14189446">The other point I wanted to make was that when we look at the second exception and whether there should be some form of power that comes from the incidental impacts of these tourists on the reservation, if we look back at Strate, there this Court considered what was the standard, and it was in effect on tribal self government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.936" offset="14287876">This Court looked at the possibility that accidents on the reservation might create some health risks and certainly would call on some tribal services, but that wasn't enough to find that there would be tribal jurisdiction in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.624" offset="14350674">Here we have these guests that travel on the highway and end up in the hotel and, in effect, there is less of a showing of an effect on the tribe, and there is no showing of an effect on tribal self government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.422" offset="14401874">This is a difficult area when we look at the possibility of a tax being imposed by one government in which a group of citizens can't participate, and we have a well established set of rules that deals with that in Montana and the cases that have followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.717" offset="14471046">This case should be decided under that framework.</text>
