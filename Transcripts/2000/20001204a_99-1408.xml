            <text syncTime="2873.357" offset="11585629">The reason why that premise is incorrect Justice Stevens is this Court's teachings in Gerstein v. Pew and reaffirmed in County of Riverside v. MacLaughlin, once you have probable cause this Court's teachings have been not only can you engage in a full custodial arrest, but likewise you're entitled for a temporary detention for the purpose of administrating the paperwork so that this individual can be booked and then released once a probable cause determination has been made by a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.376" offset="11713734">This Court has rejected the notion that there must be some second reason based on some mini trial based on the facts presented as to whether or not that decision of that tree to bring into custody is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.752" offset="11767232">All three options to a police officer are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.663" offset="11786876">The first is to issue a warning, whether it be in writing or oral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.283" offset="11801401">Second, to actually arrest and bring into custody, or third to issue a citation instead of actually engaging in a full custodial arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.308" offset="11841420">This Court has taught us that all three options are equally reasonable under the floor, the minimum guidelines and protections that the Fourth Amendment and the federal constitution give, and then it becomes a matter of policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2966.053" offset="11956463">As you will note some of the amici here have said that it's appropriate under state law to engage in a full custodial arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.510" offset="11986243">Indeed, if arguing whether or not the state governmental interest is one that should be given credence by this Court, the state of Texas has spoken in the statute, even though the statute in question, the seat belt offense law does not provide for punishment in the form of jail time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.464" offset="12058027">They have likewise determined that it is appropriate to have a full custodial arrest in order to enforce the government's interest in that particular law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.793" offset="12135350">The traffic rules of the road is a certain codification of state law that includes seat belt offenses and there is a statute in Texas on the books that says for any offense in this traffic code, full custodial arrest is appropriate, save two exceptions, one is for speeding, and two is for the open container law which were the results of political judgments made in the local jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.170" offset="12244855">Other states have decided that in certain circumstances they will allow the issuances of citation rather than a full custodial arrest based on the circumstances presented to that officer, and he has that discretion to make that judgment call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.816" offset="12299503">But if he picks wrong in the view of the folks that have to review it later, in other words, we don't think he made the best decision among all of his options, so long as those options are equally reasonable under the Federal Constitution, then that mistake does not drive a constitutional decision of reasonableness because you can't put that in front of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.722" offset="12395112">And so, whereas here, the commission of an offense witnessed personally by the police officer gives rise to probable cause then the constitutional inquiry ends and the policy judgments and decisions will begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.788" offset="12467418">And that's why it would be unworkable as this Court in several questions has asked whether or not we can draw lines between fine only and jailable time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.311" offset="12505453">In fact, in Welsh v. Wisconsin, one of those offenses in that case was for DWI, but under that jurisdiction's law it was only for jail... for a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.250" offset="12553205">Similarly, in United States v. Watson, when dealing with the Prohibition cases, that particular, actually... Carroll v. United States, that particular case dealt with bootlegging, and that was a misdemeanor fine only offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.141" offset="12612764">You cannot determine the constitutional question based on the penalty that is associated with a crime, but rather based on whether or not there is an offense for the specific facts that have occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.774" offset="13767272">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.771" offset="13779288">What is interesting about this case as some members of this Court have pointed out, is respondents do not defend the reasonableness of the conduct of the officer in question here, instead they attack the workability of potential rules and raise... and allege that this is not a recurring problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.488" offset="13870194">Two points... well, a third point also they characterize decisions of this Court far beyond their holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.660" offset="13906870">The first point, the reoccurrence problem, since certiorari has been taken by this case and I know this is anecdotal, we have received call after call of problems of this sort and to limit it to publically reported incidents, just within the past month, before this argument, a DPS officer arrested a passenger in a vehicle, the passenger was a 17-year-old boy with his mother, and that boy then... the officer asked the boy, do you have ID?</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.880" offset="14043752">Well that boy lived in a small town that did not have driver's ed. He had no driver's license, so that was then used as a justification for arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.900" offset="14079801">The arrest presumably would be one that would not be treated as a brief one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.538" offset="14102370">He spent the night in jail in a holding cell with crack dealers and people accused of violent crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.074" offset="14132568">I submit that it is a recurring problem and perhaps more on point, if the conduct in this case is condoned, it will be much more likely to be a recurring problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.338" offset="14185544">Secondly, boundaries, Judge Weiner's boundary as some members of the Court have suggested is just as workable as the Terry boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.079" offset="14232565">It's not going to require a new volume of any treatise... for one thing it's already a couple pages in Blackstone, which has been around for some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.037" offset="14276346">It's just going to be a footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.396" offset="14285854">But under either standard, no matter what the standard is, if it's reliance on the probable cause, or, excuse me, reliance on the common law rule or a balancing of the competing interests or any of the rules proposed by petitioners amici, petitioners win.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.548" offset="14362445">This was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.268" offset="14369342">And that leads to the fact that again they have offered no explanation for why this arrest furthered any legitimate law enforcement interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.669" offset="14410929">Finally, probable cause as the touchstone, I have not, I admit I have not read every Fourth Amendment decision that this Court has written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.638" offset="14450739">However, I have never come across a decision saying that probable cause and not reasonableness is the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.679" offset="14490968">And no decisions have held that anything other than a public felony arrest... thank you.</text>
