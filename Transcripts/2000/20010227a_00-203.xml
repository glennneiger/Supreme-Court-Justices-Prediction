            <text syncTime="55.385" offset="367842">The question presented in this case is whether back pay for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, known as FICA, and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, known as FUTA, whether back pay under those statutes is taxed in the amounts applicable to the year in which it was paid, or the year in which it should have been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.881" offset="453837">In our view, the plain language of the statute provides a clear answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.285" offset="475362">All five of the statutory provisions that are directly applicable to this case base the tax on, quote, the wages paid during the calendar year, not the wages that should have been paid, or would have been paid, or could have been paid if events had been other than they were.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.228" offset="543176">You know, I have just one big problem with your case, and that is the case from this Court dealing not with the taxability, but with the calculation of benefits under statutes using the very same language, where we look back at the year when it should have been paid in calculating benefits, and your opponent is going to say, and has said in the brief, that it will cause lots of disruption if we were to adopt your view in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.103" offset="694686">Can you have these statutes using the very same language and have a different interpretation for calculating benefits than you do for taxing--</text>

            <text syncTime="154.899" offset="765844">The statutes that are at issue here were not at issue in Nierotko.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.789" offset="813387">--Right, that's true, but they... it's slightly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.491" offset="820283">They say calendar quarters in which it was paid, so it is slightly different, even the provision that might have been applicable there, but beyond that, the Court in Nierotko based its decision on the purposes of the Social Security Act in providing security for people as they reach older age and as they retire.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.651" offset="884858">The Court referred to that, and I think construed the particular statutes it had there in terms of the statutory scheme in which it was found, which was a security scheme of that sort.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="207.383" offset="975764">--the way Nierotko suggests and not be disturbed by the fact that it's a different view here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="213.853" stopTime="296.657">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="213.853" offset="1001677">I actually think that there's no problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.722" offset="1009201">In the first place I'd point out that that's the way it's been... the Internal Revenue Service since the time of Nierotko has taken the position that the wages-paid rule is a statutory test for taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.228" offset="1051206">On the other hand, the Social Security Administration has taken the view that at least for statutory back pay, which wouldn't apply to this case, but at least for statutory back pay they will allocate it back, and that's been going on for 60 years, and it hasn't caused an enormous problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.337" offset="1107630">In fact, it's caused no problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.539" offset="1116407">As far as the specific... I mean, I could go through some of the specific examples of problems that respondents say would be caused in the statute by their view.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.462" offset="1156113">For example, there is a... an exclusion from wages for money that's paid to somebody more than six... on disability, for disability more than 6 months after the person... the employee stopped working for the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.572" offset="1212538">Well, I don't see any problem that is created by applying the wages paid for taxes to that payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.476" offset="1240228">In fact, the problem would be created quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.428" offset="1252035">Under the wages-paid rule, you look, you count 6 months after the employee stopped working, which is what Congress wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.433" offset="1280038">Payments made after that date are not taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.718" offset="1289129">Payments made before that date are taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.001" offset="1298324">Under respondent's view, you'd have to take all the payments that were made after that date and try to figure out whether they should have been paid, should they have been paid earlier or should they have been paid later.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="296.657" stopTime="311.101">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="296.657" offset="1332910">Don't those records have to be kept for social security allocation purposes, so the employer... to determine quarters of coverage, would have to supply those records to the Social Security Administration.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="311.101" stopTime="391.869">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="311.101" offset="1390693">Well, not quite.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.036" offset="1398425">The Social Security... the issue arises, I would say, with less intensity and frequency in Social Security for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.373" offset="1427787">One is that as a Social Security... under the Social Security scheme, they essentially permit you either... your choice, option of either going back or using the wages-paid rule, and therefore a lot of cases, since you have a choice a lot of cases don't even arise, because they just use the wages-paid rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.834" offset="1497586">Secondly, under the Social Security scheme, because of the way that scheme works, it's a lot less significant, the allocation decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.424" offset="1535934">Under Social Security, all you need is 40 quarters of coverage in order to be a fully-insured individual, and most people already have that, and it doesn't really matter whether it's in the quarter that it would be paid or the quarter, or some other quarter it's allocated to.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.665" offset="1588910">In addition, under the Social Security scheme, your benefits are based essentially on your average annual earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.937" offset="1622033">That's the way they're currently calculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.653" offset="1628930">It's just an average annual earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.372" offset="1635722">It doesn't really matter where you allocate the wages, it won't make much difference for most people's Social Security, because you're taking an average anyhow over some many-year period of time, usually.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.947" offset="1682011">Now, I'm not saying it will never make a difference, but the issue arises much less sharply and with much less frequency in the Social Security context, but in any event--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="391.869" stopTime="418.436">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="391.869" offset="1713775">But my question really is, are you taking a position that the provisions, the FICA and FUTA, however you pronounce it, that those provisions dictate the position that the Government is taking, or are you saying, yeah, they could have gone for symmetry with Nierotko, but this statute could go either way, and our consistent interpretation, the service's consistent interpretation has been when it's paid is when it's income?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="418.436" stopTime="450.473">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="418.436" offset="1820042">--No, I think the wages-paid language in FICA and FUTI... FUTA is entirely unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.988" offset="1842193">It says, wages paid during the particular year, and I think that that ends the question as far as FICA and FUTA goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.161" offset="1866957">The Court in Nierotko adopted a different construction of somewhat different language in the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.482" offset="1892244">I think the fairest reading of Nierotko is probably that the Court felt that this was not... didn't tie it to any particular... the allocation question... didbn't tie to any particular language, but just decided that an exception of this sort was necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Social Security Act.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="450.473" offset="1948146">Do you think Nierotko was wrongly decided?</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="455.693" stopTime="554.123">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="455.693" offset="1969044">No, we don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.493" offset="1972283">It was a statutory decision, and I don't think that there's any basis to overrule it.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.697" offset="1989106">I think that they... the Court didn't give any explanation of how it arrived at the conclusion that you have to allocate back based on any particular language of the statute, and that's one reason why I think the best reading of Nierotko is that the Court was just adopting a kind of extrastatutory exception, and saying, given the purposes of the Social Security Act and providing security for people so that they'll know they'll get the funds and won't descend into poverty as they get older, given those purposes, this is really the only way to do it for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.217" offset="2107180">The Court did not look at the specific language of the statutes here, or the specific changes that those statutes had gone through to arrive at that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.405" offset="2143855">Originally in 1935, in the 1935 Act, the FICA, what became FICA and FUTA... it was actually all part of the Social Security Act... those taxes were based on wages paid for employment during a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.815" offset="2197563">That meant, and everybody agreed at that time, you had to look at when the employment occurred, not when the wages were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.885" offset="2221805">That scheme was in effect for a few years and the 1939 Congress saw that it caused confusion and difficulties and said, we have to change this, because we don't want to have to... it's easy to figure out when somebody was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.694" offset="2269034">Indeed, in this case they stipulated that they were paid in March of 1994 and usually that's a question that doesn't cause any problem, so we're going to base the taxes in 1939 on the wages paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.065" offset="2314487">Now, in 1946, Congress extended that to the wage-base provision, so by 1946 everything was in line to avoid the kind of confusions and uncertainty that were caused by having to look and see when the employment was performed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="554.123" offset="2362762">But none of the statutory changes address this point specifically.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.046" offset="2394422">I think changing... because I think changes to wages paid was an unambiguous change that required that the tax be based on whether--</text>

            <text syncTime="586.780" offset="2493374">If we take the position that the statute simply does not address the problem that we've got here... it addressed the problem of accrual versus cash methods when you're doing your taxing in the normal course, but it doesn't address the, in effect the back-wage problem, if we take that position, why isn't it sensible for us to say the normal, bedrock philosophy of remedial orders is to put the wronged party in the position that the wronged party would have been in if, in fact, the defendant has acted as the defendant should have, and if we take that position, then we're going to, in effect, find the wages payable for these various tax purposes when they should have been paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.118" offset="4482755">There's the example of a case where payments that are made to the estate of someone who's deceased in the year after they died, are not taxed under FICA and FUTA, but if the payment is made during the year... in the same year that they died, they are taxed under FICA and FUTA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.150" offset="4582856">Under respondent's scheme, you have to look at all the payments that were made after the year that the person died and try to see, well, was there some reason why they really should have been made earlier, were they late, were they delayed, did the employer not make the payment on time, was there a dispute, whatever, and you have to sort all that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.461" offset="4656104">I think under the logic of respondent's position, which is, you're trying to put people, the Federal Government in the FICA and FUTA system is trying to put people in the same position they would have been if the taxes had been paid when they should have been, you have exactly the reverse problem, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.954" offset="4714095">All the payments that were made during the year that the person died, you have to look, well, were those advance payments, should they really have been made in the next year, why shouldn't they be made in the next year, then they're not taxable, and I don't really see any way to distinguish between any of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.946" offset="4766027">I think Congress enacted a precisely drawn statute here with carefully drawn provisions that drew sharp lines and were easy to administer, and the wages-paid rule is the classic example of that, because it's... there's very few disputes about when wages are actually paid, and if it's applied in accordance with its terms, then the result is that you were able to do it, and I don't think any--</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.975" offset="5250128">At the very most, they referred to section 209(g) of the 1939 Act, which had slightly different language from the tax provisions that are in issue here, although I wouldn't make a big deal out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.115" offset="5294745">It talked about quarters in which wages were paid, rather than wages paid during a year, but it had slightly different language, and I think the Court's whole approach in Nierotko was driven by its impression of the purposes, the need for security in an old age security system, which is what the Social Security system was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.977" offset="5366216">It would be anomalous to take that approach, that was driven by the purposes of that system and was, insofar as the Court was looking at language at all was driven by language of different provisions that are in a context that's talking about benefits determinations and who's a fully-qualified individual, and apply it to the statutes that are at issue here, which talk about rates of taxation, and are quite clear in speaking in terms of wages paid during a particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.263" offset="5479274">I'd just... finally I'd add that the Treasury Department by regulation has for a very long time, since the time of Nierotko, and in fact even before that, looking at some of the wages, the rate provisions of the 19... when they were changed in 1939 has had a wages-paid rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.410" offset="5559940">It's firmly adhered to that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.377" offset="5567777">The Treasury regulations give examples of, right in the regulations of cases where some one is paid one year for services in the prior year, and they say no, you go, you look at when the wages were paid, and that answers all questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.602" offset="5620649">It doesn't say, you then look and see well, when should they really have been paid, or why were they paid late, or should they have been paid later than they were, or any of those questions that could arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.208" offset="5659101">The IRS, the Treasury regulations also speak specifically in terms of wages actually paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.250" offset="5703300">I don't think that could be clearer, although I think actually the language of the statute is equally clear and consistent with that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="1579.440" offset="6463986">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.260" offset="6483317">I'd like to essentially focus on three basic points, what the Court held in Nierotko, the importance of the 1946 amendments to the Social Security Act on both the benefits and the tax side, and then finally try to discuss and balance the relative positions with respect to the administrative convenience or inconvenience of the various positions taken here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.305" offset="6563460">With respect to Nierotko, I think I understand the United States to have finally conceded that the pivotal language in the Nierotko decision is the wages-paid language, and that there is no meaningful distinction between the wages-paid language that was the basis for the interpretation in that case and the wages-paid language that we have inherited now that is the subject of the provisions that are at issue in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.968" offset="6650187">But to the extent that there is any question on that, I would ask the Court to recognize first of all it's clear that the Court was interpreting the 1939 amendments, which contains that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.407" offset="6687908">The first paragraph of the opinion refers to quarters of coverage, which was a concept that did not exist prior to 1939, so it clearly had '39 in mind at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.196" offset="6727091">And then if you look at the penultimate and the ultimate paragraph of the Supreme Court... of this Court's opinions, it also discusses quite specifically that... the provision that's at stake here and it says, you know, the petitioner argues, to put it into context, the amendments of 1939 use quarters as the basis for eligibility as well as the measure of benefits, and require wages to be paid in certain quarters, and this Court then, in rejecting essentially that argument said, we have no doubt that it, referring to back pay, should be allocated to the periods when the regular wages were not paid as usual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.055" offset="6870451">I think there's no other way to interpret Nierotko except for saying that language of wages paid in the benefits context, certainly, means that you allocate it back to when those wages should have been paid under the... under that particular scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.796" offset="6921442">It's a special rule for back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.429" offset="6928025">Obviously, it doesn't deal with the general accrual problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.398" offset="6939833">It doesn't resurrect any of the accrual problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.783" offset="6949446">It doesn't ask you to try to make those kinds of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.402" offset="6959895">It asks you to say, when would they have been paid if the employer--</text>

            <text syncTime="2658.750" offset="10781295">Because of the 1946 amendments, and for exactly the reason you identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.019" offset="10798327">Nierotko is a famous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.421" offset="10803970">Congress, seven months after the 1946 famous Nierotko decision--</text>

            <text syncTime="2669.724" offset="10825181">--comes back to this same tax-benefits position, uses exactly that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.511" offset="10848273">What could Congress have meant?</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.744" offset="10853289">It clearly didn't mean to overrule Nierotko on the benefits side, and it says it wants the tax side to conform to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.598" offset="10876695">So in 1946, Congress told us the right answer, and hopefully, 55 years, this Court will tell the IRS that's the right answer, get in line with the Social Security Administration, and affirm the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.640" offset="10924864">If they need a change, let them take it to Congress.</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="2709.465" offset="10984110">--It is for me now, moderately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.451" offset="10996126">I think one of the points actually I wanted to make is that, to look carefully at what happened in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.521" offset="11020368">This Court decided Nierotko.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.021" offset="11026324">There's not a trace of any indication in the legislative history of the 1946 amendments that Congress had any idea that Nierotko had been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.393" offset="11063836">They certainly did not say, we are trying to conform anything to Nierotko, so that's the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.281" offset="11083375">The second point is, what they did do there is, they also did not change the specific provision that was at issue in Nierotko, which was a benefits provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.219" offset="11115140">It was a definition of who is a fully qualified individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.421" offset="11127993">They didn't change that at all, and so they didn't discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.040" offset="11138442">What they did change was the tax provision for the wage base, and that provision they changed to move it to the wages-paid rule, which they had started to bring in in 1939, and they had said why they did that, to avoid the confusion and difficulties that the other rule had caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.900" offset="11201867">Finally, then, they changed the wage base in the Social Security Act, which was not at issue in Nierotko, because that had nothing to do with wage bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.906" offset="11233945">It had to do with who was a fully qualified... they changed that, and they said, well, we're doing this just to conform with what we've done with the tax provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.243" offset="11259232">I think if you put it all together, what the clear intent was, was to keep the taxes easily collectible, and to pursue the ease of administration that they had started in 1939, and then just to bring the Social Security wage base definition in line with that, but I don't think saying that meant in any way, or there's no reason to think that Congress thought that what... if they were aware at all of Nierotko, that it had anything to do with taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.341" offset="11355676">As far as the Social Security... just two other very brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.727" offset="11373230">One is that the Social Security Publication 957 discusses what they... their method is, and they do give an option, because they say you can... you report the back pay on your W-2, and then if you file another filing allocating it back, we'll look at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.004" offset="11434252">If you don't, you can just leave it allocated on the W-2 for the year it was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.540" offset="11448463">And finally, just one other point that I thought was interesting is that the 19... Mr. Phillips referred to the 1943 income tax provision that did allow some attributing back pay to prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.448" offset="11500081">That was limited to where it was 15 percent or more of your wages, but this was a statute which they enacted, and it's called Section 119, Back Pay Attributable to Prior Years, and it starts off, if the amount of back pay received or accrued by an individual, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.608" offset="11556714">So when Congress wanted to address the back pay problem in the income tax context, right around this time, they did it, they did it in express language, they kept that into effect, in effect for a certain number of years, they limited it to where it's more than 15 percent of the income, and then they got rid of it when they found that that was too difficult to work, in, I think, 1961 or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.485" offset="11628185">None of those things happened with respect to, in 1946 with respect to the Nierotko decision, or the FICA and FUTA taxes at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.691" offset="11665070">Thank you.</text>
