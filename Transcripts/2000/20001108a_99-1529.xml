            <text syncTime="53.120" offset="364709">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.467" offset="394070">Washington State's divorce revocation law strikes at the very heart of ERISA's comprehensive regulatory scheme for employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.982" offset="440150">It does so by purporting to revoke ERISA plan beneficiary designations upon divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.144" offset="468781">We submit that the Washington statute is preempted by ERISA on two independent grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.032" offset="500337">First, because it relates to an ERISA plan within the meaning of ERISA's express preemption provision, section 514(a) and second, because it conflicts with ERISA's other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.495" offset="566165">Turning first to section 514, this Court has made clear that a State law relates to an employee benefit plan if it mandates employee benefit structures or their administration or binds plan administrators to particular choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.434" offset="649966">Washington's divorce revocation statute has precisely that forbidden effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.396" offset="677865">As applied by the courts below, the statute invalidates the beneficiary determination and benefit payment scheme provided for by the terms of the ERISA plans here and instead mandates payment according to a different State-imposed scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.425" offset="757904">Moreover, the determination of beneficiary status, and the payment of plan benefits, lie at the very heart of ERISA's concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.224" offset="801163">Indeed, the determination whether particular alleged beneficiaries are entitled to obtain plan benefits is so crucial to the entire Federal scheme created by ERISA that such benefits claims are deemed to arise under Federal law under this Court's decision in Metropolitan Life v. Taylor even if they purport to raise only State law claims.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="187.584" offset="902518">Of course, what you say applies exactly similarly, I take it, to a State statute that would say, if A murders B, A shall be treated as having predeceased B for purposes of inheriting from B, or in a word, A can't inherit from B. All that you've said would apply to that similarly, so what's the difference?</text>

            <text syncTime="211.115" offset="996663">In other words, you're saying that basically this ERISA preempts all of what you call the slayer statutes, I guess, that traditionally have said you can't inherit from a person you murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.695" offset="1054968">However, the slayer rule may very well be incorporated into ERISA, because the slayer rule was extant at the time of ERISA's passage in 1974, was a common law rule, and had been applied in numerous cases, Federal cases with regard to a death benefit statute, so it was a gloss on the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.716" offset="1227063">Is there any reason why Congress would have wanted ERISA to preempt a traditionally State-regulated subject like probate and... you know, at least where it doesn't interfere with some important policy, or... I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.382" offset="1289757">I mean, you see the... that's what I want you to address.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.950" offset="1308043">Yes, the answer, of course it preempts those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.839" offset="1327582">There's no reason to believe that it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.951" offset="1336046">We're talking about employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.725" offset="1347122">There's nothing more central to an employee benefit plan than benefits, how it pays them, to whom it pays them, and ERISA has specific provisions with regard to the exception for State law with... in the context of the payment employee benefit plans in a divorce situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.134" offset="1464777">You say it's been around, it's part of the common law, it's part of the background.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.908" offset="1495811">Well, the difference, Justice Kennedy, is that the slayer... the slayer rule was part of the common law, was part of the common law of trust at the time that ERISA was enacted, and it may be presumed that the Congress, seeing that as a backdrop, incorporated, impliedly incorporated the slayer rule into ERISA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.327" offset="7181519">Applied to this case, and I think it very important that we talk about the facts of this case, the statute rests on the idea that when petitioner sought and received a divorce from David Egelhoff, and after they entered a very detailed divorce decree, to the level of, he got the tan area rug and she got the Exercycle, that he did not walk out of the courthouse thinking, oh, and I want her to get the pension and the life insurance, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.267" offset="7577326">The death benefit is the entirety of the pension benefit, and she could not have an expectation that she would ever get the money, because she knows that he could change it the next day.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.042" offset="13444428">I should make one final point, and that is that there is at the very least one alternative narrow holding that I don't understand the answer to for this Court, and that is that we sued petitioner under a provision of State law that lets us just sue her, and if the problem is the practical administration of this rule, that it will cause a burden for ERISA plans, the rule at the least ought to be that that's not preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3446.692" offset="13938978">The last point that Mr. Goldstein made, which suggests broader preemption than I think the statute entails, ERISA preempts State law only insofar as it relates to an employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.699" offset="14007001">No one is suggesting that the State statute is preempted with regard to other nonprobate assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.979" offset="14036154">Mr. Goldstein also mentioned that they had sued, the respondents here had sued petitioner, not the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.236" offset="14077218">Well, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.984" offset="14080144">That, of course, was true in Boggs as well and, as the Court said in the Boggs decision, there, as here, the premise of the lawsuit is based on a displacement of ERISA provisions and plan provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.264" offset="14145241">A point with regard to the contingent beneficiary notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.715" offset="14171050">If Mr. Goldstein is correct, and respondents are beneficiaries under ERISA because they have a contingent right, then their only cause of action would be under section 502(a) of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.226" offset="14245133">That would be their exclusive right, and they would have had to sue the plan under those provisions rather than the petitioner under the State statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.509" offset="14306260">With regard to the QDRO point, Qualified Domestic Relations Order point, the fact is that a QDRO could have been fashioned that provided that the spouse had given up any interest that she might have as a beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.703" offset="14391001">The fact here is, that wasn't done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.717" offset="14403122">That provision is a relatively easy one to effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.988" offset="14424229">It wasn't done, and that's the reason that respondents must lose.</text>
