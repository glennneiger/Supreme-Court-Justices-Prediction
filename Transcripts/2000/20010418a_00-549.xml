            <text syncTime="133.940" offset="676419">Now, that's what I didn't see because it seemed to me in any real corporation it's not going to be following what the corporation wants to commit a crime, so it's not in the scope of your employment to commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.686" offset="731381">And so under the Second Circuit's rule, unless you're suddenly... unless we're talking about a corporation that wants to go off and commit crimes, the person's never going to be acting in the scope of his employment, so always he's caught within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.294" offset="809853">If there's, you know, several people, certainly.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Edlin</label>
            <text syncTime="174.064" offset="836916">The problem that we have with the Second Circuit's decision is that it is hard to rationalize with the meaning of the statute and with the Court's decision in Reves.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.641" offset="875263">Reves clearly, for example, confers liability on all inside managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.925" offset="896370">Whatever else it does, it certainly confers liability on all inside managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.755" offset="915701">There's no question under Reves that Mr. King would be included within the operation and management test that this Court adopted there.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.217" offset="949556">The Second Circuit's decision immunizes precisely the same group of people, or a single person, that Reves would impose liability upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.991" offset="992605">And the Second Circuit's decision is not limited and does not distinguish between corporations in which there is one principal party or corporations in which there are many parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.508" offset="1038685">I agree with you the scope of management test doesn't really work, but it's because it doesn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.081" offset="1060942">It's not because the Second Circuit has limited it to just this fact item.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.626" offset="1095110">It seems to me that if the scope of management test includes at least, as I assume it must, some reference to the purposes of the corporation, then no corporation, whether it's a regular corporation or a pure formality, can be organized as a matter of law to commit acts of racketeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.173" offset="1181314">So the odd thing to me about the Second Circuit's opinion is the notion that one would be within the scope of employment while engaging in the prohibited activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.020" offset="1236693">And I would have thought that that was a legal impossibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.379" offset="1290192">But even beyond the corporation, certainly RICO reaches both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises and, in the context of the illegitimate enterprise, scope of employment analysis makes no sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.351" offset="1338049">So I just think that when you look at what the Second Circuit is doing, it can't be reconciled with what the words of the statute said.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.496" offset="1382666">The words of the statute are extraordinarily broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.468" offset="1394473">This Court has had many opportunities to look at this section of the statute, and when we look, for example, on page one of the blue brief, at the definitions, person includes any individual or entity, and an enterprise for this purpose includes any corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.301" offset="1465840">And 1962(c) refers to any person employed by an enterprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="999.455" offset="4138480">Section 1962(C) reaches racketeering activity by a defendant who is employed by the RICO enterprise, without regard to the scope of the defendant's employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.486" offset="4178604">That is clear from the text of Section 1962(c) which reaches racketeering activity by any person employed by or associated with any enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.426" offset="4222385">A scope of employment rule defies that plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.936" offset="4236387">In addition, a scope of employment rule is inconsistent with the statutory scheme in three additional respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.085" offset="4260942">First, a scope of employment rule defies Congress's intent to reach criminals who infiltrate and corruptly run legitimate businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.282" offset="4301797">It's important in that respect to address the question of whether a criminal or otherwise wrongful act can be within the scope of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.744" offset="4335652">And the answer to that is yes, it can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.768" offset="4343698">Section 231 of the Restatement of Agency addresses that point, but consider the example of a corporation which instructs its employee to make a sale, knowing that the way that that sale was made traditionally is through bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.628" offset="4403152">In that case, the bribery would be within the scope of employment, notwithstanding that it would be unlawful and, notwithstanding, there might not have been specifically urged by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.122" offset="4441187">Because of that, when criminals take control of a business, they are able to bring illegal activity within the scope of that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.833" offset="4475982">And under the Second Circuit's scope of employment rule, that would immunize the racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.983" offset="4500537">Second, the scope of employment rule would create additional difficulties in applying Section 1962(c), because the test itself is contextual and subject to the case specific application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.614" offset="4551110">This Court discussed that in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.586" offset="4563022">The difficulties and the permutations of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.210" offset="4581516">Third, a scope of employment limitation is inconsistent with the Court's holding in Reves that a defendant, under Section 1962(c), must participate in the operation or management of the affairs of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.782" offset="4639822">If participation and operation and management is necessary for there to be liability, then carrying out the affairs of the business cannot prevent liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.616" offset="4675139">An employee who controls a corporation would, under that rule, be immune from liability when he misuses his control of the corporation to involve the corporation in racketeering.</text>
