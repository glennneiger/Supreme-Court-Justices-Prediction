            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="6.055">This is my day.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.823">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.430">It involves a dispute between the United States and the State of Idaho over ownership of submerged lands underlying portions of Lake Coeur d'Alene and the St. Joe River.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.549">The disputed lands are within a vast area that was once inhabited by the Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.165">In 1873, in the phase of an influx of immigration into that tribal territory, President Grant set aside an exclusive tribal reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.569">During the 1880s, the Tribe and the United States negotiated over the size of that reservation and over the Tribe’s continuing claim to other aboriginal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.477">Although they reached several agreements, before the agreements were ratified by Congress, the State of Idaho was admitted into the Union in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.669">It was not until eight months later that Congress approved the agreements by which the Tribe ceded aboriginal lands and part of the 1873 reservation in return for compensation and for congressional confirmation of the reservation that remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.886">In 1994, the United States sued Idaho to determine ownership of the portion of the lakebed and the riverbed within the Tribe’s current reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.848">The District Court quieted title in favor of the United States as trustee for the Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.913">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.160">We granted certiorari and in an opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.313">Due to the public importance of the navigable waterways, ownership of the land under such waters is closely identified with the sovereign power of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.479">A court deciding a question of title to the bed of navigable water must therefore begin with a strong presumption in favor of State’s title and with that presumption, we have looked to Congress’ declarations and intent in order to resolve conflicts over submerged lands that it claimed to have been conveyed or reserved by the United States before statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.719">Via submerged lands beneath navigable waters are located in the tract that National Government has reserved for a particular national purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.184">We asked whether Congress intended to include the submerged lands within the federal reservation, and if so, whether Congress intended to defeat the future State’s title.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.384">This two step test of congressional intent can be satisfied in the context of land reserved by the Executive Branch, if the Executive reservation clearly included submerged lands and Congress recognized the reservation in a way that demonstrates an intent to defeat state title.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.258">Here, Idaho has conceded that the Executive Branch intended the 1873 Executive water reservation to include submerged lands and that by 1888 Congress was on notice of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.395">Both of those concessions are sound in light of the District Court findings that we found in detail in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.013">The manner in which Congress proceeded to deal with the Tribe made it plain that Congress’ object was to obtain tribal interests and modify the extent of the reservation only by tribal consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.061">Its object was therefore necessarily to deny Idaho title to any unrelinquished submerged lands within the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.572">Congress, for example, undertook in an 1889 Act to authorize negotiations with the Tribe for the consensual compensated session of such portions of the reservation as the Tribe would consent to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.097">This and other evidence shows that Congress’ intent was clearly that anything not ceded by the Tribe would remain for the Tribe’s benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.458">An object that is flatly at odds with Idaho’s view that Congress meant to transfer submerged lands to the State in what would have amounted to an active bad faith accomplished by the unspoken operation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.090">Idaho’s position is also at odds with later manifestations of congressional understanding that statehood had not affected title to the submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.244">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas join.</text>
