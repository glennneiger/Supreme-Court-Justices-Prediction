            <text syncTime="1235.531" offset="5092921">In 1887, the tribe and the United States negotiated an agreement that would cede all lands outside the 1873 boundaries and as part of that agreement they agreed that the tribe would continue to hold the land within the reservation as Indian land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.393" offset="5160421">Then in 1889 we have the second agreement which was only a cession agreement specifically limited to purchase of lands by the 1889 Act and in the agreement there was no additional rights of conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.867" offset="5214234">There's no language of conveyance in the 1889 agreement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.438" offset="5228549">It's simply a quit claim to the northern portion of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.490" offset="5244745">So whatever rights the tribe holds in the southern third of the lake and the remainder of the reservation are necessarily going to be founded in the language of the 1887 Act which defines the tribe's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.198" offset="5295631">And under Montana, where we simply have a continued right of aboriginal occupation, that type of conveyance to a tribe would not normally carry with it an interest in a lake bed that would be sufficient to defeat State title.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.573" offset="5441081">Justice Breyer, I would say it would not because again that would simply be a beneficial interest and we have numerous examples of where tribes have beneficial interest in submerged lands without a defeat of State title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.214" offset="5495625">For example, they could reserve an exclusive fishing right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.849" offset="5510253">They could reserve a fishing right in common with other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.135" offset="5523314">But I think the point I want to make is that because of this presumption against defeat of State title that we should always assume that Congress would try to accommodate tribal rights and State interest in public ownership of these lands to the extent possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.996" offset="5582769">And here where all we have is a simple right of use, that would probably not be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.900" offset="5606384">Again, I think it's worth pointing out that in neither of these agreements is there a fishing right provided to the tribe expressly, which is very unusual for a northwestern tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.172" offset="5647553">I think that admission by itself is very telling in the legislative history leading up to the 1889 Act and the 1889 agreement, again we see numerous references to this tribe as a farming tribe, not as a fishing tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.631" offset="13025368">The southern part at least I'm reliably informed, and this is matter that's outside of the record, is not as polluted, although it is subject to pollution problems and issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.040" offset="13078971">I would like to just make a couple of points in conclusion and that is the Idaho issue in terms of submerged lands is also implicated by the 1888 railroad statute which Congress passed and that passage which came after the Senate resolution asking about the navigable waters included a right of way that crossed across Lake Coeur d'Alene to a point on the lake itself and requires that the secretary provide compensation to the tribe for that easement and it further provided that no rights for the railroad shall accrue unless and until they obtained the consent of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.669" offset="13257440">So read together and this court's cases makes very clear two overarching propositions, that these Indian statutes should be read as a series and that doubts should be construed in favor of the tribe suggest that Congress did understand that the submerged lands were at stake, that the tribe had control over those submerged lands and that the United States would not take them without the consent of the tribe.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven W. Strack</label>
            <text syncTime="3309.172" offset="13387530">On this question of whether or not there's a difference between beds and navigable waters, I think the court has made that very clear in the Alaska decision where the court looked to purposes that required ownership of the beds themselves; for example, the need to own the bed to preserve the oil deposits.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3332.787" stopTime="3342.227">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3332.787" offset="13481989">We've just heard about wharfs, about harvesting potatoes, about grants for the mill, does that indicate the sort of purposes that we thought were important in Alaska?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_w_strack" startTime="3342.227" stopTime="3449.230">
            <label>Mr. Steven W. Strack</label>
            <text syncTime="3342.227" offset="13519709">Looking back at the 1889 Act I don't think any of those purposes are evident on the face of the 1889 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.685" offset="13557535">If there was a purpose and the only purpose they have identified is fishing, and that itself does not require ownership of the beds of the navigable waters themselves unless they're fishing methods for some reason required ownership of the bed like a fishing weir, but we don't see any evidence that they were doing that in 1889.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.162" offset="13631514">So again I think we need to look at the purposes here and see whether or not those require ownership of navigable waters, ownership of the beds of navigable waters as opposed to the waters themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.970" offset="13678743">I'd like to go back too to the question of practical effect because I think it obviously is a concern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.458" offset="13704656">And I think it's important to note that all of the lands along the shore of the lake are owned by non-Indians and that's been true since 1910 when the reservation was allotted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.664" offset="13749483">Those lands, those people have riparian rights which they look to the State to protect and define.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.170" offset="13775500">Many of those people have encroachments on the lake and that's where our ownership of the beds comes into play because we regulate those encroachments so that they do not go out far enough to impair navigation and other uses of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.144" offset="13823357">So all of these people along the lake, now their riparian rights are called into question because the State no longer owns the beds of the lake according to the decree and so we don't know what the effect of that would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.801" offset="13878005">On the issue of pollution it works both ways, so the tribe has an interest in protecting the lake from pollution and the State has an equal interest, if not more so, because we own the remainder of the lake, and when you split a system like this in two it becomes very hard to regulate that in a consistent manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.830" offset="13942162">For example--</text>

            <text syncTime="3460.388" offset="13992317">Doesn't the Corps get to say what can encroach out in the navigable water?</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.270" offset="14091896">Where there's a fail interest involved, Justice O'Connor they certainly could come in and preempt, but it's my experience that we regulate all those encroachments and I'm not aware of the Corps ever being involved in those kinds of decisions.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3498.946" offset="14146648">If the State perhaps regulates more stringently then the Corps would care to, that's quite possible.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven W. Strack</label>
            <text syncTime="3506.184" offset="14175592">That is quite possible because of the statute that we have in place protecting the lake as a public resource for recreation and other public uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.455" offset="14208611">And so when we have a split system like this, especially on issues such as fisheries, if the tribe was to introduce new species of fish that was not genetically compatible with the fisheries that we have in the remainder of the lake, we could have some real problems there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.282" offset="14263990">So there's tremendous practical effects that result not only from tribal ownership but tribal ownership of a small portion of the greater lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.471" offset="14296696">On the issue of... Mr. Givens mentioned the acreage that included in the report, the acreage that included navigable waters but it's also important to look at the acreage of the cession that was reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.045" offset="14351030">According to the United States' exit report at page 237 the acreage that was ceded in 1889 was 243,000 acres and that included 37,000 acres of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.103" offset="14395229">But the House report 1109 reported that acreage as 185,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.757" offset="14417799">That's found at page 315 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.442" offset="14428562">So obviously Congress did not view this cession as including the lake bed itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.180" offset="14455520">They did not view themselves as having purchased that from the lake.</text>
