            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="147467">We'll hear argument next in Number 99-1792, the Director of Revenue of Missouri v. CoBank ACB.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.799" offset="190621">Mr. Layton.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_r_layton" startTime="48.572" stopTime="225.738">
            <label>Mr. James R. Layton</label>
            <text syncTime="48.572" offset="341714">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="51.795" offset="354566">In 1933, when Congress authorized the organization of banks for cooperatives, it implicitly authorized the States to tax them.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.891" offset="390928">That authority became effective for each bank when it retired the Government shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.695" offset="414229">The National Bank for Cooperatives paid taxes to Missouri until 1995, but according to the Missouri supreme court the bank's tax liability ended in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.241" offset="456339">That court failed to recognize the bank's exemption from taxes is and always has been provided by statute, and that statute, now 12 U.S.C. 2134, exempts from taxation only the bank's notes, debentures, and other obligations, not its income.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.573" offset="525720">In deciding what section 2134 means, the Missouri supreme court erred in three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.897" offset="551007">It transformed a technical and conforming amendment into a significant change in the Farm Credit Act, it made that transformation by adding to the plain language of the statute, and it turned the statute into something that is incongruous to the rest of the Farm Credit Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.327" offset="612760">Before 1985, the statute provided that CoBank and its predecessors would always pay taxes on real and tangible personal property and, at any time when the Government did not own shares, they would pay other taxes to State and local governments and perhaps even to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.320" offset="688724">The question arises here as to what happened in 1985, and the position being taken by CoBank is that in 1985 suddenly they were freed from all taxes, and yet that is not what the statute said in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.567" offset="741700">There was a technical and conforming amendment that appeared in title 2 of the 1984... 5 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.762" offset="766465">Title 2 was the part of the act that was dedicated to making the Farm Credit Administration an arm's length regulator for the farm credit system, something more akin to what we see at the FDIC and other bank regulators in the Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.692" offset="826233">Title 1 of that act also included conforming amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.816" offset="842638">Title 1 dealt with the credit corporation which CoBank cites here as a new vehicle for investment into the farm credit system.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.089" offset="879731">The second point that the Missouri court erred on is transforming the plain language by adding to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.085" offset="907735">The plain language of the statute is simply that this entity is exempt from taxation as to its notes, debentures and other obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.160" offset="940022">Ever since 1933, the entire scope of the exemption given to the banks for cooperatives has been contained in statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.635" offset="973981">The only thing that anyone can point to in the statute today that goes beyond notes, debentures, and obligations is the reference to this entity as a Federal instrumentality, but this Court has at various times suggested or, in fact, held that Federal instrumentality does not have the kind of meaning that CoBank ascribes to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.800" offset="1498625">The Second Bank of the United States was run by presidential appointees.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.671" offset="1514089">The Federal Government owned 20 percent of the shares in that bank, and that bank performed governmental functions, not just functions in which the Government had an interest, but it actually issued currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.469" offset="1557243">It did things that the Government itself must do.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.800" offset="1566647">In that sense, the Second Bank of the United States was a little like the Red Cross that this Court addressed in the Department of Employment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.745" offset="1598412">Again, presidential appointees run the Red Cross, and that entity fulfills treaty obligations that the United States assumed under the Geneva Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.301" offset="1632580">The... CoBank mentions the Rural Telephone Bank in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.815" offset="1650657">Well, the Rural Telephone Bank has a 13-member board of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.747" offset="1666435">Seven of them are appointed by the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.629" offset="1677929">The Governor of the Rural Telephone Bank is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, and there is a direct appropriation from Congress in a... over a 10-year period of... or 20-year period of $600 billion for the Rural Telephone Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.507" offset="1733413">By contrast, here we have an entity that from the beginning has been controlled by a board of directors that is appointed by its voting shareholders, which did not include the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.814" offset="1778657">That is, by the borrowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.086" offset="1783777">It has always been a private entity, quite distinct from the things that we see in McCulloch.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.480" offset="1805302">So what's the distinction from McCulloch?</text>
            <text syncTime="416.341" offset="1812825">McCulloch holds that if you have something that is an instrumentality of the type that is the Second Bank of the United States, then in fact there is, absent any congressional language, immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.444" offset="2353142">Mr. Layton, there's a reason that the other side gives for the exemption of the debt obligations, because, they say, those obligations are held not in the hands of CoBank but in the hands of the lenders, so you need an exemption so that those lenders, who are private and not government instrumentalities, won't be taxed.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.190" offset="2452198">Well, it's curious that they make that claim in a brief where they also cite the Memphis case in section 742 of, I believe it's title 31, which, if this entity is part of the United States, that is, if this bank of cooperatives has the inherent authority that they ascribe to it, then 742 would cover them, and this provision would be superfluous in 2134.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.744" offset="2538403">But it doesn't cover them, because they are not an instrumentality of this sort, and Congress has defined the scope of their authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.702" offset="2578213">In 1928, this Court in the Shaw v. Gibson Zahniser Oil case, just a few years before the 1933 act that created the Bank for Cooperatives, pointed out that there are instrumentalities of the United States that do not have exemptions unless Congress gives them an exemption, and then 5 years later Congress in this instance defines what the exemption is, and what CoBank and what the Missouri supreme court have done is to say, well, that definition by Congress doesn't really matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.702" offset="2698272">The third point that I mentioned was that it turns the statute into something in Congress with the rest of the Farm Credit Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.626" offset="2721887">That is, in each instance in the Farm Credit Act, where Congress has created an entity that is even... that is analogous to this particular one, Congress has said, okay, here is the kind of exemption that you have from State and local taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.736" offset="2782386">It always is a comprehensive statement, and does not leave room for some kind of an argument that there is an additional exemption based on some kind of inherent immunity, and in each instance it permits taxation of real property and in many instances taxation of tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.688" offset="2854171">And one of the differences that occurred in 1985, according to CoBank, is all of a sudden the statute changed from allowing State and local governments to tax tangible personal property to including only a real property exemption which they ascribe back to the dicta in McCulloch.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.759" offset="2922403">In fact, there may be a problem with tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.961" offset="2935255">I'm not sure how much of that CoBank would be likely to foreclose upon, but the same statutory language is used for the production credit associations, and it is easily understood that there would be tractors and other equipment that they would foreclose upon that would justify the need for a provision for taxation on tangible local... tangible personal property.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.416" offset="3209123">If that had been the scope of the... of Congress' action, just eliminating that last sentence, then except for the tangible personal property question CoBank would have today exactly what they wanted, but that sentence says, okay, the exemption that we are giving you in the prior sentence... that is, you don't have one until we give it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.618" offset="3285923">The exemption we are giving you in the prior sentence is going to apply only to a certain point.</text>

            <text syncTime="823.114" offset="3439836">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="834.000" offset="3483408">Our position is that banks for cooperatives under the Farm Credit Act are not exempt from State income taxes for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.236" offset="3520398">We think the Court should confine its decision to an analysis of the text of the Farm Credit Act, and not go beyond it to discuss or address the constitutional issues relating to Federal instrumentalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.955" offset="3571284">Under the text of the act itself there are two reasons why banks for cooperatives are not exempt from State income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.571" offset="3601691">First, as the State counsel noted, at section 2134, the first sentence itself just addresses an exemption for notes, debentures, and obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.728" offset="3646308">That provision contrasts with two other provisions of the Farm Credit Act that specifically give State income tax exemptions for other entities of the farm credit system.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.816" offset="3698657">12 U.S.C. 2023 provides an exemption from State income taxes for farm credit banks and provides expressly that Congress intended for those entities to be exempt from State income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.226" offset="3760306">Moreover, 12 U.S.C. 2098 provides an express exemption from State income taxes for Federal land bank associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.192" offset="3804192">It's clear, therefore, that when Congress enacted this statute, and it amended it over a 50-year period, it knew precisely how to give the kind of exemption from State income taxes being asserted by respondents in this case and chose not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.903" offset="3863020">Secondly, the history behind this provision, as the State counsel made perfectly clear, does not support respondent's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.058" offset="3899696">Between 1933 and 1985, the text itself provided for the exemption from State income taxes only in any part of a year in which the Government owned stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.657" offset="3942014">That ended in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.519" offset="3953508">From a period between 1965 and 1968, the Government retired all of its shares of stock in banks for cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.003" offset="3983392">So as of 1968, and this is reflected in the Farm Credit Administration's annual report, banks for cooperatives were not exempt from Federal and State income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.070" offset="4027696">When Congress made its amendment nearly two decades later, in the 1985 Farm Credit Amendments Act, there was no Government ownership in any banks for cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.646" offset="4066043">These were completely privately owned for profit entities and, as such, would have been subject to State income taxes throughout the entire period.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.473" offset="4105331">Now, the last point that I'd like to make is that the Court should not reach out to opine about instrumentality status generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.169" offset="4140127">This... the Court consistently under the Farm Credit Act has looked at the text of the act to determine the scope of exemptions from taxation, and that's true in all of the cases that have been cited by the parties under the Farm Credit Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.868" offset="4198850">It should not use this case to opine broadly about what instrumentality status means for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.612" offset="4229883">First, Congress uses the term, instrumentality, in a broader range of contexts, and even in this case and in this statute itself, has used it to describe not only the organizations that are being used to facilitate Congress' purpose, but also the financial instruments themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.906" offset="4306997">Section 2023, which is the Farm Credit Bank tax exemption provision, describes the notes themselves as the instrumentalities of the United States, and so by making a decision about what instrumentality status means, the Court could end up having... could create unintended consequences that would affect the taxable status of instrumentalities throughout the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.237" offset="7980336">They said, what we are writing with that third sentence is, not that we... we won't tell you what happens when there's no ownership, but we are telling you affirmatively that you become taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.817" offset="8026729">Now, was it artful language?</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.979" offset="8039372">So I don't think it's fair to say that the exemption... that the taxability previously existed by negative implication.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.904" offset="8087020">Now, both the exemption, I agree, and the negative implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.029" offset="8111575">One thing here that I think the Court needs to focus on, and it's a major point made by the State and by the Solicitor General, is they... citing Rosello and cases like that, they say, well, the farm credit banks have an exemption, and the farm... the Federal land bank associations have an exemption, and you don't have an exemption therefore, and I grant that that's a perfectly valid rule of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.388" offset="8217005">But I think it's fair to say that someone ought to at least offer a reason why it makes sense that Congress would discriminate against... differentiate.</text>

I know I'm repeating about this point, but in 19... prior to the change, the statute said that the bank was exempt as long as the Federal Government owned stock in the bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="2842.746" offset="11518360">Here, and I'd like to simply conclude by where I started.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.808" offset="11534660">If you look at the New Mexico decision which Missouri relies upon at length, and you go to page 736, and I pick this out... this is illustrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.617" offset="11585860">You were talking about whether those particular Federal contractors were exempt from State tax, and you said, the Court's other cases describing the nature of a, quote, Federal instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.245" offset="11636434">That is a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.645" offset="11641971">It's been a term of art since Justice Marshall first coined it in McCulloch v. Maryland, and the one attribute that's always been associated with a Federal instrumentality in this Court's cases is an exemption from State taxation absent a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.388" offset="11708949">I mean, I've looked... I can't claim that I... this is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.080" offset="11727758">The Court has never held that an entity which is a Federal instrumentality is taxable in the absence of an affirmative congressional authorization, whether you're talking about the Department of Employment, you're talking about New Mexico, you're talking about Graves, you're talking about James v. Dravo, never, at least not that we can find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.256" offset="11824411">That term carries with it that attribute, and we submit that Congress, in designating us a federally chartered instrumentality, consistent with what we do... they didn't do it haphazardly... intended precisely the same designation, and we would suggest that that also fits with the overall goals of Congress in passing the 1985 act and rescuing the farm credit system and trying to give the agricultural borrowers some relief from high interest rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.680" offset="11962128">It seems to us it all fits together, and what the State is literally saying is, well, we want to act like the law didn't change, that there was no repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.466" offset="12005283">Well, there was a repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.427" offset="12009149">The law did change, and the question is, did Congress intend that we become taxable without regard to the Federal investment, or did they intend that we become exempt under the McCulloch rule, and those are basically the choices facing the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.228" offset="12068290">If there are no further questions--</text>

            <label>Mr. James R. Layton</label>
            <text syncTime="2987.223" offset="12096293">I'll note first that I believe that the banks for cooperatives were subject to Federal income tax prior to 1985, but I'd also note the franchise tax that counsel referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.504" offset="12173407">In the 1971 act in section 4 it sets out a franchise act that could be as high as 25 percent of net income for the banks, but interestingly, that franchise tax applied so long as the Government holds shares in the bank, and that the Government didn't hold any shares at that point, and there was obviously an incentive, given that franchise tax, not to allow the Government to pick up any shares in your particular bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.459" offset="12265253">I should note also that although the National Bank for Cooperatives was formed in 1989, it was the merger of other banks for cooperatives, and there have been banks for cooperatives operating in Missouri for many, many years prior to 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.367" offset="12312900">Turning to the legislative history, if, indeed, we have to get to the legislative history, the history does talk about the reasons for the 1985 act, and one of the things that's there is a note that the banks for cooperatives themselves were healthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.717" offset="12374236">This was not prompted by a problem with the banks for cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.101" offset="12391790">It was prompted, as Mr. Hanson accurately said, by a system wide problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.525" offset="12409554">That is, there may have been... there were other entities within the bank, the farm credit system that were having enough problem that it was bringing down the ability of the entire system to sell bonds, and yet the argument being made here is that because some other entity had a problem and Congress created a system wide remedy, that is a remedy that would provide Federal financing to the system as a whole, and never to particular institutions, that somehow these banks for cooperatives attained a new exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.542" offset="12529612">Before, they only had an exemption when they had Federal investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.626" offset="12545913">Afterward, according to CoBank, they all have an exemption even if no one has a Federal investment, and the most that's likely is that some production credit association or someone else would have an investment, and yet somehow they get this exemption back.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.878" offset="12614876">Mr. Frederick, what is the effect of Congress' calling an institution a Federal instrumentality?</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.292" offset="12648626">I'd always thought that the primary reason they do that is precisely to exempt it from State income tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.298" offset="12684571">Why would you enact a statute that says, you know, the Red Cross, or whatever it is, is a Federal instrumentality?</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.974" offset="12711320">--I think one reason is to ensure that that entity... in the tax context one reason is to ensure that that entity cannot be subjected to discriminatory taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.408" offset="12745070">Missouri, for example, could not pass a tax that was restricted to the income of federally charter... or, excuse me, of cooperative banks that serve cooperatives, farm cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.907" offset="12795016">Because the only one that exists is this instrumentality, that would be aimed at a Federal instrumentality and would be a discriminatory tax and it would be illegal, because that is a Federal instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.683" offset="12830125">There may be other reasons as well, but certainly that is one impact of use of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.317" offset="12848724">The change that is alleged to have come about in 1985 is not just to remove the connection between the Federal investment and the bank that is asserting the exemption, but also to remove the temporal aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.555" offset="12901596">That is, before, the exemption only was in place while the Federal investment was in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.649" offset="12926047">At the time in 1985 there was 5-year sunset provision on the credit corporation through which the funds that Mr. Hanson spoke of would be channeled, and yet the exemption that he asserts is one that would exist indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.167" offset="12980068">That's inconsistent with the legislative history and with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.761" offset="12998458">CoBank poses the question as to why differentiate between production credit associations and banks for cooperatives on the one hand and other institutions such as land banks on the other, and we shouldn't have to ask that question, because Congress made that determination in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.491" offset="13065331">There has always been a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.434" offset="13073168">We're just discussing today what the distinction now is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.226" offset="13084349">But there are a couple of possible reasons for Congress to have made that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.536" offset="13101589">One is simply temporal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.179" offset="13108172">In 1933 we were in the Depression era, and not only was there a problem with the farm credit, with credit for farmers, but there was a problem with banks generally, and so here Congress was setting up some institutions that would compete with commercial banks that themselves were failing throughout rural areas in the United States, and Congress set up a system that said, okay, for the time being, we will give you an advantage over your commercial competitors, but only for the time being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.158" offset="13224051">At some point it's going to go back to where you do not have that extent of commercial advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.812" offset="13246621">Sure, you can still issue obligations that will be tax free, but you won't be able to avoid tax entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.694" offset="13270236">Another reason that there may be a distinction is that the land banks that Mr. Hanson referred to lend, as I understand it, based on the farmer's land as collateral, and there has always been a feeling in Congress that we don't want to take the land away from the farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.074" offset="13327705">That is distinguishable from the question of lending based on their crops, which is what a production credit association would do, or based on the equipment and land that is held by a cooperative that may be producing or processing the crops or otherwise providing services for the farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.455" offset="13389250">There is a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.307" offset="13392594">It's worth noting that today between two thirds and three quarters of agricultural lending in the United States is done by entities outside of the farm credit system, and those entities must compete on the grounds that Congress set forth, and not on the grounds that can be divined by some reference to past history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.968" offset="13463333">If there are no further questions, I thank the Court.</text>
