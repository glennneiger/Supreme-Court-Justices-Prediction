            <text syncTime="77.359" offset="459065">First, the South Carolina supreme court cited a... an extraneous feature of a post Simmons amendment which, the main thrust of which was to abolish parole in all cases of murder, to hold that Simmons v. South Carolina does not apply to South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.671" offset="540254">Secondly, the State argues that even though Simmons recognized a due process right to inform the jury that the defendant was ineligible for parole, arguments of counsel and instructions of the court that never did that nevertheless somehow satisfy the due process requirements of Simmons in any event, and finally the State argues, seizing on a single word culled from the opinions in Simmons, the word argue, submits that because counsel rather self evidently, out of a desire to evade and avoid the due process rule in Simmons, declined to drive home in jury argument their future dangerousness case as it had been presented to the jury, therefore the rule in Simmons was not triggered.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.201" offset="1378471">That's correct, and here I think the State court is simply confused about what Simmons required.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.317" offset="1414938">The South Carolina procedure is that the... a jury is instructed to determine first whether any statutory aggravating circumstance is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.892" offset="1457152">This is a Georgia type nonweighing statute in which the finding of an aggravator is a threshold finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.950" offset="1485469">The jury is instructed, pursuant to the statute, and this jury was instructed that if the jury does not unanimously find the existence of a statutory aggravating factor, it goes no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.550" offset="1531862">It does not sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.287" offset="1538758">It simply reports its failure to find the aggravator to the judge, and the judge sentences, and at that point the judge has the option, and only under those circumstances the judge has the option of either imposing a 30-calendar-year sentence or life, of course without the possibility of parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.152" offset="1846272">This is exactly the situation in Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.291" offset="1858811">It cannot be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.065" offset="1865916">The only difference is that the... if the jury never acquires sentencing responsibility in the first place, there is another option.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.776" offset="1900711">There's no reason why the jury should know about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.211" offset="1910429">It's not part of their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.234" offset="1918579">It's not part of their responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.926" offset="1925371">The State supreme court just yesterday filed another case which my friend helpfully filed, lodged with the court yesterday, State v. Kelly, in which the court finally explained its rationale... this is the State supreme court... for this holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.439" offset="1991408">It said in Kelly that where another sentence other than life without parole was available to the defendant as an alternative to the death penalty... this is at page 11 of the slip opinion... then a Simmons charge would actually mislead the jury by representing that the defendant would never be released from prison, when, in fact, a 30-year sentence is a potential sentence for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.754" offset="2088584">Now, it's clear what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.022" offset="2097674">This explanation doesn't appear in the Shafer case or in the accompanying Starnes case, but now apparently the South Carolina supreme court is laboring under the misconception that a Simmons instruction is a prediction to the jury as to the defendant's fate, rather than an explanation of the sentencing option of life imprisonment that the jury is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.010" offset="2181684">Of course, the Simmons instruction is the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.421" offset="2195268">It has nothing to do with a prediction about what is going to happen to the defendant as of this moment, when the jury hasn't yet found aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.625" offset="2232153">In any event, none of this really matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.482" offset="2239571">The... it's quite clear, I think, that Justice Kennedy's plurality opinion in Ramdass, which we quoted in our brief and, indeed, in the question presented in the cert petition, three times stated the holding of Simmons in a way that precisely encompasses this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.315" offset="2310833">He said, the parole eligibility instruction is... of Simmons is required only when, assuming the jury fixes the sentence at life, the defendant is ineligible for parole under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.204" offset="2358481">Simmons applies elsewhere in the opinion only to instances where, as a legal matter, there is no possibility of parole if the jury decides the appropriate sentence is life imprisonment, and I can go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.266" offset="2402680">That is the holding of Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.133" offset="2414174">That is the holding which was clearly violated in this case and which, according to the South Carolina supreme court, no longer applies in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.966" offset="2449491">Now, clearly a mistake has been made and we submit that it should be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.977" offset="2473524">This leaves the question of what to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.300" offset="2494840">The State asks you to remand the case back to the South Carolina supreme court to perform the rest of the Simmons analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.128" offset="13394171">But now, the South Carolina supreme court has made quite clear that except in very rare cases involving a recidivist statute that's almost never invoked, the life without parole section of the statute will never be given unless this Court rules otherwise under the Simmons case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.704" offset="13468463">The last thing I want to say is that the near unanimity of the States on this issue really does demonstrate, I think, a paradigmatic example of a due process violation, where the considered judgments of the American people on this claim, as expressed through their courts and legislatures, is already quite, quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.214" offset="13554458">Now, I had thought that Simmons was also clear as to what the Due Process Clause required, but clearly in South Carolina it is not clear enough, so I would hope that this Court will decide all of the issues that are presented by this record whether the South Carolina supreme court reached them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.394" offset="13619242">I think there's no need for another analysis such as went on in the Kelly case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.686" offset="13636378">Mr. Bruck, do you know the answer to the question that was asked about... I was under the impression that defense counsel had asked to be allowed to say this, or was told he couldn't say it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3382.626" offset="13680159">Your Honor, I was under that impression, too, and I was just looking through the joint appendix right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.859" offset="13705028">I recall Mr. Banks, defense counsel, saying that he wanted to read that to the jury, but I can't put my finger on it right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.053" offset="13729792">If I may, I will file a letter with the Clerk giving the citation if, in fact, my recollection is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.914" offset="13753302">And for those reasons we hope that the Court will take up all of the issues presented by this case and will reverse the death sentence imposed.</text>
