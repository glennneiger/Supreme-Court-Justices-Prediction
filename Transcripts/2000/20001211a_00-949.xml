            <text syncTime="25.303" offset="284849">Just one week ago, this Court vacated the Florida Supreme Court's November 21 revision of Florida's election code, which had changed statutory deadlines, severely limited the discretion of the State's chief election officer, changed the meaning of words such as shall and may into shall not and may not, and authorized extensive standardless and unequal manual ballot recounts in selected Florida counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.618" offset="410132">Just four days later, without a single reference to this Court's December 4 ruling, the Florida Supreme Court issued a new, wholesale postelection revision of Florida's election law.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.644" offset="462273">That decision not only changed Florida election law yet again, it also explicitly referred to, relied upon, and expanded its November 21 judgment that this Court had made into a nullity.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.956" offset="927461">The Secretary of State as the executive branch is also given considerably other... considerable other responsibilities, when but... and to a certain extent, especially in connection with the contest phase of the election, certain authority was explicitly vested in the Circuit Court of the State of Florida, which is the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.251" offset="1268621">Can you use this theory and say that it creates some sort of presumption of validity that allows us to see whether this court or the executive has gone too far?</text>

            <text syncTime="348.032" offset="1575821">And I would have thought that that would be sufficient rather than to raise an appropriate federal question, rather than to say there's no judicial review here in Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="2040.544" offset="8345819">The only case in Florida that even touches upon this in terms of a machine ballot is the Hogan case from the Fourth District Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.149" offset="8376225">In the Fourth District Court of Appeal, that candidate lost by three votes, and he went during the protest phase to the canvassing board and asked for a manual recount to be done and they exercised their discretion and said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.598" offset="8430038">And in that case, there is a discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.112" offset="8440069">He raised the argument that there were ballots in there that had hanging chads and this that and the other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.938" offset="8459399">They would hear none of it and when it went up on appeal, it was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.406" offset="8473296">So the fact of the matter is that the only case that we have that deals with this handles it in that fashion, and I would respectfully suggest that a ballot that is not properly punched is not a legal ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.761" offset="8514674">And I think also, sir, if you go through an analysis of the Vice President's arguments in supporting what the Supreme Court does, there is sort of an omelet that is created by going and picking through different statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.708" offset="8566501">For instance, the clear intent standard comes from a statute that deals with a damaged ballot where you have to create, to put through the machine, a substitute ballot, and there are very clear directions as to what to do to preserve the integrity of the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.702" offset="8626479">And the Beckstrom case, which you will no doubt hear much about as the argument proceeds, dealt with that kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.356" offset="8653123">There was a manual recount there; the court did not pass on the propriety of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.620" offset="8670155">The issue was if the election officials took ballots and marked over the ballots instead of creating a separate substitute ballot, they took that ballot and marked it over so it could go through an optical scanner, which the court found to be gross negligence whether they would discount the votes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4387.882" offset="17735167">The reason that I said what I did to Justice Scalia was that I think that if this Court were to rule that there was something wrong with the statewide recounts, that they were being done by canvassing boards as opposed to directly by the court, or because the court was not supervising the particular expression of voter intent, what the court would have done is simply cut back on a remedy that we didn't ask for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.322" offset="17856898">The second part is that when you are dealing with overvotes, remember, this is a machine issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.178" offset="17892320">When you are dealing with overvotes, the machine has already registered two votes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4979.157" offset="20100294">That does not, I respectfully suggest, at all deal with the question of deference to the voter intent determination which the court has repeatedly said is a matter for judicial determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="5080.803" offset="20506864">First, I think that the answer that they did it differently, different people interpreting the general standard differently, would not raise a problem even in the absence of judicial review of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.908" offset="20559318">Second, even if that would have raised a constitutional problem, I think the judicial review that provides the standardization would solve that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.718" offset="20594531">The third thing that I was saying is that any differences as to how this standard is interpreted have a lot less significance in terms of what votes are counted or not counted than simply the differences in machines that exist throughout the counties of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.462" offset="20649492">There are five times as many undervotes in punch card ballot counties than in optical ballot counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.801" offset="20682825">Now, for whatever that reason is, whether it's voter error or machine problems, that statistic, you know, makes clear that there is some difference in how votes are being treated county by county.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.469" offset="20733502">That difference is much greater than the difference in how many votes are recovered in Palm Beach or Broward or Volusia or MiamiDade, so that the differences of interpretation of the standard, the general standard are resulting in far fewer differences among counties than simply the differences in the machines that they have.</text>

            <text syncTime="5278.568" offset="21297956">Then they got into the process of evaluating these ballots and changed the standard from moment to moment during the first day and again, they evolved from the standard that the chad had to be punched through to the socalled dimpled ballot standard, indentations on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.577" offset="21373920">There was a reason why that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.795" offset="21378831">It was because they weren't producing enough additional votes so that there's pressure on to change the standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.917" offset="21407357">And that will happen in a situation which is where the process is ultimately subjective, completely up to the discretion of the official, and there's no requirement of any uniformity.</text>

            <text syncTime="5424.869" offset="21883099">The only thing I can say in response to that is that what this Court said one week ago today, that as a general rule the court defers to a state court's interpretation of a state statute, but not where the legislature is acting under authority granted to it by the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.253" offset="21952689">The final point I would like to make is with respect to section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.549" offset="21965855">It is quite clear that the court in both the earlier decision and the decision last Friday was aware and concerned about compliance with section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.920" offset="22007337">It construed section 5 in a way that allowed it by labeling what it was doing as interpretation to change in dramatic respects the Florida election law, and we submit because it did, so misconstrued the applicability not only with respect to finality but the other part of section 5 requires a determination of controversies pursuant to a set of laws that are in place at the time of the elections.</text>
