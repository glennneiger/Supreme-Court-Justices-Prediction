            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="70.856" offset="429993">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="76.102" offset="450996">The Controlled Substances Act prohibits the distribution of marijuana outside federally authorized research programs because Congress, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have each determined that there is no currently accepted medical use for the drug, and it has a high potential for abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.695" offset="537304">The statute also recognizes that new information might come to light that would justify less restrictive controls so it establishes administrative procedure for changing the classification and the restrictions for marijuana and other controlled substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.335" offset="599894">That statutory scheme leaves no room for the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative to distribute marijuana without the approval of the Attorney General under a claim of medical necessity, and it leaves no room for a court to consider such a claim as a basis for refusing to enjoin the marijuana operations of the cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.591" offset="688919">The Ninth Circuit's ruling in effect authorizes the operation of marijuana pharmacies outside the safeguards and restrictions of the Act and undermines the ability of the Act to protect the public from hazardous drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.350" offset="747956">The common law defense of necessity can sometimes authorize a person to violate the law in order to avoid a more serious harm but it doesn't apply here for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.739" offset="797484">First, because the legislature has already balanced the harms and come to a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.474" offset="824442">Congress anticipated there would be claims of medical uses for controlled substances and provided an administrative procedure for evaluating them allowing trial judges and juries to redetermine that balance in individual cases would undermine the procedure established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.976" offset="898421">Second, because the defense has no application because the co-ops members and the co-op itself have alternatives to violating the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.694" offset="945337">They have substantive alternatives, other lawful medications including a synthetic form of the active ingredient of marijuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.192" offset="991313">You have a footnote in your brief, footnote 11, that describes some of the situations there that gives the impression that this whole case is a sham, that it's really just a front for using marijuana and I'm wondering if... and your argument you're just making now suggests there are always alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.243" offset="1063515">Do you think we should take the case on the assumption that there really are some people for whom this is a medical necessity or should we assume that there are no such people.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.169" offset="1099250">The... on the assumption that there are no such people because the Food and Drug Administration charged with evaluating the medical... the scientific information and the DEA, that is the agency that report to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services having evaluated the claims of medical use have found that there is no accepted medical use, that some of the claims of medical use are simply wrong.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="273.592" offset="1240939">General Underwood, may I just stop you there because take one of the examples that was in the brief, the one about the man who was constantly vomiting and the only thing that calmed him down, he had a lymphoma or something like that, that is not an uncommon experience and what surprised me about this case was that that kind of thing has been going on, individual doctor prescribing marijuana just to prevent that kind of extreme suffering, and that seemed to have gone without enforcement until California passes this proposition and you get clinics selling it, not individual doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.614" offset="1445007">Am I wrong in thinking that there has been quite a bit of this going on in the medical profession.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.849" offset="1466010">The record doesn't reflect and I don't know how much of it has been going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.592" offset="1484922">I think there are two things to say in response to that though, one is that the agencies charged with evaluating the medical uses here have ongoing studies and have so far concluded that there are... that the particular use that you're describing is best served... there's now an extract of marijuana that's been on the market... been available and been put on the lower schedule than schedule one for 15 or 16 years which is this Marinol and efforts are being made to find other methods of administering the pure substance and determining whether it has the effect that's described.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="381.332" offset="1671855">Ms. Underwood, these judgments made by the federal agencies, the FDA and the DEA, I think they take into account the overall public interest, I mean, they... I'm not sure that they have come to the conclusion that marijuana would never ever, ever be helpful to someone who's in extreme pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.258" offset="1775613">I think what they've probably done is made the judgment that the chances of its being that helpful and not being replaceable by something else are so slim that in view of the abuses to which general permission for its use would lead it's best that it be proscribed, is that an inaccurate determination on my part?</text>
            <text syncTime="431.394" offset="1872161">Could you really say that there has been a determination by the federal government that marijuana is never medically useful.</text>

            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="441.331" offset="1911868">Well the determination that's been made is that the medical utility of it has not been established which is a slightly different way of putting it but there is a separate determination the FDA makes determinations as it does with substances that aren't on the controlled substances list, that is there are new drugs that are proposed all the time which might possibly be useful and aren't authorized for use until after tests satisfy the FDA that the drug is safe and effective for use and marijuana has not passed that screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.903" offset="2050212">There is an additional screen for controlled substances that is in addition to considering and the scheduling decision takes into account not just medical utility but also the potential for abuse, but the FDA's role in it, the Health and Human Services role in it is just to assess or it has a role in simply assessing the medical evidence and has concluded that to date there is insufficient reason to think that it is a safe and effective drug although there are continuing research projects going on to try and pursue the anecdotal information that it is sometimes helpful or that components of marijuana are sometimes helpful.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="522.346" offset="2235995">Ms. Underwood, it would help me, General Underwood, if you would tell me why the word preemption doesn't appear in the government's brief because I took the simple-minded approach looking at this, Congress says this is a schedule one drug and California says you can have it if you've got a note from a doctor that says you have a migraine headache.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.289" offset="2323766">Why isn't the federal law that says this is the schedule one drug preemptive, it must have been with some thought that you didn't use that word.</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_d_underwood" startTime="553.474" stopTime="557.474">
            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="553.474" offset="2360442">Well the California law doesn't actually purport to authorize the distribution of marijuana with a doctor's note, it provides a defense to California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.044" offset="2418748">Now it is true that an effort is being made here to invoke the judgment behind that law as in support of the claim of medical necessity, but California didn't purport to create a defense to federal law as it couldn't have if it had tried it would have been presumably preemptive... preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.592" offset="2532955">But it's perfectly possible to comply with both California law and federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.563" offset="2656775">And I should say that the decision of the federal agencies not to accept the kind of anecdotal evidence that you're suggesting is a decision that the federal... the Food and Drug Administration has made again not just in the controlled substance area but it has concluded that the anecdotal reports of individuals are a basis for research, a reason to conduct research and not a basis for authorizing the use of a drug or changing its scheduling.</text>

            <text syncTime="663.938" offset="2802330">General Underwood, there's some indication in the trial court's observation, he had no choice but to enter this injunction, that's something of an over-reading, but suppose I were the district judge and I said, you know, General Underwood, you want me to basically supervise what's going to be a major effort to prosecute people and you're doing this under my contempt power, I don't want the court to get involved in this, you have your own United States and assistant United States attorneys, you have investigate these, bring these as prosecutions and then we'll hear these cases and if there's a necessity defense or something we can rule on it, but you're basically asking me to issue an injunction and in order to enforce it I'm going to have to make prosecutorial decisions, I don't want to be bothered with that because I think it intrudes upon a separation of powers balance, it's making me more of a prosecutor than a neutral judge.</text>

            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="3487.823" offset="14097886">A medical necessity defense is foreclosed here not only by the fact that Congress contemplated and rejected it and not only by the fact that alternatives are available but also because any necessity defense is a response to unusual and unforeseen circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.650" offset="14189210">It couldn't possibly, the common law necessity defense couldn't possibly authorize an ongoing enterprise designed to stand ready and provide supplies to people who might show up with their own individual claims of medical necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.179" offset="14255247">There's no constitutional problem with the statutory procedure for deciding when and if medical uses for a drug exist where with... and the court held in Weinberger against Hynson that it's perfectly appropriate for the FDA to reject anecdotal evidence and insist on controlled studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.825" offset="14357856">There's also no problem with protecting sick people from charlatans or unsafe and ineffective drugs as this Court held in Rutherford in dealing with Laetrile the claim that there was a right to use Laetrile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.983" offset="14410519">Respondents in this case have never presented their claims, the claims they're making here, to the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.904" offset="14442179">They've never sought review of the classification of marijuana in schedule one, they've never sought access to, at least so far as the record reflects, to the clinical trials that are ongoing right now to deal with synthetic manufacture of components of marijuana, and on the remedy for contempt at the petition appendix at 25 A and again at 37 A it's perfectly clear that the government was not seeking fines or incarceration, that the judge wasn't contemplating fines or incarceration but just evicting and padlocking, closing down this business.</text>
