            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92722">The opinion of the Court in No. 00-767 Immigration Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr and a companion case will be announced by Justice Stevens.</text>

            <text syncTime="13.246" offset="145698">Each of the plaintiffs in these cases is an alien who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States, but is deportable because he pleaded guilty to a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.276" offset="197734">At the time of each of the guilty pleas, federal law provided that the alien could apply to the Attorney General for a discretionary waiver of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.735" offset="239635">Literally, thousands of such discretionary waivers had been granted in the years prior to 1996, when Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.920" offset="312360">As the Government construes those statutes, they withdrew the Attorney General’s authority to grant plaintiffs the waivers that were available when they agreed to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.013" offset="356768">Moreover, the government also contends that procedural provisions in those statues deprive both the Federal District Courts and the Courts of Appeals of jurisdiction to review the Attorney General’s legal conclusion that discretionary relief is no longer available.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.007" offset="424686">Thus, these cases raise both procedural and substantive questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.732" offset="447569">For reasons stated in opinions filed with the Clerk, we answer these questions the same way that the Court of Appeals did.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.171" offset="477349">We hold that the Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs’ petitions for direct review of the decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals, but that the District Court does have jurisdiction in a habeas corpus proceeding to order a hearing on their applications for a discretionary waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.997" offset="556657">On the merits we hold that the repeal of the Attorney General’s authority to grant discretionary relief, does not apply to aliens who pleaded guilty before the enactment of the 1966 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.091" offset="609006">Justice Scalia has filed dissenting opinions that are joined in full by the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas, and in part by Justice O’Connor.</text>
