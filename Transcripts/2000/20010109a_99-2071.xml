            <text syncTime="50.411" offset="356070">First, Mr. Boulais, as a father, must produce a signed statement that he will support the child until his 18th birthday.</text>

            <label>Ms. Martha F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="85.709" offset="497340">Your Honor, the Fiallo case concerns the situation of some individuals who are citizens applying for special immigration preferences for children of those citizens or relatives of those citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.589" offset="572782">The Court here ruled that that was covered by the plenary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.827" offset="585738">Here the issue concerns only citizens applying for trying to transmit citizenship at birth, benefits to... to parents, and so the difference is the question of what the extent of plenary power is.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.921" offset="634117">And we believe that plenary power should stop, at the very least, before it reaches a situation where a citizen, here Mr. Boulais, is seeking to transmit citizenship benefits to a child who, as the statute indicates, once citizenship is recognized will relate back to the date of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.486" offset="716351">So I guess there are two basic distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.838" offset="725859">One, that there's a relation back issue, so the citizen's child... the child here, once his citizenship is recognized, will have been deemed to have been a citizen from birth, and therefore there isn't any of the concern about transfer of allegiances that's the case in naturalization or also potentially the case in immigration sorts of situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.164" offset="827110">I mean, it's fine to make it retroactive as far as the law is concerned, but that doesn't change the reality of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.126" offset="855009">The reality of it is he's not an American citizen until these conditions are... are met, and he's proclaimed to be such.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.491" offset="7096393">I mean, you're right in saying by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.080" offset="7106738">Normally in all countries citizenship was conferred by statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.379" offset="7139965">But statutes traditionally transmitted citizenship most cases through blood.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.536" offset="7176641">And so would you say that when the United States passes a statute like any other country that transmits citizenship through blood that they treat that person who results as a citizen the same way precisely as a naturalized citizen?</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.315" offset="7243724">The point I'm making is that this Court held in Wong Kim Ark and also held in Rogers v.

            <text syncTime="1882.907" offset="7686133">For example, if it was procured by fraud, but the other important... and this was significant in Rogers v.

            <text syncTime="1896.948" offset="7742245">In that case, it was the parallel provision here in 1401 (g) until, I believe, it was 1978, someone in that situation had... the child had to reside in the United States for some period of time after birth in order to establish the requisite connection with the United States, and that was challenged on the ground that the person having been declared a citizen at birth, there could not be a condition subsequent to perfecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.981" offset="7854362">And this Court upheld that provision in Rogers v. Bellei, and importantly, it did so by distinguishing the children of U.S. parents born abroad from those who are born in the United States with the suggestion that Congress has greater latitude with respect to the naturalization of those persons than it does to others, precisely because they are not encompassed by the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.354" offset="7943910">The Fourteenth Amendment refers to citizens who are born or naturalized in the United States, and the Court pointed out that persons who are born to United States citizens abroad do not fall within that description and therefore are not citizens for Fourteenth Amendment purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.501" offset="9432471">And also first of all a reason why Fiallo applies is it's a question of who is going to enter our society.</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.286" offset="13983629">First, in response to Justice Stevens' question about whether or not any bill was introduced in Congress, no, there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.909" offset="14006094">Mr. Kneedler spent a great deal of time talking about the legal relationship which he asserts is automatically established at the time of birth between a father and child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.502" offset="14056458">In fact, as this Court knows, that to the extent that that exists, it's a legacy of coverture and common law discrimination which this Court has previously condemned in Frontiero versus--</text>

            <text syncTime="3493.170" offset="14127093">Your Honor, I think it can be distinguished from this case, aside from my view of its propriety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.109" offset="14150917">This... in Lehr versus Robertson the issue required the state to decide between competing parents, and to do that quickly because of the emotional trauma involved with the adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.530" offset="14200550">Here there isn't any need to create a hierarchy between parents, any need to create those kind of classifications to make that decision proceed quickly, and so therefore, the government interests are different--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3524.736" offset="14253422">Is there a problem for the child in Lehr?</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.315" offset="14255720">Lehr, one of the grave concerns I thought was holding up an adoption, holding up placing a child in a secure setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.463" offset="14284351">Here you have none of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.180" offset="14291142">It would benefit the child, surely, to be a U.S. citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3542.784" offset="14325624">--Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.163" offset="14327087">Exactly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.394" offset="14331998">And so, no, I don't believe that a ruling in our favor in this case would require this Court to reassess the decision in Lehr.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.734" offset="14357389">In addition, the Court asked about the question of the numbers that would be involved here, and there's no indication in the legislative history that the Congress has been concerned about that in looking at this statute, as Mr. Kneedler just indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.309" offset="14419665">In fact, the statute has progressively gotten more liberal, and I think that that underscores the fact that in... as this Court looks at the intent of Congress in crafting a remedy that the Court should take into account, that Congress has progressively gotten more liberal in addressing this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.009" offset="14482463">Most recently in 1986, the Congress eliminated the... or reduced the ten year residency requirement down to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.242" offset="14515378">Now, that had presumably a significant effect on the additional numbers of individuals who could seek transmission of citizenship under this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.862" offset="14545889">Yet, there was no mention of that in the legislative history as being a factor that was influencing in any way Congress' view of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.739" offset="14573369">In addition, there are other indicia of Congress' intent.</text>
