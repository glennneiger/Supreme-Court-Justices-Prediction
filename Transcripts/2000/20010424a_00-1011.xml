            <text syncTime="1519.996" offset="6237150">May I point out what the dissent said in Accardi, Your Honor, which is that it specifically objected to the Court's exercise of jurisdiction on the ground that habeas corpus did not encompass the claim raised in that case, and it objected to the exercise of jurisdiction on precisely the same grounds that the Government argues here, that a person is deportable, that it concerns discretionary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.493" offset="6327115">And the Court rejected that, and exercised discretion, and said there's a fundamental difference between reviewing the exercise of discretion and reviewing the refusal to exercise discretion, and this is a case about the refusal to exercise discretion based on the Attorney General's legal ruling that an entire class of individuals is not eligible for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.610" offset="6419589">And it's our...  our only challenge is to that determination by the Attorney General, that his legal determination as to who is eligible to apply and who is not is legally incorrect, and we believe that claim must be reviewable in a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.009" offset="6481238">It can be the court of appeals, and we set forth why we believe that is entirely possible and appropriate, but it must be reviewable in a court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.331" offset="6538498">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.039" offset="6557306">In 1996, in two separate statutes, Congress fundamentally restructured the Nation's immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.188" offset="6581862">There are amendments of general applicability, and also ones specifically dealing with criminal aliens to ensure that criminal aliens were expeditiously removed from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.962" offset="6625016">Briefly, the three amendments of general applicability that are most relevant to these two cases this morning are Congress's elimination of deportation and exclusion proceedings, and replacing them with a single proceeding called removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.875" offset="6680604">Secondly, Congress repealed the prior 1182(c) under which petitioners here seek relief, and replaced it with a new proceeding, or form of discretionary relief called cancellation of removal, and third, Congress reenacted, or enacted a new judicial review provision which channeled judicial review, if it's to be had at all, to the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.600" offset="6779556">The two amendments specifically dealing with criminal aliens that are relevant here is that Congress not only repealed the prior 1182(c), but rendered aggravated felons and in some cases other criminal aliens altogether ineligible for cancellation of removal, and secondly, Congress provided in section 1252(a)(2)(C) of the Act that no court, which includes both the court of appeals and the district court, shall have jurisdiction to remove...  to review an order of removal entered against an alien who had committed one of the specified criminal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.433" offset="6922916">The theory was that an alien, just like a citizen, would have full access to the courts to contest the criminal conviction in the criminal proceedings, both direct review and collateral attack, but once that was done, the validity of the conviction was established, and therefore, with respect to access to the courts, there was really no further need to test the central basis on which the alien was to be removed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.660" offset="9803804">Well, one thing to bear in mind is that the petitioner in Accardi argued the case in terms of a due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.636" offset="9831703">What was alleged there was that the Attorney General had engaged in prejudgment and had deliberately subverted an administrative scheme for adjudicating discretionary applications, and the petitioner argued that that was a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.035" offset="9893248">Now, this Court subsequently has said in the University of Missouri, in 435 U.S., that Accardi did not state a rule of constitutional law binding on the States, so in light of subsequent understandings of what Accardi stood for, it would seem odd that if it didn't state a fundamental rule of constitutional law that is binding on the States, that it would nonetheless be the sort of thing that Congress would be compelled to provide judicial review of under the immigration laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.645" offset="10095749">That...  the Court explored that, though, solely for purposes of deciding which court would, as a statutory matter, have jurisdiction over the particular claim there, and what the Court said is, sensibly it only...  it makes sense for suspension of deportation claims to be heard in the courts of appeals because the Attorney General has chosen to adjudicate applications for suspension of deportation together with the substantive basis for deportation in one single proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.033" offset="10213300">But the Court made pretty clear in Foti that the Attorney General was not required to do that, and it would have been equally consistent with the Act for the Attorney General to determine whether to grant relief to particular aliens outside of the affirmative removal proceeding as a matter of discretion, maybe on a sort of certiorari jurisdiction to the Attorney General to decide at the close of the case whether to do that or not, and that remains the case under the current law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.027" offset="10309222">Nothing in the Act requires that the Attorney General adjudicate an application for 1182(c) relief, or for cancellation of removal before entering a final order of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.578" offset="10355511">The regulations provide that method of adjudication, but nothing in the Act does, and the question, I think, for purposes of whether judicial review is compelled is whether there is a statutory right, because after all, Congress has plenary power over immigration, over the jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts, and broad power over the fashioning of the writ of habeas corpus, as this Court said in Felker, and Congress could legitimately decide if there is not a statutory right to have an application for cancellation or 1182(c) relief adjudicated in a particular...</text>

            <text syncTime="3458.052" offset="13989352">The Government says that those cases came out that way simply because the Attorney General had, as a discretionary matter, decided to determine the discretionary element together with the merits determination, so as a matter of fact, it happened to have been preceding the order of deportation, but that there was no legal requirement that that be the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.919" offset="14188823">It's 212...  it was 212e(b)(2), I believe, and it's currently also the regulation governing the current version of that, which is the cancellation of removal, and I'd be happy to provide it at the next case, if that's...  that that final order...  and I don't believe the Government would actually contend that under the statute as it's currently implemented, and as it has been since 1917, and under the regulations that govern, that a final order could be entered with the immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Attorney General simply say, I refuse to adjudicate your application for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.268" offset="14342214">If the Attorney General determines that the individual is not legally eligible, then so be it, but that claim is reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.783" offset="14372307">If the Attorney General exercises discretion, then that is not reviewable, and we concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.560" offset="14395400">The...  what the...  what this Court has said about the pardon analogy to the discretionary decision goes to the exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.529" offset="14427269">That's very clear from the Jay v. Boyd case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.674" offset="14435837">It's clear from the Yang case, Your Honor, where the exercise of discretion is not reviewable, but the question of whether the Attorney General has properly construed who is eligible, the Attorney General in this case has said that an entire class of individuals is ineligible because I determined that, Congress instructed me to apply this law retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.594" offset="14523504">Whether the statute applies retroactively or not is a question that the courts must decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.340" offset="14542521">That's what Landgraf said, and it's for Congress to legislate clearly and specifically what the temporal scope of the statute is, and that's not for the Attorney General to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.878" offset="14580660">I also, in regard to the particular provision governing the review of discretionary decisions that Mr. Kneedler referred to, that refers to particular determinations there in the...  that are in the discretion of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.177" offset="14629875">For example, asylum claims remain reviewable, so it's clear that the preclusion provision here still would do a significant amount of work, and as far as the definition of what constitute...  of what removable means, that definition does not specifically apply to the term in section 1252, in the judicial review provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.201" offset="14709914">It is a definition, but it does not specifically apply to what we have at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.204" offset="14726005">And finally, in terms of the Government arguing that the Attorney General could simply decide to deny any exercise of discretion, that is the Chennary principle, that the decision of the Attorney General must be, correct or not...</text>
