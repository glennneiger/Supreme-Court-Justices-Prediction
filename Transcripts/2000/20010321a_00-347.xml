            <text syncTime="32.244" offset="276944">The paradigm Section 10(b) plaintiff is an investor who has purchased a security which has been inflated by deception, the price of which was been inflated by deception or manipulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="98.624" offset="542453">And the definition of security in the Act includes an option to purchase securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.940" offset="567740">But what I am suggesting to Your Honor is that the oral expression which passes or is asserted to be a security in this case should not be accepted as such, that in this case that what you're basically dealing with is a conversation which gave rise to an asserted right to purchase common stock in a subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.318" offset="673274">The answer to why, as I understand the law, Your Honor, is rooted in the Blue Chip Stamps case.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.203" offset="704726">And as I interpret that case, Your Honor, I believe it to reflect a reluctance on the part of the Court to accept oral assertions as satisfying the predicate to establish standing to sue as a purchaser of securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.091" offset="788317">Are you saying that no oral representations count under the Exchange Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="167.621" offset="818411">Are you saying that that goes for the SEC as well as what we have here, private suitor?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul M. Dodyk</label>
            <text syncTime="173.837" offset="843279">Well, certainly Your Honor, I'm not saying then oral statement cannot constitute a misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.319" offset="869193">Far be it from me to suggest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.103" offset="880373">Going to the second part of your question, Your Honor, I certainly think that distinctions can be made between the breadth of section 10(b) in the hands of the SEC and the breadth of the judicially implied private right of action under Section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="200.481" offset="949859">And as Your Honor is aware, there are distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.982" offset="959890">In an SEC action, it is of no concern whether anyone relied on misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.381" offset="985490">In fact, there is no purchaser requirement constraining the SEC's enforcement bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.508" offset="1009940">So I think the contours of the private right of action which is implied under Section 10(b) are quite different from the contours within which the SEC might bring an enforcement action.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.993" offset="1087890">Your Honor, I think as a matter of Federal securities law, as I read the Blue Chips Stamps case, that a conversation which a person asserts via an oral option should not, under the doctrine of that case, be accepted as a security.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.913" offset="1175557">The holding of the case itself was limited to a situation in which the offerees in that situation did not purchase the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.458" offset="1209829">But what I say to Your Honor is I don't think given what I understand to be... and of course Your Honor would know better than I... the thrust of that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.944" offset="1251730">The reluctance of the Court to accept wholly oral testimony not for the purpose of saying whether or not there has been a misrepresentation, but for the purpose of satisfying the threshold predicate requirement of whether or not the plaintiff has purchased securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.270" offset="1336993">The Court, time and again in the course of that opinion, said that the principal advantage of that doctrine was to place as a requirement for standing in a 10(b) case a transaction which could be proven by document.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.237" offset="1428944">The issue here is whether the security existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.901" offset="1447544">Whether there was, indeed, an option, or there wasn't an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.782" offset="1463113">If there was an option, there's no doubt that this plaintiff purchased it.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.240" offset="1480876">It isn't a question of whether the plaintiff, you know, agreed to accept the option or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.390" offset="1505535">That's, as I understand it, not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.074" offset="1516298">The question is was there an option.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.386" offset="1525493">Well, I'm not sure that Your Honor is correct in saying that there's no question as to whether or not there was a purchase of an option here in a contractually binding sense, because as Your Honor is aware, it certainly is our position that the court, the district court, failed to properly instruct the jury with respect to the statute of fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.222" offset="1648791">The question in Blue Chip is whether the plaintiff would have bought the stock or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.735" offset="1714933">The question here is much simpler, much more focused.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.871" offset="1731442">Was there a promise by the alleged seller of the option to deliver the stock or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="428.598" offset="1862368">Now I submit to Your Honor, that this case is no different in that respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.731" offset="2062884">Don't forget that in the Blue Chips Stamps case, you weren't talking about a drive by offeree in the market place.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.988" offset="2095903">What you were talking about in Blue Chip Stamps were a group of retailers who as a result of a plan of reorganization that was entered after a consent decree had the right to purchase a determinate number of shares which was defined in the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.224" offset="2172807">Therefore, their right to make the purchase was clearly documented.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.539" offset="2198094">In addition, in terms of the damage claim in that action, in terms of the injury, they were pointing to the difference between what the price the stock was trading at currently and the price which it was offered at in the prospectus.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.226" offset="2260892">And they said that is the measure of my damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.372" offset="2269460">Here, you're dealing with I think very much a weaker case in the sense that the alleged act of purchase, the existence of the option, was throughout a lawyer's description of an oral event.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.893" offset="2331527">And the would have, could have, should have goes like this, I would have exercised my option; I would over a period of years have invested fifty million dollars in this business; the business would have succeeded, and the stock market would have valued my stock interest at X million dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.147" offset="2472588">But as I understand it, it's not open to us to assume that that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.751" offset="2498920">As I understand it, the finding was that they did exercise the option.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.952" offset="2519713">That they exercised the option by going ahead in effect and paying part of the consideration for that... for getting the option which was the help that they gave to your client in getting the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.928" offset="2583661">So that as I understand it, we have a finding that this is not a hypothetical should have or would have case, but a case in which we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.753" offset="2622949">We went ahead, and when we performed... when we did the part performance, at least... that sealed the deal for the option.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.464" offset="3865855">First of all, certainly the courts of appeal have construed Blue Chip Stamps to hold that if you had a purely oral event to satisfy the purchase requirement which is unenforceable under the statute of frauds, that under Blue Chips Stamps that didn't suffice, number one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.994" offset="4539919">And the proposition which I'm going to advance, Justice Ginsburg, is that the errors committed by the district court and by the Eleventh Circuit with respect to the statute of frauds are clear and undeniable and are fatal to every cause of action which was asserted in this case, State or Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.316" offset="4633228">Now, grant me the indulgence of assuming, although I've had little indication of this, that the Kagen and Pelletier approach would prevail, and that the Court was at least open to the argument that, well, Blue Chip Stamps means that if you have an oral event upon which you are basing your purchase argument, and you don't have an enforceable contract under the statute of frauds, you don't have a purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.149" offset="4740540">Now, I think... and I don't mean to be rude or over reaching... but I think it's clear that both the district court and the Eleventh Circuit committed undeniable errors in the way they treated the statute of frauds question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.867" offset="4807413">In the court of appeals they said that the statute of frauds did not apply to this case because the oral option, although a security for Securities Act purposes was not a security for the purpose of the statute of frauds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.957" offset="4875749">Now, bear in mind that what we're talking about here is an oral agreement contract option for the sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.162" offset="4912634">And I submit that there can't be any question that the proper analysis on these facts is that the oral option was the contract for the sale of securities which the statute of frauds rendered unenforceable.</text>
