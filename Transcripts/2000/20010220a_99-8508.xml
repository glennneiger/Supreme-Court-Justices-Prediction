            <text syncTime="3382.287" offset="13686554">Because it does seem to me that the expectation of privacy, say with sound if you had a rock band in the attic, you'd have lesser expectation of privacy that someone can hear it than if you had a soloist or something, and here if you had heat that, you know, really was a tremendous amount of heat you might say well you really didn't expect that to be private, but we don't measure it that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.633" offset="13775893">--The thermal imager doesn't really measure it that way, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.844" offset="13788745">All it detects is relative amounts of heat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.317" offset="13798671">It doesn't detect absolute amounts of heat, and accordingly, officers tried to use a reference structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.931" offset="13821137">Now, they're going to have to draw a lot of inferences by comparing one structure to another because it's not a perfect control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.094" offset="13845796">They don't really know what's going on inside the house next door, and even the inference that there's an anomalous amount of heat that's going on in 878 Rhododendron Drive, which is what the thermal imager produced in this case, is an inference that depends on things that the officers don't really know, that what is going on in the house next door that makes it look cooler compared to the house that they're actually surveying, and all of those factors contribute to make the data that is obtained in this case qualitatively different than the data that would be obtained in a wiretap case or in a case where an x ray type device actually penetrated the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.093" offset="14017786">Now, if this Court were to hold that thermal imaging is a search, it could have a very chilling effect on uses of the thermal imager other than the kind of use that it was put to in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.150" offset="14061986">Thermal imagers are often used in fugitive apprehension, in perimeter surveillance for law enforcement, and for search and rescue operations in which they pick up an enormous amount of data, including houses that may be nearby to where a fugitive or a missing person is located.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.459" offset="14171177">First of all, the Government's position that they were just seeing generalized heat loss is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.584" offset="14207749">I disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.385" offset="14210884">If you look at the video taken, you will see that it's very specifically showing three glowing areas, evenly spaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.712" offset="14240245">That's very specific private information that it's obtaining about the inside of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.014" offset="14257382">It's not generalized heat loss, and it is information that they could not have determined any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.697" offset="14280160">Only by the use of the thermal imager.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.940" offset="14289146">I also think that the Government's test is really going to lead down a difficult road for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.586" offset="14319762">When will information become private enough that it's protected or when is it going to be specific enough that it should be protected?</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.061" offset="14345571">These are very vague concepts that every case is going to turn on the specifics of the facts which I think is going to be very troubling for courts and for the police in the future, and really don't set any guidance for how to use this machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.181" offset="14398129">I think that's a very problematic area that the Court's going to have to grapple with.</text>
