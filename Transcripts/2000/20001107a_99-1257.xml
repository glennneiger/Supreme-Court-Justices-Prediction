            <text syncTime="9.454" offset="187406">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.139" offset="198168">There are two principal issues in this first case and, with the Court's leave, I'll address each in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.627" offset="220111">First, the Clean Air Act does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.541" offset="239755">The Act prescribes the following: EPA must set national ambient air quality standards for a limited set of ubiquitous pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.974" offset="285522">The standards must be requisite to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.322" offset="314883">They must be based on criteria that reflect the latest scientific knowledge about the identifiable effects of the pollutant in the ambient air, and the administrator must consult an independent body of scientific experts and explain any significant departure from its recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.530" offset="403804">For 30 years, successive administrators have applied the Act's terms consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.929" offset="429300">Requisite means sufficient, but not more than necessary to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.300" offset="466812">Public health addresses not all biological effects, and not even all medical effects, but only those adverse health effects that threaten populations.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.584" offset="523967">And identifiable effects means those that are shown to exist not hypothesized.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.303" offset="554896">The Court of Appeals--</text>

            <text syncTime="105.490" offset="571615">--They do; that is, the legislative history... says that they must be adverse, which the administrator and the Court of Appeals means medically significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.976" offset="613515">Now, they have to be also medically significant to a sufficient population to constitute a public health effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.580" offset="639951">The Court of Appeals held that the Constitution requires more, specifically the articulation of what it called a determinate criterion to govern the setting of the precise standard for each pollutant.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.978" offset="701496">That is contrary to this Court's precedents which require that the Court articulate only an intelligible principle or, as the Court has otherwise put it, that the Court delineate the general policy, the public agency that is to accomplish it, and the boundaries of the delegated authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.641" offset="828242">For a discrete set of pollutants and based on published air quality criteria that reflect the latest scientific knowledge, EPA must establish uniform national standards at a level that is requisite to protect public health from the adverse effects of the pollutant in the ambient air.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.592" offset="956033">Now that, in our view, means that Congress has made the fundamental policy choices, and it is also articulated both substantive and procedural constraints on EPA's application of the specified standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.595" offset="1044013">The Constitution simply does not require more.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.341" offset="1063030">There is a second issue in the case, if I can outline what our position is.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.553" offset="1131889">I mean, suppose, you know, the scientific evidence indicates that there is some risk beyond... below a certain level of pollutant in the air, but that risk has not been... the extent of that risk has not been scientifically determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.236" offset="1214541">Now, what is requisite to protect the public health?</text>

            <text syncTime="276.722" offset="1256545">And let me answer your direct question first, and if I can and if it would be helpful to the Court, quickly outline the steps, the serial steps, that the Agency must go through every time the administrator has to modify it.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.614" offset="1356124">What is the criterion?</text>
            <text syncTime="302.561" offset="1359886">How do you decide how much risk is too much risk, or is that just up to the Agency?</text>

            <text syncTime="308.301" offset="1382874">The Agency looks first based on the criteria documents at the identifiable effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.988" offset="1409623">Those are effects that science has identified will happen to people not hypothesized risks about what might happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.648" offset="1448180">Number two, it then looks at whether those demonstrated effects rise to the level of medical significance, not whether they are... there is some effect on the biology of a cell, but whether it rises with respect to any person to the level at which a physician applying in this case the standards of the American Thoracic Society would determine that that person requires treatment, that that person, if you will, is ill or manifesting a significant medical symptom.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.639" offset="1700209">That is, the Congress could not have been clearer that zero risk or background levels of a pollutant, that is levels that exist in the ambient air without man-made activity, is not what the administrator is aiming for or what the Act is designed to protect.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.247" offset="1778576">It's something above zero, but what is it to decide whether the risk is too much risk?</text>

            <text syncTime="412.985" offset="1801564">Well, perhaps I... if I may, perhaps I can, to answer your question by reference to either or both of the two pollutants that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.107" offset="1838031">With respect to particulate matter, for example, there was a preexisting standard that was set in 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.332" offset="1866975">The Agency pursuant to the Act's requirements that the standards be reviewed every five years in light of the latest scientific knowledge went back and collected all of the medical and scientific study and prepared them in a criteria document, which is a multivolume set that is reviewed by CASAC, the independent advisory committee, which agreed that it was what it called the best ever compilation of the health effects of small particulate matter on public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.461" offset="2007514">The EPA then created a... what is called a staff paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.252" offset="2026635">The staff paper distills the science and organizes the data in a series of recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.258" offset="2058714">That, too, was reviewed by CASAC, which agreed that the ranges of concentrations... and this I think is what you're getting to... provided the appropriate parameters for the administrator's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.581" offset="2115974">Now, with respect to particulate matter, the staff recommended, and CASAC agreed, that it was important to separately measure particulate, fine particulate matter; that is, matter that is equal to or less than 25 micrograms per cubic meter.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.786" offset="2188803">And if the staff with CASAC's approval set both the upper bound and the lower bound for the administrator's decision based on what the science revealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.726" offset="2232585">May I ask you a question right there about the CASAC reviews, so called, the scientific committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.126" offset="2258185">I thought the statute required that committee to advise the EPA of any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of the national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.816" offset="2336865">I mean, the statute does require the scientific committee to look at all those things and to report it to the EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.451" offset="2367481">Now, why would Congress want that advice on economic and energy effects if Congress didn't want the EPA to consider those in setting the standards?</text>

            <text syncTime="570.510" offset="2431638">First of all, as I think we'll probably address in some detail in the next hour, the EPA uses costs and feasibility standards in many, many of the things that it does, and it uses the information, this information that CASAC provides for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.137" offset="2502168">For example, in all... the Act essentially creates a two-part process.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.967" offset="2521499">The first part is the setting of these national standards that set a floor for ambient air across the whole country and do not apply of their own force to any source of polluting, whether it's me driving my car or the utility plant that generates my power.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.172" offset="2594328">The second part of the Act is implementation; that is, how do you go about achieving these standards, and the states and EPA have vast authority and discretion to determine how that's done, and costs and other implementation factors, like technological constraints, are used at that point to determine what's reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.980" offset="2693594">This Court in Union Electric in 1976 pointed out that costs and technological considerations are amply used in the implementation process, so long as they don't avoid it.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.247" offset="2846671">--The legislative history and the text of the '70 Act are absolutely clear, and the EPA and the D.C. Circuit have been unanimous for 30 years that in the first part of the Clean Air Act, that is in setting the standards, the EPA is to consider only what the criteria documents reveal as the effects on public health and welfare of the pollutant in the air, and that costs are determined at the implementation phase by the states, by EPA, and by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.708" offset="2988464">Now, your point about CASAC, I think is very important to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.916" offset="3005287">The CASAC was created in the 1977 amendments, and it was directed to do two things, and it's reflected at pages 112-A and 113-A of the appendix to our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.943" offset="3065368">First, in 109(d)(2)(b) it is told to review both the criteria, which I was just discussing, and the national ambient air quality standard that EPA proposes in light of its scientific knowledge and what the criteria document reveals, and that is part of the NAAQS standard-setting process, and in this case the CASAC issued what they called closure letters, both with respect to the criteria documents on PM and ozone and with respect to the staff papers on particulate matter and ozone.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.136" offset="3246136">You have directed my attention to a separate section of the statute which says that such committees shall also, and then it lists a series of things that it should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.414" offset="3291275">That section, the section that relates to implementation technologies, et cetera relates to the implementation process of the standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.387" offset="3339132">The EP... for example, with respect to the PM and ozone standards, the CASAC has not yet issued any of that information because the Agency has not yet either begun to implement the eight-hour standard or the 2.5 standard, or indicated in notice and comment rulemaking how it will go about doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.768" offset="3424709">The provision that you have questioned, Justice O'Connor, ties in perfectly with the provision in... also in Section 7409, I can't remember which subsection it is, which requires the EP... or maybe it's Section 7408.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.031" offset="3525750">In any event, I'll explain to you what I have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.521" offset="3547693">The 1970 Act, which required EPA to set national standards for the first time under the 1967 Act, they were set by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.319" offset="3598893">In the 1967 Act, the states were told to set them by reference to two things that EPA's predecessor, HEW, would supply them.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.270" offset="3654691">The first was the criteria document accumulating the science data on health effects, which is the same thing we have today.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.610" offset="3688023">The second thing was a description of costs, pollution control technologies, feasibility, et cetera, and the '67 Act told the states that they were to conform their standards to both of those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.360" offset="3759076">Now in 1970, the Congress did two very significant things.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.727" offset="3780496">First of all, it gave, it made the requirement to set standards mandatory and upon EPA, that is, on a national basis, so we would have a national floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.244" offset="3826576">Then the second thing which is really significant to your question is that it separated out the two things that EPA was collecting and providing.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.754" offset="3864611">And it provided that EPA was to still do the criteria documents, but that the NAAQS, the national standards, would be based on those criteria documents only, and the Act provides that at the time that the criteria documents are issued, EPA shall also provide to the states and to Congress information about costs, implementation, and available control technologies so that they can use that information in the standard-setting process that this Court reviewed in Union Electric.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.555" offset="4155824">And if we look at coughing outdoor children we see with.09 in the air, approximately.9 of 1 percent of all the coughing outdoor children will cough and it will hurt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1045.727" offset="4332516">I do believe it is their main point, and it is... it fundamentally misconceives both what the Act requires and what every administrator since 1970 has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.591" offset="4372013">As I was saying before, when the administrator gets the decision, it gets a staff report validated by CASAC that shows the upper bound and lower bound of where a standard should be set based on the application to the latest scientific knowledge of the standard requisite to protect public health, and in this case, you gave the ozone standard, the standard was at the upper level.09 parts per million over an eight-hour period and at the lower level,.07.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.060" offset="4509835">Now, the question about why the administrator chose one number within that range is, of course, the question that the Court of Appeals under Section 307(b)(1) to which it will apply the arbitrary and capricious not in accordance with law standard that it has not yet done in this case, but I can articulate for you why both why no one thought the range should be below.07, that is regulating down to zero risk, and why the administrator chose.07 versus.08.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.437" offset="4651419">I'll start with the second first to make sure that I get to the salient point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.434" offset="4671376">.07 was, and this is reflected in the Federal Register notice promulgating the rule at pages 38863 to 38868.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.081" offset="4721949">.08 was chosen over.07 because one, there were no demonstrated adverse health effects below.08.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.551" offset="4763850">Two, the average responses, even at.08 were typically small or mild.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.506" offset="4799690">Three, the most certain effects at or below.08 were transient and reversible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.845" offset="4833022">Four,.07 is at or slightly above peak background levels in some locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.422" offset="4871370">And five, not one single member of CASAC recommended.07 and in the legal challenges in the Court of Appeals to the standard, no party has challenged the administrator's decision not to go to.07.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.595" offset="4940020">.07 was viewed by CASAC and the EPA staff as within the lower range because with respect to two of the six testable health effects or end points or lung function, that is, the ability to exhale, the volume you exhale in one second and symptoms, it was possible to extrapolate from studies done at and above.08 to levels all the way down to zero just by using an arithmetic extrapolation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.947" offset="6589391">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.113" offset="6626067">From what you have already heard this morning, it simply cannot be true that Congress intended for the administrator to make decisions which would cost nearly $50 billion annually by 2010, when the administrator herself frankly admits, and I'm quoting, that she followed no generalized paradigm in making these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.581" offset="6727945">Nor could Congress have intended for the administrator to regulate ozone and particulate matter by controlling combustion emissions from every automobile, factory, and commercial activity nationwide when again using her words, she never determined what risk is acceptable through quantification or any other metric, any other metric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.094" offset="6830031">This Court's decisions do not lightly presume that Congress delegated questions of such great economic and political significance to an administrative agency, nor as this Court said in Benzene, in the Benzene decision, do they allow an agency like EPA to regulate broadly across the entire economy without determining what risks are acceptable or unacceptable in an everyday common sense manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.020" offset="7021665">Because the prerequisite, the logically antecedent question for arbitrary and capricious review is an intelligible principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.481" offset="7055520">This Court has for 70 years said there must be an intelligible, substantive principle against which the rulemaking can be conducted, expert advice can be given, and judicial review can take place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.529" offset="7319775">And so it is true, I think, Justice Souter, to respond to your question, I do, just like General Waxman had to, I have to refer to the statute in talking about the intelligible principle and I will do so this morning in my discussion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.763" offset="7468673">--If I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.621" offset="7476092">First, we are saying that it is the Lead Industries line of cases that created the delegation problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.301" offset="7506812">We do argue that there is an intelligible principle in this statute that derives from public health, from requisite to protect the public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.082" offset="7545995">There are a number of other words in the statute which I may get time to deal with in my second argument but I want to focus right now on public health, because I think it brings clearly into focus what is missing from General Waxman's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.707" offset="7600434">General Waxman referred to medically significant risks and talked about the American Thoracic Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.116" offset="7638051">He's talking as if the statute said we want to protect personal health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.112" offset="7658113">That's not what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.887" offset="7665218">What the statute says is we want to protect public health, and that difference is terribly significant because let me explain what happened in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.060" offset="7697923">The Senate bill said we want to set national standards which will protect the health of persons, a term that was interchangeable in the previous Act with health of any persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.466" offset="7755497">The House had a bill that said, no, we want to protect public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.683" offset="7776395">Public health was a word that had been used consistently since 1955 in the statute and connoted just what, as we say in our briefs, public health does connote, which is a comprehensive cost included evaluation in order to reduce sickness and to improve longevity of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.445" offset="7871376">What the conference committee did is it accepted the House version, public health, which has a meaning which I'm going to be discussing further this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.809" offset="7912859">And what Mr. Waxman or what General Waxman has been doing this morning is referring to legislative history from the Senate bill from which he... not just he, I don't want to blame Mr. Waxman... but EPA has derived this notion of medically significant risks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.024" offset="7997705">I mean, that is as obvious or not obvious, one or the other, and this regime has been going on... Lead Industries was 1980, and this debate has been going on and yet when Congress made adjustments, it always made adjustments on the implementation end.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.825" offset="8136885">First of all, this is... the Congress has taken no action with respect to Section 109(b).</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward W. Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="2017.341" offset="8219014">But Congress has never, has never done anything to the central standard-setting provision, and it has never said anything which is different than what I'm saying about public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.425" offset="8255376">And I think for a very good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.115" offset="8262064">Let me just kind of put those cases in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.966" offset="8273453">I know that you had some role because you were in the Court of Appeals at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.463" offset="8291530">But Lead Industries involved a not very ubiquitous pollutant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.779" offset="8316712">Lead in the ambient air principally resulted from gasoline emissions which had already been regulated by EPA, and that case was tried very much as a technological feasibility case, not as a public health case such as we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.351" offset="8375017">There is no doubt that the standards there protected public health in the very sense that I'm talking about in my argument this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.722" offset="8412529">The problem with the decisions following Lead Industries, it's not that Lead Industries on those facts concerning the contentions being made in that case was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.010" offset="8449623">It is rather that the Court of Appeals then conflated the idea of technological feasibility with the question... separate question... of whether cost and other kinds of countervailing considerations can be taken into account in setting the standards in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.326" offset="8510958">Now, with respect... and let me go ahead and say here we are with the two most ubiquitous pollutants, ozone and particulate matter, where the regulatory scheme requires everything I said in my first moments of argument this morning where we are in the last mile, and all of a sudden the question which has been present all along in public health is now front and center.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.391" offset="8607194">Now, we talk about the implementation process here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.016" offset="8625688">I think two things are significant about what General Waxman had to say about this... that this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.339" offset="8647004">First of all, I think he is conceding logically that costs must play a role or else he wouldn't be making this argument about the implementation phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.908" offset="8689218">But he is misstating with all due respect what this Court's Union Electric decision said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.314" offset="8710847">What the Union Electric decision says is that the standards are set by EPA and they cannot be changed when EPA approves a state implementation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.220" offset="8758495">Those standards are set and whether they protect public health or not, they can't be changed in the implementation process.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2159.800" stopTime="2227.621">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2159.800" offset="8788797">But I think it is the case, number one, that the implementation process, may, and I presume does, consider economics when it determines the period of time in which compliance must be reached, and of course, Congress may do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.577" offset="8847938">And so that I think it's wrong on anybody's premises to say that economics is excluded from the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.813" offset="8888898">Now, it may very well be that if the cost is so horrendous, that there is... that there is no implementation period in which the cost would not be very great on an annual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.184" offset="8962354">In 20 years, it's still going to be enormously costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.619" offset="8972072">I think the Solicitor General's response to that, if I understand the briefs, is that, in effect, is the decision that Congress reserved to itself by periodically taking up the question of revising implementation standards as it has, as we are going to get to, I guess, in the next case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2227.621" offset="9060157">Justice Souter, if I may, this Court's decisions very clearly distinguish between feasibility analysis and cost/benefit analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.024" offset="9101744">Now, I will say, recognizing you said the opposite, cost in the sense of cost/benefit analysis can never be taken into account in the implementation process at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.624" offset="9148137">Those standards are set, and they can't be modified in the implementation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.225" offset="9194531">Then I think the government's answer would be Congress has set out the scheme which in effect reserves to Congress the right to revise implementation, and that's the point at which economics definitely will be given its place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.460" offset="9271435">But even on your kind of worst case argument, I think the government's response is that's what Congress wanted, and Congress has reserved to itself the power to interfere in the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2300.522" offset="9351683">What the Union Electric case says is that only the states can even look at these questions at implementation, and then they can only look at them and say who's going to bear the burden of the standards that are already set by EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.525" offset="9403719">I call it triage, but, I mean, I think you get the idea.</text>

            <text syncTime="2851.506" offset="11555687">EPA's promulgation of a revised ozone standard was unlawful because it conflicts with Congress' specific and comprehensive plan for ozone regulation found at subpart (2) of part (d) of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.707" offset="11612425">In 1990, Congress rewrote the law that applies to ozone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.999" offset="11629665">Congress rejected the old and failed one-size-fits-all approach to ozone attainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.026" offset="11653698">Congress implemented instead a comprehensive and unique scheme that combines realistic expectations with measures of progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.148" offset="11690269">EPA's position has changed repeatedly over the last few years, but there is no question the EPA intends to take us back to that failed approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.345" offset="11731021">For the states, that means a return to unrealistic deadlines, inflexible requirements, and certain failure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.265" offset="13334730">He did, Your Honor, and what he suggested was that once an area met the standard, that then EPA could change the standard for that specific area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.046" offset="13373809">That doesn't work with subpart (2) for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.390" offset="13387184">The first is that subpart (2) is a comprehensive scheme that applies nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.014" offset="13405678">The second is that Section 172 of the Act takes away EPA's general authority, not just general authority with the 1-hour standard, but its general authority for classifying areas and for setting deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.132" offset="13462207">The final reason is that subpart (2) itself in Section 181 refers to areas that are currently in attainment but may fall out of attainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.215" offset="13498465">There are specific provisions in place that would apply subpart (2), and specifically table 1, to those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.941" offset="13525424">There is simply no room left, whether now, in the future, until Congress acts to change the specific standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.538" offset="13555830">We've got an extraordinary case here where Congress balanced the interests, many of the interests that we're talking about this morning with respect to ozone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.743" offset="13592611">Congress got it right, and we're asking the Court to simply affirm the lower court's judgment that EPA may not implement the standard, but we are offering as an alternative basis that EPA cannot implement the standard because Congress gave it no authority to revise the standard in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.607" offset="13668052">Again, we need to look only specifically at Section 181, at the very first sentences, the sentence that provides that each area designated nonattainment for ozone shall be classified in accordance with table 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.832" offset="13732941">I would be remiss if I didn't state here that we won below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.835" offset="13748927">A majority of the D.C. Circuit agreed the EPA had no enforcement authority to enforce a different standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.842" offset="13781006">We are asking the Court to go one step further on alternative grounds, and that is that EPA cannot implement a different standard because it may not revise the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.123" offset="13822175">EPA's argument is that they cannot implement the standard because it becomes unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.612" offset="13844118">It's unworkable because Congress never anticipated that the 1-hour standard would be changed without congressional change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.498" offset="13875674">Just as the states and EPA, I may remind the Court that EP... this was EPA's bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.525" offset="13899706">This was the President's bill before Congress asking for certainty, asking for a specific standard, a specific set of classifications, and specific deadlines.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="3453.911" offset="13965326">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.966" offset="13977447">The state of Ohio is asking this Court to rule that the administrator may not revise national ambient air quality standards for ozone, and that even if she can revise them, that she cannot implement them either for primary or secondary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.427" offset="14047350">The District of Columbia Circuit held, in a judgment that no one petitioned from, that the clear language of the statute requires EPA to revise and, as appropriate, promulgate new standards for ozone, and that nothing in Section 181 in any respect impairs her ability to enforce the secondary standard, which is identical, and we think, therefore, that those questions are not properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.264" offset="14170648">What is before the Court is the question of whether, having resolved the legal question before it, which is the challenge to EPA's authority to revise and provide a new standard, the Court of Appeals acted properly in going beyond that and opining, based on some preamble language, to the new rule that EPA promulgated, that EPA could either not implement the new primary standard, or implement it only in conformity with subpart (2), which are the specific implementation provisions that Congress enacted in 1990 for the 1-hour ozone standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.933" offset="14365417">We think... we have two submissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.329" offset="14374926">First, there was... the Court of Appeals did not properly address the issue of how EPA will implement the new standard that it said it had authority to set, because EPA has not undertaken any final agency action to do so, and the time for doing so has not yet come.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.181" offset="14462384">Second of all, the question is, because it hasn't engaged in the notice and comment rulemaking about how to implement the 8-hour standard, the EPA has not... the Court of Appeals decision is perforce phrased in terms of such a high level of abstraction that not even any of the respondents can agree what the Court of Appeals meant when it said in its third try at this that EPA may implement the 8-hour standard only in conformity with subpart (2), and therefore we think that the Court of Appeals should not have reached this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.952" offset="14641479">The administrator will engage in notice and comment rulemaking specifying how the Act is to be implemented at the time that she promulgates the area designations that the states have provided to her and sets the schedule for what are called state implementation plans, and at that point she will have issued a rule and undertaken an action supported by an explanation that this, or the Court of Appeals could review.</text>
