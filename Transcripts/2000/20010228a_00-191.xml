            <text syncTime="53.297" offset="357843">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="58.890" offset="380204">Twenty-five years ago in Buckley this Court held that limits on campaign contributions can be more easily justified under the First Amendment than limits on campaign expenditures, and noted that a coordinated expenditure, such as one made at the candidate's request, is treated as a contribution for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.304" offset="465886">Nothing in the First Amendment requires an exemption from these rules for political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.559" offset="490859">Congress recognized that parties are different from other political actors and gave them somewhat higher contribution limits and much higher limits on coordinated expenditures.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="98.708" stopTime="125.215">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="98.708" offset="539446">I think that you do have a problem in sustaining this part of the congressional act because the basis for sustaining the limits on contributions is the corruption rationale that has been in our cases for, you know, 50, 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.299" offset="617814">But it's very difficult, at least for me to see how receiving a contribution would corrupt a political party.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_d_underwood" startTime="125.215" stopTime="179.288">
            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="125.215" offset="645504">Political parties present the risk... a risk of the corruption that justifies limits on contributions and coordinated expenditures in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.392" offset="690225">First, because they can receive contributions in much larger amounts than other actors and then redistribute them to candidates, they provide a conduit for other actors to circumvent the contribution limits of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.101" offset="756994">Other donors can make large contributions to the party which, though not technically, literally earmarked, and therefore not in violation of the specific earmarking provision of the statute, nevertheless through informal and well understood arrangements find their way through the party to the candidate and create the same risk or appearance of corruption as a direct contribution to the candidate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="179.288" stopTime="195.580">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="179.288" offset="861797">Well, if those informal arrangements are that actually this money is given to the party but we know you're going to give it to candidate X, certainly the Congress can prohibit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.100" offset="921043">Perhaps it already has.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_d_underwood" startTime="195.580" stopTime="253.607">
            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="195.580" offset="926999">Congress has prohibited earmarking, but the Court recognized in Buckley itself that a prohibition on earmarking cannot reach, cannot be effective to reach the whole problem of, in effect, using an intermediary to exceed the limits, and the reason is for one thing an earmarking arrangement requires something more rigid than what would usually happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.469" offset="1042460">I mean, it's not earmarking, for example, if... within the meaning of the statute, if a contributor understands that there is a good likelihood that the money will be passed by the party to the candidate, although there might be reasons why it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.750" offset="1107662">In that case it's not earmarking, but it still has the prospect of being regarded by the candidate and by the donor as virtually a contribution.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="253.607" offset="1159071">Let me get this straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.480" offset="1166594">I can understand why there's, you know, corruption if the donor gives the candidate money and there's a quid pro quo, the candidate says I'll vote for your bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.114" offset="1205046">But you allow individuals to spend $100,000 in their own advertising for this candidate, and it says at the bottom of the ad, you know, paid for by Schwartz, and the candidate knows Schwartz has bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of television advertising, that is perfectly okay, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_d_underwood" startTime="287.399" stopTime="288.301">
            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="287.399" offset="1294176">That's the distinction between--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="288.301" stopTime="319.852">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="288.301" offset="1297833">But if Schwartz gives $100,000 to the Democratic Party, we're suddenly worried that the candidate is going to be corrupted because Schwartz gave $100,000?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.666" offset="1339316">I can't understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.908" offset="1344227">That seems to me so fanciful to think that the one situation presents, you know, an opportunity for corruption and the other doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.203" offset="1381425">You're much better off if you want to corrupt Schwartz, spending the money on an advertisement that says presented, you know, presented by XYZ Corporation.</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_d_underwood" startTime="319.852" stopTime="358.157">
            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="319.852" offset="1424057">--Well, the Court in Buckley had to balance a number of different concerns in arriving at its distinction between independent expenditures, which will certainly often please the candidate, but which it regarded as sufficiently important in First Amendment terms so that limiting them to protect against possible indirect corruption was not permissible on the one hand, and contributions, direct contributions to the candidate, which the Court saw as having a lesser First Amendment component on... importance on one side--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="358.157" stopTime="358.567">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="358.157" offset="1577239">Right.</text>

            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="358.567" offset="1578911">--and a greater potential for corruption on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.920" offset="1588315">That distinction having been made, coordinated expenditures are the functional equivalent of contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.525" offset="1626767">When you pay somebody's bills, it's no different from handing them a check, and that's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.791" offset="1655815">Now, the additional point that I was addressing was the use of an intermediary to make the, that is, if we, if we have a prohibition on contributions and coordinated... not a prohibition, a limitation on contributions and coordinated expenditures to protect against corruption, then it can be easily circumvented through intermediaries, and there are only a few ways to solve the intermediary problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.131" offset="1777128">One of them is to limit contributions to the intermediary, in this case the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.246" offset="1801579">Another is to limit contributions by the intermediary to the candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.649" offset="1823208">That would be from the party to the candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.139" offset="1833239">And the third is to try to prevent earmarking directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.333" offset="1849957">Each has its pros and cons, and the statute uses each of them to some degree to complement the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.296" offset="1877856">This Court recognized in Buckley that it's impossible to police earmarking sufficiently because of informal and nonrigid arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.443" offset="1914428">The approach of limiting contributions to the party so that it can't operate as a pass-through, would starve the party of needed funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.790" offset="1951835">It has disadvantages of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.753" offset="1959672">There is a limitation, but it's a high limitation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="456.424" stopTime="478.329">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="456.424" offset="1970330">But what does the party use its limited funds for?</text>
            <text syncTime="459.657" offset="1983286">I mean, the whole purpose of a party is to support candidates, and to say that the party can't use its funds for candidates is to say that you know, parties don't... cannot play a significant part in American politics.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.507" offset="2106689">It is not clear to me that there is any less First Amendment value in people being able to band together in political parties and in unison support political candidates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.694" offset="6615424">The issue before the Court is whether this clear, direct, and substantial infringement on political parties' First Amendment rights is justified, and based on this Court's precedent, the legislative record, and the factual record developed in this lengthy case, the answer must be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.375" offset="6686163">The record demonstrates that this limit directly and substantially suppresses political party speech and does not prevent any discernible form of corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.443" offset="6730362">Moreover, this particular Federal limit stands in contrast to the majority of State laws which may restrict contributions to political parties, and contributions to candidates do not restrict the amount of party support that can be received by candidates themselves with State elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.269" offset="6893680">There used to be 20 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.090" offset="6904965">Three have repealed these restrictions, most recently Colorado last year and also our largest State, the State of California in November of 2000 had a referendum and over 60 percent of the voters of California supported that proposition, which was number 34, and that proposition placed numerous restrictions on contributions to candidates, contributions to political parties, but at the same time repealed a short-lived restriction that the State of California had on the amount of contributions or expenditures that parties could make in support of candidates for office in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.439" offset="7074343">The money that the parties can use to support their candidates for the House and the Senate and even for President has to be the so-called hard money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.434" offset="7114362">The District Court noted in its opinion that the majority of this so-called hard money that the national parties raise comes in sums of less than $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.111" offset="7161069">It is true that there are contribution limits that are somewhat higher for parties and for candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.196" offset="7185415">For my client, the Colorado Republican Party, that limit is $5,000 per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.931" offset="7208403">And for national party committees the limit on individuals is a maximum of $20,000 a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.008" offset="7256677">Now, if you win, and I guess this is their main rationale, what they're saying, if you win, to give a practical example, if you have a family of four, I guess candidate X who is running for the Senate, can take $4,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.347" offset="7318013">And then if you win, instead of $4,000, he could take $80,000 through the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.573" offset="7346957">All right, so if you assume a Senate race that costs $4 million, let's say, the difference would be between whether you had to find 50 willing donors with families or a thousand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.095" offset="7409024">So couldn't Congress conclude that where a Senator is dependent upon 50 families with $80,000 each, the appearance, anyway, that the Senator will be quite beholden to those 50 is far greater than where he must, in fact, get that $4 million from at least a thousand?</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.309" offset="7501915">Now, that it seems to me is what the government's argument boils down to, and they're saying we never know about these corruption things or the appearance, but the difference between fifty families and a thousand families is as good as any.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.081" offset="7700968">But if you win this, the limitation's gone, and therefore the first thing a candidate does is he says to the 50 people who know him the best, thank you for the four.</text>

            <text syncTime="2647.927" offset="10736292">Right now, there is actually a perverse effect of these limits, rather than preventing corruption, arguably, they are promoting corruption because the limits tell a party chairman or fund-raiser it really doesn't matter how much hard money you raise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.176" offset="11953285">Well, there is a very interesting reason for that, which goes back to when Congress devised the campaign finance system that this Court reviewed in the Buckley decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.360" offset="11994036">And the genesis of this particular limit was introduced in the United States Senate back in 1973 or 1974 at a time they were considering a bill which provided for no private contributions in general elections for the Senate or the House and that there was going to be completely publicly-financed and when they got to this public financing proposition, somebody got up and said, well, what about the parties?</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.950" offset="12104482">I mean, we have got to let them operate and they said, well, that's great, we're going to let them operate, but of course, our principal concern in addition to corruption is we want to equalize resources and we want to make sure that there is not excessive spending so we're going to devise this formula, which is more generous than we are providing to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.873" offset="12188073">In fact, it's generous exponentially because we're telling individuals and political committees they cannot contribute to these candidates at all, and that's the genesis of this limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.402" offset="12238228">We discussed that in 1996 before this Court that shows that historically this was a limit imposed to prevent excessive spending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.016" offset="12276681">This court noted it in the decision of FEC vs. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the plurality decision noted that congressional purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.063" offset="12720867">I believe that the rationale for this provision today is the original rationale, the entire statute, this provision was transferred verbatim after this Court's decision in Buckley from the criminal code of Title 18 into the existing statutory provision of Title 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.899" offset="12824207">And other than the report language that was noted in the Government's brief regarding the effect of this provision after Buckley, there is no other congressional utterance that I'm aware of regarding the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.161" offset="12889304">This really is a relic from Congress' effort to basically control spending in the entire political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.997" offset="12932668">There is one final point I would like to bring to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.099" offset="12953043">There has been discussion about Congress' treatment of family members and there is an intimation that perhaps there was no record or legislative record regarding Congress' actions in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.218" offset="13001526">We noted in our reply brief in 1996 that there is legislative record of concern back in 1974 about wealthy family individuals contributing to candidates of their family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.610" offset="13067042">There was even the example noted of concern that Nelson Rockefeller's mother had contributed one and a half million dollars to his campaign in 1968, and there are some floor statements by legislators as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.889" offset="13132139">So it is not accurate to say that Congress did not have any expression of concern about family members, as opposed to political parties, and that record was presented to this Court in Buckley when it considered all of those statutes at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.529" offset="13190757">I would also like to address the question about what is the definition of coordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.498" offset="13234643">That is in the statute, Section 441A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.300" offset="13257840">It does prohibit or it does turn an expenditure into a contribution if there has been a request or a suggestion, if there has been consultation with the candidate and I don't believe it's at all clear whether the Government would not restrict a political party's spending if they simply went to a candidate as suggested by Justice Scalia and said, well, will this help you or will this hurt you?</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.189" offset="13373406">There is some history of FEC enforcement that suggests that at least as far as the commission is concerned that would constitute coordination and therefore would be either subject to our limit or somehow barred under the contribution limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.730" offset="13435577">If there are no further questions, I have covered everything I intended to cover.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.589" offset="13486986">I just want to make a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.620" offset="13495136">The rationale for the party expenditure provision has always been a conduit theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.547" offset="13518855">The structure of the statute has changed, and so just exactly how the party could act as a conduit to evade whatever limits existed has changed, but right from the beginning, the concern was that the party could act to enable another donor to evade the limits by--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3365.028" stopTime="3370.191">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3365.028" offset="13604746">Well, you just said there is nothing in the legislative history, not one Senator, not one Congressman ever said anything like that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_d_underwood" startTime="3370.191" stopTime="3512.885">
            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="3370.191" offset="13625435">--Well, at pages 28 and 29 of our brief, we quote some legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.036" offset="13652811">I think my colleague discounts it because it was at a time when the structure of the statute was somewhat different so the evasion and the conduit that was possible was somewhat different but it was nevertheless then, and is now, aimed at preventing parties from enabling individuals to avoid their limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.492" offset="13754584">I mean, at page 28, Senator Matthias says that the point of this is to prevent an indirect contribution by a candidate... by a contributor to a candidate going through the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.515" offset="13822712">That was why the provision was in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.038" offset="13836818">The coordinated expenditures are like contributions and it was the premise of Buckley, over some objection to be sure, that they have a greater potential for corruption than independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.340" offset="13918006">That's true for parties and for political action committees, as well as for individuals, and it's true for fat cat contributors, as well as for small contributors, so the right that's being claimed here, the constitutional right here to unlimited coordinated expenditures is, in effect, a claim of right to unlimited contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.625" offset="13999091">The Colorado Republican Party isn't making that argument, but it seems to follow from their argument because parties... and the reason why, although parties are different from other kinds of actors in the system, they nevertheless need to be subjected to some limits, is precisely because, as intermediaries, they can serve to defeat the other limits of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.610" offset="14103058">A party has no more... that was a judgment Congress was entitled to make, not compelled to make, but entitled to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.695" offset="14127404">It solves a part of the problem but not the whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.266" offset="14137748">Political parties, though, have no more a constitutional right to exemption from limits on contributions than do political action committees and, in fact, Congress gave them much higher limits.</text>
