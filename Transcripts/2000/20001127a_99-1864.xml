            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="145450">We'll hear argument first this morning in number 99-1864, James B. Hunt versus Martin Cromartie, Alfred Smallwood versus Martin Cromartie.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.230" offset="198322">Mr. Dellinger.</text>

            <text syncTime="14.963" offset="205218">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.071" offset="217652">In the Shaw versus Reno line of cases this Court established two important propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.536" offset="243566">The first is that the Constitution does not tolerate using race as the predominant factor in drawing legislative districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.955" offset="277212">When a district is drawn predominantly on racial lines, the state reinforces harmful racial stereotypes.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.484" offset="307305">It sends a message to elected officials that they represent only a particular racial group.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.076" offset="329666">Those cases stand also for a second proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.714" offset="348265">As this Court said in Miller, Federal court review of districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.805" offset="392568">For this reason, the important second principle is that Federal courts adjudicating Shaw claims must exercise extraordinary caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.611" offset="443873">The decision below would severely compromise this second principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.344" offset="462786">That ruling is inconsistent with this Court's admonition.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="82.858" stopTime="94.993">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="82.858" offset="476787">Mr. Dellinger, are you suggesting that there is some different standard of proof of facts in these cases or that we should not review a factual determination of a clearly erroneous rule?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="94.993" stopTime="145.756">
            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="94.993" offset="525375">Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the decision below was clearly erroneous, and we're perfectly happy to meet the standard that the conclusions were clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.224" offset="562260">Because the court did not separate out findings of fact from conclusions of law, it is possible to read the opinion as if the court did not actually apply the standard, but requiring a predominance of race to be shown, in which case it would have applied the wrong legal standard, but taking them to have found that race predominated here, in our view that is clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.996" offset="661421">I only mean to suggest, as this Court has said in Bush v. Vera, and in Miller that because redistricting is such an exceedingly sensitive matter that the Court should be awfully cautious before they conclude that a state legislature--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="145.756" offset="728399">That could be true, but to continue the question that the Chief Justice asked, do we at bottom have to apply a clearly erroneous test here to the determination of the facts?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="159.843" stopTime="189.379">
            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="159.843" offset="784719">--Not if you find that when you read the District Court's opinion that the court simply wasn't applying a standard that required the court to conclude that race predominated and subordinated other conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.681" offset="852114">You can say, well, it did refer to the predominance test, but that's not what it was applying.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.945" offset="873221">The evidence that it adduced at best was evidence that was probative only of whether race was one of the factors that was considered here.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="189.379" stopTime="215.180">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="189.379" offset="902897">I frankly have some difficulty with your position in the case because it is possible that as a fact finder I would not have found the facts as the court below did, and yet the court below appears to have believed one expert over another and made findings that may have been within its power to make, and how are we to upset that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="215.180" stopTime="314.452">
            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="215.180" offset="1006132">Justice O'Connor, it takes a careful review because there is simply nothing probative underlying the conclusions of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.786" offset="1048555">We set out at pages 25 to 33 of our brief, we really have to go through the trial transcript citations, the court says, for example, that where splits occur in District 12 in the six counties between District 12 and the other districts, the splits invariably occur along racial rather than political lines, if that's a fact it will certainly tend to show predominance.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.119" offset="1145835">It's simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.322" offset="1154717">Neither the District Court nor the appellees point to a single instance of a split in which race trumps politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.350" offset="1190766">For example, in the plurality opinion in Bush v. Vera, you find that in that case the Texas redistricters, faced with precincts that were minorities, Hispanic or African-American, but where the precinct itself was majority Republican, went out and took that in, in order to bring in the minority group, even though that was contrary to the asserted goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.870" offset="1300898">That's set out at page 917 of Bush v. Vera.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.478" offset="1319288">There is simply no instance of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.992" offset="1329319">The two big items of proof... I am quite confident that reversing the court below and sustaining the North Carolina plan will not in any way impair the vitality of this Court's antiracial gerrymandering principle either on--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="314.452" stopTime="336.679">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="314.452" offset="1403194">You can say that about any number, no one single decision would affect a stream of decisions, but, you know, you've got factual findings here, and if they're supported by some evidence, even though, as Justice O'Connor said, perhaps we would not have made those findings, they're not clearly erroneous.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="336.679" stopTime="470.392">
            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="336.679" offset="1492114">--Let me go to explain why those findings are clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.864" offset="1516879">Let me give you one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.098" offset="1525760">The court says that... or the appellees say, the courts say that this is completely consistent with race and not with politics, the appellees walk away from that and say that the lines are more precisely correlated with race than with politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.404" offset="1591066">What do they cite for that?</text>
            <text syncTime="362.980" offset="1597336">They cite for that the proposition that of the six counties, these six counties take in... District 12 takes in 90 percent of the 40 percent or more African-American precincts in the six counties, 90 percent, whereas if you look at the Democratic counties, even as measured by reliable voting day Democrats, only about half of the Democratic counties... I'm sorry, only about half of the Democratic precincts in the six counties are taken in.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.420" offset="1723037">That was their proof that the lines follow race more precisely than politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.732" offset="1740278">But look at those figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.996" offset="1749368">They're set out in Exhibit 309 on page 515.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.229" offset="1766296">There are 429 precincts in these six counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.821" offset="1784686">Of those 429 precincts, 79 of them are 40 percent or more African-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.397" offset="1811017">Understandably, those are the most reliable Democratic voting precincts, and therefore they form the core of a difficult attempt to create a Democratic congressional district in this Republican area.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.250" offset="1878413">So 76 of the 79 African-American precincts which are the most reliable Democratic precincts are included in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.169" offset="1914044">Now, there are another 300... another 290... there 290 precincts, including those that are Democratic, about half of those are included within the district, but there's no need for any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.177" offset="1974126">The ones that aren't included would, A, blow this district way past the equal population point and, B, they are less reliable Democratic than the 76 African-American precincts included.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="470.392" offset="2026998">Dr. Weber was asked was there any majority black district or precinct, precinct, that conceivably could be included in this district that was not included, and he said, rather astonishingly, no.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="483.964" stopTime="532.742">
            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="483.964" offset="2081228">That is correct, and he also gave the following answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.681" offset="2104111">He talked about how there were... and Justice Kennedy, the reason that makes sense, that all the African-American precincts that could reasonably have been included are included is that those are the core Democratic precincts in what is basically a Republican area of North Carolina in the Piedmont Carolinas, so that is naturally the core that is the overlap, and that is the correlation.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.030" offset="2197525">There are other Democratic precincts, Dr. Weber noted, that are not included, and he was asked the following question at page 140 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.058" offset="2241620">Question: Are the white precincts as heavily Democratic?</text>
            <text syncTime="528.712" offset="2260219">Answer: No.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.009" offset="2269414">So that--</text>

            <text syncTime="590.874" offset="2508905">Instead of using racially encoded census blocks, they used precinct voting day election patterns.</text>

            <text syncTime="799.744" offset="3344405">That was the use of race, and it is also the case that when in most all instances, perhaps not every, that a state undertakes to make race drive the process, there will be plenty of evidence of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.567" offset="3407621">For example, you will find areas where, as in Bush v. Vera, if you have a, say, a Republican district that has a significant number of minorities in it, you put it in a supposedly Democratic district, so that shows it following race.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.485" offset="3459344">That's how you prove it.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.438" offset="3467181">Mr. Dellinger, there is some evidence here, I mean, besides Senator Cooper's statement, which, you know, you offer an alternate explanation for, but you have to explain it, and once it becomes debatable, it's hard for us to say that the finding of the court below was clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.226" offset="3546279">Another thing that has to be explained away is, is the E-mail, Cohen to Cooper, as part of the legislative exchange which refers to Greensboro black, that portion of Greensboro at one of the two ends of this salamander, and referring to those districts from Greensboro as simply Greensboro black.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.795" offset="3648575">Now, you say that's just shorthand for those portions of Greensboro that were reliably Democratic.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.651" offset="3675951">Maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.839" offset="3680758">But certainly the other interpretation is a reasonable one as well, in which case it becomes evidence that predominantly they were trying to put together a district that had predominantly black voters in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="895.973" offset="3729241">--Let me suggest why I think that is really utterly insufficient as being really probative, to set aside a fundamental act of political self-definition by a state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.047" offset="3777620">This is a sentence in an E-mail from a staffer to members that says that in the districting context where they have to talk about race because of the Voting Rights Act, he notes that the change he has been making is that they're now going to for very good nonracial reasons include Greensboro in District 12, the Democratic parts of Greensboro, and refers to that by saying, I have moved the Greensboro black community into the 12th.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.052" offset="3885558">Now, I am not going to tell you that that is without any probative value, but in order for it to play any significant role in invalidating a state law, you have to conclude first of all that it's not merely descriptive, it's not like saying what are these new precincts the legislature has, so this is a working class Italian neighborhood and the other new precinct in your district is a Jewish retirement community.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.934" offset="3969150">No, it is... you have to read it as being an explanation of the motive for the move, and you would have to assume that you attributed that to the whole legislature, not to the staff or to the two recipients, and you have to assume that that would be evidence of the predominance of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.678" offset="4032157">I simply don't think it will bear that kind of weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.770" offset="4044487">A stray remark like this, to use a stray remark like this would be akin to a stringent speech code where legislators who engage in the sensitive redistricting process find state law brought into jeopardy, and that's why there's very good reason for predominance.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.091" offset="4113763">The other way to prove a Shaw violation, if I may turn just for a moment to Justice Kennedy's question, the other way to prove a Shaw violation is quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.228" offset="4150335">When the state says we're using politics, not race, it turns out that there are a lot of high proportion of African-Americans, that's because they're reliable Democrats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.350" offset="4190772">You can often come in and show, now, wait a minute, there would be a very easy way, more sensible district that you could have created here that would have been reliably Democratic, and this 1 that runs through 6 counties is completely unnecessary to accomplish that goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.905" offset="4260990">The different district has to be more central.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.564" offset="5679648">The District Court also found, and I quote, Dr. Weber showed that, not just in his opinion, showed that without fail Democratic districts adjacent to District 12 yielded their minority areas to that district, retaining quite Democratic precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.165" offset="5750074">And of course this would be an important finding if it were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.102" offset="5765852">It would be very much like Vera where there was exchanging of Hispanic and African-American communities by census block back and forth, but that didn't happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.081" offset="5817679">There's no evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.081" offset="5821754">In fact, there's only one Democratic precinct of the five that surround District 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.797" offset="5844637">That's District 8, which is separated from District 12 by the county line between Cabarrus and Mecklenburg County.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.587" offset="5895732">So that is an important finding, we submit, that the court made which is simply not supported by the record and is clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.101" offset="5929796">I would point out that in choosing between Dr. Weber and Dr. Peterson, it said that Dr. Peterson's evidence was unreliable because it ignored the core, but this Court said in Vera that the difference between areas just inside and just outside the district is particularly probative in this sort of case, and that's exactly what Dr. Peterson did, but that's what Dr. Weber criticized him for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.416" offset="6051109">I would like to address an argument advanced by appellees that was relied on by the court below, but they offer it here in support of the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.161" offset="6101995">They say that the district, 12th District in 1997 plan is an inadequate remedy because it overlaps too much with the population and geography of the former 1992 district in that it gives Congressman Mel Watt a good chance for reelection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.477" offset="6831334">At the outset, let me suggest this, in the last arguments, I heard some description of what was said by the court, and I would request that the Court at a later time look at the argument of opposing counsel and match it up with the opinion of the court below, and I would suggest there was very little resemblance between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.187" offset="6918165">So that... that needs to be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.375" offset="6934883">Secondly, I think it's very important that near the end of the opinion of the court in the previous appeal of this case, it was pointed out that this case was to be remanded to a court which was familiar with the circumstances and would be in a better position to assess the motives of the General Assembly than would be true of a Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.270" offset="7030492">Now, this Court set... the District Court sat there for two-and-a-half days and heard testimony, they heard testimony from experts, they heard other testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.328" offset="7074691">Pursuant to the authority that they have under Rule 52A, they assessed credibility, and unfortunately for the appellants, they didn't believe the appellants' witness, and fortunately for us, they believed our witnesses.</text>

Bush is that one of the persons involved there was a lady who was in Congress who was utilizing race as incumbency protection, and there was held unconstitutional, so I think to whatever extent incumbency protection is involved in this context, it would be unconstitutional for many of the reasons that Justice Scalia has stated, the derivation, but also because in deciding to protect the incumbent, that was really subsidiary to the primary purpose of creating a racially predominant--</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.404" offset="7711034">So there doesn't seem to be any question in that regard, but the real problem is that in this instance, as the facts demonstrate and the statistics are part of the facts, what was done by the legislature was to take away more of the geographic area of the 12th District than any of the other prior districts, but to retain the racial core.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.065" offset="7809672">Now, you find that of the people who are in the 12th District in the 1997 plan as compared to the '92 plan, 90 percent of the African-Americans were there before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.544" offset="7863589">On the other hand, with respect to the white portion of the population, less than 50 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.761" offset="7896399">If you look at... there are two maps here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.791" offset="7908519">If you look at them you'll find that although they are parallel, there has been some change of territory with respect to precincts that are predominantly white.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.615" offset="7955853">There was none with respect to the core, the racial core.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.270" offset="7970482">We find the legislature was using phrases, the leaders of the legislature were using phrases like racial balance and core, which in this context was a clever way of trying to say we have reserved a district where it is almost certain that an African-American--</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.650" offset="8067971">Proving the racial motivation was predominant, then you've got to have strict scrutiny to see if it was justifiable and all the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.459" offset="8099213">Now, why is it, I just have been a little puzzled about the case, this was proved with respect to both the 1st and the 12th Districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.145" offset="8129933">With respect to the 1st, which was even more racially dominated, as I understand it, than the 12th, the court said that's okay, but not with respect to the 12th.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.968" offset="8185313">--I might note two circumstances in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.044" offset="8201613">First, the court did find that both in the 1992 and the 1997 1st District, race had predominated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.103" offset="8241842">Secondly, they gave statistics as to the 12th District which recognizes that it is one of the I think five least compact districts in America, while on the other hand, in terms of geographical compactness, the 1st District had been remedied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.985" offset="8309342">Then frankly, as I understand it, Your Honor, it was not a matter of the motive, it was a matter of strict scrutiny that save the 1st District, they found there had been a compelling interest primarily I believe to get preclearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.659" offset="8435984">We chose not to appeal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.206" offset="8442253">But by the same token, there is much more logic as to the 1st District in terms of the area involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.266" offset="8474436">A lot of counties there are over 40 percent African-American in population in the northeastern part of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2093.434" offset="8519158">Here, on the other hand, you're dealing with a district where less than 30 percent of the population in any of the six counties is African-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.929" offset="8565133">We're unlike any other district in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.053" offset="8581643">They split six counties, and every county was split.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.946" offset="8709225">You concede that by saying each substitution affects the compactness and appearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.043" offset="13401548">Well, it depends what you mean by handful, particularly in the context of large cities where they're glued together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.197" offset="13426208">In Charlotte, in Winston-Salem, and in Greensboro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.491" offset="13451390">I believe there was testimony by Dr. Weber that he had looked at all three aspects... he looked at the three elections which had been considered by the General Assembly and were before them, and came to the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.970" offset="13509277">This was all grouped under party affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.468" offset="13523279">So he certainly came to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.264" offset="13530488">The Court may have pointed out simply a few that were left out, and maybe there were only a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.465" offset="13555252">But there was a lot of evidence that was generated by Dr. Weber that concerned the primacy of race as a motive over politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.179" offset="13602064">So I think, if you look at it in context, Your Honor, and look at the other things, look at some of the statements in the record, look at what we termed the smoking gun, the E-mail, look at the testimony of the legislators whom we called and other persons whom we called, when you take all that together, it seems to us just unmistakably clear that this Court which was familiar with the circumstances and which was familiar with the motives of the workings of the General Assembly came to a permissible conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.853" offset="13740826">One other thing that deserves note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.447" offset="13747200">Given the use of pretext, and the Court found that one of the persons on one aspect of testimony was simply not credible, you have a very significant circumstantial evidence, maybe it's more than that, the use of pretext, as I recall from the Reeves case that was decided this summer can itself be positive evidence of a particular state of mind, and we would submit that the pattern followed by the State in terms of concealment, excuses, and it's a pattern that continues from the past in respect to the 1992 plan, that this in itself is evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.132" offset="13917937">You take the whole thing, you look at what they were doing with the 1st District where they were concentrating on percentages, you look at the district here, District 12, where it was announced to the Senate by Senator Cooper that as long as they were under 50 percent they were home free, and then look at the way they increased the percentages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.714" offset="14036219">Mr. Chief Justice, if you look at the map and with some understanding of the demographics of North Carolina, you can see that the bipartisan legislature faced a difficult task in attempting to create a sixth Democratic-leaning congressional district in this part of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.550" offset="14107586">One of the joys of North Carolina is that we don't have a big metropolitan area like Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.440" offset="14123154">We have a nice string of more medium-sized cities, from Charlotte running through.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.921" offset="14161084">--It's getting too big for my taste, but it's... but the... they accomplish this in every instance by creating districts, one for the Republican Sue Myrick in Mecklenburg county and one for the Democrat Mel Watt, each a rising star.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.272" offset="14242482">Their expert thought Mecklenburg should be entirely within one district, but Charlotte is very happy to have rising stars in each party represent Charlotte, and neither of the political parties wanted to cede Charlotte to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.016" offset="14301414">So you really have an expert who is making political judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.170" offset="14318028">This case may be your final opportunity to address redistricting before the 2000... post-2000 redistricting occurs, and I think it's worth asking again why is predominance the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.087" offset="14369750">The Court has consistently rejected the idea that any consideration of race, however small, should trigger strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.601" offset="14391798">That's properly because of the nature of the Shaw harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.350" offset="14406844">The Shaw harm is not hostility towards individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.818" offset="14416666">It is communication of a message that people are defined by their race, and when race predominates, you have the Shaw harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.018" offset="14445506">To move to a more extreme exclusion of race would create a hair trigger in which legislatures would be completely uncertain of their ability to legislate. We'll have judges creating election districts and rather than state legislatures doing this critically important task that involves political judgment, we usually say plans that do not cause expressive harms should not be declared unlawful.
