            <text syncTime="17.090" offset="215387">There are two points that I would like to make this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.569" offset="225314">The first is that it is never appropriate for a branch of the Federal Government to imply the creation of a private right of action under the spending power.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.055" offset="267214">The second is that, regardless of the participation of the State as a defendant in this case, the Court's implied right-of-action doctrine does not extend to these disparate effect regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.141" offset="319564">Let me start with the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.204" offset="327818">In case after case over the last two to three decades the Court has made clear that States are not run-of-the-mill civil defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.999" offset="363031">They are not mere interest groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.144" offset="371600">They are coequal sovereigns and, as a result, the Court has not lightly inferred that Congress means to regulate the States as States, to regulate in core areas of local sovereignty, or, as here, to expose the States to a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.894" offset="442548">Those principles are particularly critical when it comes to the spending--</text>

            <text syncTime="88.444" offset="500749">Exactly, Your Honor and, of course, the Eleventh Amendment applies even to injunctive relief and even, as this particular case reveals, you can still alter the Federal-State balance by allowing private rights of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.416" offset="548710">Indeed, in Cannon, the Court distinguished a case not unlike this one on just this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.617" offset="569503">In Cannon, in footnote 13, the Court reviewed many of the implied right-of-action cases it had decided, and it looked at a case called Santa Clara Pueblo, a case in which the Court had not implied a right of action against a tribe, and for that... and the reason it did not imply a right of action was because tribes are sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.193" offset="643795">Now, they're statutory sovereigns, whereas States are constitutional sovereigns.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.908" offset="658633">Mr. Sutton, do I understand what you just told us to mean that if the Cannon case had been against the State medical school instead of against a private university there would have been no claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="141.737" offset="713908">I think that's right, and it would have been... of course, it's an even harder claim here, because this claim is under regulations, which is something the Court has never inferred before from congressional actions.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="151.108" offset="751420">That's a different point, but I wanted to know how sweeping your position is, and you are saying that if Cannon had been against the University of Illinois instead of the Medical School of the University of Chicago, it would have been thrown out?</text>

            <text syncTime="164.483" offset="804919">That's exactly what I'm saying, Your Honor, and I think that's true, and that is our first principal point.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.941" offset="822787">And I think, Your Honor, it follows from all of the cases... I mean, whether you look at Gregory v. Ashcroft, Atascadero, or South Dakota v. Dole, Pennhurst, all of those cases made clear, when you alter the Federal-State balance Congress has to be unmistakable in what it's doing, and in this case it was anything but unmistakable.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.510" offset="901049">Everyone agrees--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="189.253" offset="903975">Cannon itself said that's... as far as implied rights of action it said, we come from a past when Congress was reacting to the courts' activity and knew that the courts were implying private rights of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.311" offset="968236">I thought Cannon said, this much but no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.944" offset="982760">Congress, we're now putting you on notice that henceforth we are not going to imply private rights of action, but we understand that Cannon comes from a different milieu, and we're going to... not going to change that.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.798" offset="1046186">The Court... the only case that's been identified so far by respondents involving what seems to be an oxymoron, implied right of action against the State, is the Allen case from 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.488" offset="1088922">That was not a Spending Clause case, point number 1, but point number 2, more importantly, that's a case that falls under this case's... this Court's decisions, specifically Atascadero, where you can have an overwhelming implication in the statute that a right of action was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.554" offset="1149213">In Allen, had there not been a right of action, the individuals would not have been able to enforce other parts of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.810" offset="1182231">That case is not a classic implied right-of-action case where there's no suggestion in the statute that Congress meant to create a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.356" offset="1216400">In this case, it's just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.008" offset="1222982">Here, Congress did create a right of action, just not by private individuals, by agencies, so you said my first proposition is a sweeping one, and perhaps it is, but there are not a lot of cases recognizing the implied right-of-action doctrine against States.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.817" offset="1286303">I mean, that's not something the Court has been doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.499" offset="1536974">I mean, to quote him at page 246, given their constitutional role, the States are not like any other class of recipients of Federal aid.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.776" offset="1678140">But I do want to go back to, I think a premise in your question, which is that this argument is somehow sweeping because there are lots of other civil rights statutes where somehow there would not now be a right of action against the State, and we're concerned about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.211" offset="1723802">I don't think that's true, however.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.022" offset="2383133">You are right, after 1986, when it comes to Section 504, Title IX and Title VI, the argument's not sweeping at all when it comes to the antidiscrimination mandate, because, as respondents have argued, in 1986 Congress picked up on the dialogue and said, we are going to create an express right of action, so when it comes to intentional discrimination, that which is barred by Title VI or Title IX, there is a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.542" offset="2481144">But the critical failing with that particular argument, and I think that's why it's really not being relied upon by respondents, is Congress says nothing at all about rights of action under regulations, which you know, after all, is an extraordinary concept.</text>

            <text syncTime="2092.159" offset="8515639">The Court has addressed that question on several occasions, in Morning v. Family Publications Service with regard to the truth-in-lending law, and in Gemsco v. Walling, a 1946 decision with regard to the minimum wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.968" offset="8578855">Both cases involved prohibitions containing regulations which clearly went beyond the language of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.707" offset="8601843">Both cases, they were upheld by this Court, and Gemsco again was the prevailing law at the time the Congress authorized regulations in 602, so it seems to me that's appropriate to look to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.544" offset="8653147">With regard to the argument regarding the limitations on the preconditions for certain actions under Section 602, this Court has addressed that question already in Cannon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.477" offset="8724932">It's important to note here that Congress clearly intended that the limitations in Section 602 on an agency action would apply in a discriminatory intent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.317" offset="8768295">Indeed, the... that was a particular focus... intentional commission was a particular focus in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.254" offset="8795985">The one thing that's certain is that Congress didn't intend to permit an agency to cut off a State agency or a city agency or a private entity from Federal funding without going through all the loops set up in Section 602.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.423" offset="8848648">That is to say, Section 602 applies even where we're dealing with a Section 601 violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2553.096" offset="10359361">First of all, the implication of drawing the kind of distinction that's been suggested here has very, very broad ramifications beyond enforcement of civil rights statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2791.100" offset="11311368">--Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.412" offset="11320667">What we have on our side is, I believe, a completely unbroken practice of enforcing obligations under both the Spending Clause and otherwise equally, whether they arise within the four corners of the statute, or under substantive regulations that are mandated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.043" offset="11407185">Now, I understand that this... that our position puts great weight on the validity of these regulations, but that point, as the court of appeals noted, was expressly conceded by the State below, and we don't think that it's at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.133" offset="11475521">With respect to the implication of a, an implied private right of action against a State official, which was Mr. Sutton's first point, Mr. Schnapper cited some of the cases under Title VI and its cognate statutes, but I think it's also important to recognize not only the long line of 1983 cases, many of which enforce Spending Clause statutes and their regulations in injunctive action, but also the point that Justice Kennedy made in his dissent in Golden State Transit for himself and Justice O'Connor and the Chief Justice, which is that there may be instances in which a healthy disagreement may arise as to whether a particular provision of Federal law creates a right, privilege, or immunity, but when what is being sought is injunctive relief, prospective relief only against a State official, the courts have long recognized a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause, Sections 1331 and 2201, including in Spending Clause cases which we have cited and discussed probably too briefly in footnote 12 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.152" offset="11787632">Cases like Blum v. Bacon and Lead-Deadwood are Spending Clause cases... Blum was, even involved a regulation... in which a suit was brought by a private party against the State official saying, look, the State has a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.151" offset="11859626">It's reflected in a regulation or a statute that operates in a manner that's inconsistent with Federal law and therefore it is preempted, and the background principle, the principle of law, I respectfully submit, that Mr. Sutton is advocating runs directly contrary to the particular cases we cited under Title VI and its cognate statutes and 1983, but also this more underlying, long line of cases that includes but goes well beyond Spending Clause precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.674" offset="12009673">Our position fundamentally in this case is that for 25 years, it is true, Mr. Chief Justice, there is not a holding directly on point that says, you may have a private right of action to enforce the Title VI regulations, but there... for 25 years at least there has been a shared understanding among the three branches, reflected in a unanimous set of, body of case law from the federal courts, from successive congressional enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.423" offset="12152720">In addition to the attorney's fees amendment, the Rehabilitation Act amendments, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act, Congress has enacted 11 cognate civil rights statutes in which the funding agencies are expressly directed to promulgate regulations patterned after those under Title VI, all against a backdrop in which, at least since Lau v. Nichols and running up to the present, implied rights of action against State public agencies and other public agencies have been adjudicated, and the executive branch across administrations... I've pulled out briefs filed on behalf of the United States by my predecessors, Robert Bork and Rex Lee, explaining to the Court that the implied private right of action to enforce these cases, and I believe that the former one was in Alexander, which was a case against a State, are important for the... an important complement to Federal enforcement officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.719" offset="12417915">Our brief in Darrone said, quote, the award of individual relief to a private litigant who has prosecuted her own suit is not only sensible but is fully consistent with and, in some cases, even necessary to the orderly enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.501" offset="12493043">If there are no further questions, we'll submit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.046" offset="12527211">A few brief points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.216" offset="12543825">In terms of the question of what vantage point the Court uses in looking at this issue, there are many cases from the eighties and nineties where the Court has not looked to the date on which the statute was enacted for determining whether it's an applied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.673" offset="12597742">Touche-Ross, involving the 1934 Securities Act, is the very same statute that Borak involved, and it didn't look back in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.475" offset="12628880">It followed what the Court was doing at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.499" offset="12637030">The true is... the same is true of Transamerica, California v. Sierra Club, and Northwest Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.495" offset="12656987">Even Cannon itself applied the Court v. Ash test which came 4 years after Title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.902" offset="12678617">Now, as for the question whether Guardians has resolved this, the last thing that Guardians resolved was the question of whether there was an applied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.415" offset="12708710">Even if one allowed for the counting of dissents and plurality votes, you only had two justices agreeing there was an implied private right of action in Guardians, so that surely was not decided there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.932" offset="12754685">And the notion that pre-1983 there were settled expectations on this point can't possibly be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.105" offset="12787391">Look at Justice Marshall's opinion in Guardians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.077" offset="12799302">Footnote 1 identifies the split in lower court authority on the very question the Court tried to resolve but didn't, so that doesn't seem possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.590" offset="12829395">As far as the preemption cases that the Federal Government is relying on, I think it's footnote 11 or 12 in its brief, that's a very different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.559" offset="12861265">The question of whether a properly promulgated rule would preempt State law is one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.472" offset="12880909">It's a second issue whether a private individual can enforce it.</text>
