            <text syncTime="91.105" offset="516290">This case involves the State action status of the regulatory conduct of a high school athletic association, the respondent, the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association, or what we call the TSSAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.619" offset="582327">Under the analysis of this Court's decision in NCAA v. Tarkanian, State action exists in this case because first, the regulatory conduct of the TSSAA is attributable to the entity or entities that control the organization and, secondly, Government institutions, in this case public schools, control the TSSAA's conduct and are therefore constitutionally accountable for its regulatory conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.777" offset="762990">Now, do you disagree with the court of appeals on those points, or do you think we should simply expand the State action concept?</text>

            <text syncTime="160.019" offset="791934">Mr. Chief Justice, the court of appeals did not look at the local level interactions between the TSSAA and the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.927" offset="823594">It looked exclusively at the State-level relationships, and so we think it overlooked the core ingredients of the Tarkanian analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.979" offset="855777">It was the local-level interconnections.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.867" offset="867376">There are two levels of State interaction with the TSSAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.787" offset="883049">At the State level, the State Board of Education for 24 years explicitly designated this organization as its agent to regulate interscholastic athletics for all schools in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.791" offset="935085">That was repealed, or changed in 1996, and now it recognizes, continues to recognize the role of the TSSAA and specifically authorizes the schools to maintain their membership in the TSSAA and the court of appeals focused exclusively on that State-level relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.481" offset="1013766">Under the Tarkanian analysis, Your Honor, the local levels, the public schools that control this organization, that comprise 84 percent of the membership, where there's one school, one vote, control the organization and under the Tarkanian analysis we think the--</text>

            <text syncTime="264.893" offset="1211461">This is... case is unlike many of this Court's other cases, such as Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, involving a school, Blum v. Yaretsky, involving a nursing home, Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison, involving a private utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.632" offset="1270393">In all of those circumstances, Justice O'Connor, the privateness, if you will, the formal privateness of the organization was assumed, and the question was whether the Government as purchaser, or Government as regulator, transformed that private, concededly private entity into State actor status.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.927" offset="1339565">In this case, that very threshold question is what is at stake.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.072" offset="2148212">I think in this case the public officials are serving because of their relationship to the school, because they are the principals in the school, and the clearest example of that is in the constitutional provision of the TSSAA regarding vacancies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.865" offset="13955350">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.893" offset="13979487">The TSSAA has been very candid in stating the breadth of its position, but I'd like to point out on page 32 of its brief their position seems to be that even a coach who is a public school teacher and a public school official is not a State actor, so their position is that extracurricular activities are so outside of the scope of public accountability that even if there is a decision by a coach about a decision affecting athletic contests, that that does not fall within State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.246" offset="14148865">The other... another point on the question of control, in the joint appendix at page 89 and page 92 it makes it pretty clear that the principals are representatives of the school in voting on the legislative council and on the board of control, and joint appendix 89 and 92 sets that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.825" offset="14239144">And finally, I would like to just indicate, we haven't talked about the existing state of the law, but this circuit, the Sixth Circuit decision is the only decision that finds a comparable institution not to be a State actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.287" offset="14309047">This case is an outlier in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.714" offset="14322736">The law has been settled for over 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.686" offset="14334647">Some of the concerns that the respondent has I think have not been manifested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.092" offset="14356277">The way that the courts have dealt with the issue of reviewing decisions of these associations is through a proper level of deference on a matter of substantive law, and so if the Court affirms below it will be unsettling what has been settled law in every jurisdiction that has heard this case for 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.328" offset="14433181">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
