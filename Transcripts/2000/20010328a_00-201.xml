            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="188005">The parties on both courts below agree on at least two things, first, that section 201(c) represents a compromise that assures freelance authors that they may control and exploit their individual contributions to collective works like newspapers and magazines in new anthologies and serializations and screenplays and other derivative works unless they've expressly transferred that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.993" offset="308691">The parties are also agreed as are both courts below that 201(c) assures the publication of collective works that the publisher of such collective works has the aggregate right to publish any article in the collective work both in publishing the collective work itself of course, but also in publishing that article, quote, as part of any revision of that collective work, again unless there has been an express transfer of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.064" offset="444946">Now the principal impetus for this measure was a rather strong wish to undo several quite notorious rulings like that of the Southern District of New York in the Geisel case in 1968 which of course involved the legendary Dr. Seuss and denied him the right to stop the unauthorized distribution of toy dolls that were derived from cartoons that he had published decades earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.882" offset="552257">There is no hint at all in the history of this measure and I think no hint in the way it's written that microfilm, for example, which had been in use for some 40 years at the time this measure was passed and which people used to make copies of individual articles more often than to make copies of entire cumbersome periodicals was seen by anyone as a problem to be addressed or solved by 201(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="378.043" offset="1652848">I think it's a kind of belief in magic that leads some people to think that if there's an inequity of bargaining power it will be solved by creating two estates rather than one.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.934" offset="1696420">In fact, in the mid 1980s it's interesting that the respondents went to Congress, the National Writers Union went to Congress and tried to get a measure much more modest than this one, a measure that would say that when there is a demonstrable inequity in bargaining power, an unconscionable arrangement, and when that's shown by individualized proof there could be a transfer of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.318" offset="1797984">Here they want a wholesale, global transfer which I don't think is necessarily going to change anything for the future but could have very serious impact on existing writings whose authors and heirs and assigns are going to be extremely difficult to locate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.103" offset="7177119">The statute couldn't be clearer, we believe, in the proposition that the collective works copyright owner has no copyright in the individual article in these free-lance situations where there is the separate author copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.205" offset="7293520">It seems to us that the clearest lesson from that is that if the publisher were in print terms to publish reprints of individual articles and treat them separately that would be an infringing action, the publisher would be exploiting the article as an article and without any authorization.</text>

            <text syncTime="3524.356" offset="14238121">Let me first say very clearly it is not the case that these newspapers disaggregate something and break it down to facilitate copyright violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.247" offset="14285664">It is disaggregated from the word go, that is, when they put together the computer text file that's going to go to the printer they do it article by article because as it happens, that's what goes into a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.006" offset="14340730">That exact text, and you'll see it unmistakably in the record, is exactly what is sent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.945" offset="14376466">Well, sometimes indexing codes, but not only for articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.497" offset="14390676">You've got to be able to find this stuff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.314" offset="14397991">You can't just wander around inside a computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.933" offset="14408440">And it is the readers guide to periodicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.385" offset="14422232">That's what we've got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.437" offset="14426516">Whether it is in written form or in index form, it's the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.889" offset="14444280">So point one, they don't deliberately disaggregate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.943" offset="14460476">Point two, if you look at 349 A of the joint appendix, that's one of many places, I just happened to find this one, where they say they're not claiming any contributory or vicarious liability with respect to infringements by end users.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.452" offset="14518572">Their whole theory was putting this stuff in the way that the 20th and 21st centuries has to do it is an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.991" offset="14556711">It's really a quite Luddite theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.093" offset="14565070">Their distinction with microfilm is that microfilm is a piece of something, you can see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.812" offset="14587953">Well, what about the CD-ROM, then?</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.864" offset="14596208">You can't see it except with a machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.199" offset="14605507">It just looks like it might be Joan Baez singing, but it turns out it's got volume upon volume of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.721" offset="14635600">There's nothing fancy that's done here to facilitate violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.689" offset="14651483">What they're doing is making entire bunch of material available and I didn't hear an answer to Justice Breyer's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.760" offset="14679800">If we read the law the way they propose to read it and I still don't know the exact moment they think is an infringement and how analytically it differs from Justice Stevens' library example, we're going to have a serious problem with our kids doing homework and with professors of history finding out what happened in the middle of the 20th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.324" offset="14753987">It seems to me that before this Court takes a step like that it should pause.</text>
