            <text syncTime="18.209" offset="222514">The... I don't want to return to the delegation issue, other than to repeat and emphasize that this agency wishes to regulate every nook and cranny of this environment for air pollution reasons, and yet said to the Court of Appeals, nothing in the statute requires her to make any specific findings or to structure her decision making in any particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.268" offset="338707">Now, with that said, I want to turn to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.861" offset="357097">And I want to start a little bit out of order because in my first argument, I intended, I didn't get a chance to respond to, Justice O'Connor's colloquy with General Waxman.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.977" offset="405581">You asked, Justice O'Connor, about Section 109(d) of the Act which requires the CASAC committee to advise the administrator on any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic and so forth effects, and Mr. Waxman said two things that I want to very much disagree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.631" offset="508189">He said that's in a different provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.592" offset="516026">Well, it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.268" offset="518743">It's in the standard setting provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.364" offset="527102">It's in Section 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.910" offset="533267">It refers to standard setting, and entails standard setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.561" offset="547896">Secondly, the statute makes clear in the judicial review provisions, and I'm looking at pages 6-A and 7-A of my blue brief, that's the Petitioner's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.682" offset="700346">In other words, I'm reading about the statement that the administrator must provide, which is the next sentence, and it says it must set forth the pertinent findings, recommendations and comments and so forth, and if her proposal, and you'll notice it says Section 109(d), that's 7409(d) is all of Section 109(d), it's not excluding out the parts that General Waxman would exclude out.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.356" offset="819047">What it says is that she has to say where she differs with the CASAC, and where she agrees with the CASAC, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.477" offset="843497">So this information that Justice O'Connor, you referred to in your question, is very much part of the standard setting process.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.415" offset="871292">It's very much part of what the administrator has to say when she promulgates a standard, and it's very much part of the judicial review provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.609" offset="900026">Now, if I can return to the core provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.005" offset="925626">Requisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.279" offset="942763">Now, I'm going to talk mostly about public health this morning, but that doesn't mean that there aren't other words that you should pay attention to, and other provisions in Section 108 and 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.608" offset="984036">I just would like to focus on public health because I think it's so doggone central.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.584" offset="1003994">Now, what does it mean to protect the public health?</text>
            <text syncTime="218.314" offset="1022906">Now, public health is not defined in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.158" offset="1038266">We all agree on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.034" offset="1041819">It has to take on its natural and ordinary meaning under this Court's decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.693" offset="1108379">If the administrator defines public health so that it excludes all countervailing factors, what you are doing is handing over to the administrator a decision of far, far-reaching economic and political significance, and under this Court's decisions, the MCI line of cases, the Court just doesn't presume those kinds of delegations lightly, so my point would be, of course, the administrator in this provision and others has discretion, but it doesn't have discretion--</text>

I take the Central Bank of Denver case as probably the best one to talk about because this Court held no stare decisus effect and overturned a decision where 11 courts of appeals had come out the other way, and everybody had been living with aider and abettor liability under 10(b)(5) of the '34 Securities Act for decades, and yet this court said that's not what the statute said, so this Court is in a position to read the statute and make sense of the statute, as I am suggesting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.019" offset="6385741">I have a pretty good sense then in the first decade of the statute, there wasn't much question about that, that one of the reasons this thing didn't come sharply into focus in lead industries is because we were at the early stages and it made a lot of sense to do what was being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.509" offset="6447703">But at this stage, I don't think health-health tradeoffs really are the answer because for the very reason you're suggesting, the costs are important because the resources, and even in a rich society like this one, we do have limited resources and those resources can be better used elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.237" offset="6534534">I mean, there is no even attempt to reconcile the ozone standard in the particulate matter and the other ambient standards in terms of providing a comparable degree of protection, even without any regard to costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.978" offset="9441545">The first thing that Congress did after it passed the '70 act was to provide in 1977 that the standards should be reviewed and revised every five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.787" offset="9492745">Now, that is a provision that is codified in Section 109(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.437" offset="9519389">It's a new provision, and it's significant because what it says is that the revisions shall be made in the same manner as the original standards are set, by reference to the criteria documents and Section 109(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.931" offset="9589398">Now, I think that one of the things one can glean, one of the many things one can glean from the legislative history, is that when Congress did that in 1977, it knew repeatedly without any doubt and from a commission that it itself asked to look at this question, that the EPA was setting the standards without reference to costs or other implementation factors, and yet, it required the EPA to revise the standards every five years and expressly said that they are to do so in the same manner as which the original standards are set.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.755" offset="9756686">There was, in particular, a 1970 Congressional Research Service Report, 1975, Congressional Research Service Report that was asked to look at this question, and outlined the debate over whether to retain the effects of the pollutants as the sole criteria of standard setting, and Congress did that in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.259" offset="9854697">But it went further, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.276" offset="9862743">It also directed that another commission, an independent commission, be established to look at this question, and that commission reported to Congress in 1981, and it said,</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.751" offset="9976637">And when Congress revised the statute in 1990, that's exactly what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.402" offset="10003282">And both the House and the Senate reports accompanying the 1990 legislation said that primary NAAQS are</text>

            <text syncTime="2486.311" offset="10094919">This Court itself said in the Union Electric case, construing the Clean Air Act, and I'm quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.839" offset="10128983">"when Congress intended the administrator to be concerned about economic or technological feasibility, it has expressly so provided. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.766" offset="10172660">And in the Benzene case, which my opponent has cited but which I think strongly supports us, the Court said, and I am quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.142" offset="10214247">"when Congress has intended that an agency engage in cost/benefit analysis, it has clearly indicated such intent on the face of the statute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.694" offset="10268372">Now there, this Court determined that before OSHA could lower the level for a particular toxic material or hazard physical agent below an existing standard, it had to determine that there was a significant risk to safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.846" offset="10356980">And that determination was to be made without reference to cost/benefit analysis, and if I can just say one thing with respect to the previous argument, that standard, significant risk to safety, has no more countervailing extraneous factors imported into it than the public health adequate margin of safety requisite standard that exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.572" offset="10471918">In fact, this Court went on at length to say that it doesn't require mathematical precision and there will be a range of factors and that judgment has to be rendered and that the court will simply have to review whether the decision is arbitrary or capricious.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.226" offset="10970544">I want to say two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.790" offset="10984754">First of all, Congress has made a rational decision that with respect to what it viewed and characterized as the most serious problem facing America in 1970, which was air pollution, that it wanted to create an agency, an expert agency that would rely on science and the latest scientific knowledge to do as step one, just tell us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.333" offset="11094991">We recognize this is going to be hard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.673" offset="11152356">And then, establishes a program for how to achieve the levels by balancing the burdens between cars and stationary sources of pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.422" offset="11199272">But secondly, the EPA was... the EPA has always done cost estimates at the time that it promulgates the criteria documents so that the states can use them in implementing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.214" offset="11262488">And retrospective... looking retrospectively, every single one of those cost estimates has vastly overstated the actual cost/benefit analysis of what it took to meet that level.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.470" offset="12779471">If that is correct, then mightn't it be factually true, I mean, that if you were going to electric cars, or you're really going to change the whole economy, the chances of the costs being so fantastic that they have serious adverse health effects are fairly high, and the saving might be fairly low in terms of health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.705" offset="12876438">Maybe that isn't so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.361" offset="12903083">In 30 years under this act, and this act is... this act is the premiere example of the point that Justice Kennedy was expressing for the Court in Loving of cooperation between two different branches under the separation, under the permissible separation of powers to achieve a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.718" offset="12980509">Congress has over and over and over again adjusted implementation issues in response to problems of cost and feasibility, but never, it has never done either of the following two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.221" offset="13034531">It has never changed a NAAQS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.604" offset="13044039">Never said no, that's too low, we'll have to deindustrialize, and it has never changed the factors that EPA considers and doesn't consider in setting NAAQS.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3234.388" offset="13087194">Have there been, have there been other cases in other regulatory statutes where the government has argued that it survives a delegation challenge because there is a cost/benefit analysis... i.e. have you taken a position, in other cases, in other agencies, cases where cost/benefit is a way to save the statute from the delegation session.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.279" offset="13202759">Not that I'm aware of, although in some of the rate-making cases, I think it was probably apparent from the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.760" offset="13232643">I mean, my colleague cites Hope Natural Gas, which was not a nondelegation case, but it was apparent from the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.773" offset="13256676">But I think the interesting point, Justice Kennedy, is that this Court has decided many cases in which it is clear that it was neither necessary nor important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.032" offset="13309757">Benzene is the best possible example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.987" offset="13325535">But it is also true in other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.910" offset="13349254">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.546" offset="13351866">What was neither necessary, nor important?</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="3302.403" offset="13359285">--A cost/benefit analysis in determining in either making the statute constitutional under the nondelegation doctrine, or providing a sufficient principle for determining what is a significant safety risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.405" offset="13419262">But the other case that just comes to mind is, in many ways... the first nondelegation case of the last century, the Stranahan case, Buttfield vs. Stranahan in which Congress passed a law that told the Secretary of the Treasury for some reason to set uniform rates for the quality of tea and to prohibit the importation of any tea that did not meet those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.560" offset="13527827">Now, there's no indication in the record in the case that cost/benefit analysis went into the determination of what an appropriate standard for tea quality was, and it's frankly hard to imagine how it would have been done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.073" offset="13601910">In my few remaining minutes, I would like to address my comments to the argument that somehow the words public health requires this Court, notwithstanding 20 years of D.C. Circuit precedent to the contrary, to require some form of cost/benefit analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.990" offset="13681636">And I have five points to make with respect to that in my remaining time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.102" offset="13702012">First of all, the legislative history, the 1970 legislative history reflects that Congress intended the plain meaning of public health to mean to protect populations, not the most sensitive person as is the case in the OSHA Benzene context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.982" offset="13777558">Number two, if you look at Section 108(a) of the act, which determines what criteria are, it is the effects on public health of the presence of the pollutant in the air that is being ascertained and costs does not make sense in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.718" offset="13864493">There are also, as Justice Scalia pointed out, many provisions of the Clean Air Act that require consideration of both costs and public health, and they are collected in the brief of Massachusetts and New Jersey at page 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.572" offset="13931889">Well... penultimately, the Winslow definition, the 1951 definition that ATA cites is a definition of the profession of public health, the discipline of public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.001" offset="13989672">There is no showing in this record or in the legislative history that that case, that that definition was ever even cited in... by 1970, much less brought to the attention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.114" offset="14042126">And there is no showing whatsoever in the legislative history that that definition was interpreted that way before 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.668" offset="14080265">I mean, it would require Section 109(b) to say that NAAQS must be set at the level requisite to protect the profession of public health with an adequate margin of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.831" offset="14140973">And in fact, there is a reference to the fact that all public health organizations agree can you only determine this with respect to costs, at page 36, footnote 27 of our principle brief on this appeal, we reference and describe the expressed views of the American Public Health Association which is the national umbrella organization for public health professionals, which specifically has endorsed the process that EPA uses for setting the NAAQS standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.712" offset="14272526">In short, there is nothing in Section 108 or 109 that permits EPA to set a level inadequate to protect the public health because of the costs of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.770" offset="14332712">If there are no further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3556.238" offset="14374612">Your Honors, the cotton dust case, which did construe Section 38, said that cost/benefit analysis either permitted or required by section 38 of that statute, it was ruled out only because the statute provided a feasibility analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.017" offset="14433649">That's the only thing that ruled it out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3578.290" offset="14462802">He concedes that the standard itself cannot be changed after it is set, and lastly, we have acted as if this provision has made sense in the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.807" offset="14508882">I call the Court's attention to the American Lung Association case, which shows that this interpretation of the statute makes no sense from any perspective.</text>
