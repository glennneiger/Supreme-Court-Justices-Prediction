I mean, the Government points out in the brief that there are limitations in a flood situation on the amount of water that can be discharged downstream, and in order to comply with those limitations they might have to use this canal to run off surplus water, so the United States is saying that there certainly are situations in which this canal would have a flood control use.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.343" offset="3347268">But another to do it is to say that so long as the water that's sometimes in that canal and running out through the crack that was too big is flood water, so long as that's so, as long as that's a substantial amount of the water that's causing the damage, i.e. as long as a substantial amount is water that would have otherwise gone into the San Joaquin River but did not because there is too much water behind the dam and the river was filled up, as long as that's substantial, the Government's entirely immune.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.377" offset="3583415">And there's no doubt that that water causes some of the damage, but surely not even half.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.135" offset="10062409">That's why I think you have to get to the third part of this, which is the causation part, if we're going to say anything useful, and on that I thought you'd say, look across the year about 98 percent of the time it is diverted from the San Joaquin bed just for irrigation purposes.</text>

I'll give you as much as you want, but it's not going to be more than 50... it's diverted for, let's say, flood control purposes, and now we have to say that the causation problem is solved by saying, you know, one, this water wouldn't have been substituted by some other water, and the second thing is, you have to apportion the damages, I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="3501.114" offset="14162380">It would, in fact, be subject to proof at every step of the way, and this Court has made clear that not only is sovereign immunity a principle of jurisdiction, but it... to prevent against the Government being liable, but it's also a principle to avoid the Government having to defend against vexatious litigation.</text>
