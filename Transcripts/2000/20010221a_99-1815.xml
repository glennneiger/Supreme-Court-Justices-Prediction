            <text syncTime="34.570" offset="287650">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="38.622" offset="303846">The National Labor Relations Act confers organizational, representational, and bargaining rights on employees, broadly defined, including professional employees, but it expressly excludes supervisors from that protected class.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.042" offset="417531">The term, supervisors, is defined in section 211 of the Act, which is set forth on page 2 of our brief, or also on page 2 of our petition, and to be a supervisor under this provision an employee must have authority in the interest of the employer to perform one of 12 specified supervisory functions, or effectively to recommend that such action be taken, and the employee's exercise of that authority must not be of a merely routine or clerical nature, but must require the use of independent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.241" offset="622331">In 1994, in NLRB v. Health Care and Retirement Corporation, this Court held that the board had mistakenly applied a special test of supervisory status for the health care industry based on an incorrect interpretation of the phrase, in the interest of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.828" offset="740718">The Court held that the board had set up a false dichotomy between action taken in connection with patient care and action taken in the interest of the employer, which is in the business of patient care, and in so doing, the Court did not at all suggest that the problem of reconciling the coverage of professional employees with the exclusion of supervisors was an insuperable one for the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.751" offset="888362">It suggested some possible approaches that might result in a defensible solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.741" offset="932352">It specifically agreed with the proposition that phrases in section 211 such as independent judgment and responsibly to direct, are ambiguous, and the board needs to be given ample room to apply them to different categories of employees.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="219.424" offset="1027020">So there were those three phrases that could possibly justify the exclusion of registered nurses generally, and one of them was disposed of in the earlier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.100" offset="1081772">There are two left, independent judgment, and responsibly to direct, but the Government has chosen not to put both in play in the present case, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="246.091" offset="1133704">Only independent judgment is at issue here, so that if you lose on this one, you still have the third swing, right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="252.745" offset="1160349">Well, this was a determination made by the board in going back to the drawingboard, so to speak.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="262.267" offset="1198383">Yes, of course, but the board made a determination that responsibly to direct in the abstract need not be defined because it is always qualified by the exercise of independent judgment not of a routine nature in order for these determinations to be made, and early on, after Taft-Hartley was passed, the board got burned by courts of appeals in trying to interpret responsibly to direct, particularly in a case called Ohio Power.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="304.844" stopTime="342.052">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="304.844" offset="1368701">The trouble is that hanging it all on independent judgment is... that's much the broader way to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.419" offset="1414990">I think that suggests that no professional exercises independent judgment if he is acting on the basis of knowledge that is peculiar to his profession, or her profession, in the case of nurses, for the most part.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.732" offset="1492313">What... you really think you can sustain that position?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="342.052" offset="1517599">Well, the board I think quite properly on the basis of textual analysis of this provision holds that there must be a nexus between the exercise of independent judgment and the exercise of one of the 12 categories of authority that define who is a supervisor, because that is what is qualified by the phrase, requiring the exercise of independent judgment.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="378.725" offset="1664303">But your basic position is that professional judgment is not independent judgment, that if something is required to be done, and any qualified professional would do it that way, this is not independent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.902" offset="1716966">It comes closer to routine.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="393.802" offset="1724594">Well, the... if we're talking about when an employee is performing his own functions, his trade or his profession, carrying out his own tasks, that is not one of the functions that makes one a supervisor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="413.998" stopTime="492.600">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="413.998" offset="1805364">No, but let me give you a hypothetical, one that concerns me.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.367" offset="1818843">Let's say that you have a registered nurse in charge of a health care facility, and one of her tasks is to assign the other health care personnel to one or another patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.646" offset="1887911">She says, we need more help here.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.466" offset="1903271">This patient is in more need of help.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.550" offset="1911526">The other patient is in less need of help.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.085" offset="1921661">That seems to me to be supervisory activity, even though it is based upon her medical expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.392" offset="1962935">That's opposed to the situation in which the registered nurse is merely supervising one of the practical nurses in the care of a particular patient, and she says, you know, put a bandage here, you know, or give him two aspirins.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.669" offset="2032003">There, you're not directing the employee to one task or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.258" offset="2058439">You're telling that employee how to do the task that employee is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.710" offset="2072231">Well, if the registered nurse is really assigning all of the people, and saying, we need three more over here, we need two more down there, I don't know why that is not supervisory work.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="492.600" stopTime="569.851">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="492.600" offset="2119774">Well, assignment is a separate category in this, but let me respond more directly to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.373" offset="2154883">If the nurse did not have anyone assisting her and had to decide which patient was in more acute need of care, the nurse would be making a professional judgment and carrying it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.585" offset="2223741">If the nurse has an extra pair of hands available with which the nurse has to communicate by more than brain waves in order to exercise the same professional responsibility, and this is a less-skilled employee, and the direction to that employee once that professional determination has been made falls into the category of routine, in giving the directions to the assistant, so that it would be in... for purposes of dividing labor and management, which is what this is about, in the category that also would include the journeyman directing his apprentice--</text>

            <text syncTime="572.803" offset="2440558">Is that nurse who is assigning other health care personnel to one patient or another, on the basis of her expert medical judgment of which patients need help more, is she in a supervisory position, or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="689.145" offset="2905955">Well, I thought in this very case, and maybe I'm wrong, but there is a mechanism whereby there's a registered nurse who's the building supervisor when the other folks aren't there, and that that amounts to about 72 percent of the time, in terms of total hours that the building is open, 24 hours a day, and there is an internal memo which states that these registered nurses, as building supervisors, are in charge of the facility, and all rehabilitation staff, and are ultimately responsible for quality patient care.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.322" offset="3074602">Now, why isn't that using independent judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="736.459" offset="3095186">I have a hard time understanding why a person under those instructions, who is in charge, and the only person there at the building, isn't exercising independent judgment under your proposal.</text>

            <text syncTime="749.700" offset="3148163">--Well, there's also a finding that these registered nurses usually work on their own, without any assistance in performing their duties, and the other employees who may be present... we're talking about the evening hours when less is going on, are... do not report to the nurse, whether she's the building supervisor or not, and are performing tasks that are laid out for them by management in the facility, so of course she would be using judgment in performing her own nursing services, to the extent they're called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.978" offset="3321302">But what the board found in this case, the regional director found in the representation hearing, was that all that the building supervisor designation meant in practice was that she was to try to see to it that prescribed numbers of staff, and we're talking about rather small numbers, were met, previously prescribed staffing--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="830.386" offset="3470932">Mr. Wallace, I am less concerned about, you know, the outcome of this case, whether these particular nurses were, indeed, supervisory, as I am with the rationale that the board used, and the rationale that it used... I'll quote it from your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.930" offset="3533103">It is that an employee's exercise of ordinary, professional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services in accordance with employer's specified standards is not the exercise of independent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.409" offset="3606977">Now, if that's the principle on which the board is proceeding, it seems to me that would say that in the hypothetical I gave you before, that nurse, who is using her expert judgment to direct the less-skilled employees, you go here, you go there, she would not be a supervisory personnel, because she's using her professional judgment to know, you know, which medical services are needed where, and it seems to me she is a supervisor, on any reasonable analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.732" offset="3744277">In other words, I think maybe you have to take the third swing, and go back and, you know, try to resolve this case under the remaining test, which is, what is it, authority to direct.</text>

            <text syncTime="913.056" offset="3801537">--Well, what... that standard that we've articulated was based on longstanding board experience with other employment situations involving skilled crafts, team leaders, lead men, group members, who they on their experience, or their superior technical knowledge, direct discrete tasks to be performed by other members of the group that management has assigned to be members of that team.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.584" offset="3975722">They're not deciding for themselves who should be members of the team to perform the function.</text>

            <text syncTime="1112.937" offset="4601093">Now, the assistant carpenter may tell the carpenter a lot of things, all about carpentry, and if that's what's going on, that isn't supervision, because they're experts, they're carpenters, and as long as they're talking about carpentry, that falls within the rule we're talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.969" offset="4689283">The licensed practical nurse does things, gives shots or whatever, so that's the expertise point, but I thought this case primarily involved two other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.908" offset="4725018">One is, what does the woman do who is the nurse, let's say, during the night hours?</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.896" offset="4752917">Now, if she's ordering building people around, like maintenance people or others, maybe she's a supervisor, but there was a finding she did nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.636" offset="4803908">And then there was a second thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.523" offset="4819477">In fact, she can call in substitutes, but when she calls in the substitutes, they don't have to come, or she has little discretion there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.508" offset="5347359">If I may briefly mention a couple of other hypotheticals along the spectrum which may shed some light on what the board has to decide here, supposing a nurse either has a broken arm, or has her hands tied up with another patient, and another... and a different patient needs something administered that requires two hands, and she directs someone to do that, even selecting from among the staff assigned to her someone that she knows knows how to do that, that would be very similar to the team leader, the skilled electrician or carpenter who is doing one thing and asks another man of his team to do the other thing that's required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.675" offset="5540039">Moving much more toward management on the spectrum, if the nurse is anticipating a difficult night, and can authorize someone to stay overtime in addition to the regular staff, and therefore commit the employer's resources to decide how the business should be run, rather than what happens here, just seeing to it that the preordained head count is met, that would move the judgment much more toward the managerial side along the spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.966" offset="5693221">Perhaps it would move back a bit if this discretion were cabined by rather specific criteria from the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.620" offset="5723836">The task of the board is to place these various fact-intensive situations, and we've shown them in many other areas of the workforce, to place them accurately along this spectrum and to decide where the line is to be drawn, and if there is to be coherence in the administration of the Act in this respect, it is important that when the board reasonably does so the court defer rather than second-guess those judgments.</text>
