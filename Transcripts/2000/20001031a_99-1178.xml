            <text syncTime="11.685" offset="190768">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, by 1972 the terms navigable waters and waters of the United States had a settled meaning after a century during which congresses and this Court's conception of what those terms meant had expanded significantly from an initial strict view that the navigable waters were those navigable, in fact, to a recognition that they included in addition waters navigable with improvements and tributaries of those waters, to this Court's statement in the Union Electric case in 1965 that the only things excluded were intrastate nonnavigable waters that did not flow into the navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.484" offset="369968">By 1972, when the act was passed, the broadest conception of the navigable waters of the United States included all waters that form part of a single aquatic system with navigable waters in the traditional sense, that flow into and so can affect the quality of those waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.214" offset="664838">In Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, for example, the statute begins by talking about protecting the navigable capacity of the waters of the United States, and immediately switches to talk about preventing obstructions to the navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.213" offset="740907">In a much more recent statute, 1990, the Aquatic Nuisance Prevention Act, which I did not cite in my brief, but which I have alerted the Solicitor General to, it's at 16 USC 4702.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.125" offset="804541">That is a statute in which the jurisdictional term is waters of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.560" offset="838291">Navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.905" offset="843620">The phrases have been used interchangeably in statutes and in this Court's opinions, and in our reply brief in a footnote towards the end we cited a number of opinions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.410" offset="7365664">The first thing to be said about this question, before turning to the statute, is that this Court has already spoken to this issue, not in detail, but quite clearly in an opinion in which it was an important part of the Court's reasoning, and I'm speaking of a carefully crafted opinion of the Court in International Paper Company against Ouellette which dealt with a very difficult issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.401" offset="7493664">This is in 479 U.S., which dealt with a very difficult issue of implied preemption under the act in light of the meaning of two savings clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.337" offset="7545387">And an important part of the reasoning of the Court in concluding the scope of preemption of escape based causes of action, it happened to be a challenge to a discharge that caused harm in an adjoining state, but an important part of the Court's reasoning was consideration of the comprehensive scope of the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.739" offset="7667013">And the Court stated at page 486 of 479 U.S. in describing the case first that the act applies to virtually all surface water in the country, and it had a footnote at that point citing its decision from the previous term in Riverside Bayview Homes which had described the Corps' regulations that extended to isolated waters so called.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.211" offset="7824897">And then in the legal discussion in its opinion several pages later at 479 U.S. page 493, the Court reasoned, As we noted in Milwaukee 2, Congress intended the 1972 act amendments to establish, quote, an all encompassing program of water pollution regulation, unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.783" offset="7951121">The act applies to all point sources and virtually all bodies of water, and it sets forth the procedures for obtaining a permit in great detail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2627.621" offset="10654481">But to get back to the 1977 controversy, the House did pass a bill, and a similar bill was sponsored by Senator Bentsen in the Senate, but both bills made clear that they were not repudiating the broader scope of authority for EPA in regulating toxic discharges into all waters of the United States as they had been interpreted in the regulations, but only addressed the Corps' permitting activities with respect to dredge and fill activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.054" offset="10816231">The Congress indicated in detail that it was very familiar with the agency interpretations by both agencies, and even then the Senate refused to pass the House version or the Bentsen amendment, and it decided instead to retain the existing scope of the geographic authority stated in the regulations that had been adopted, but to counterbalance that with this new provision that Justice Ginsburg has been averting to, 404(g), which provided authority for the states to adopt their own programs over what were called in the Corps' new regulation and the Senate report, very specifically referred to this as Phase II and Phase III of the expansion of the Corps' permit program, and we have quoted the Senate report that uses precisely those terms on page 25 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.260" offset="11124998">The committee amendment does not redefine navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.008" offset="11148090">Instead, the committee amendment intends to assure continued protection of all the nation's waters but allows states to assume the primary responsibility for protecting the waters outside of the so called Phase I waters, which are the navigable waters and those adjacent and then the wetlands adjacent thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.070" offset="11252267">Under the committee amendment the Corps will continue to administer the entire Section 404 program in all navigable waters until the approval of a state program for Phase II and Phase III waters, and the Phase III waters which the Corps was planning to get to in a couple of years time are the waters at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.381" offset="11353517">So the whole premise of the Senate bill, which is what the conference committee adopted, was that the extension of jurisdiction to these Phase III waters would be retained, but the states would be given the option of administering the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.053" offset="11432198">Two states have chosen to do that, New Jersey and Michigan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.305" offset="11749220">Your view is that all the water that affects interstate commerce, maybe the word is substantially affects or significantly affects, whatever the constitutional test, but think of that set of water, all the water that significantly affects interstate commerce is included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.127" offset="11816512">I take it that they agree that all the water that affects interstate commerce is included provided it also is either navigable or if not navigable, it flows into navigable water, and I thought they were talking about flows on the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.974" offset="11887878">There is an amicus brief that says well, there is only about 20 percent left over.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.113" offset="11912433">Now, I think maybe today... I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.438" offset="11921733">I think maybe they said it also includes the water affecting interstate commerce that isn't navigable but flows underground, in which case I would think that takes care of everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.241" offset="11980979">Maybe there is a tiny little bit that actually doesn't flow underground, and I take think it this particular place, the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA think it does flow into the Fox River underground, and they think it doesn't flow into the Fox River underground, so I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3022.540" offset="12234157">And perhaps if we get away from this particular cite for a moment, much of the battle would be about the so called prairie potholes in the Dakotas and adjoining states where about 50 percent of the waterfowl in this country breed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.174" offset="12340737">Under petitioner's position, as I understand it, the commerce power would enable Congress to protect the winter habitat of duck species and other waterfowl in the Chesapeake Bay area with all of its tidal waters and navigable rivers and et cetera, but not to protect the summer breeding habitat of these same waterfowl.</text>
