            <text syncTime="2710.841" offset="10990859">However, the Federal Government provision would allow that by reading the Federal amendment, the Article IX, which says if there's a hearing and the court orders that you're sent back, that's not a violation, but that's only applying to the Federal Government as a receiving State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.871" offset="11066928">It's not in the main body of the IAD, and I think that that is significant in terms of the statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.076" offset="11103813">In fact, I think it would be to run rough shod over the text to simply ignore it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.787" offset="11138608">It seemed to me that earlier the prisoner sees his new State counsel and begins working on the case and then the more time before the case starts, the better off the prisoner is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2759.221" offset="11184374">The more time to confer with his counsel or?</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.711" offset="11206317">I certainly would think that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.106" offset="11215930">In this case there was very little opportunity to confer with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.853" offset="11234947">If I could turn back to these Federal cases, the Chico case, Mr. Chico was transferred for arraignment, transferred back, and then transferred back to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.887" offset="11291058">He did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.828" offset="11298791">He made no objection to the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.883" offset="11311016">He was transferred pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum rather than as a detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.231" offset="11340377">This was before this Court had dealt with Mauro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.203" offset="11352289">Then when he had a probation violation, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus asking that the IAD be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.361" offset="11416968">In Reed v. Farley, this Court has held that habeas corpus is not something that can be used to recognize violations of the IAD, so that would simply not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.379" offset="11472975">This case is then cited as justification in another Second Circuit case, the Roy case, Mr. Roy had so many detainers from so many different jurisdictions that I feel quite certain that the Second Circuit was looking for any reason whatsoever to keep from excusing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.670" offset="11562209">Mr. Roy had another case in the Seventh Circuit which referred to the Second Circuit case and to the Chico case, and in fact the same transfer was complained about in the Second Circuit and in the Seventh and the Second Circuit cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.927" offset="11631173">The Taylor case that Mr. Lamken mentioned does say that a brief transfer doesn't happen, but the prisoner there asked to be transferred back to State custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.988" offset="11675476">There's quite clearly a waiver, although the Court for some inexplicable reason doesn't seem to reach that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.253" offset="11704524">That's a First Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.877" offset="11723019">The Fifth Circuit Sassoon case is also was raised on habeas corpus, and in fact it was raised on habeas corpus in the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.082" offset="11759799">Mr. Sassoon had not appealed the issue following his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.627" offset="11793968">Sixth Circuit Taylor case, many of these people for some unknown reason seem to be named Taylor, the court there held that since he was held in a jail and hadn't been transferred to a prison yet, that there was no violation, and then adds, and besides, all these other courts hold that quick, temporary transfers do not violate the IAD.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.862" offset="11906921">It mentions Article IX of the Federal amendment in a footnote but doesn't rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.178" offset="11932208">I find it somewhat inexplicable that these courts have this Federal amendment available to them, but it's evidently not being used because none of the opinions that I've found have done more than mention it in a footnote.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark John Christensen</label>
            <text syncTime="2970.493" offset="12029488">Yes, all these are cases where the United States was the receiving State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.900" offset="12051117">The Eighth Circuit Baxter case mentions this but it's again citing Chico, Taylor, and Roy, but it really resolves the issue on the fact that Mr. Baxter was transferred by writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum before a detainer had been lodged, so it really doesn't add to the argument other than to saying, yes, us, too, and the Ninth Circuit Johnson case simply comes down saying well, we've looked through and this is what the majority thinks, and we think that also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.996" offset="12223421">I would also point out that another reason I believe this cannot be de minimis or harmless error is that we tend to focus in on the phrase, the Court shall enter an order dismissing with prejudice, but there's also a self executing clause in there, it seems that by the transfer itself, ex operi operato, the indictment becomes without further effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.598" offset="12357899">Now, that is something that I believe that it requires an objection prior to trial to preserve that, just like any sort of defect in an indictment would require, yet it's not something that you can apply harmless error or de minimis analysis to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.747" offset="12454448">If the... it seems somewhat redundant to have, then having the court enter a ruling dismissing the charge but I believe that that's to prevent the prosecutor from coming back and reindicting on these same charges, and it also recognizes that there really is no indictment, self executing clauses being somewhat difficult to enforce otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.378" offset="12577014">I would also point out, it's not very difficult for the States to follow these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.468" offset="12609406">It's laid out quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.120" offset="12615989">In this particular case, as I have set out in the red brief, the prosecutor had ample opportunity to know what the statute said and to follow the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.783" offset="12670637">She even had notice from Mr. Bozeman himself who had filed a pro se motion objecting to a prior transfer that said the IAD requires dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.759" offset="12734480">It's... to excuse that is simply, I believe, would be saying that a prosecutor can do whatever he or she pleases and that they hope to be able to get away with it by claiming that it's harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.216" offset="12824342">As a practical matter, a trial court judge is almost always going to rule that an error is harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.944" offset="12859241">He's going to rule against the prosecutor unless there is some real teeth given to the wording of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.395" offset="12997063">And also, this statute provides a bright line.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sandra Jean Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3273.696" offset="13242301">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.008" offset="13251496">Just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.123" offset="13255989">I wanted to point out, the respondent has conceded that there are some exceptions to the actual wording of section, of Article IV(e), he has conceded that the language is not that clear and that there might have to be some construction of that statute in order to make it effectuate its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.695" offset="13314294">Also, it's very important to point out that the agreement was not just for the benefit of the prisoner here, this agreement was entered into for the benefit of the party States as well as for the benefit of the prisoner, and that purpose is specifically stated in Article I, and it is one of the purposes that needs to be considered in determining whether or not a harmless error analysis should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.817" offset="13386706">In response to Justice Stevens' question about waiver and whether or not we could just have the prisoner waive, I think it's important to point out that the respondent has argued that one of the problems with implementing harmless error is it would lead to additional litigation in the trial courts, and I would point out that if we have a hearing every time we need to determine whether or not the prisoner wants to waive the right, then again we're going to have additional litigation, so either way we're going to come up with additional litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.993" offset="13507496">In answer to Justice Breyer's question about what's the purpose behind Article IV(e), I think it's simply meant to implement Article IV(c), and it's a way to bring the prisoner over, and we need to have him here, dispose of the charges, and bring him back, but I don't think the purpose is to give the prisoner some sort of benefit, some sort of way to have the charges disposed of short of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.739" offset="13598402">Finally, Mr. Bozeman made no argument below about harm and that he suffered any harm, so it should not be considered here, and if this Court has no further questions, I thank you.</text>
