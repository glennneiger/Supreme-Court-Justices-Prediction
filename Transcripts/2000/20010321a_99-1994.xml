            <text syncTime="3485.166" offset="14093242">One of our major concerns in this case is the non-federal claim in tribal court, because that's problematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.426" offset="14142247">The removal of the non-federal claim if there's no federal claim to which it's pendent loses really in tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.003" offset="14180595">And even if there's review of the immunity defense, ultimately in federal court, there's no basis for federal court jurisdiction to review the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.006" offset="14232631">And so it leaves us exactly where we started, which is at the mercy of the tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.005" offset="14268575">That is a derogation of state sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.432" offset="14282264">This isn't the kind of treatment that the federal government would accept for its own officials, and the reference I would make, if I may, in the U.S. brief is footnote twenty-two on page twenty-nine where the whole theory of federal officer immunities is set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.526" offset="14366691">And in the end they conclude, just as we have, that because of the status of the tribes as dependent sovereigns within the federal system, additional considerations may apply to the exercise of tribal court jurisdiction over federal officers even when sued in their personal capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.525" offset="14438685">That's exactly what we're asking for in this case as state officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.303" offset="14461777">We're not asking for any more than the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.244" offset="14469509">And perhaps the difference here is due to the fact that the U.S. views states and tribes as coordinate sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.389" offset="14514127">Coordinate sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.587" offset="14518933">And tribes and states are not coordinate sovereigns, they're different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.788" offset="14539727">States and tribes are fundamentally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.594" offset="14550907">State immunities have a constitutional dimension, whereas tribes have been implicitly divested of their sovereignty to the extent that it's inconsistent with their status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.938" offset="14600331">And that's our ultimate position in the case and explains the position we take.</text>
