            <text syncTime="1456.804" offset="5979680">It rested that on a variety of considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.922" offset="5992114">The first was that the Court's jurisprudence had recognized Gideon violations as a unique constitutional defect that rose even to the level of a jurisdictional defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.672" offset="6031089">The second two reasons I think are the ones that most clearly explain the rule that we're espousing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.861" offset="6107889">Well, there are two distinctions between that kind of a situation and the Gideon situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.191" offset="6133175">The one that I think is most applicable to the majority of cases that are going to come up in this context is that a Brady violation is a very fact intensive inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.620" offset="6170896">It can't be resolved, as the Court noted in Custis with respect to a Gideon claim, simply by looking at the judgment or the judgment role and determining whether the defendant had counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.366" offset="6209871">It requires instead a fairly intricate analysis of whether the Government suppressed and withheld information that the defendant couldn't with due diligence have gained access to, and whether there was resulting prejudice to the defendant as a consequence, and the administrative costs of adjudicating that are far more substantial and very intrusive into the sentencing process as compared to Gideon.</text>

I think, Justice O'Connor, that is the second distinction in your hypothetical, that the hypothetical posits that this was information about a constitutional claim that could not with due diligence have been obtained, I'm assuming within any time for bringing an appropriate appeal or collateral challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.572" offset="6394713">The capital context is unique in that area, I think, and I'm going to set it aside, because questions of actual innocence in the capital context would be dealt with under the Eighth Amendment and would implicate constitutional principles that aren't broadly applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.663" offset="6459079">But as to the generality of sentencing cases, I think that the basic rule is that there is a system in place to challenge convictions that balances two fundamental interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.489" offset="6510384">One is in finality, the other is in fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.095" offset="6528774">Those two interests have always been accommodated not by giving one total sway over the other, but by saying that in certain contexts there are claims that are available and they may be brought, and if they are brought in a manner that's compatible with the procedural limitations such as statute of limitations, procedural default, exhaustion, Teague v. Lane, if they surmount those hurdles, then the interests of vindicating the Constitution take precedence over the interests of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.055" offset="6652699">But if those procedural hurdles have not been met, and the defendant did not bring his claim in accordance with the procedures that are set out, then society is entitled to take that conviction as conclusively final, and any further remedy that would be available would have to come from the executive branch--</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.662" offset="9275079">A defendant who doesn't challenge his guilty plea in that fashion at the time that it's available to do so is essentially saying, I struck a deal with the Government, the deal allows me perhaps to reduce my time of imprisonment compared to what it would have been if I had gone to trial and lost, as I probably would have been, would have lost, therefore I'm going to enter a guilty plea and establish finality, and I'm not going to take an appeal, because if I appeal and win at this juncture I'll probably be back right in the position that I started in, namely, facing a trial and a potentially longer sentence.</text>

            <label>Mr. G. Michael Tanaka</label>
            <text syncTime="3173.155" offset="12845077">I'd first like to address the question of what Custis left open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.018" offset="12872558">We've been talking about the sentence at issue, and it ends, if... we recognize... and this is at page 497 of the Custis decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.956" offset="12908294">We recognize, however, that Custis, who is still in custody for purposes of State convictions, at the time of this Federal sentencing under 924(e) may attack a State sentence in Maryland or through a Federal habeas review, and then, importantly, after that the citation is just see Maleng v. Cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.222" offset="12981332">Now, there are two things that suggest that what that left open was the possibility of reviewing the prior conviction as it enhanced the later sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.598" offset="13022815">First is that it says, or through a Federal habeas review, and second it says, it cites Maleng v. Cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.065" offset="13048728">Now, what Maleng decided was that there was subject matter jurisdiction in a Federal habeas case where there was an expired conviction, and the petitioner in that case had attacked an expired conviction directly and what this Court said was, no, you couldn't attack that directly, but there was subject matter jurisdiction on habeas where that prior conviction was used to enhance a subsequent sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.780" offset="13151546">So that strongly suggests that the remedy that this Court left open in Custis is akin to what exactly is at issue here and that is, a 2255 remedy, by its very terms, allows the petitioner to attack the constitutionality of that prior State conviction, as it was used to enhance his Federal sentence.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3268.924" offset="13228137">Maleng, though, was directed just to whether or not he was in custody.</text>

            <label>Mr. G. Michael Tanaka</label>
            <text syncTime="3272.265" offset="13241512">Right, whether he was in custody on the subsequent sentence, but it suggests that they would entertain attack on the prior conviction through the custody of the subsequent sentence and conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.623" offset="13298981">The other point I wanted to make is, the Solicitor General mentioned that there was a fairness finality balance here, and that this changes where the conviction, as in this case, is so old, but that fails to recognize that the finality interests where the conviction is used in a subsequent proceeding are not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.421" offset="13410158">In fact, they're not even close to the same, where we're challenging the challenges to that State conviction directly, and that is because this Court's jurisprudence in many of those 2254 cases regarding finality posits the rationale that the State judgment is a final one, and we don't want to intrude in the State process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.680" offset="13507125">That is, we don't want to release this person from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.394" offset="13522067">We don't want to make the State retry this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.367" offset="13529904">We don't want to intrude in the State process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.159" offset="13545055">In this case, again, that interest is almost nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.445" offset="13566266">If a Federal sentencing court granted a 2255, there is no impact on that State court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.426" offset="13594165">So it really boils down to a question of, is there a remedy for someone who is going to face a potential life term--</text>

            <text syncTime="3412.430" offset="13802204">So basically what's at issue, then, is do we allow 2255, which by its fine language provides a remedy where the sentence is unconstitutional, do we close that door on the basis of considerations that aren't at issue in this case, or do we allow someone who's facing a life sentence to litigate the validity, and in some cases it's going to be obvious, of prior convictions that don't reliably indicate his guilt and, as the Solicitor General said, the whole purpose between the armed career criminal act is incapacitation, or--</text>
