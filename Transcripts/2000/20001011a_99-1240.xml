            <text syncTime="3479.411" offset="14075830">--To be honest with you, I've never... I'm not aware that that is the Court's rule, that the Court's job is to conceive of rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.967" offset="14097982">I always thought that was the job of the Government lawyer to come before the court... the inquiry is not exactly what the Government did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.314" offset="14123373">It's whether there's any rational explanation after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.258" offset="14135180">And, as this Court's decisions prove, there are probably a dozen to two dozen of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.322" offset="14151480">There are some instances where they can't come up with anything, and that's exactly what happened there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.011" offset="14166214">Whether it was good lawyering, bad lawyering, the end result, everything they identified was not rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.044" offset="14186380">The second thing, I've not heard anything from the Government or the private respondents in their briefs or today about the second half of the City of Boerne inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.013" offset="14218249">There's nothing about proportionality and, as the Court said in Kimel, Florida Prepaid, and City of Boerne itself, the issue on proportionality is whether the statutory standard covers, quote, substantially more conduct than would be found unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.368" offset="14279585">That itself invalidates this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.650" offset="14288780">Now, the question of discrimination, whether it exists at the society or the Government level, I think this Court's decisions from 1985, one of them written, by the way, by Justice Marshall in Alexander v. Choate, Justice Marshall says in a 9-0 decision, the main problem with disability discrimination is not one of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.553" offset="14360356">It's one of either trying too hard, needless paternalism, or not trying hard enough, unintentional neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.445" offset="14387941">That's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.476" offset="14392016">That's an Article I problem, and we're happy the ADA was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.018" offset="14406227">The only challenges that have been made to it to our knowledge are in the prison setting, and it's about inmates and, if there's one area where maybe interstate commerce doesn't go, it's to a prison, where the very point of a prison is to keep people out of interstate commerce, so--</text>
