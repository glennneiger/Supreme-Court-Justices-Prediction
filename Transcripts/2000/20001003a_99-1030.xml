            <text syncTime="1569.879" offset="6439512">If they, in fact, act upon license violations and serve that interest within the meaning of this Court's prior recognition of that as a legitimate interest, then the fact that they also serve another legitimate interest that does not in any way change the nature of the intrusion on the individual, does not enhance the length or duration or intensity of the seizure, then it would not make a difference, and then what the government says or doesn't say in the preamble I don't think would change the Fourth Amendment analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.104" offset="14068416">So it's clear that there are times when the last thing being done is being sniffed by a dog, and that makes sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.569" offset="14118362">Given the number of cars, the dogs have to do multiple cars, and inevitably I believe there's going to be a wait for the dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.680" offset="14142813">But obviously, Your Honor, the risk here is that if we break down the barrier here and allow this seizure which is clearly for criminal investigatory purposes to occur without cause, then we will be faced with ever-increasing incursions which will be balanced away because if the problem is deemed serious enough, if the intrusion is deemed minimal enough, we will have seizures of persons on streets.</text>
