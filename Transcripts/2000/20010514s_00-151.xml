            <text syncTime="6.651" offset="119459">I have the opinion in the United States versus Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.206" offset="157703">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.291" offset="182049">Respondent Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative was organized to distribute marijuana to qualified patients for medical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.054" offset="221128">The United States sought to enjoin the Cooperative’s efforts under the Controlled Substances Act, which prohibits the manufacture and distribution of certain drugs including marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.080" offset="281210">The District Court granted the Government’s request for a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.514" offset="302943">The Court then rejected the Cooperative’s motion to modify the injunction to permit distributions that are medically necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.382" offset="346411">The Cooperative appealed and the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court’s ruling on the motion to modify the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.289" offset="382042">According to the Ninth Circuit, medical necessity is a legally cognizable defense to the statute’s prescriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.341" offset="418196">The Ninth Circuit also concluded that the District Court could have issued an injunction more limited in scope than the Controlled Substances Act, and thus instructed the District Court to consider the criteria for the medical necessity exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.407" offset="490503">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.127" offset="509415">We hold that there was no medical necessity exception to the Controlled Substances Act’s prohibition on manufacturing and distributing marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.862" offset="556331">Under any conception of legal necessity, the defense cannot succeed when the legislature itself has made a determination of values.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.094" offset="593216">Here the Act reflects a determination that marijuana has no medical benefits meriting an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.614" offset="627280">Whereas, other drugs can be dispensed and prescribed for medical use, the same is not true for marijuana, which according to the Act, has no currently accepted medical use.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.858" offset="680256">The Ninth Circuit erred in instructing the District Court to consider the criteria for medical necessity exception when fashioning the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.126" offset="721321">Although District Courts that are properly acting as courts of equity generally have discretion in designing relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.707" offset="751727">They cannot ignore Congress’ judgment expressed explicitly in legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.144" offset="781402">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, which Justices Souter and Ginsburg have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.120" offset="809301">Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
