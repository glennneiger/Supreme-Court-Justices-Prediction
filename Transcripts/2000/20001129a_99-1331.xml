            <text syncTime="2655.038" offset="10765399">You don't need to get that far, and the reason is because under the rubric adopted by the Eighth Circuit, if the remedy sought is available already in the limitation court, the claimant's not allowed to go back, and it was already available, i.e. a nonjury trial, so the court below never needed to address whether a nonjury trial was specifically a saved remedy or not, nor does this Court need to decide that for--</text>

Luckenbach, the remedy is the means employed to seek the redress and in our view, and I think the cases bear this out, a jury trial is a specific form of remedy, a nonjury trial is another form of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.478" offset="12255110">It's the means employed, and I think that there's really no question under the case law that a jury trial is in a class separate from a nonjury trial as far as the saving to suitors clause goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.594" offset="12303593">They're different remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.629" offset="12307773">Now, they both seek judgments, but in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.179" offset="12329925">If I may briefly address the rule (f) argument, the position urged by petitioner that rule (f) should be declared invalid is in our view extreme and not warranted by the case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.769" offset="12408292">This Court in the Henderson case did not announce a general test for the determination of when a Rules Enabling Act rule would be ultra vires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.610" offset="12451655">It instead decided that rule 4 trumped the Suits in Admiralty Act provision requiring forthwith service of process on the basis that the rule was purely procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.385" offset="12502751">But if I may, under rule (f), three of the four items that petitioner urges are contained in rule (f) and that mandate that it's a substantive rule are found in the limitations statute itself, namely, who may sue, when they may sue, and the object of the suit and so therefore, even under the test that petitioner cites, rule (f) clearly does not meet the standard of a substantive rule that would be struck down under the Rules Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.326" offset="12638483">Indeed, the limitation act addresses those items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.214" offset="12658023">And I turn again back to the original decisions by this Court in the Benefactor, in the Norwich v. Wright case, in which this Court had occasion to construe the act and, if you follow the language closely of those decisions the Court was not construing rules that it promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.539" offset="12727404">The Court was construing rules that it promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.681" offset="12727926">The Court was construing the act itself, and the original admiralty rules that were promulgated by this Court in the Norwich case, the original 50-some admiralty rules from 1871, were rules, but they were in themselves interpretations of the act as seen by this Court, and they included the right to exoneration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.260" offset="12810264">Now, if the limitation petitioner can come into court, and if he can pursue a limit... exoneration as well as limitation, then by definition the Court has exclusive jurisdiction over both of those subject matters and the limitation claimant, in this case the Jones Act seaman, can return to State court only if he demonstrates that the remedy he wants is not available in the Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3225.759" offset="13048292">Mr. O'Brien relies heavily on the Benefactor, and I would simply refer the Court to the quote from the Benefactor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.803" offset="13092387">It's at page 16 of the reply brief, and the Court said that hence, this Court, in preparing the rules of procedure for a limitation of liability, deemed it proper to allow a party seeking such limitation to contest any liability whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.518" offset="13163335">That is not the statement of statutory construction.</text>

Murkowski case and the Seventh Circuit in the Joyce v. Joyce case have said no, that unless there is a viable claim for limitation you cannot come in and ask for exoneration, and I think that is the rule that this Court should adopt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.201" offset="13429993">--as Justice Stevens noted does not require a jury trial, but it simply said that a jury trial is one aspect that makes the State court forum desirable, and that's part of the Jones Act remedy to allow the injured employee that option of choosing either State or Federal court, and whether or not to have a jury trial in either forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.868" offset="13512645">To get to the respondent's not otherwise available test, this Court is going to have to say that the saving clause does not protect statutory remedies, particularly the statutory remedy afforded by the Jones Act, which allows the employee to choose the forum that the case will be tried in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.898" offset="13612850">That, however, is exactly what the saving clause was designed to do, and that is why this Court should reverse the Eighth Circuit's decision and reinstate the decision of the district court dissolving the injunction.</text>
