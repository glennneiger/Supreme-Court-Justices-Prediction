            <text syncTime="19.319" offset="223239">This case involves an excessive force action brought by a State prisoner under Section 1983 that was dismissed on the grounds that the prisoner had not exhausted the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's three-tiered prison grievance system.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.863" offset="293456">The case turns on an issue of statutory construction, whether when first enacting and then amending Section 1997e(a), to limit the exhaustion provisions to, quote, such administrative remedies as are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.297" offset="375167">Congress intended to require a prisoner, whose remedy is one for monetary damages, to address a past-completed constitutional violation to exhaust a prison grievance system that cannot provide such a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.015" offset="442041">Of course, the backdrop of this case is that there's no general exhaustion requirement in Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.272" offset="475059">But what is key here is that when Congress first enacted the Section 1997e exception in 1980 and then when it amended Section 1997e in 1996, while dramatically strengthening and changing the exhaustion provision in many respects, it retained the key words, such administrative remedies as are available.</text>

            <text syncTime="121.570" offset="632212">Congress took out the words plain, speedy and effective in 1996, along with making exhaustion mandatory rather than discretionary, removing the stay provision and a number of other changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.514" offset="691980">The purpose of taking out plain, speedy and effective, though, those words did not drive the result that we're seeking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.743" offset="736911">They didn't drive the inquiry of whether, in fact, the prison grievance system could provide the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.833" offset="769303">What those words... what the work that those words did in the prior statute, and this is evident from looking at the present statute, which is reprinted on page 5A of Respondent's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.579" offset="824264">In this case the statute says, no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.607" offset="848401">It doesn't say particular claim for something.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.662" offset="860627">It says no action shall be brought until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.061" offset="886227">Your client, I take it, brought an action and in that action, he wanted a transfer of records, a bunch of different things, as well as damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.092" offset="926351">So at least as far as this case is concerned, why wasn't there for that action remedies to exhaust, namely all the transfer part, all the other parts?</text>

            <text syncTime="208.755" offset="980999">Your Honor, when Mr. Booth brought his claim, it's true that he sought both what we know as injunctive relief and money damages and in fact that was the basis upon which Respondents opposed our petition for writ of certiorari, that this was a mixed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.299" offset="1051216">But the question that we presented was a money damages only case and that's the question that's before--</text>

            <text syncTime="232.038" offset="1074099">Just looking at the statute, the statute, though, and the statute refers to action and this is a mixed action.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.484" offset="1103879">And I would think there's a very strong argument that whatever you think about somebody who runs into court and files a claim only for money damages, where a prisoner asks for both, he shouldn't be able to bring his money claim in court until after he's exhausted his prison remedies in respect to what there is to exhaust and there's a lot.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="267.333" offset="1215265">So that's what I want to know, what's the rationale for allowing a person who has the mixed claim to go to Federal court at all, if he doesn't first go and exhaust what he has to exhaust?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nancy_winkelman" startTime="281.905" stopTime="338.171">
            <label>Ms. Nancy Winkelman</label>
            <text syncTime="281.905" offset="1273570">--The Courts of Appeals haven't explained their reasoning in the decisions, but one possibility would be a practical one, which is if in a mixed claim situation the prisoner has to go back and exhaust both the injunctive and the monetary part, it's likely that their monetary claim... they would risk... face a high risk of forfeiting their money claim because it would be too late to exhaust that through the prison grievance system.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.915" offset="1393629">Pennsylvania's, for example, is five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.227" offset="1402929">It's 15 days for bringing your initial grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.654" offset="1416617">So if Mr. Booth's case had been dismissed, he would have been out of time, in all likelihood by that point, to pursue the money claim through the grievance procedure, which is why I think the Courts of Appeals had approached the issue and dealt with this problem by permitting--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="338.171" offset="1498641">I don't follow that if he hadn't come to court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.143" offset="1510553">If the rule is, if you want more than one kind of relief, you must go to the administrator within five days, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.028" offset="1542109">So the idea is, I think what Justice Breyer was suggesting, that is if you have a mixed claim, this... what you're trying to present, you said, the question we presented is damages only.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.608" offset="1596444">You want this Court to treat this case as though there were never any claims, anything else other than money damages and I understand that that's how you would like this case to be treated, but if we take this very case, I am not following your argument that there would be any loss of time and a time bind for the defendant if you must go swiftly to the prison system and name everything.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.412" offset="1715667">--My argument Justice Ginsburg is that when he brought his... he brought his mixed action, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.586" offset="1748268">If he had been... if that action had then been dismissed, go back and exhaust because there are injunctive claims in here that need to be exhausted, he would have been, he would have been time-barred from pursuing the money damages claim then in Federal court because he had to bring his grievance, under Pennsylvania's grievance procedure, within 15 days of the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.964" offset="1853802">By the time he brings his action in Federal court, the Federal court then dismisses.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.362" offset="1915451">If our interpretation is right on the money damages point, and I'd like to go there, if that's right then the approach that the Tenth Circuit took in the Miller case, I think, addresses the concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.788" offset="1965084">The prisoner brings a mixed claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.843" offset="1977309">The court allows the money damages aspect of the claim that the Tenth Circuit agrees does not have to be exhausted to go forward, thereby avoiding this problem of the prisoner perhaps losing the money damages claim all together because they could never exhaust the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.048" offset="2050139">It's too late.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.472" offset="3811837">But after reading the briefs and reading the statute a few more times, I came to the conclusion that, in fact, remedies was an ambiguous word.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.586" offset="3852274">It could either mean form of relief or it could mean administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.325" offset="3875262">And one of the textual clues, it seems to me, that's in there to indicate that Congress meant administrative process was its use of the word exhaust.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.796" offset="3913192">We don't normally speak of exhausting the relief that you get.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.443" offset="3931791">I mean, like running through the money damages and having a good time, that's what... I mean, exhaustion usually refers to exhausting a particular process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.906" offset="6885613">Congress amended the scheme by deleting the requirements that the administrative remedies be plain, speedy or effective and by withdrawing from the courts the discretion to determine whether or not exhaustion is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.941" offset="6941724">In light of these changes, it is clear that Congress wants prisoners to exhaust their prison administrative processes whether or not those processes can provide the prisoner the relief he or she says they need.</text>

            <text syncTime="2922.634" offset="11836548">On that small point and I don't think it would come up very much because almost often... almost in all cases there would be something that the administrative process could do about the complaint and here we're talking about a complaint about excessive force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.321" offset="11899242">So the available remedies that have to be in existence is just something that addresses complaints about excessive force and it could be transferring the inmate to another area, it could be disciplining the officer involved and directing the officer not to repeat that conduct and that would show that administrative remedies are available and an inmate would have to exhaust, even if he only wants to seek money in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.442" offset="12007703">Now that conclusion follows when the textual changes that Congress made in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.469" offset="12031840">Before the Act was amended, exhaustion could only be required when the available administrative remedies were effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.417" offset="12071650">And this Court said in McCarthy against Madigan that administrative remedies are not effective when the inmate seeks only money and the administrative process does not offer that specific form of relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2996.444" offset="12131732">Of course, it was dictum, but when Congress is reviewing a statute and are attempting to amend it, it's very unlikely that Congress is going to make fine distinctions about whether this Court had a holding or an analysis that was necessary to the holding or that it was dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.130" offset="12194530">What Congress was faced with was an interpretation of the term effective and the Court interpreted it to mean then when administrative remedies do not offer money and the inmate is seeking money, the administrative available remedies are not effective and in that context, Congress's elimination of the term effective shows that Congress intended to require inmates to exhaust available remedies in all cases, including ones like that in McCarthy, in which the inmate seeks only money and the available remedies do not offer money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.993" offset="12341965">So what we have, what the statue essentially says to an inmate, is if you have a complaint about prison conditions and the administrative process will address it in some way, you must give the administrative process a chance to do it to your satisfaction and if they cannot do that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.991" offset="12449903">I would just use the word grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.426" offset="12459725">A grievance procedure is something that offers some relief for the kind of complaint that an inmate is complaining about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.651" offset="12488565">And the reason Congress made the particular changes that it made here is it wanted to reduce the enormous burden that these kinds of cases were placing on Federal district courts and the change that it made accomplishes that in two important ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.915" offset="12553662">First of all, an inmate may start out wanting nothing other than money and he may end up being satisfied with something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.088" offset="12586367">And second of all, you have cases where the inmate receives a decision on the merits and he decides after seeing that decision that this is not a claim that's worth pursuing in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.206" offset="12642792">And finally, it's important to note that very few State administrative programs offer money for anything other than personal property loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.980" offset="12685841">So the consequence of accepting the Petitioner's construction here would be that an inmate would have the ability in a wide range of cases to avoid the exhaustion requirement simply by formulating a complaint that seeks only money.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.722" offset="12760865">Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.868" offset="12769433">Ms. Winkelman, you have three minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Ms. Nancy Winkelman</label>
            <text syncTime="3158.840" offset="12781345">And I have three points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.465" offset="12799840">Number one, there's been a lot of discussion about the types of remedies, disciplining the guard, apologies and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.555" offset="12832232">I would point out and emphasize that none of what has been mentioned is a remedy to the prisoner for the particular wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.843" offset="12869325">In this case, Mr. Booth was assaulted by prison guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.467" offset="12887820">The only remedy available to address that wrong to him is money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.832" offset="12917286">Transferring the prison guard is not going to provide redress to Mr. Booth for the wrong that was inflicted upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.988" offset="12949887">And as counsel for the Respondent conceded, Mr. Booth has a high risk of forfeiting his money damages claim under Section 1983 completely for no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.134" offset="12994504">The prison grievance system cannot remedy that wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.303" offset="13011223">He has everything to lose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.469" offset="13011850">How is that a forfeit?</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.750" offset="13016970">How does he forfeit it?</text>

            <label>Ms. Nancy Winkelman</label>
            <text syncTime="3219.524" offset="13024075">Because if he misses one of these short time frames through the prison grievance system as is pointed out in McCarthy--</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.235" offset="13058870">That's the part I don't understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.516" offset="13063990">Suppose it's 15 days, all right he has to file in 15 days, what's the problem?</text>

            <label>Ms. Nancy Winkelman</label>
            <text syncTime="3250.670" offset="13148627">--That's true, but in the injunctive context, he has something to gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.400" offset="13167539">Here he has nothing to gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.167" offset="13178615">The second point is, is that in terms of what about couldn't it just mean that the prison grievance will hear the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.917" offset="13213619">I would return this Court to the words in First Iowa of 55 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.284" offset="13235144">When Congress intends for a litigant to do something futile, it has to be explicit about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.829" offset="13269312">Here Congress was far than explicit about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.833" offset="13285299">Under our view, we think it was said the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.094" offset="13298361">At best it was ambiguous, but certainly Congress didn't explicitly require a prisoner to do a futile act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.896" offset="13329603">And the final point on the deletion of the word effective, I would point the Court to the prior statutory scheme because the words plain, speedy and effective in that scheme right on the face of the statute went only towards the procedural aspects of the State grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.472" offset="13403895">Did it prevent against reprisals?</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.444" offset="13415703">Could it deal with things quickly enough?</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.468" offset="13423853">That's what Congress took out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.492" offset="13431899">But what Congress left in was such administrative remedies as are available, which we believe have force and in this situation the only remedy available was to pay damages.</text>
