            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in two cases: the first is number 00-346, Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation against Garris.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.244">In this case the respondent’s son Christopher Garris was killed, as a result of injuries he suffered while working on board, the Ship Maj. Stephen W. Pless.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.364">Since the ship was berthed in the navigable waters of the United States at time he was injured, she filed complaints in the District Court under federal admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.008">She said the negligence of the petitioner, the Drydock Company and another party had caused her son’s death and she asked for damages under general maritime law which is law made by judges on the exercise of their admiralty powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.325">The District Court dismissed her complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.933">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed saying that “although this Court had not yet recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death resulting from negligence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="59.570">The principles contained in our decision in Moragne versus States Marine Lines, a decision about some 30 years ago, made such an action appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.721">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.989">In Moragne, we held that the general maritime law provides a cause of action for wrongful death caused by breach of duty of unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.152">Unseaworthiness was the limit of our holding there but we cannot find any basis for distinguishing negligence from unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.098">Negligence is no less a “distinctive maritime dury than seaworthiness”.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.192">As we explained in an opinion authored by Justice Scalia and filed with the Clerk today, the common law duties of care have not been adopted and retained unmodified by admiralty but have been adjusted to fit their maritime context.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.863">We do not agree with the petitioner that Congress has preempted this cause of action by statute though if it had of course we would be obliged to enforce the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.282">None of the three statutes which are talked about by petitioner, the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, or the  Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act a preempt this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.118">Beyond preemption is a prudential matter or probably be the better course in many cases that assert new claims of maritime personal injury law to leave further development to Congress which is already legislated so extensively in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.401">But the cause of action we recognize today is new only in the most technical sense of a word.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.435">The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century and it has been clear since our Moragne decision that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.077">We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.860">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part in which Justice Souter and Justice Breyer have joined.</text>
