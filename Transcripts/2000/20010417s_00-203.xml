            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.908" offset="136256">The Federal Insurance Contributions Act or FICA and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, FUTA, imposed taxes on employee wages to fund Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment compensation programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.697" offset="203443">This case concerns the application of those taxes to backpay awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.213" offset="225491">The essential facts, the Cleveland Indians settled the controversy with certain baseball players by paying them back wages in 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.539" offset="274810">Those wages should have been paid in 1986 and 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.213" offset="301455">The Internal Revenue Service maintains that the Cleveland Indians must pay the taxes according to the rates in effect in 1994, the Cleveland Indians and players on the other hand say, the years 1986 and 1987 are determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.548" offset="378777">In those years as you may already have gleamed tax rates and the amount of wages subject to the tax were lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.498" offset="414617">The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in the Cleveland Indians' favor holding that 1986 and 1987 were the proper references which meant that the baseball company owed no FICA and FUTA taxes on the backpay and would qualify for a sizeable refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.039" offset="500821">Other Courts of Appeals in other cases however have upheld the Internal Revenue Service position that the year of actual payment, year 1994 is the year that counts in determining tax rates and the amount of wages subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.276" offset="565709">Using 1994 tax rates and wage basis, the total on Cleveland Indians exceeded a $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.074" offset="596952">We do not find a clear and certain answer in the text of the governing Internal Revenue Cpde provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.743" offset="623597">Those provisions state simply that FICA and FUTA taxes are levied on “wages paid during a calendar year”.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.765" offset="663721">Our own case law concerning the treatment of backpay for employee benefit eligibility purposes indicates that the word formulation Congress used, “wages paid during the calendar year” does not have a dispositively plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.474" offset="734565">We are satisfied however that the Internal Revenue Service reading of the Tax Code provision is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.132" offset="761210">That reading reflecting a long standing treasury regulations and rulings interpreting the regulation have been consistently maintained by the service, using rates and wage bases effective in the years in which the back wages are actually paid does not strain the statute’s text and serves to reduce complexity in administering the FICA and FUTA tax schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.089" offset="873014">According due respect to the Secretary’s steady construction, we hold that back wages are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes prescribed for the year in which the wages are in fact paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.690" offset="927348">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.941" offset="940410">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
