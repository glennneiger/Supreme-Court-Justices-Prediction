            <text syncTime="41.152" offset="314936">Paula Buford's case presents the very type of mixed question well-suited to de novo review, and that's particularly true here because of the overriding, indeed the pervasive importance of uniformity in the current Federal sentencing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.595" offset="400723">Paula Buford serves a prison sentence roughly twice as long as it would have been because of the way in which the district court interpreted and applied guidelines and commentary on relatedness and consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.309" offset="471567">In her view, the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit erred by declining to give independent review to the question of consolidation incorporated into the meaning of relatedness, specifically declined to review de novo whether her prior convictions, her prior cases in fact had been consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.476" offset="568220">I think there are several specific reasons that make this an appropriate case, an appropriate mixed question application of the guidelines--</text>

Mr. Chief Justice that but a fraction of sentences ever are appealed on any ground, but there is no reason to assume that the district judge would be reviewing the act of a State court in his own district or her own district or of any court familiar to that district judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.100" offset="1390763">Now you want to know... this is somebody writing an application note in the guideline, and logically speaking nobody's disputing the brute facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.475" offset="1428171">They're disputing whether sentencing was joined, those words, sentencing was joined, do or do not apply to this undisputed factual situation in the world, so if you're going to go on a, all legal questions are for the court, and the court of appeals, all factual questions are for the trial judge, and this is a legal question, in that rubric I guess you win.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.524" offset="1520435">But I would have thought that there were millions of legal questions of this kind that are really for the trial judge, because what they call for is the expertise of the trial judge, and they are so minor that if you start getting court of appeals into all that thing, what you will produce is an unbelievable mess, where the courts of appeals try to figure out every possible ramification of the application of every application note in the guideline.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.109" offset="1650734">I think... first let me note, Justice Breyer, that the functional consolidation term comes only from the Seventh Circuit and some of the other court of appeals, the application on the guideline themselves refers simply to... well, the application note refers simply to consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.022" offset="1718443">It is a question of what type of guideline are we applying here, and clearly if we confine ourselves today to the realm of Federal sentencing, United States sentencing guidelines, I would submit clearly that some guidelines never rise above fact in their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.914" offset="1806006">Others I think are altogether discretionary in their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.331" offset="1827635">Many of the Chapter 5 guidelines would fall into that category.</text>

            <text syncTime="1974.498" offset="8048331">Now, there's no order specifically saying that they did, so I have to look at the record of what happened in those two cases and see how the court system treated this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.648" offset="8092948">Now, there isn't a, kind of an immediately obvious answer, so the court had to look at the way that those cases were treated from the complaint stage all the way until the sentencing, and there were various factors that strongly indicated that the two cases were not consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.234" offset="8159299">They were charged by separate complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2013.696" offset="8205065">So I think the evaluation, the district court's determination that the totality of the facts have a certain character is what we view as the application of the guideline to the facts, and that is what is entitled to deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.331" offset="12567619">It would seem to me, of course, you're right that deference doesn't mean no review at all, but I would think that it would be more difficult for a court to review in a sensible and critical way a decision about whether consolidation had occurred than it would have been under the old law for a court to review whether a sentence was appropriate when you're asking the question, should the sentence have been 10 years or 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.709" offset="12685170">Here, we've got a case in which this question of consolidation is going to make the difference, as I recall, between doubling a sentence or not, and I would suppose that in the absence of some clear rule it would be more difficult to review the consolidation decision under the guidelines than it would under the old law have been to review the sentence itself, as, say, between 10 and 20 years, which is a very strange result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.751" offset="12821320">Well, I think that... I may not be quite understanding, but I think that one has to assume that the courts of appeals announce interpretations of the guidelines and that the district courts then apply those interpretations in a faithful manner to the facts of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3186.450" offset="12896135">Yes, but can you give me an example... give me an example, keyed to this case, perhaps, of the kind of announcement of a rule governing the meaning of consolidation that would be appropriate and would actually make a practical, critical difference when courts are reviewing consolidation solely for abuse of discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.440" offset="13108040">You said, you know, even if you come down with a rule it would be difficult to review on a de novo basis because of the extraordinary variety of facts, so we're starting with the assumption that you've got functional consolidation, number 2, that functional consolidation covers a tremendous amount of district territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.519" offset="13180347">If you make those assumptions, what kind of a rule on abuse of discretion review could a court announce that would be of any critical help?</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.694" offset="13545121">True enough, but the consequence is now, since the commission has not done any such thing, that it seems to me that the range of unreviewable discretion is greater when a court is determining what is or is not a functional consolidation than the range of unreviewable discretion was under the old law when a court was deciding whether to give 10 years, or 20 years, or 50 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.633" offset="13648879">Justice Souter, one response I would like to say is, I think as the commission and as the courts refine the legal concepts farther and farther down, and as the legal concepts themselves become narrower, I think it's going to be the case that the district court's determination whether any case where the facts of the case fall within those legal concepts is more likely to be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.108" offset="13758698">Okay, but I think what your argument in fact means is, if the Sentencing Commission decides to get into this with more detailed rules, then the discretion is going to be limited, but if the Sentencing Commission doesn't, then we are left with what seems to me this rather ironic situation of less reviewable discretion--</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.957" offset="13838110">--Well, Mr. Wolfson, my understanding of the rule before the sentencing guidelines came into effect was that a majority of the circuits said there was no review of sentencing so long as it was within the limits specified by law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.278" offset="13927449">--Yes, but my point is, it's harder to find, I think, an abuse of discretion inherently as the legal rule that you're applying to a set of facts becomes narrower and narrower.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.134" offset="14134861">This Court in Mistretta approved the basic structure and rule of the Sentencing Commission, of course, and my view on that, or anyone else's, no longer matters, but I think we cannot rely here too much on the Sentencing Commission or cede the ground properly in Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.859" offset="14225767">For one, the Sentencing Commission never can fix disparity in a given case, or cure a lack of uniformity in the cases as they come.</text>

            <text syncTime="3551.210" offset="14355126">In its... its powers really are not so different in its realm than would be Congress' power in the realm of reconsidering what this Court does in the area of an ordinary statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.699" offset="14413118">Congress can act there, too, to alter the rule or even the standard of review, so I think it's clear, 3742 certainly makes it clear, I think, that Congress envisioned here a critical role for the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.876" offset="14485843">The question then is, well, at what level?</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.211" offset="14495142">I want to note how much de novo and deferential review look the same in terms of the mechanical tasks that judges must undertake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.748" offset="14537356">It's only the conclusory act, as I understand it, that differs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.315" offset="14555537">That is, the briefs must be read, the relevant portions of the record must be examined, and in the end the difference then is will reasonable, if inconsistent, conclusions be allowed to stand... well, yes, that's deferential review... or does a court of appeals simply look for the right answer, de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.916" offset="14634009">De novo review continues to have its place and it has its place here, just as much, I think, as de novo review admittedly on a case by case basis helps us understand reasonable suspicion, or helps us understand probable cause, or helps understand what in custody means for Miranda purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.215" offset="14723139">So in the end I'm married to the belief that the word do in 37... thank you very much.</text>
