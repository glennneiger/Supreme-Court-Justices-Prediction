            <text syncTime="9.756" offset="190685">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="14.596" offset="210015">There is a single element in this case that properly determines its outcome, and that is that the product liability loss, as the district court said, and you can find this on page 36A of Appendix B. The product liability loss is a subset of the net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.668" offset="310326">Section 172(a) and 172(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a net operating loss can be carried back three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.966" offset="363511">Section 172(b)(1)(I), and you can find the exact language on page two of petitioner's brief, provides that in the case of a taxpayer which has a product liability loss, the product liability loss shall be a net operating loss carry back to each of the ten taxable years preceding the loss year.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.126" offset="472180">In Section 172(j)(1) then defines the term product liability loss, and that is, it is the lesser of the net operating loss for the year, and that is the net operating loss that can otherwise be carried back three years, or the sum of the amounts allowable as product liability deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.713" offset="570505">So it is clear that the product liability loss is nothing other than a piece of the net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.366" offset="609166">And if you apply that rule to a single stand alone corporation, the first thing you do is determine whether the corporation has a net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.462" offset="653470">If it has a net operating loss, the next thing you do is determine the extent to which that net operating loss is attributable to product liability deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.275" offset="700804">And the product liability deductions in an amount not exceeding the net operating loss then becomes the product liability loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.051" offset="739883">That can be carried back ten years, but it's all part of the net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.105" offset="764125">So if you have a product liability loss that's less than the entire net operating loss, then after you carry back the product liability loss ten years, what is left of the net operating loss can be carried back three years.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.317" offset="828908">Is the theory of the statute that development of these products usually takes longer than a three year period, and that what we're just trying to do is allow the company to have its loss carry back apply to those years in which it was engaging in research?</text>

            <text syncTime="193.281" offset="924830">--I think the legislative history suggests that there was some concern that product liability suits and the like took time to arise, and that a product might be sold in a particular year, generate income, and then it wouldn't be for many years before the product liability suit arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.908" offset="1015318">And in order to provide a longer period of income against which potentially large losses might be deducted, the Congress thought it was appropriate to extend the statute and allow going back as far as ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.056" offset="1079893">I think the theory was that it would be logical that the income might arise years earlier than the three year period, and Congress was simply extending the carry back period to allow for that problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.968" offset="1187517">In the first instance, they're specific to that corporation, and yet they are carried over to affiliated groups, so product liability losses should be given the same treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.344" offset="1369016">Did the... did the successful companies in this affiliated group which, in fact, as I understand it, had the expenses involved here... did they deduct the product liability expenses in the course of calculating what in effect turned out to be positive income which was then attributed to the group?</text>
            <text syncTime="328.837" offset="1467028">Had they already... leaving aside the treatment... the possible treatment of the loss, has there already been a deduction taken by the constituent companies here?</text>

            <text syncTime="357.014" offset="1579668">There was clearly a subtraction of the product liability deduction in arriving at separate taxable income.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.351" offset="1657094">The reason is that when you... when a single corporation or an affiliated group has a net operating loss, the total amount of that loss has not produced any tax benefit because you have had deductions that exceed income, and, yes, you've deducted them in the sense that you subtracted them, but now you come up with a negative number, and that negative number, which is all we're talking about here... the net operating loss... that in and of itself does not produce a tax benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.699" offset="1886450">The fact is that the very same product liability deductions that have been, quote, deducted, in arriving at separate taxable income are in the net operating loss that Respondent will agree we can carry back three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.213" offset="1956562">And if we can carry it back three years and take a deduction, there's no double deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.132" offset="4052210">The reason for that is, as I said earlier, the net... the product liability loss is just a piece of the net operating loss, and an affiliated group filing a consolidated return has only one net operating loss... the consolidated operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.651" offset="4122218">That's the only thing that exists to be carried back three years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.370" offset="4209153">And you can determine that by looking at all of the product liability deductions of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.803" offset="4230887">It's right in there and every one of those deductions, regardless of whether the contributing member has negative taxable income or positive taxable income, goes right to that bottom line, and you can prove, dollar for dollar, that the net operating loss is attributable to every one of those deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.624" offset="4306120">And that, because of the way they have designed the regulations, they have provided only for the single consolidated net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.568" offset="4337885">That is what could be carried back three years, that's what a piece of can be carried back ten years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.303" offset="4588869">The Fourth Circuit said, as the Petitioner argued, that the definition of separate taxable income is not the same as the definition of a net operating loss because separate taxable income excludes things like charitable contributions, capital gains and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.606" offset="4662117">And so negative taxable income can never equate theoretically, and definitionally, with a net operating loss.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.831" offset="5202956">But even then you could have an affiliated group of five thousand coffee shops, or five thousand vitamin stores, all managed by a separate headquarters business... all financed out of one separate headquarters business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.942" offset="5267426">I think it's pretty hard there to view each separately incorporated coffee shop as a business that's separate and apart from every other business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.590" offset="6054025">Take a single stand alone corporation that has an oil business and a computer business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.321" offset="6076908">Now, they might have a product liability in the oil business, but when they report their income, they are reporting the entire company's income and losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.456" offset="6121526">And if there is a profit in the oil business with a product liability deduction and a huge loss in the computer business, they put that all together and, even though the oil business was profitable and the product liability was more than offset by the oil company's income, because they are in a separate corporation, they can put everything together and they're going to get the product liability deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.203" offset="6220477">So the fact that you have disparate lines of business is not the thing that causes the problem, because you can get exactly the same result when you're dealing with a stand alone corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.922" offset="6879390">I think it's common ground that none of the corporations involved in this case would be able to claim a product liability loss on a separate return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.228" offset="6912618">That's because the product liability loss provisions provide no extended carry back benefits either for profitable corporations regardless of the amount of their product liability expenses, or for unprofitable corporations that have no such expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.082" offset="6971968">So the narrow question presented in this case is whether the fact that this profitable entity that had some expenses of this type is combined with an unprofitable entity that had no such expenses changes the result on a consolidated return.</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.538" offset="13509790">The implication of this seems to be pretty clear... that Congress recognizes the background rule that this Court described in Woolford Realty, which is, you look at each of these companies as individual entities first, unless a regulation provides separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.740" offset="13566632">That's why I was focusing on how the regulations tell us what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.755" offset="13582724">The regulations tell us take these deductions at the individual affiliate level first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.755" offset="13602681">Having taken them at the individual affiliate level... these were profitable affiliates, they had no losses to pass on to the consolidated return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.654" offset="13634237">The losses at the consolidated level are ordinary losses with a three year carry back, not this special ten year carry back that you can only get through juggling of tax attributes as this Court described in Woolford Realty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.331" offset="13688990">I want to just briefly touch on one thing that was raised in the reply brief, which is a new argument and which is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.623" offset="13718143">In the reply brief they say that the Gottesman case stands for the concept that you construe all ambiguities in consolidated return regulations against the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.069" offset="13763909">Looking at that case, it's clearly not what it holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.481" offset="13773627">What it says is that penalty provisions are narrowly interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.461" offset="13785539">Penalty provisions are to be construed against the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.925" offset="13799331">The ordinary rule that this Court established in White v. United States in 305 U.S., which we always cite when taxpayers make this argument, is that there is no policy of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.603" offset="13846038">That the tax provisions are not interpreted in favor of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.730" offset="13858577">Indeed, in a case like this involving deductions which are a matter of legislative grace, any ambiguity is to be resolved against the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.347" offset="13893059">This taxpayer has not satisfied the requirement of showing that its profitable affiliates had losses from product liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.715" offset="13930570">Congress did not intend to provide benefits for any other type of corporation, and the consolidated return regulations don't get them there, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.186" offset="13964425">I think I've covered what I intended to.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric R. Fox</label>
            <text syncTime="3462.874" offset="14003191">The Respondent takes the position that if the regulations do not address a particular provision, that any provision in the Code has to be applied on a separate company basis and not on a consolidated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.059" offset="14063899">That is totally inconsistent with the position that the Internal Revenue Service took in both Gottesman and H Enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.344" offset="14093052">In the Gottesman case, the IRS argued that the accumulated earnings tax had to be applied on a single entity basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.282" offset="14132758">They happened to lose that case, but that was their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.815" offset="14142894">In H Enterprises, they took the position that the disallowance of interest rule had to be applied on a consolidated basis, and they won the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.025" offset="14183749">What happened in that case was the taxpayer argued that they had borrowing in one company, and the tax exempt bonds in another company, and that you shouldn't look at the two together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.024" offset="14223769">But H Enterprises is... clearly provides that you look at the whole thing as one, and there was no regulation that said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.134" offset="14256161">The other point I want to make is that the Government seems to think that you can kind of have a... it's not very important as to how close the definition of separate taxable income may come to net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.548" offset="14313839">I think that is, in a sense, totally irrelevant because the statute says, you look at the net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.564" offset="14341947">The regulations have provided for a net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.570" offset="14353963">It's the consolidated net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.450" offset="14361486">I see no reason why it would even look at separate taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.778" offset="14378727">The question is, we have the regulations provision for the separate net operating loss, and the issue is, to what degree does that net operating loss that everyone agrees can be carried back three years... to what extent is it attributable to product liability deductions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.798" offset="14446854">When we come up with the number, that's the product liability loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.757" offset="14462737">And that's the end of the matter, and you don't need a regulation to tell you to get there, because the statute is clear on its face, and the Service has put in the regulation the definition of net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.435" offset="14509444">Thank you.</text>
