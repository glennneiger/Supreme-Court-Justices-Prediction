            <text syncTime="11.044" offset="196652">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.523" offset="218595">This is a business tort action based entirely on State law, filed in the Maryland State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.576" offset="250777">The suit was filed within Maryland's time limits, but the Maryland courts believed that they could not entertain the suit because it was barred by operation of Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.880" offset="315979">It was barred, they believed, because a Federal district court in California had dismissed an earlier assertion of the claim on the ground that it was untimely under the California statute of limitations and it declared that dismissal to be on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.191" offset="381285">Now, that earlier California case had been filed by the plaintiffs in State court and, of course, we now know it was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.125" offset="417021">If the case had remained in State court and had been dismissed as untimely by the State court, it is absolutely clear that under California law it would not have precluded the suit in Maryland, and that's because the California supreme court has stated repeatedly that dismissals based on the statute of limitations do not extinguish the substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.385" offset="510017">So far as California is concerned--</text>

            <text syncTime="128.452" offset="666333">--Well, certainly if it... if Maryland was borrowing the California statute of limitations it would certainly have to give credit, but even if it was relying--</text>

            <text syncTime="135.676" offset="695173">No, suppose the statutes were exactly parallel, and the issues were exactly parallel, but a disputed issue of fact as to whether or not there had been tolling?</text>

            <text syncTime="145.581" offset="734879">There would be issue preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.944" offset="740312">But of course Maryland might have a different definition of what constitutes fraud, in which case the finding of fact in California would not necessarily dispose of the comparable question under the Maryland statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.032" offset="792661">There was a close question here about exactly how much knowledge do you have to have to be compelled to file.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="166.300" offset="817739">So there is some instance in which California's judgment has extraterritorial effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.307" offset="845742">It might have issue-preclusive effect, but what the California supreme court has been very clear about is that so far as your right to assert the underlying... you still possess your underlying tort rights, this being a tort suit, even though we have dismissed this suit on the basis of the statute of limitations.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="190.863" stopTime="202.899">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="190.863" offset="915959">If it's an ordinary statute of limitations; but suppose it was what was once called a built-in statute of limitations, a proscription period that bars not merely the remedy, but the very right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="202.899" stopTime="265.846">
            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="202.899" offset="964129">Well, surely, if California had a statute and it was construed to mean that it bars the right, then yes, that would preclude you going to another State.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.879" offset="999969">We would agree with that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.983" offset="1008433">But here, California is clear that its general statutes of limitations do not have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.541" offset="1030689">Now, as a result, when the defendant removed the California case to the Federal court and immediately moved to dismiss, so it's clear that it understood at the time it was removing, we're going to move to dismiss this case based on the statute of limitations, but by moving it from the State court to the Federal court and getting the exact same ruling, a ruling on California law, because, of course, the Federal court was obliged to apply the State's statute of limitations, by getting that ruling in a Federal court, it is now claimed, and the Maryland courts accepted the claim, that the rights which California's statute of limitations preserve had been extinguished because the statute of limitations was applied by the Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.826" offset="1315842">We... I mean, if Erie, for example, is a Federal rule, if Dupasseur is a Federal rule, then yes, we would agree that it is a Federal rule, but the Federal rule is that the State's determination controls, so in some sense, clearly it is a Federal rule, because this Court decides what law applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.706" offset="1443319">Well, absolutely, that we regard as the critical... for us, the critical threshold question is, we must persuade you that Rule 41(b) is not a rule of preclusion, or that if it is, it violates the Rules Enabling Act, because it is substantive, and so let me turn to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.740" offset="1515417">Rule 41(b) we submit for five reasons should be not understood to be a rule of preclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.854" offset="1639969">It isn't termed as a rule of issue preclusion, because Rule 41(b) says that unless it's a jurisdictional thing it counts as a dismissal on the merits, even though nothing may have been adjudicated, so it may be that 41(b) would be applicable despite the absence of any specific issue of adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.116" offset="1748952">I think the answer is, they may well be barred, but it's not 41(b) that causes the bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.319" offset="1809765">--Yes, five reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.582" offset="1818856">The first is the text, and I'll come to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.399" offset="1826066">Let me just rattle off the five, and then I'll go back and talk about each of them if time permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.465" offset="1842366">The first is the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.027" offset="1848635">It is not by its terms a rule-preclusion provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.870" offset="1863995">Secondly, that's not inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.916" offset="1876221">As the advisory committee notes, and states repeatedly, the Federal rules do not state rules of preclusion and it would be improper if they attempted to do so, because such rules are substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.975" offset="1924390">The third is this Court's decisions since the Federal rules were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.373" offset="1946020">Now, this Court has not had a preclusion case involving a State law diversity action since the rules were enacted, but it's had a number of Federal question cases, and so it's had an opportunity to discuss what are the sources of the preclusion rule that the Court applies in Federal question cases and it has never suggested that the source is Rule 41(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="470.492" offset="2034523">Quite the contrary, the Court has repeatedly said these rules of preclusion are judge-made and the decisions of this Court that we have the power to determine when exceptions to the general rule are appropriate, et cetera, so that it's clear that this court does not understand Rule 41(b) to be directing the answer to rule preclusion questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.565" offset="2118741">The fourth, and I hope I have time to explain this, is that the rule would be incongruous and in some respects implausible in operation if it were a rule preclusion law, and the fifth is that it would violate the Rules Enabling Act and would undermine important questions of sensitivity to State interests, these being things that would cause the Court, when in doubt, to interpret it as not being a rule of preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.628" offset="2223022">Let me start with the text, because the argument on the other side is principally that the words of 41(b) are a rule of preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.931" offset="2264191">The words of 41(b) are that a dismissal, unless it's in one of the exceptions, quote, operates as a judgment on the merits, end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.979" offset="2308390">Now, it doesn't say how a judgment on the merits operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.609" offset="2330960">Often, judgments on the merits do operate to be rule... to be claim-preclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1257.792" offset="5183636">Secondly, even if you are foreclosed from pursuing that claim in California, you can take the same set of facts and say, well, we first alleged it as a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.203" offset="5221357">That was untimely, but those same facts actually add up to a breach of contract, and California will allow you to refile and pursue the claim as a contract claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.901" offset="5260123">But thirdly, the California court has expressly said, and this is the Western Coal case, which is cited in our brief at page 48, that even if you are precluded from coming back to the courts in California you are free to go to a sister State if they are willing to hear the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.646" offset="10507078">I think that's a massive substantive change, to say that a... an adjudication that under State law would not prevent further State litigation, now, because a Federal judge has said this is on the merits will preclude further State litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.721" offset="10647408">What is at issue here is the effect of a judgment of a case that has been adjudicated in a Federal court, where the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure set up a clear system, a signalling system for saying, all voluntary dismissals are not on the merits, are not claim-preclusive, all involuntary dismissals are, that's a default rule unless you otherwise specify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.247" offset="10745524">Now, there may be many reasons why you would think, Justice Scalia, that a Federal judge sitting in diversity ought to make a decision dismissing the case on statute of limitation grounds or any other grounds not claim-preclusive, that the judge ought to specify otherwise, and Rule 41(b) provides for that, so that whatever the reasons are, a Federal court sitting in diversity and a party before that court can say, you should not make this claim-preclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.742" offset="10887525">One of the factors you ought to take into account is the existence of a contrary California law on claim preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.017" offset="10912603">And if the judge insists on not otherwise specifying, or in this case making it absolutely clear, by saying this dismissal is in its entirety with prejudice and on the merits, you can seek relief under Rule 59 from the form of that judgment and you can go to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where they went to contest the merits of the statute of limitations claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.777" offset="11999610">So that you could imagine that the proper thing for a Federal court to do sitting in diversity is to say, well, look, it first looks like there's a direct conflict between 41(b) and State law, because 41(b) says these are all dismissals on the merits, but State law is to the contrary, and I have this otherwise-specifies clause, so I can make an exception, so I could in the sense of Gasperini make an exception where there's a contrary State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.547" offset="12390715">There's a certain oddness here, if you think about it, that we're talking about Erie and Hannah and Federal diversity cases on review of a State court judgment dealing with a matter of State law, because the... it's just as if Judge... suppose Judge Collins had said that she was going to decide this case, clearly erroneously, as a matter of Federal common law business torts, and they didn't appeal it to the Ninth Circuit, they didn't seek cert from that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.801" offset="14143741">For three reasons, I think they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.759" offset="14155548">First, the advisory committee has said it is not the function of the rendering court, the first court, to worry about the res judicata effect of its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.087" offset="14196821">That's in the advisory committee notes to Rule 23(c) in 1966, and that is a traditional Hornbook rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.328" offset="14225765">The rendering court doesn't sit around and say, now, let's see what the preclusive effect of my decision will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.683" offset="14251261">Secondly, it would be--</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.136" offset="14281040">--Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.454" offset="14282294">Well, to the law of the rendition court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.912" offset="14288146">Not to the court itself, but to the law of the state of the rendition court, that's correct, Your Honor, but you rarely see an opinion in which the opinion ends by saying, and I think this decision ought to have res judicata effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.563" offset="14334748">I mean, it just isn't done, and the rules committee said it's not being done in the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.946" offset="14356273">Secondly, it would be too complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.169" offset="14365155">Preclusive of what, as Justice Kennedy asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.497" offset="14374454">Every decision precludes some things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.557" offset="14386784">The Court's going to have to write a Hornbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.573" offset="14394830">If it's... if the argument is, State law isn't preclusive of certain things, Your Honor, you should tailor your order appropriately, the parties are going to sit there and analyze the entire jurisprudence of that State in order to write in what it does preclude and what it does not preclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.490" offset="14462435">It would be an impossible task.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.339" offset="14469853">And thirdly, it would mean that you would have constant appeals, because districts... we now have created a whole other issue to litigate in the rendering court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.133" offset="14509037">Parties might not ultimately decide to bring a second lawsuit, but they're got to worry that in case I might I'd sure better get this thing right, and we are going to have endless litigation in that first court, and it will be a Federal court, because we're talking about Rule 41 here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.232" offset="14577478">Now, the third point I want to make is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.692" offset="14591270">There's something very asymmetric about this.</text>
