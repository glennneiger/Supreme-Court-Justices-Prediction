            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000">The second case which I have to announce is No. 00-391, Florida against Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.738">Here, a respondent Robert Thomas got out of his car in the driveway of a home where police were investigating drug sales and encountered an officer at the rear of his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.458">The officer arrested Thomas on an outstanding warrant, took him inside the house and searched the car finding drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.905">The Trial Court suppressed the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.634">The Court of Appeals of Florida reversed saying the search was valid under our decision in a case called New York against Belton where we held that an officer who makes the lawful custodial arrest of a car’s occupant may search the car’s passenger compartment incident to that arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.505">The Supreme Court of Florida in turn reversed that court saying that, Belton is limited to situations where the officer initiates conduct with the vehicle’s occupant while the person is still in the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.875">The Court remanded the case to the Trial Court to decide whether the search was valid under another of our cases called Chimel against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.253">We granted certiorari to determine whether Belton is subject to the limits that the Supreme Court of Florida imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.302">But because we find that Court’s judgment is not final, we dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of jurisdiction in a unanimous opinion filed with the Clerk today.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.928">We are authorized by statute to review final judgments of State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.512">In four categories of cases set out in Cox Broadcasting Company against Cohn, we have treated State Court judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes although further proceeding will take place in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.589">But none of these categories fits the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court and much as Justice Souter just said about Tax Law, the law of jurisdiction of final judgments is not terribly easy to explain orally and no more interesting to hear probably.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.264">So, I will leave you with the idea which is true, that we therefore dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of jurisdiction.</text>
