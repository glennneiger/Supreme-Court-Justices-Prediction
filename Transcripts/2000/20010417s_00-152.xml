            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92699">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 00-152 Lujan versus G&amp;G Fire Sprinklers, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.575" offset="126972">The California Labor Code authorizes the State to withhold payments due to a contractor on a public works project if a subcontractor on that project fails to comply with certain prevailing wage requirements of the Code, and it permits the contractor in turn to withhold the similar sums from the sub.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.223" offset="209519">Respondent G&amp;G, a fire protection company, has served as a sub on several California public works projects, payments was withheld from it, pursuant to the statutory plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.749" offset="255599">G&amp;G sued the petitioners, various State officials and State agencies under Section 1983, claiming that the withholding of payments without a hearing deprived G&amp;G of property, without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.771" offset="319755">The District Court agreed, declared the relevant Code provisions unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.038" offset="340758">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.821" offset="351938">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.082" offset="364999">We assume without deciding that payments were withheld from respondent under color of state law, and the respondent has a property interest in its claim for payment under its contract, but we conclude that because California law affords G&amp;G sufficient opportunity to pursue its claim in State Court, the Labor Code does not deprived of its claim with due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.537" offset="462802">In cases involving deprivation of present entitlements, such as the right of ownership in property, the right to pursue a gainful occupation, we have held the due process requires a reasonably prompt hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.746" offset="515674">The G&amp;G has no present entitlement, it has only a claim that it complied with the terms of its contracts and therefore it has entitled to be paid in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.415" offset="554335">G&amp;Gâ€™s interest in its claim can be fully protected by an ordinary breach of contract suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.596" offset="578995">We believe that such a suit is available to it either under the California Labor Code or state common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.852" offset="604072">We therefore hold that the relevant provisions of the Code do not deprive respondent of property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.040" offset="632807">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
