            <text syncTime="7.680" offset="182028">Mr. Sutton.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="8.711" offset="186103">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.541" offset="205434">There are two arguments that I would like to press this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.347" offset="216614">The first is that a timely notice of appeal may never be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction solely because it lacks a signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.256" offset="256320">The second is an alternative argument, and that's that a typewritten signature would suffice to meet any such requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.058" offset="287458">Let me start with the sixth circuit's review of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.690" offset="301982">In their view, there is a jurisdictional signature requirement in light of the thirty-day rule under Appellate Rule 4, and in light of Civil Rule 11, which indeed does contain a signature requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.505" offset="353287">The problem with the Sixth Circuit's reliance on Civil Rule 11 is that it not only contains a signature requirement, but it also contains a remedy for the absence of a signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.567" offset="397486">And in this particular case, everyone agrees... the court-appointed amicus curiae included... that Mr. Becker was never given an opportunity to correct this omission of a signature, whether at the district court or the court of appeals level.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="75.380" stopTime="80.248">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="75.380" offset="452761">I should know this... when you file a notice of appeal, do you file with the district court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_s_sutton" startTime="80.248" stopTime="81.157">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Sutton</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="81.157" offset="475853">So Rule 11 applies at that point?</text>

          <turn speaker="jeffrey_s_sutton" startTime="83.220" stopTime="112.820">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="83.220" offset="484108">It does technically.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.328" offset="492572">In fact, Appellate Rule 1 arguably acknowledges that when it says all filings in a district court... all filings in the courts of appeals that have been made through district courts have to comply with district court rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.338" offset="540637">So it does seem, as odd as it would appear, that Civil Rule 11 does apply to a notice of appeal, keeping in mind that Civil Rule 11 is pretty broad in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.098" offset="579612">It says pleadings and quote other papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.341" offset="592568">So arguably that does include a notice of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.344" offset="680653">It is problematic, Your Honor, and I think the answer is Appellate Rule 1 which does, as I noted, make clear that you do have to comply with the district court rules and the Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.035" offset="723390">In light of Appellate Rule 1, a court of appeals or a court of appeals clerk's office would be fully within its rights to contact in this case Mr. Becker, saying, Mr. Becker, we see you've typed your signature.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="257.096" offset="1179592">Mr. Sutton, could we go back to your answer to Justice Kennedy about Rule 11... isn't the answer on the other side that once you file the notice of appeal, authority over the case passes from the district court to the court of appeals, so at that point, up until the notice of appeal, you're in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.960" offset="1255138">Once you file that notice, you are in the court of appeals and Rule 11 is a rule directed to district court and not the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.711" offset="1290142">So the cure that Rule 11 provides, at least so the argument goes, would not be available in the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.596" offset="1321594">--And Your Honor, that is why I was relying on Appellate Rule 1 which incorporates those rules, and that would therefore give appellate courts authority to make sure that someone did correct the signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.967" offset="1359106">If they wanted at that point to decide, well, if you're not going to correct it... you're going to be unrepentant when it comes to this particular requirement, at that point we are going to dismiss your appeal, and in fact will do so on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.199" offset="1420023">I mean, you could argue it the other way that if indeed a signature is required and you file it without a signature in the court of appeals, it is ineffective and so the case remains in the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.716" offset="1466103">What the court has said and what the rules reflect is that as soon as the district court clerk receives the notice of appeal, it doesn't say anything about validity, it is immediately sent to the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.317" offset="1512497">And I think... but I think that does raise a second answer to Mr. Baker's argument... the point Justice Ginsburg is getting at, it is true that to find a notice of appeal immediately vests jurisdiction in the court of appeals over the merits of the case, but that doesn't preclude district courts from acting on collateral matters; that's when they can act on stay motions, bond motions, attorney fee motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.091" offset="1591595">This arguably could be such a collateral act.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.524" offset="1601313">It wouldn't go to the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.927" offset="1606955">It would, however, and I think there would be one problem here, and that would be interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.789" offset="1630361">The district courts would have authority to enforce this as a jurisdictional rule, and you would have district court judges dismissing appeals of their own cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.889" offset="8498789">I think the reason that it can't be is that the signature requirement has been pulled into Rule 3 for pro se parties by the direct reference to an expectation that the pro se party will sign the notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.070" offset="8563572">It is hard to read that language without coming to the conclusion that there is something about the notice of appeal, and the standards for notice of appeal, that is... that requires a signature from pro se parties, and there are good, obviously policy, reasons for wanting to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.649" offset="8689901">I think though that the principal problem that the signature requirement addresses is the risk that someone is practicing law... probably without a license... on behalf of a party who may or may not understand what is being done in his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.336" offset="8752595">The signature requirement allows the court to be sure that the party who is nominally appearing pro se in fact has had a chance to think about what he is doing, and to examine the contents of what has been filed in his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.083" offset="8807556">That is the reason that in multiple appellant cases... this rule has been applied without controversy, yet because it is obvious there that one party may be proceeding to draft pleadings that the others may not have seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.943" offset="8867011">But in the context of single appellants as well, there are numerous areas of law where there is an active cottage industry of assisting pro se litigants... not just prison cases but bankruptcy cases, immigration cases, where people who hold themselves out as grievance consultants or other forms of quasi-lawyer, have taken to filing pro se papers on behalf of parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.776" offset="8974322">The signature requirement at least requires that those pro se parties have a chance to see what has been done in their names.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.201" offset="9416105">Indeed, if you look at the... at the lower lefthand corner of each of those documents, you'll see that each of them is labeled 6CA3, which is the name of the... the number of the form.</text>

            <text syncTime="2743.797" offset="11126394">I think that's been addressed at considerable length already.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.051" offset="11143426">My first point, and I apologize for raising it at this stage, is there is a question whether this is fairly covered by the question presented, but the Court drafted a question presented that presumes there has been a failure to sign here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.498" offset="11209254">It did so after the petitioner had filed a petition that made reference to some of the cases that address the question whether a signed notice of appeal could be... whether a signing constituted typing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.032" offset="11275396">So there is a real question whether the Court in framing this question didn't exclude this issue or--</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.306" offset="11308519">--You're saying we've proceeded on the assumption that there was a failure to sign.</text>

            <text syncTime="2807.782" offset="11382394">If I could turn also to the question of a lawyer not signing... I think Mr. Sutton made the argument that an attorney... if you were a represented party and you did not sign, it would not be jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.299" offset="11464418">If you were a non-represented party and you did not sign, it would be jurisdictional, and that there would be some doubt about that possibility raised the prospect, I think, of people trying to game the system by rushing out and hiring lawyers or having lawyers submit things that weren't signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.024" offset="11527321">I think it's worth remembering this is not a difficult requirement to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.194" offset="11544039">Signing the notice of appeal is an easy thing to do; it provides useful confirmation to the court that every party who is part of the notice of appeal actually has seen and has willingly joined in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.009" offset="11595344">And so the likelihood that people will game this system in order to avoid signing the notice of appeal I think is... is highly unlikely.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.680" offset="12901989">First of all, in defense of Dale Becker, the form he used is actually the form that's now attached to the Sixth Circuit rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.707" offset="12926126">It is not outdated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.533" offset="12929365">It is attached to their current rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.648" offset="12933858">Second, the notion that prison inmates should be consulting websites to get the forms doesn't seem to me plausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.502" offset="12961235">Third, when it comes to the forms that Mr. Baker has relied upon, if you look at our yellow brief, there is a great irony here to his argument that this signature rule only applies to pro se appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.648" offset="13005852">Every one of the forms refers to signatures for attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.280" offset="13020376">If you look at the one that's attached to the Federal Rules... that's at A-1... it's clear the signature requirement is not for the pro se... it says the s and then attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.682" offset="13061963">And then you look at Mr Becker's... Baker's... Becker's form, it's counsel for appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.612" offset="13081711">You then look at the next one and it has attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.574" offset="13089548">Every single one of them, if there is a signature requirement at all, it's referring to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.949" offset="13107102">There is no indication that pro se litigants and pro se litigants alone are expected to sign these things in whatever manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.348" offset="13132598">Every other point that Mr. Baker has raised... and there are many policy problems out there... they are all problems that show at most there is a signature requirement, not a signature jurisdictional requirement.</text>
