            <text syncTime="32.201" offset="278102">In June 1993 when this Court handed down its decision in Sullivan v. Louisiana, it did something it had done in only five other instances which spanned the preceding seventy six years... it characterized an error as structural.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.867" offset="348738">The holding of the Sullivan decision, which reaffirmed and explained this Court's decision in Cage, is what makes Melvin Tyler's conviction unconstitutional, but it is the Court's rationale underlying the Sullivan decision that makes Sullivan retroactively available to Melvin Tyler, and that is because the rationale underlying Sullivan also satisfies the second exception to Teague's policy of nonretroactivity to cases on collateral review.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.525" offset="495441">The statutory argument is, Your Honor, that EDPA in this case would be purely theoretical if this Court finds that Mr. Tyler's case satisfies the second Teague exception.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert V. Larson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="269.402" offset="1226974">--that Cage was meant to be applied retroactively, and that unmistakable import was received by seven circuit courts of appeal that have applied Cage retroactively since Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.065" offset="1281622">Every lower court that has considered the new rule in Cage since this Court's holding in Sullivan has said that Sullivan compels the application of Cage on a retroactive basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.491" offset="1331255">The respondent in this case and amici have advanced two principal arguments for denying Melvin Tyler relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.721" offset="1376186">The first would be the language of EDPA which requires that a matter relies on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court that was previously unavailable, and then finally this Court's holding in Teague v. Lane that new rules of constitutional law cannot be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review unless they fall within one of two, as the Court has described, narrow exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.730" offset="1496244">As I said in response to Chief Justice's question, from our perspective now that we are before the Court, the first obstacle is purely theoretical.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.875" offset="1540862">If this Court should decide that Teague requires that the new rule announced in Cage as explained by Sullivan should be applied retroactively, and it simply says in this case, which it has the power to do, and as all... as amici has conceded, that it's made retroactive and applies it to Mr. Tyler's case, and that resolves the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.684" offset="1640022">Obviously, not every case that turns on the meaning of 2244(b)(2)(A) is going to be heard by this Court, so if the Court decides that it should address the statutory question now, we would submit that the better interpretation is the one that has been offered by the Third and the Ninth Circuits in the two cases of West v. Vaughn and Flowers v. Walter... that the phrase made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court does not require the express ruling of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.753" offset="1788293">We are not saying, as the Ninth Circuit has said in Flowers v. Walter, that all cases that should be retroactive under Teague are, in fact, retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.089" offset="1841688">We are simply saying that the word made in this case should be given its simple plain meaning of caused to be the case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="431.263" stopTime="438.732">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="431.263" offset="1874393">But I think an equally simple plain meeting is to say, made retroactive would be that this Court has said they were retroactive.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_v_larson_jr" startTime="438.732" stopTime="546.146">
            <label>Mr. Herbert V. Larson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="438.732" offset="1904277">That would be, Your Honor, but if that were to be the case, it creates an entire host of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.412" offset="1934997">First, I think that the Court... that Congress had before it the possibility of a wide variety of language such as held by, determined to be retroactive by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.301" offset="1982540">The first is that this... the use of the word made as not requiring an express decision by this Court avoids the unequal treatment of similarly situated petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.099" offset="2033740">You would have a first petitioner who received the... who a lower court could say, well, yes, the Court had made that new rule retroactive, whereas a second petitioner identically situated for Teague purposes would not receive the benefit of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.651" offset="2099882">The second is that this interpretation of made retroactive is the only one that works with the statute of limitations that EDPA has created.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.706" offset="2148156">If... if we are to interpret the rule as requiring an express ruling from this Court that something has been made retroactive, when the statute of limitations begins to run when the new rule has been recognized, as we pointed out in our briefs, you could have a statute of limitations expiring before this Court ever ruled on whether something had been made retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.247" offset="2262259">On the other hand, if you were to take the position of the Solicitor General that maybe the statute of limitations doesn't begin running until this Court recognizes the retroactivity for successive petitions, the statute of limitations would never begin to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.455" offset="2327147">So you would have successive--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="546.146" offset="2333939">On the other hand there is a thirty day requirement in the court of appeals to determine whether or not to decide the issue, and that indicates, it seems to me, that the only thing they can do is look to see whether this Court has decided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.413" offset="2415023">Because otherwise they have to decide a difficult substantive issue within thirty days.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.500" offset="2431324">It does not seem to me that that is consistent with the statutory scheme.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_v_larson_jr" startTime="573.722" stopTime="652.279">
            <label>Mr. Herbert V. Larson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="573.722" offset="2444176">--Well, but that's precisely the type of decision that lower courts make every day in terms of first petitions, as was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.405" offset="2490987">The Fifth Circuit had determined that Sullivan had been made retroactive... Cage had been made retroactive by Sullivan, and it applied it to all first petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.311" offset="2538530">So I don't think, Your Honor, that we're placing an additional burden on the lower court because, quite candidly, we are only talking about a very, very, very small category of new rules that would have been made retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.103" offset="2601747">In fact, in the eleven decisions that this... in which this Court has considered new rules of law since Teague was handed down, none have been found to qualify for the second Teague exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.272" offset="2654409">In fact, this would be the first new rule under the second Teague exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.814" offset="2672591">So to respond more fully to your question, Your Honor, I do not think we are placing an undue burden on the lower courts, because Your Honors' interpretation of requiring an express ruling from this Court would mean that a successive habeas petitioner under a new rule was either too early or too late, but never on time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.899" offset="7824878">That is, what their argument is... I mean you might find it easier to address the specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.107" offset="7841701">The specific, I take it, is that before Cage and Sullivan, people always understood that judges can make mistakes on jury instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.964" offset="7885169">They do every day of the week, and some are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.103" offset="7897707">But after Cage and Sullivan, we suddenly see that a misdescription of the reasonable doubt standard is like no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.224" offset="7934174">It is so important that automatically you get a new trial no matter what.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.592" offset="7955699">The only other thing that compares is not having a lawyer at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.512" offset="7971373">So before the two cases we thought, yes, you could make a mistake in the instructions, maybe even a bad one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.532" offset="7999480">After the instructions, we recognized that that kind of mistake is unique among all others and like not having a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.025" offset="8037410">Now, that's their argument, I think, as to the significance in you're reshaping our legal thinking about a jury standard misdescription.</text>

            <text syncTime="3280.411" offset="13270991">I think the Court could do it because the question would really come down to whether the word made retroactive had a temporal component, that is, it had to have been done at the time he filed the petition, or whether it could be done some time later in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.816" offset="13328564">And it's our view that it doesn't necessarily have that temporal component.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.070" offset="13345596">If you thought that it did have that temporal component, then you would stop after the first question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.702" offset="13876091">This instruction was not given in all criminal cases in Orleans Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.871" offset="13892809">It would also be subject to the statute of limitations under EDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.238" offset="13914230">Following Sullivan, people had to file Cage claims saying I had a Cage instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.131" offset="13941815">And so the number of people... and this is based purely on an estimate from inmate counsel at the Louisiana State Prison... there might be fifty or sixty people still in prison who had gotten a Cage instruction and, even then, since we are only dealing with the retroactivity issue, they would still have to surmount all of the very formidable procedural obstacles that otherwise apply in habeas cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.984" offset="14041289">The reason that Mr. Tyler did not raise this in his first petition to Federal court is because it wasn't available to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.289" offset="14194471">Not one judge in any of those courts has ever suggested that Sullivan did not compel a finding that Cage was to be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.282" offset="14234491">In terms of whether there is some ground between Gideon and Cage in terms of watershed rules, I would suggest that in Justice Harlen's concurring opinion in Mackey, he made it clear that that category, that second category, does have cases, and that cases will arise in that second category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.323" offset="14322576">It's not an empty box as one of the amici suggested in their brief, it is a box into which we put rules, new rules of law, that are fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.007" offset="14369387">And what is fundamental about Sullivan is that it tells us that if a jury is given a yardstick that is two feet long, that's not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.697" offset="14412124">It has to be accurate because that is the central point of any jury trial, criminal jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.673" offset="14440022">There are some decisions that are... some errors that are so fundamental that a conviction obtained with that type of process should never be final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.357" offset="14486729">That's what Justice Harlen recognized in his entire retroactivity doctrine.</text>
