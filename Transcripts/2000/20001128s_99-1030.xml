            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92782">The opinion of the Court in No. 99-1030, City of Indianapolis versus Edmond will be announced by Justice Oâ€™Connor.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="9.078" stopTime="244.141">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.078" offset="129040">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.977" offset="152655">In August 1998, the City of Indianapolis started a highway checkpoint program.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.986" offset="176687">The primary purpose of the program is the interdiction of illegal narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.694" offset="195495">The party stipulated in the case that the checkpoints were being conducted in accordance with written guidelines, under which the police stop a predetermined number of vehicles at each checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.715" offset="243561">An officer informs the driver, that the driver is being stopped at a drug checkpoint, and asked for the license and registration of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.810" offset="283998">The officer looks for signs of impairment and examines the vehicle from the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.204" offset="305523">A narcotics detection dog walks around the outside of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.717" offset="323600">The city conducted six of these drug roadblocks between August and November 1998, stopping over 1100 vehicles and arresting approximately 9% of the motorists stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.439" offset="378457">Roughly half the arrests were for drug related offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.634" offset="395280">The respondents filed a Class Action Suit after being stopped at one of these checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.756" offset="415760">The District Court denied a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.148" offset="429344">A divided panel of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the checkpoints violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.705" offset="459541">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.431" offset="486500">In Michigan Department of State police versus Sitz, we approved a sobriety vehicle checkpoint for the purpose of combating drunk driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.751" offset="527773">In United States versus Martinez-Fuerte, we approved vehicle checkpoints near the Mexican border for the purpose of intercepting illegal immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.060" offset="576988">These cases are examples of limited exceptions to the general rule that a search or seizure is ordinarily unreasonable in the absence of individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.426" offset="630486">Considerations specifically related to the need to police national borders were significant factor in the Martinez-Fuerte decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.741" offset="667685">In Sitz, there was a close connection between the imperative of roadway safety and the law enforcement practice at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.869" offset="704256">Likewise, we suggested in the case of Delaware versus Prouse, that a State could constitutionally set up a roadblock for checking licenses and registrations of the vehicle in order to serve the violent for sub-highway safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.208" offset="769562">We distinguished roadway safety interest from the general interest in crime control.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.073" offset="797043">The petitioners concede and the evidence shows that the primary purpose of the checkpoints in this case is to interdict illegal narcotic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.372" offset="838212">This purpose is ultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.417" offset="862349">As a result we hold that the Indianapolis drug checkpoint program violates the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.484" offset="886695">A low traffic in illegal narcotics create social harms of the first magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.944" offset="912504">The gravity of the threat alone could not be dispositive of what means law enforcement officers may use to pursue a given end.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.547" offset="946882">Our holding today is limited to checkpoints whose primary purpose is general crime control.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.229" offset="969660">It does not address other programatic searches or seizures, aimed primarily at purposes beyond the general interest in crime control.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.148" offset="1005291">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas joins and in which Justice Scalia joins as to part 1 I believe; Justice Thomas has also filed the dissenting opinion.</text>
