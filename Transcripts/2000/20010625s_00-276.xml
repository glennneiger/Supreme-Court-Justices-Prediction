            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92648">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in United States versus United Foods, No. 00-276.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.012" offset="124622">Four terms ago in Glickman v. Wileman Brothers, we rejected a First Amendment challenge of the constitutionality of a series of agricultural marketing orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.295" offset="169761">As part of a larger regulatory marketing scheme, those orders required producers of certain California tree fruits to pay assessments for product advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.562" offset="214797">In the case now before us, a federal statue mandates assessments on the handlers of fresh mushrooms for product advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.075" offset="248860">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the mandated payments were not part of a more comprehensive statutory program for marketing, and it held the assessments were invalid under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.161" offset="297239">We granted certiorari and in an opinion for the Court authored by Justice Kennedy we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.140" offset="321167">We have used standards for determining the validity of speech regulations, which accord less protection to commercial speech than to other expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.869" offset="356067">Even when we to view commercial speech as entitled to some lesser of protection, we find no basis in either Glickman or under our First Amendment precedents to sustain the compelled assessment sought in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.398" offset="414163">First Amendment values are at serious risk if the government can compel a particular citizen or a discrete group of citizens to pay subsidies for speech on the side that it favors, and there is no apparent principle, which would accept minor debates such as those about mushrooms in this case, from that general principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.360" offset="498068">The program sustained in Glickman differs from the one under review in a fundamental aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.099" offset="520952">In Glickman the mandated assessments for speech were ancillary to a more comprehensive program restricting market autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.466" offset="558464">Here, for all practical purposes, the advertising itself, far from being ancillary, is the principle object of the regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.703" offset="595453">Mushroom producers are not forced to associate as a group, which makes cooperative decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.328" offset="621889">A proper application of the rule in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, a long standing precedent of this Court, requires us to invalidate the instant statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.794" offset="671730">Under Abood only an overriding associational purpose allows any compelled subsidy for speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.955" offset="700465">Here the only program the government contends the compelled contributions serve is the very advertising scheme in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.655" offset="731185">Were it sufficient to say speech is germane to itself, the limits observed in the Abood line of cases would be empty of meaning in significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.843" offset="767966">So, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.907" offset="780191">Justices Stevens and Thomas have filed concurring opinions; Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joins, and in which Justice Oâ€™Connor joins as to parts 1 and 3.</text>
