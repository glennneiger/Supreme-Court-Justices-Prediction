            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92946">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.143" offset="105485">The first is 99-1178, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County versus the Untied States Army Corps of Engineers. Here the Solid Waste Agency purchased an abandoned sand and gravel pit of the disposal of its baled non-hazardous waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.673" offset="171627">The balefill project called for some of the sites permanent and seasonal ponds to be filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.462" offset="194719">Under a Section of the Clean Water Act, passed by Congress, the Army Corps of Engineers has regulatory authority over the discharge of fill material into navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.985" offset="236828">The Corps has interpreted this language to include discharge into non-navigable, isolated, intrastate waters observed as a habitat for migratory birds.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.758" offset="275908">The Corps found that the ponds of the old mining site fell under this so-called Migratory Bird Rule and refused to issue a discharge permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.766" offset="311957">The Solid Waste Agency filed suit arguing that the Corps has exceeded its statutory authority in interpreting Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.776" offset="344035">The District Court rejected its argument and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.935" offset="364619">It held that the Clean Water Act reached as many waters as the Commerce Clause allowed, and that the destruction of habitat for migratory birds substantially affects interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.361" offset="406311">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.147" offset="421462">The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters as waters of the United States, although we have previously held that the Act extends the wetlands actually abutting on a navigable waterway.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.968" offset="468796">We have never held that it extends to isolated ponds that have no significant nexus to navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.737" offset="495859">The plain meaning of the statue precludes us from doing so now.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.524" offset="511010">Congress intended the term navigable to have at least some import, and the Corps’ position would require to read it out of the statute completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.301" offset="546118">Nonetheless, the Corps submits that the amendments of the Clean Water Act in 1977 demonstrate Congress’ awareness of and acquiescence to the Migratory Bird Rule, but this subsequent legislative history does not convinced us that Congress intended to displace the original meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.412" offset="622500">The Corps also contends that the Bird Rule is reasonable and should it be afforded deference, but warrant administrative interpretation of the statute invokes the outer limits of Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.580" offset="675163">We expect a clear indication that Congress intended that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.551" offset="691150">The exertion of federal authority under the Migratory Bird Rule raises significant constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.842" offset="716228">Yet there is nothing approaching a clear statement from Congress that it intended to regulate isolated, intrastate ponds.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.981" offset="744858">We therefore hold the Corps exceeded its authority under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act in asserting jurisdiction over the Solid Waste Agency’s side.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.935" offset="784668">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer join.</text>
