            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92657">The opinion of the Court in No. 99-1331, Lewis versus Lewis &amp; Clark Marine Inc. will be announced by Justice O’Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.243" offset="129542">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.448" offset="154410">The petitioner James Lewis claims he was injured while on board the respondent Lewis &amp; Clark ship while working as a deckhand.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.697" offset="199341">The petitioner sued the respondent for his injuries in the Illinois State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.892" offset="220135">The petitioner did not ask for a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.296" offset="233823">In anticipation of petitioner’s lawsuit, the respondent ship owner filed a complaint in Federal District Court under the Limitation of Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.064" offset="280843">The Limitation Act grants vessel owners the right to seek limited liability in Federal Court for claims of damage aboard their vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.136" offset="325147">Another federal statute grants exclusive jurisdiction to Federal Courts over admiralty and maritime claims, but that statute also has a clause that saves the suitors like petitioners, their choice of remedies including remedies in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.378" offset="402156">The Federal District Court noted the potential tension between the Limitation Act and the saving to suitors clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.492" offset="438623">The District Court eventually allowed the petitioner to proceed with his claims in State Court after the petitioner provided certain stipulations and waivers assuring the District Court that respondent’s right to seek limitation of liability in Federal Court would be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.230" offset="513542">The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the District Court, concluding that litigation should have continued in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.125" offset="549068">The Court of Appeals held that respondent had a right to ask for exoneration from liability not just limitation of liability in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.373" offset="598074">The Court of Appeals also held that because petitioner did not ask for a jury trial in State Court, he had not sought a saved remedy under the saving to suitors clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.433" offset="646348">In an opinion filed with Clerk of the Court today, we reverse the judgment of the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.664" offset="671217">As the courts although recognized there is tension between the Limitation Act and the saving to suitors clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.461" offset="698489">The Limitation Act allows vessel owners like respondent to seek limited liability in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.333" offset="729940">The saving to suitors clause gives suitors like petitioner their choice of remedy including remedies in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.781" offset="759720">The tension arises when the vessel owner wants to proceed in Federal Court and the injured suitor wants to proceed in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.183" offset="805382">We believe that District Court properly resolved that tension in this case by allowing the petitioner to proceed with his claims in State Court after having protected respondent’s right to seek limited liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.664" offset="863269">The Court of Appeals contrary conclusion had two defects we think: first, the Limitation Act does not give vessel owners the right to seek exoneration from liability where limitation of liability is not at issue; second, suitors like the petitioner have the right to their choice of remedies in State Court not just the choice of a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.825" offset="959922">The decision of the Court is unanimous.</text>
