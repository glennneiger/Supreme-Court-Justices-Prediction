            <text syncTime="14.113" offset="200478">The Federal Arbitration Act is a declaration of Federal policy favoring arbitration, arbitration agreements, and its coverage extends to the very limits of Congress' Commerce Clause power.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.817" offset="243319">There's an exception to the act, the scope of which is in dispute today.</text>

            <text syncTime="36.920" offset="291698">The act does not say that it excludes all contracts of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.923" offset="307685">Section 1 excludes only certain kinds of employment contracts, the contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.581" offset="358363">Beginning nearly 50 years ago, 11 courts of appeals have read that text in a uniform, consistent manner, finding it to create a narrow exclusion applicable only to those workers who are actually engaged in the movement of people or goods across State lines, and we contend that that's the only interpretation consistent with the text of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.301" offset="1073177">Well, there are several points in response, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.016" offset="1088015">First, the letter from Secretary Hoover was a letter submitted to the committee in 1923, written on the day that it was entered, and there was no further explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.822" offset="1123332">I would also submit that we need to look to the language of the coverage provision, section 2 of the act, and contrast that with the language contained in section 1 of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.928" offset="1171711">I acknowledge that Commerce Clause authority over seamen and railroad employees would have been clear, but I would also point... bring to the Court's attention, of course, the fact that there were statutory mechanisms in place, and also the single item that we know most clearly is that the seamen as a group, through their representative, Mr. Bruce, have specifically asked that they be carved out.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.406" offset="1285605">While it may be somewhat difficult to determine exactly what Congress' motive was, they were responding to a request from a constituency group to be carved out.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="293.102" offset="1316430">Well, the other most troublesome point for me, anyway, is this Court's decision in Allied Bruce, which dealt with section 2, and said that we're going to interpret it now as reaching the full scope of Congress' Commerce Clause power.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.234" offset="1396887">Why would we not do the same for this section 1?</text>

          <turn speaker="david_e_nagle" startTime="316.575" stopTime="351.428">
            <label>Mr. David E. Nagle</label>
            <text syncTime="316.575" offset="1410261">Well, in Allied Bruce, which is one of the cases upon which we would principally rely, that was an interpretation of section 2, the coverage, and certainly was making it clear that the Court recognized that Congress was acting to the full with respect to its Commerce Clause power.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.118" offset="1476508">Section 1 is an exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.135" offset="1484554">It is to be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.356" offset="1497406">I would submit that there is a general policy that whenever we have a statute which clearly enunciates a public policy of broad scope that any exclusion to that should be narrowly construed.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.556" offset="1566265">Why should we unrealistically construe it just because it's an exception?</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.110" offset="8220488">That act referred initially to engaged in, but then on two separate occasions had what we characterize as a temporal limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.974" offset="8267927">It said, while engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.301" offset="8277226">It specifically limited the scope to less than the full commerce power, as would have been expressed by the term, engaged in, and in Shanks and in Behrens, and in several other cases, this Court expressly noted that whether workers were covered by the amended FELA or not, turned upon whether the injury they suffered occurred while they were engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.480" offset="8393941">It didn't focus on the type of work they generally performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.119" offset="8404495">It... for instance, in Behrens, I believe, the worker was working on an interstate... intrastate traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.842" offset="8443365">His job often included interstate traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.396" offset="8457576">He would be engaged in commerce, but because at the time he was hit by the locomotive he was engaged in solely intrastate work, the Court said that, given the temporal limitation of FELA, it doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.737" offset="8502924">So those cases support our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.658" offset="8510656">Shanks in particular supports our position because Shanks goes to... the FELA law was very complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.003" offset="8540018">There were many, many cases coming before this Court trying to decide who is and who is not covered by the various limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.696" offset="8562797">Shanks goes through and summarizes the Supreme Court jurisprudence of the time under FELA and makes very clear that engaged in is as broad as it gets, because it includes not just those narrowly working on the trains as they were going down the tracks, but everyone whose job is sufficiently related as to be practically a part of the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.440" offset="8661749">So at the time, in 1925, engaged in was a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.833" offset="8679303">It was a term of art that reached to the full scope of Congress' commerce power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2145.301" offset="8725174">That explains, we believe, why there was the reference to in... engaged in foreign or interstate commerce, because that was the common use of art whenever--</text>

I'm sorry, with respect to Behrens, had indicated that that applied only to employees who were actually engaged in interstate transportation or closely related functions, and not to other employees that Congress had the constitutional authority to regulate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3099.870" offset="12543440">I would note, as Justice Scalia had pointed out, that this would lead to the anomalous result that a CEO of a multinational corporation who has an arbitration provision in his or her employment contract, that it would not be enforceable pursuant to the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.517" offset="12598088">I would note that in Prima Paint, at note 7, the Court made reference... albeit it in dicta the Court made reference to certain kinds of employment contracts being excluded under section 1, which is consistent with our view that it was not intended to cover the entire range of that which was covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.006" offset="12672067">Ultimately, I would suggest that as the court of appeals have consistently held, the narrow reading of section 1 is the only reason which is based on and consistent with the text, that makes use of the full text and conforms with the principles of statutory construction, so that we don't read words to be meaningless and that we do apply the canon of ejusdem generis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.713" offset="12754823">As this Court noted in Allied Bruce, and particularly in Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion there, there's value in uniformity and stability of the case law which has developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.656" offset="12790663">Since Gilmer, untold number of agreements to arbitrate employment claims have been entered into in reliance, and I would suggest that Congress is certainly well aware of this case law development, has had the opportunity to correct it if they thought the Court had gotten it wrong, and they have declined to do so.</text>
