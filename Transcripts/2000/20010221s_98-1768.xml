            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92952">The second case, I have to announce is No. 98-1768, Buckman Co. versus the Plaintiffs' Legal Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.769" offset="131927">Here the respondent represents plaintiffs who claimed injuries resulting from the use of orthopedic bone’s screws in the pedicles of their spines.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.742" offset="167871">Petitioner is a consulting company that assisted the screws' manufacturer in navigating the federal regulatory process for these devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.094" offset="205279">The plaintiffs’ claim the petitioner statement to the Food and Drug Administration or FDA as to the intended use of the use of these screws fraudulently induced the FDA to give market approval and ultimately led to plaintiffs’ injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.120" offset="265360">The District Court concluded that these State law so-called fraud on the FDA claims were improper under the Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug And Cosmetic Acts or the MDA, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed that decision, saying that there was no express or implied conflict between the plaintiffs’ claims and the MDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.654" offset="359505">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.909" offset="376537">Under the Supremacy Clause United States Constitution, State law claims have conflict with the federal statute are invalid under what is known as the implied preemption doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.762" offset="419901">The plaintiffs fraud on the FDA claims create such a conflict with the regulatory regime established by the MDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.357" offset="450307">The bones screws at issue here were introduced under a provision of the MDA, directing the FDA to approve devices that it determines, are substantially equivalent to a device that is already on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.049" offset="505060">Referred to as the 510(k) process, this exception to the FDA’s more time consuming in normal processes prevents unnecessary delay in the development of competition among medical device manufactures.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.488" offset="566813">The 510(k) process sets forth a comprehensive scheme for deciding whether an applicant’s device qualifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.853" offset="596279">The process also includes various provisions aimed at detecting, deterring, and punishing false statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.575" offset="627208">The statute makes clear that it is the FDA’s responsibility not that of private litigants to issue a measured response to incidence of non-compliance. The FDA is charged with achieving a variety of difficult and often competing statutory objectives and it would inevitably forth that task if plaintiffs at each of the 50 states, were able to bootstraps state tort claims under the federal regulatory regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.973" offset="740789">Both manufacture’s willingness to participate in the approval process and their conduct within that regime would be skewed by fears of unpredictable state litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.905" offset="788541">This would interfere with the FDA’s own judgment is to how best to achieve the statute’s goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.603" offset="811319">The conflict between the MDA and plaintiffs’ fraud on the FDA claims dictates that the latter are impliedly preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.606" offset="843293">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Thomas joins.</text>
