            <text syncTime="169.006" offset="817994">As Justice Black said in Cone v. West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper, when a trial court in ruling on a motion to set aside a trial, to order a new trial, he has a fresh perspective on the evidence, he has just seen it go in, he has also got a fresh perspective on the effect, the impact of the evidence on the jury--</text>

            <text syncTime="222.337" offset="1031363">And the Seventh Amendment certainly has quite different application when you're talking about a trial judge who has accepted the jury's verdict and, on the other hand, a trial judge who has rejected the jury verdict, in effect overridden it and said we have to have a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.079" offset="1106282">I don't know why the same standard of review has to apply to both of those situations when the Seventh Amendment treats them differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.798" offset="1137211">Well, the... there is one minor difference, and that is, the court has to look to whether the trial court applied the proper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.332" offset="1183291">That is, when he sets side a verdict that's contrary to the weight of the evidence, the question is, can a rational judge have made that decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="268.860" offset="1217459">That is, was it clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.690" offset="1236790">Sometimes the evidence would be evidence that juries have particular ability to evaluate, or at least the power is given to them saying witness demeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.661" offset="1284646">There could be other cases in which the matter is not particularly one that's suited to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.084" offset="1318292">I mean, it turns... he gives a new trial because of something to do with a document and its admissibility or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.597" offset="1348385">Would you at least say that where it's a matter that the juries are entrusted with the decision, a trial judge should be particularly careful of granting a new trial contrary to the jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.169" offset="1406690">I mean, what I'm wondering at is... what I'm wondering about is if it perhaps is the same standard, but in applying that same standard you should pay particular attention when you overturn a jury verdict because, judge, the jury has responsibilities to decide things that you don't have.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.946" offset="1501776">That's true, but the trial judge has a much better take on both the force of the evidence and the impact on the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.686" offset="1560708">Suppose this Court said, well, in a sense it's the same standard, but what searching inquiry means is, it means, after all, here you are upholding the jury, not going against the jury, and if you were going against the jury there are many reasons why you should be very careful.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.688" offset="1756731">I think if one looks to what the D.C. Circuit and other circuits following the Lindh decision actually do is, it boils down to was there evidence to support the jury verdict?</text>
            <text syncTime="416.774" offset="1809080">If there was, they say that it was an abuse of discretion to set it aside, but it's Hornbook law that a court can set aside a jury verdict even if there's substantial evidence to support it if the court makes an independent determination, without drawing inferences for the verdict, an independent determination that it's contrary to the great weight of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.426" offset="11895689">There are several cases in which the appellate court looked into whether that was proper or not, so I'm... you know, I'm... now, where does that leave me?</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.915" offset="11953681">If I thought we were wrong in Gasperini, and there were several on this who joined me, in allowing appellate review at all... we allowed appellate review there on the basis of abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.033" offset="12010106">I guess to be consistent we should have an even stricter standard when there's review in the situation where the jury verdict is ignored, so I guess there should be something beyond abuse of discretion, or should... I don't know.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.442" offset="12155764">Now, why did you take it as an assumption that if you lose on this issue it's going to go right back to the D.C. Circuit, if you lose on the issue which is in front of us, which is not the issue that either of you apparently wants to argue, and that's the issue about whether... it says, did Gasperini make unlawful the throw-away line that the D.C. Circuit threw in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.674" offset="12252731">Now, maybe we shouldn't be hearing that, but we're hearing it, so my question concerns that, and I've looked at Wright and Miller, and as I look at their standards for new trial it strikes me that I understand very well your uncertainties, because what it says is, there are all kinds of verbal formulations all over the place, and you say the D.C. Circuit has adjusted to this over 30 years, and I expect other circuits have adjusted over similar periods of time to different verbal formulations, and if we start fooling around with those in this case, there is no matter so close to the heart of the trial bar, and suddenly we will discover different circuits doing different things in light of what we say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.224" offset="12426915">So if we say you're right on these words, searching inquiry, some other circuit is going to take that as a signal that they're wrong and, therefore, if we allow the D.C. Circuit to do what it did for 30 years, some other circuit will be unable to do what it has done for 30 years, so what do we do?</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.508" offset="12904016">If D.C. thought that that entailed a stricter abuse of discretion review, that should have been brought up at that point and it could have been resolved one way or the other by the court of appeals, but they had their opportunity and all of a sudden it becomes a problem now, when the decision comes, and there's this verbal formulation of a more searching inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.539" offset="13004117">But the fact of the matter is, the D.C.
