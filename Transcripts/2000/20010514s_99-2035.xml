            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 99-2035, Cooper Industries against Leatherman Tool Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.906">The respondent Leatherman Tool Group is the country’s leading manufacturer of multifunction pocket tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.134">In 1995 petitioner Cooper Industries decided to introduce its own competing product.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.952">In some of its early marketing materials instead of creating its own prototype, petitioner simply used photographs of a modified Leatherman Tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.924">Leatherman sued respondent alleging false advertising, unfair competition, and violations of the Federal Trademark Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.201">Leatherman prevailed and the jury awarded Leatherman $50000.00 in compensatory damages and $4.5 million in punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.435">Petitioner challenged the punitive damages award arguing that it was grossly excessive and therefore violates the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.419">The District Court upheld the verdict and the Court of Appeals, reviewing the District Court’s determination for an abusive discretion affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.352">We granted Certiorari to decide whether the Court of Appeals applied the correct standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.976">Petitioner argues that de novo review is appropriate while respondent argues in the favor of review for abusive discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.398">For reasons stated in opinion filed with Clerk, we hold that de novo review is the proper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.335">Compensatory damages and punitive damages served distinct purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.960">The former measure of the concrete loss that the plaintiff suffered by reason of the defendant’s wrongful conduct whereas the latter, are intended to punish the defendant and to deter future wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.863">They have been appropriately described as “quasi-criminal” and as “private fines”.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.145">Because punitive damages do not constitute findings of fact, the Seventh Amendment does not present a bar to de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.895">Although, States possess broad discretion with respect the imposition of criminal penalties and punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.458">The Due Process Clause imposes substantive limits on that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.026">In the context of both criminal penalties and punitive damages, this Court has enforced these limits by prohibiting grossly excessive punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.339">We have determined the boundaries of this gross excessiveness by focusing on the same general criteria, like degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.574">The relationship between the penalty imposed and the harm to the victim and the sanctions imposed for a comparable misconduct in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.620">When enforcing these limits this Court has consistently engaged in an independent examination of the relevant criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.152">The same de novo review that is applied in criminal cases is appropriate in the punitive damages context.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.917">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.683">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Ginsburg has filed a disenting opinion.</text>
