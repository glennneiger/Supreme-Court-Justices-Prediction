            <text syncTime="0.000">The second case is Fiore versus White, No. 98-942.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.033">The background facts of this case are stated in the opinion we issued last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.232">Petitioner challenged his Pennsylvania conviction for operating a hazardous of waste facility without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.078">He was denied relief in the Pennsylvania Courts and by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on federal habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.850">We granted certiorari to determine whether his conviction was consistent with the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.169">Because we were uncertain whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision in Scarpone represented a change in the law of Pennsylvania, we certify the question to that court and that court replied that, no, it did not announced a new rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.358">Because Scarpone was not a new law but represented the law of Pennsylvania at the time Fiore's conviction became final, the only question presented by this case is whether Pennsylvania can constitutionally convict Fiore of a crime of that its statute properly interpreted by its own court does not prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.132">In Jackson versus Virginia and Winship, we held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a State to convict a person of a crime without proving the elements of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.964">In this case, failure to posses a permit is a basic element of a crime of which Fiore was convicted, and the parties agree that the Commonwealth presented no evidence whatsoever to provide that basic element.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.403">The Commonwealth concedes that Fiore did posses a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.312">Fiore’s conviction therefore fails to satisfy the federal constitutional demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.262">In a Per Curiam opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the contrary judgment of the Third Circuit and remand this case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.035">Our decision is unanimous.</text>
