            <text syncTime="12.260" offset="199456">When Congress brought Federal judges within the coverage of the Social Security and Medicare programs, they began to share with the vast majority of all other Americans the costs and benefits of a universal program of social insurance that benefits society at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.690" offset="265180">The obligation to participate in those programs posed no threat to the central purpose of the Compensation Clause, which is to protect the judiciary from interference from the other political branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.662" offset="313036">As this Court recognized in O'Malley v. Woodruff, judges are also citizens, and the Compensation Clause does not grant them an immunity from participating in the burden of Government, whose Constitution and laws they are charged with administering.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.696" offset="369147">A nondiscriminatory tax that falls on judges as well as most other citizens does not violate the Compensation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.530" offset="404569">The concern that the Framers had with Congress' possibly abusing its power to set judges' statutory salaries does not apply to Congress' application and extension of a nondiscriminatory tax on income.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.102" offset="462770">Now, the Framers understood that when Congress exercised its authority to enact statutory salaries, it would have the opportunity for mischief.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.528" offset="512507">Suppose Congress simply reduces the salaries of all Federal employees, officers and employees, and judges among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.479" offset="568305">Surely the fact that it was nondiscriminatory wouldn't prevent it from violating the Compensation Clause, would it?</text>

            <text syncTime="118.475" offset="624311">That's the holding, of course, of Will, which is that a nondiscriminatory reduction in Federal employees' salaries that includes judges does violate the Compensation Clause, but it's one thing to say that a direct reduction of judges' salaries violates the plain language of the clause, because it is, after all, a diminution of their compensation that is owed to them for their services, but it's another thing... and... but it's another thing to say that a tax, which is not a direct reduction of their compensation but is an obligation that they must share with all other citizens, implicates the Compensation Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.111" offset="850845">It very likely would violate fundamental principles underlying Article III, a discriminatory tax, even if it didn't fall on judges' compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.822" offset="885640">If... one... there are two, essentially two different principles here.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.455" offset="900269">One is a reduction of judges' compensation, and another is discriminatory treatment of judges in some way which might or might not be directed at their salary or at their income.</text>

Spendthrift Farm show that there are broader principles protecting the independence of the judiciary that go beyond some political interference, that go beyond just the Compensation Clause, but I want to add, even if I'm wrong, and even if one should analyze the discriminatory tax on judges' salaries under the Compensation Clause, that doesn't mean one would have to also conclude that a nondiscriminatory tax violates the Compensation Clause, because the clause would still be interpreted in light of its central purpose, which is to protect judges from interference with their function by the political branches.</text>

Hamilton said that that would certainly be a benefit of the clause, but I think that even if that's... even if that's so, and even if I agree with you, it doesn't necessarily follow... it doesn't follow, in fact, that every expectation that a judge had, that he brought with him, or her, when taking office, was protected from any disparagement or any adverse effect by later action in Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.176" offset="1535149">But the broader point is that it just is not the case that every single expectation that a judge has about his financial position when he takes office is something that the Compensation Clause freezes in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.294" offset="1591573">For example, Congress surely could have raised the rate of the general applicable income tax on all citizens in the exact same amount as was the amount of the Medicare and Social Security taxes in this case, and Congress could have done so, in fact, because it had decided that from this point on these programs of social insurance should be financed out of general income tax revenues instead of a separate tax on income.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.174" offset="1739113">I mean, when employers offer compensation, they offer a compensation package, which very often includes retirement plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.528" offset="1776520">Some of them are contributory, some of them are noncontributory, but that is part of the whole scheme of compensation, and it may well be the case that the general taxes are something entirely different, but does that necessarily show that contributions to retirement schemes are entirely different?</text>

            <text syncTime="635.449" offset="2692164">And the reason why that is different from a statutory form of compensation, or why, I should say, that the concerns that the Framers had with diminishing direct reductions of statutory salary don't apply here, is that when Congress enacts and shapes a general tax like Social Security, it legislates with the broad perspective of society at large, and it doesn't have a narrow focus on the judiciary, and when Congress sets the generally applicable tax rate, it is also constrained by political checks, by the popular political objection to--</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.617" offset="4824906">First of all, I think that tax equalization, bringing judges into line with the vast majority of other people and also extending, of course, the benefits of the... the attendant benefits of the coverage that I discussed earlier to them as well as everybody else, as well as 90 percent of the civilian labor force, I believe that that is a significant reason for tax equal... for treating judges for tax purposes equally, as all other citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.872" offset="4953846">I mean, it's... it is imposing a special tax on judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.754" offset="4969415">So that, I think is... I think that is almost always, perhaps always, a legitimate objective of Congress, which is to treat judges equally with all other citizens for tax purposes, because the Constitution does not require Congress to grant judges a perpetual exemption from taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.748" offset="5053425">What it does require Congress to do is to recognize that when judges take office with a particular salary, that they cannot reduce that level of salary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1386.743" offset="5697395">So judges did not have any expectation... if they came into office at the salary of 100,000 dollars and the income tax rate was 30 percent, there's no question, or it isn't disputed in this case, I don't think, that Congress could have raised the general income tax on everybody 5, 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.253" offset="5771374">It might have required... it might have been required to by economic distress, by wartime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.520" offset="5792481">Not only that, Congress could have imposed what it has called from time to time a surtax, which is, you know, a special kind of tax that is found necessary to impose from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.891" offset="5829993">Now, that has the exact same economic effect as a... as the elimination of the 5.4... the exemption for the 5.4 percent for Social Security taxes and the Medicare tax, so I think it's just wrong to say that the judges had an enforceable entitlement that required Congress to freeze this in place, because their economic situation could have been changed in exactly the same way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.272" offset="6503534">With respect to the issue of the tradeoff, the tradeoff is derived from both Will and Evans, which refer to the fact that one of the primary purposes, an equal purpose of the clause, was to bring judges... bring qualified judges into the judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.804" offset="13037594">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.148" offset="13050969">When Congress extended Social Security taxes to Federal judges and to other Federal employees in 1984 it had several objectives that had to be balanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.376" offset="13095900">One objective was to bring as many people as possible within the Social Security system, people who had been exempted from it in order to sustain the fiscal soundness of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.946" offset="13138218">Another objective was to treat Federal... people in Federal service similarly in that each should be subjected to one, but only one, contribution for retirement income security, and a third was, Congress understood that Federal employees in the Civil Service retirement system had a large vested interest in that system, which had been in place since 1920, and that it would be extremely disruptive just to terminate it and start as if it had never existed, especially because many Federal employees would not have been able to accrue enough service in Social Security after that point to become eligible in Social Security, especially if they were older.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.472" offset="13304252">The Federal... the Civil Service retirement system allows retirement at age 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.476" offset="13320344">It also is more expensive on the cost side for Federal employees than Social Security in some sense, because the contribution rate is higher, and there was no earnings cap on Social Security... on CSRS, as there was under the old age tax system, so all of those factors had to be balanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.135" offset="13394950">The point is, at the end of the day, Federal judges joined virtually everybody else in our society in being subject to a 5, 6 percent mandatory contribution for a retirement income security system, and that's what I mean when I say that the overall objective of Congress was equalization, and that Congress treated them no differently at the end of the day than it treated everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.853" offset="13497768">Now, it is true, there are issues that come up in a transition, as there are any time when Congress extended Social Security, or where a State might adjust... a State might adjust an exemption, for example, the intragovernmental tax immunity system doctrine was alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.686" offset="13569134">Well, there was a time when States exempted all Federal employees and Federal contractors from their taxes because they thought they were required to under this Court's decisions in Collector v. Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.203" offset="13615214">Then along came Graves, and the Court said that States could tax Federal employees and Federal contractors on an equal rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.376" offset="13647919">The States were required to adjust their systems, or had the opportunity to adjust their systems, and they were able to do so in many different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.104" offset="13682819">It required some... it required a lot of adjustment because of the ways that different people had been treated differently, and this Court has many cases on that point, reviewing the adjustments that the States made, but the point is, the principle that emerged from those cases was, what was required at the end of the day was nondiscriminatory taxation of those who dealt with the Federal Government, and that principle we think is the same principle that should govern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.813" offset="13781666">That is, at the end of the day, Congress is required to do more than treat Federal judges on par with the vast majority of American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.986" offset="13814372">I do want to touch on the termination of violation point, which is, even if we're wrong about everything that I just said, it seems to me the only expectation that judges could have had when they took office was that their net pay would not have been reduced below the level at which they took office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.677" offset="13893157">So the expectation... the expectation that judges had was not that they remain exempt from Social Security taxes in a kind of indefinite number that is just, they have an interest in an exemption, quia exemption, but a particular number has to be put on that, so if a violation did occur, the violation came to an end when Congress brought judges' net pay back up above the highest level that it had ever been at any earlier time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.628" offset="14020948">If the Court has nothing further--</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.940" offset="14030143">Well, yes, as long as you're at it, the part that was bothering me was not the part, treating judges the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.884" offset="14053967">It was the part of treating judges differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.196" offset="14063162">So what... I mean, they're treated differently in that everybody else is allowed to opt out but judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.397" offset="14120004">It's just that they thought judges already have this pension plan, which is perfect.</text>
