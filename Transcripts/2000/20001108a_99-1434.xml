            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="8.508" offset="183118">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.993" offset="197120">The harmonized tariff schedule employs more than 9,000 individual categories and more than half-a-million words to classify every conceivable article of commerce for tariff purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.958" offset="248947">This massive document was drafted initially by an international commission, and in 1988 it was enacted in its entirety as a law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.297" offset="286250">Two terms ago in the Haggar case this Court held that courts should defer to the reasonable interpretive regulations adopted by the customs service to implement these complex tariff provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.691" offset="335882">In the present case, however, the Federal Circuit held that it would give no weight whatever to the interpretive rulings adopted by the customs service to apply the tariff provisions in specific situations under the very same statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.381" offset="398681">The court, having concluded it would give no deference to the agency rulings, then held that the particular item involved in this case, known as a date planner, would not constitute a bound diary within the specific meaning of the tariff provision we have here before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.599" offset="471510">In our view, the court's method of analysis and its ultimate classification determination are both incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.819" offset="496379">In enacting a harmonized tariff schedule, Congress specified that... its understanding and intent that the customs service would be responsible for interpreting and applying these provisions, and for that purpose Congress gave broad and varied types of interpretive authority to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.846" offset="568477">In particular, in 19 U.S.C. 1502, Congress provided that the agency could adopt rules and regulations for the classifications of goods under the tariff schedules, and it was under that provision that this Court applied Chevron and Haggar to say that reasonable interpretations of ambiguous provisions set forth in regulations should be applied by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.097" offset="661472">Now, Congress understood, however, that the regulations alone would not be sufficient to address the infinite myriad of small interpretive problems that arise under this kind of tariff legislation, and so Congress specified and gave authority to the agency to adopt binding interpretive rules for the purpose of applying the statute in these discrete situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.095" offset="2065502">I think in Smiley v. Citibank the Court had a similar situation where there was a subsidiary determination that was then reviewed by the headquarters office to result in a final agency determination, which is the process that we've gone through with respect to these rulings, and the Court said, well, that doesn't result in a change of view, it results in a proper application of the agency's ruling process.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.735" offset="2164036">With respect to the first point, the respondent says, well, there are 10,000 a year of these kinds of rulings made in the head... in the regional offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.960" offset="2204996">In fact, we do not claim that there's... we are unaware of any of those rulings in which there would be what the Court, in the opinion you authored for the Court in the Variable Annuity case call the deliberative conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.415" offset="2258808">It is only the deliberative conclusions that set forth the actual interpretations of provisions that the Court can look to to defer to.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.887" offset="2300604">And in most of the simple tariff entry at issue determinations, of course it's a very simplified procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.823" offset="2332369">It has to be, because of the volume of transactions at issue, and those kinds of entry-level port determinations are very simple, and the Trade Bar Association brief acknowledges they contain in almost every instance no discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.945" offset="2404885">They just contain the sort of a statement that 12 apples come in as apples.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.049" offset="4541283">In United States v. Correll, this Court held that revenue rulings should be upheld when they're reasonable, and the Court emphasized that it was based on the expertise of the agency and the fact, to quote the Court, that it doesn't sit as a committee of revision to perfect the administration of the tax laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.066" offset="4869381">Prior to the 1960's, there were two kinds of rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.543" offset="4883278">There were Treasury decisions issued by the Secretary, and there were Commissioner's rulings that were published in what's called the Cumulative Bulletin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.745" offset="4912117">The Cumulative Bulletin pointed out before 1960 that the Commissioner's rulings were not approved by the Secretary, therefore they weren't binding on the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.103" offset="4945554">In 1961, the Commissioner was given interpretive authority in a regulation we've cited in our brief, and that interpretive authority is subject, however, to the approval of the Secretary, and since that time, what are now called Revenue Rules, with a capital R, are issued by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.010" offset="5025175">They are functionally the same as Treasury decisions were before 1960, and in the cases before 1960 the Court had pointed out Treasury decisions were entitled to substantial deference, and even in Skidmore the Court pointed out they were often decisive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.187" offset="5097900">After Correll and indeed, I think after Chevron, but in any event in that time frame, Justice Marshall wrote an opinion for the Court, bringing this full circle, in which he said that a Treasury decision issued in connection with a customs ruling should be given... should be accepted if it's reasonably... if it's sufficiently reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.722" offset="5175954">That's the way... that's why I pointed out that revenue rulings and Treasury decisions and customs interpretive rulings have followed a path that should lead to the same result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.053" offset="13521345">As I read the Haggar decision, there was an argument made at that time that Haggar, or the class... the regulation at issue in Haggar was not entitled to Chevron deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.575" offset="13579441">It was not entitled to any deference because of de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.641" offset="13595637">We have a legislative regulation there and as I understand the Court, the Court was trying to explain how those two elements, a statutory regulation that creates a legal norm, would... could still be harmonized with the de novo review feature, and used as an example there that could still be applied to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.066" offset="13693335">We don't have that neat dissection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.090" offset="13701486">One can't surgically pull out the interpretive law from the fact in these types of classification rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.887" offset="13752686">I think I have two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.146" offset="13757701">Justice Breyer, as we understand the issue that you've been addressing, the Court expressly confronted and resolved it in the Haggar case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.477" offset="13798975">The Court quoted the same provision of the statute that you're quoting and said that the responsibility of the Court of International Trade to make its determinations on the record before it, meant that it was to assemble the record and make factual determinations and apply those facts to the law, but in... the Court said that deference can be given to the regulations without impairing the authority of the court to make factual determinations and to apply those determinations to the law de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.359" offset="13914540">And what the Court said in Haggar was that the regulations, the interpretive regulations of the agency were part of the law that the Court of International Trade was to apply, which is our position precisely in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.325" offset="13970442">I believe that... I want to say one more thing about this deliberative conclusion point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.487" offset="13999072">Now, the cases that have described, that you look to the deliberative conclusion to find... in the interpretive ruling to decide whether to give deference to the agency's reasonable conclusions, involve rulings in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.682" offset="14059886">In Martin v. OSHRC, Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Commission, the Court applied the same principle of Chevron deference to an agency's citation when the citation had been issued in the... precisely in the format that Congress authorized for interpretive purposes, so I think you may need to look to the nature of the regulatory ruling... rulemaking program to decide, you know, what sort of specificity is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.865" offset="14172526">But in the context of the customs service rulings, I think as a practical matter you're going to be looking at headquarters rulings that contain the deliberative analysis to find out what the agency's reasonable interpretation is.</text>
