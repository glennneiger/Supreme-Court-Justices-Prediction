            <label>Ms. Maureen A. Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="71.504" offset="438673">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="75.986" offset="456540">This case presents a narrow but important issue, and it concerns how this Court determines the threshold question of whether a statute is civil or criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.194" offset="497396">This threshold inquiry is important because it establishes what constitutional rules apply to a statute and that the statute must satisfy, and also what constitutional protections are available to people who are subject to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.183" offset="565314">It also is important because this same threshold inquiry applies to many kinds of statutes, not just statutes such as Washington's, providing for the commitment of sexually violent predators.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.489" offset="618604">It applies to numerous statutes, including others that deal with confinement such as more generalized civil commitment laws, commitments for drug or alcohol treatment, statutes such as quarantine statutes, and statutes relating to pretrial detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.784" offset="683806">In this case, the Ninth Circuit rejected the principle that whether a law is civil or criminal is a threshold question based on legislative intent and the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.589" offset="731035">Instead, the Ninth Circuit held that Washington's admittedly civil law may be divested of its civil nature and converted into a criminal law if conditions of confinement at Washington's Special Commitment Center are punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.696" offset="791430">In other words, the Ninth Circuit held that the fundamental nature of a law as either civil or criminal may vary and that the same statute may be both civil and criminal at different times and in different places.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.574" offset="846914">The Ninth Circuit's decision is fundamentally wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.967" offset="860498">It conflicts with the holding of this Court in Hudson v. United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2779.064" offset="11268935">Now, along the way, you have to examine the question of how do we go about making that decision, and initially you look at the face of the statute, but that's not enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="3014.318" offset="12209866">It seems to me that now that we're here the Court could do many different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.673" offset="12231286">The Court could simply say, we meant in Hendrix that the conditions were important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.320" offset="12253961">We were all concerned about that, and the Ninth Circuit is right to consider the purpose and effect as shown by the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.718" offset="12279456">You could just do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.725" offset="12283531">You could also say, by the way, mental abnormality, we really did mean what we said about lack of control, and that there should be some showing about, the person has no volitional control, and that would clear up a lot of things in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.132" offset="12349151">As we pointed out in our supplemental two page brief, the State of Kansas just decided that yes, in fact, Hendrix does require the lack of volitional control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.882" offset="12380184">The Court could also, I suppose, go beyond the question presented, which it has the authority to do, and say, this statute certainly looks like it's very different than what we though Hendrix was, and at least in Washington as it's being applied there's a problem, but I don't think the Court needs to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.061" offset="12440893">The Court simply can say, we're going to remand this case and let the court of appeals order stand, because what the court of appeals has simply done is to apply Hendrix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.037" offset="12480808">There's nothing different from Hendrix in what the Ninth Circuit did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.643" offset="12495228">We're simply going to send it down for the district court to evaluate it, and if the district court, Judge Cunero decided that let Judge Dwyer handle it because he's done the 1983 litigation, that could easily... that's something the district court could do if it decided to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.341" offset="12549980">But obviously the 1983 litigation has not been a habeas situation involving the question of release because of unconstitutional punishment, and what this case is ultimately about is that a man has been punished for 10 years in a prison, longer than he served under his criminal sentence, without having committed another crime and without having a traditional mental disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.036" offset="12644753">And so there are many issues presented, and I think one of the things that's difficult about examining this case is that it's something fundamentally radically different from a true civil commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.237" offset="12681533">There's nothing wrong with a true civil commitment, but this is not civil commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.790" offset="12699819">This is punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.885" offset="12704207">And I think that if you look at the various cases that we've cited here, one other thing about Hudson that I think is important is that the Court said that the penalties in Hudson did not approach the infamous punishment of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.419" offset="12762304">They involved administrative disability, and they were imposed in administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.952" offset="12784455">In Ward, the Court found that the penalty for oil discharge and water pollution was more analogous to traditional civil damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.847" offset="12816011">In Shaw v. Martin, before the Court found that pretrial detention did not violate due process, the Court examined the actual conditions of confinement and cited testimony in the opinion about actual practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.873" offset="12944116">The Court has often considered punishment in a parallel way, whether it's due process, double jeopardy, or ex post facto, but I certainly acknowledge that Shaw was a due process case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.030" offset="13080788">This is a situation where the State of Washington, over the time that the injunction has been in place, has made it harder to get less restrictive alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.047" offset="13116837">One of the things that this Court was concerned about in Hendrix, and specifically mentioned, was the less restrictive alternative idea, and what Washington has done in the last 5 years is to eliminate less restrictive alternative from the initial court determination and to make it harder for someone to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.022" offset="13192697">I would suggest that this Court over and over, in a number of cases involving both double jeopardy and due process and ex post facto has been to look at the statute as applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.717" offset="13763525">--Well, Your Honor, I think the Court could say that the application to all other prisoners would certainly enlighten the question of what's applying to Mr. Young, but the Court doesn't need to reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.202" offset="13845445">But I think the answer to the question would be yes, because it has had a punitive purpose and effect from the beginning, but I don't think there's anything that's in conflict with Hendrix for us to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.620" offset="13895077">What Hendrix said was, nobody here's saying it's punitive, it applies to Hendrix alone, it would be different if, and that's what the Court has said in many different circumstances, including Allen v. Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.984" offset="13940531">The case would be a different case if someone had shown that there was a punitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.206" offset="13957458">So over and over again I think the Court has looked at the actual implementation of the statute, but you're right, I think from the very beginning he's been committed without authority of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.226" offset="14005523">Let me just take a minute to mention Ex Parte Virginia, because I think it's important when the State argues that an administrative agency does not bind the State in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.395" offset="14042199">This Court said that whoever by virtue of a public position under State government deprives another of constitutional rights violates the Constitution, and he acts in the name and for the State and his act is that of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.215" offset="14097474">There can be no defense here that it's simply the administrative agency running amok.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.314" offset="14117850">This is certainly an act of the State that binds the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.642" offset="14179185">I would like to point out to the Court again that this case is before the Court on a very narrow issue, and it is a threshold issue, and that is, how the Court determines whether a statute is civil or criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.113" offset="14229131">Hudson establishes that that is done facially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.767" offset="14243655">Washington... the issue about whether Washington's statute is civil or criminal is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.049" offset="14268837">Both the Washington supreme court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals have held that Washington statute is civil on its face, meaning the legislature's intent was to have a civil statute and that in purpose and in effect the Washington statute is civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.920" offset="14324322">The predicates for commitment are not at issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.704" offset="14339473">There is no question that Mr. Young suffers from a mental abnormality and a personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in sexually violent acts if he is not detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.533" offset="14386806">That is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.177" offset="14393389">The Washington supreme court and the Ninth Circuit have both ruled against Mr. Young on those issues, and there was no cross petition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.959" offset="14424423">The only issue before this Court, and what Mr. Young is contending, is that because he alleges that he is not receiving treatment consistent with a civil statute, that he ought to be released, and the only way Mr. Young can contend that is by saying, if I do not receive the treatment that I'm entitled to under a civil statute, somehow that converts this statute to a criminal statute, that one day your statute can be civil, the next day it can be criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.658" offset="14535286">In Mr. Young's view, if Washington had two commitment centers instead of one, the law would be civil at the center where the commitment... where the treatment was adequate and--</text>

            <text syncTime="3613.828" offset="14607907">--Then everyone committed pursuant to the statute would be entitled to go into either State court or Federal court and get those remedies, get those conditions remedied, but they do not go to the validity of whether... they do not go back to the character of Washington's statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.194" offset="14677393">Washington's statute is a civil law, and that is meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.933" offset="14692335">It means that people confined pursuant to that law are entitled to the treatment that civil committees are given under the statute and under the Constitution, and the proportionate, measured, wholly adequate remedy is to go to court and require the State of Washington to provide the treatment and the care that it has promised.</text>
