            <text syncTime="339.037" offset="1501289">But more importantly than that, after the fact, after he was charged, fair notice and reliance applies after the fact also, not just at the time of the act; otherwise, a defendant who is approaching trial is never going to know exactly what are the elements of the offense, or what is the punishment that I'm about to face.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.372" offset="1890618">But the problem is that as a matter of fundamental fairness and fair warning as to punishment deals with not just at the time of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.386" offset="12298742">And in addition it operates under a set of institutional constraints in the way it goes about doing its business that it seems to me provides important protections here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.402" offset="12350778">The... it can't initiate law reform efforts of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.417" offset="12374810">It must... it can only act in the context of cases that the litigants bring before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.077" offset="12397484">In addition, there is stare decisis, and the concomitant imperative that courts justify departures from precedent of the sort Your Honor's hypothetical posits, with reasons, and with some neutral principles of general applicability and some consideration of the impact of the change they're about to make, not only on the litigants before them, but on all similarly situated litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.781" offset="12532276">I think all of those traditional restraints operate to justify different treatment for court decisions as opposed to decisions of legislatures, and certainly the history of the Ex Post Facto Clause indicates that the framers were acutely aware of those distinctions, and because of a well-documented history of parliamentary abuse involving legislation of this sort they thought it essential to insert a prophylactic prohibition against legislation of this sort without regard to... they weren't going to look into the fairness of individual pieces of legislation and the circumstances under which they were passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.335" offset="12734464">They erected a prophylactic bar to legislation of that sort at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.827" offset="12752436">But isn't the answer to the institutional argument that you've been making the answer that Justice Scalia has raised a couple of times elsewhere in the argument, that at the time the ex post facto rule was written the way it was, common law courts, or our very conception of courts, even in the Federal system, which was in gestation at that time, involved a system of much stricter precedent than we have today, so the likelihood of a court doing what this court has done was simply much less than it is today. We have an entirely different concept of binding precedent today, and for that reason, shouldn't the Due Process Clause take that into consideration by being starchier in... than perhaps the founders ever thought there would be a need to be when reviewing judicial change?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Moore</label>
            <text syncTime="3207.437" offset="12974895">Your Honor, I think the Due Process Clause and the Ex Post Facto Clause also are... serve very different functions under our constitutional scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.249" offset="13022124">As I indicated, the Ex Post Facto Clause is this sort of structural restraint on the power of that branch of Government, but Due Process, litigation under the Due Process Clause is by its very nature case by case, and the concern of the Due Process Clause is individualized fair treatment, so I would suggest that it would be inconsistent with the nature of the due process guarantee to build into it some sort of prophylactic structural restraint on the judicial branch because of concerns that the judicial branch in modern times engages in too much law reform.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.301" offset="13210415">It seems to me that due process, the Due Process Clause, with its concern about individualized fair treatment, is up to the task of protecting against aberrational cases in which a court is self-evidently engaged in some sort of arbitrary or vindictive action that... of the sort that violates our notions of fundamental fairness and our notions about the rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.507" offset="13351163">To close, our position is that the Due Process Clause was not violated here, and that the Due Process Clause is not violated by a court decision of this sort that retroactively alters a rule of criminal law unless that change expands the scope of conduct covered by the criminal prohibition issue and does so unforeseeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.928" offset="13484910">Secondarily, our position is that the Ex Post Facto Clause simply doesn't regulate judicial action at all, and that none of its technical restrictions should be imported wholesale into the Due Process Clause.</text>
