            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="147271">We will hear argument first this morning on number 99-1295 David A. Gitlitz versus the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.239" offset="188127">Mr. Hallett.</text>

            <label>Mr. Darrell D. Hallett</label>
            <text syncTime="11.800" offset="194396">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, As a result of the position taken by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on the brief before this Court, the issue the Court needs to decide is a limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.228" offset="248104">And that issue is whether the amount of debt discharge or cancellation of debt of an insolvent debtor which is excluded from income under Section 108 is income, such that it amounts to an item of income which increases the shareholder's stock basis under Sections 1366 and 1367 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.006" offset="343294">The Commissioner rests his entire case in his brief on the argument that under Section 108 no income is realized by the insolvent debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.948" offset="386971">Your Honors, that position is clearly contrary to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.956" offset="407033">And if I may rather than paraphrasing initially, read the statute, I think it's really critical to this issue and resolves this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.574" offset="445485">And that statute is section 108(a)(1) in the appendix to the petition, at Page 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.523" offset="481325">And it states as follows, Gross income does not include any amount which, but for this subsection, would be includable in gross income by reason of the discharge of indebtedness of the taxpayer if the discharge occurs when the taxpayer is insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.645" offset="553841">To paraphrase that, Your Honors, what that subsection (a) says in hopefully plain English is that an item is only excluded under Section 108 if it otherwise would have been included in gross income under Section 61.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="122.016" stopTime="144.124">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="122.016" offset="635238">Well, I think your argument under the statute is a strong one.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.445" offset="649031">But is there any reason in tax theory or practical equity why Congress would want to allow this result in this particular case?</text>
            <text syncTime="136.882" offset="694798">I mean, I understand that the statute may compel this, but is there some underlying rationale to support your position?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Darrell D. Hallett</label>
            <text syncTime="144.124" offset="723741">It may well be consistent with the restructuring of the Internal Revenue Code in 1954, in which Congress said very broadly in Section 61 that gross income includes all income from whatever source derived, and listed specific items, some 15 of those, and one of them is income from subsection 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.514" offset="813289">And then consistent with that over in Sections 101 through 138, those items that are included in income are specifically excluded from gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.097" offset="867624">So--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="180.438" offset="868982">What I am asking is why would Congress allow you to use income that you don't pay tax on, to increase the basis and then which would allow you to deduct additional unrelated losses?</text>

            <label>Mr. Darrell D. Hallett</label>
            <text syncTime="191.908" offset="914853">--Well, first of all, because this statute clearly says that--</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="197.490" stopTime="201.825">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="197.490" offset="937214">I know that's position number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.394" offset="944842">I'm asking, is there a reason for this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="darrell_d_hallett" startTime="201.825" stopTime="248.039">
            <label>Mr. Darrell D. Hallett</label>
            <text syncTime="201.825" offset="954559">--There's a reason for it is that in the final analysis, the basis reflects the shareholder's equity in the corporation, roughly speaking, and the shareholder gets equity in the corporation by contributing capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.490" offset="1017149">He also gets equity in the corporation when income is realized, taxable or nontaxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.305" offset="1040450">And the Congress recognized that if losses have accumulated such that they are not deductible because they exceed the basis, well when income is realized, nontaxable income such as municipal bond interest, that income goes down to increase the basis to reflect the fact that there now is an increased equity investment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="248.039" stopTime="305.595">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="248.039" offset="1139402">Mr. Hallett, it seems that the Subchapter S shareholder is the only solvent entity who could take advantage of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.048" offset="1203454">The peculiar thing about this provision is that every other taxpayer, say a Subchapter C corporation, a partner in a partnership, the insolvent would have to be that entity, that tax paying entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.223" offset="1268133">But here you have the peculiarity that the Subchapter S corporation, which is not itself a taxpayer, is the insolvent, while the shareholders are highly solvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.202" offset="1328006">And is there any reason why Congress would want to give those solvent taxpayers this advantageous treatment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="darrell_d_hallett" startTime="305.595" stopTime="349.932">
            <label>Mr. Darrell D. Hallett</label>
            <text syncTime="305.595" offset="1369593">I think what... they clearly did that in 1984 when the Congress said that in the case of an S corporation, the amount is excluded if there's insolvency at the corporation level.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.439" offset="1416927">They certainly recognized that by doing that, the benefit of the exclusion would come down to the shareholder who could well be solvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.674" offset="1453916">And I think to the extent the legislative history reflects why they did that, it made it simpler to look to the insolvency of the corporation rather than up to 75 shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.178" offset="1507937">They may well have recognized that in any situation, certainly not all, if the S corporation is in trouble, the shareholder is in trouble as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.654" offset="1833841">But I think you would also look to the critical statutes that existed prior to the change in 1984 and the statutes which provide for the basis increase, and those are Sections 1366 and 1367.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.497" offset="1893191">Now when Congress made the change in 1984, they did not change those provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.895" offset="5274794">The rationale in those cases that if a debtor realizes debt discharge, that there is no income if he's insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.218" offset="5324113">Of course the Court held in 1931 in Kirby Lumber that as a general proposition there is income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.853" offset="5350654">And these cases in the depression era picked up on some language in Kirby Lumber about</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.328" offset="5376567">"the forgiveness of the debt frees up assets. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.764" offset="5390255">And they said well, if you're insolvent, it doesn't add to assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.524" offset="5409273">And so there is no realization of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.951" offset="5427036">That was the rationale of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.721" offset="5434141">And I submit that just defies economic reality where a debtor has 2 million dollars in debt, or 1 million dollars in debt, or 100,000 dollars in debt, and that is discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.401" offset="5484819">And if he's a few hundred dollars or a few hundred thousand dollars still insolvent after the discharge, that's a real economic benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.878" offset="5518778">He can take the amount that otherwise would be paid for principal and interest on that debt and apply it to expenses to keep going.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.899" offset="5554827">When you recognize that the insolvency is determined based on the fair market value of the assets, it could well have a situation where the real estate operating assets, the value doesn't exceed the debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.824" offset="5610520">But when a million dollars of debt is discharged, that money is indeed freed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.872" offset="5630687">It does indeed free up the liquid assets to either pay down other debts or refinance or pay expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.607" offset="5661615">If that rationale applied, if that rationale applied, that would mean where a debtor is insolvent and sells an asset for a million dollar gain, that... but is still insolvent, and say he takes the million dollars and uses it to pay off debt, if that rationale applied, there would be no income in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.853" offset="5750641">Because after the transaction, even though he's had gain, he's still insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.501" offset="5769240">That's not the tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.112" offset="5775718">And I submit that that transaction cannot be meaningfully distinguished from the situation where the debt is directly discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.011" offset="5811245">Let me turn briefly to the specific language of Sections 1366 and 1367.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.811" offset="5842487">And I think there's a question of where do you start here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.872" offset="5854713">Do you start with Section 108 or do you start with Sections 1366 and 67?</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.222" offset="5876133">I don't think it makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.935" offset="5882925">Because if you start with Section 108, you go to 108(d)(7)(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.613" offset="5909674">And that sends you over to Sections 1366 and Sections 1367.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.122" offset="5939663">Sends you over to determine the amount of the losses that are disallowed for the taxable year of the discharge before you can determine that there is an attribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.410" offset="5992848">And those, I would just point out that 1366 and 67 are very, very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.508" offset="6021269">This isn't a narrowly drawn statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.492" offset="6029211">It says in 1366 that all items of income, including tax exempt income, are taken into account in determining shareholder basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.368" offset="6076649">Congress described the reason for the basis increase in some of the legislative history as insuring that if an item is nontaxable, then if there's later a distribution, the shareholder doesn't have to recognize income as a result of the... it preserves its nontaxability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.145" offset="6171839">The Commissioner seizes upon this stated purpose of a shareholder basis increase and argues that, well, that means that you only could increase basis for a nontaxable item if you get cash, money in the till that you can distribute in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.303" offset="6248430">Well, the statutes don't require that there be a distribution in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.781" offset="6270373">The statutes don't say that you have to lock the cash up in a safe deposit box and use it in the future for a distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.359" offset="6300675">The fact is if you have municipal bond interest that's collected and used to pay debt you are in the same situation on the bottom line balance sheet situation of the shareholder and the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.341" offset="6364623">But the critical event here, and this is... I'm glad the Commissioner brought up this notion of realization of income, because commentators and some of the courts have said that, well, you shouldn't give the shareholder the losses because he hasn't had an economic loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.058" offset="6443408">Well, the point is, he's had an economic gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.757" offset="6458246">It's the economic gain, the income, that Congress has chosen not to tax, that permits the taking of the losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.931" offset="6502967">I would finally point out under Section 108 that... excuse me; before I get to that I would point out that what we are asking for is consistent treatment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.176" offset="6559914">An S corporation that gets excludable municipal bond interest is entitled to up the basis and take losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.435" offset="6597008">And we ask for the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.459" offset="6605054">The... all other debtors who exclude COD income get to use their attributes in the year of discharge and we ask for the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.334" offset="6664509">And this 108(d)(7)(b) has really been a matter of confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.640" offset="6681749">It hasn't been read closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.361" offset="6688646">It requires that before you eliminate any losses you have to go over to Sections 1366 and 67 and determine if there is an excess of losses remaining after the COD income is taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.025" offset="6751340">I will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.382" offset="7168776">The Tax Court rationale was that 108(d)(7) says all of this happens at the corporate level.</text>

            <text syncTime="3337.282" offset="13496365">As I explained to Justice Breyer, we think that the proper way to reach this, to analyze this is the way Congress did, to start with 108 in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.267" offset="13536280">And then to point out that the amendment to (d)(7) in 1984 was consistent with that result and promoted that conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.613" offset="13581629">They said, as Justice Breyer points out that all of this should be done at the corporate level and nothing escapes to the shareholders because it's all handled at the corporate level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.603" offset="13625619">I think that's a correct conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.180" offset="13631888">But I think one of the reasons it's a correct conclusion is because there is no item of income that can escape to the shareholders and add to their basis and give them this double tax benefit wind fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.931" offset="13674938">And I do want to point out that in each of these cases when a basis adjustment is allowed there is indeed a windfall there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3501.891" offset="14154755">With respect to Victor and Eustice Treatise, what it actually says is that COD income of an insolvent debtor is not gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.581" offset="14193521">And it's cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.056" offset="14199477">Not one of the authorities cited by the government say that it is not realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.316" offset="14224450">They say it's excluded from gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.300" offset="14232391">With respect to... if the Commissioner were right that because an item is excluded from gross income, then none of the items excluded from gross income, life insurance proceeds, interest on municipal bonds, none of those would increase basis because they are not income and could not be an item of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.470" offset="14305116">This double tax benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.662" offset="14313893">There is no tax benefit at all without a basis increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.605" offset="14333642">The item just as well have been taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.654" offset="14341792">If it was taxable, the income would flow down to the shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.217" offset="14356107">His basis would go up and he'd be able to his loss against the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.852" offset="14382647">He'd end up with zero basis and zero income just the same position where the Commissioner urges he should end up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.822" offset="14410546">Finally the Tenth Circuit did not develop the timing rule on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.034" offset="14435310">That rule is word for word what was urged upon it by the Justice Department in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.823" offset="14458507">This case has been a constant moving target.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.645" offset="14469792">The only time the Commissioner argued the no realization was the first time this case was decided before then Chief Judge Cohen in Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.667" offset="14501870">She rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.798" offset="14506363">It was never raised again until it was raised in the petition for certiorari in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.242" offset="14532172">I submit, Your Honor, a plea on behalf of tax practitioners in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.683" offset="14549935">They should be able to read the Code as written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.704" offset="14562056">They shouldn't have to speculate as to whether or not a result that is called for on the plain language of the statute is too good to be true or is a wind fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.968" offset="14603121">The tax laws are too complicated to have to get into that kind of speculation.</text>
