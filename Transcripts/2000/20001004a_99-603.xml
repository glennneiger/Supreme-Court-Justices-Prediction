            <text syncTime="3438.550" offset="13909138">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.862" offset="13918438">It's important to bear in mind that what we have here is what type... is a question concerning what type of professional services is the Government going to pay for under a Government program which is neither a regulation nor is it a funding restriction that affects private expression of the sort that was involved in NEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.098" offset="13995342">It is funding professional services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.782" offset="14006105">I also take substantial issue with respondent's claim that all that Rust covers is Government speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.038" offset="14039124">As the Chief Justice pointed out, Rust itself did not say that, and this Court's subsequent cases have not said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.271" offset="14064097">In the Rosenberger case, for example, in addition to the passage the Chief Justice quoted about using private persons to deliver a message pertaining to the Government's own program, on page 630... or 834, the Court further said, it does not follow from the Government speaking... where the Government itself speaks, that it does not follow that viewpoint based restrictions are proper when the university does not itself speak, or subsidized transmittal of a message that it favors, but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.618" offset="14201501">The dichotomy that was created in Rosenberger was one where the Government is subsidizing essentially a forum where the Government gives money to a forum and asks the private speakers to have at it with one another for the benefit of the public at large, which is different from subsidizing a message the Government favors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.224" offset="14279868">Here, although the Legal Services lawyer opposing a State agency may not be advancing the Government's speech, the Government has decided that when it comes to a challenge of a State welfare regulation, that is not a message that the Government favors within the meaning of Rust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.686" offset="14349772">And again, NEA and the Wisconsin case last term did not suggest that Rust was limited to situations where it is the Government's own speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.801" offset="14390209">One way in which this case raises even less of a First Amendment question than Rust is the fact that in Rust the doctor was not even permitted to advise the client where other services could be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.265" offset="14440051">Under this program, the Legal Services lawyer, if he or she identifies a possible challenge to a statute or regulation, may tell the client that, may refer the client to another agency, to a pro bono list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.012" offset="14495013">Every LSC recipient is required to have a private attorney involved in the program with a list of attorneys to whom cases may be referred, so there is no gagging of communications at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.696" offset="14541824">Even though there's no attorney client relationship, the LSC fund recipient can refer the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.897" offset="14562618">Also, in the context of litigation, to the extent the courtroom is a forum, it's a forum that exists independent of the Legal Services Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.192" offset="14595741">What the Legal Services Corporation does is decide what sorts of cases are going to be funded, and there isn't enough money to go around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.962" offset="14622804">Congress had to decide how those moneys should be allocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.306" offset="14636178">Lawyers do this all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.792" offset="14642134">Legal Services recipients do this all the time, in terms of setting their own priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.789" offset="14662196">With respect to issues concerning challenging the Government's position, one need look no further than sovereign immunity on the State level to the Eleventh Amendment to recognize that there are many situations in which the Government may decline to allow challenges in court to its own positions and, by the same token, Congress could certainly choose not to... could repeal the Equal Access to Justice Act and not provide attorney's fees to people who want to sue the Government, even though it may provide attorney's fees for suits against private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.969" offset="14798869">And as we point out in our brief, Congress has provided differential standards for the award of attorney's fees, favoring plaintiffs in certain types of cases like environmental cases or civil rights cases, but not favoring the defendants in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.548" offset="14853204">As Justice Scalia pointed out, all litigation has two sides, and in one respect could be viewed as viewpoint, but this Court has never analyzed regulations on attorney conduct or the attorney client relationship in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.436" offset="14900746">Also, with respect to the argument that this is an anti Government... a prohibition against anti Government speech, this is... there's not a monolithic Government here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.603" offset="14937422">This statute prohibits an LSC recipient from taking on a case where what she would be doing would be challenging a State regulation as being in violation of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.581" offset="14981308">In other words, it would be a situation where the lawyer might even be trying to vindicate, in her view, what Federal law says on the subject, but still the client is not, or the attorney is not permitted to take that on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.752" offset="15033971">Congress could reasonably determine in the allocation of scarce resources that that was a better allocation of the resources.</text>
