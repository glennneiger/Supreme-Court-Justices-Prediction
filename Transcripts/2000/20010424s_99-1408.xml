            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92818">The opinion of the Court in No. 99-1408, Atwater verus the City of Lago Vista will be announced by Justice Souter.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="11.767" offset="139838">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.117" offset="165229">Texas state law makes it a misdemeanor, punishable only by a fine, for a front-seat passenger in a car equipped with seatbelts to fail to wear a seatbelt or for the driver of such a car to fail to secure any small child riding in front.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.358" offset="234193">Texas law further authorizes the warrantless arrest for anyone found violating the seatbelt provisions, although it permits police to issue citations in lieu of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.373" offset="286229">In March of 1997, a Lago Vista police officer stopped the petitioner Gail Atwater for violating the seatbelt law.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.362" offset="322173">After upbraiding Atwater, the officer arrested and handcuffed her, placed her in his squad car, and transported her to the police station, where she was made to remove her shoes and jewelry and eyeglasses and empty her pockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.731" offset="379642">Booking officers then took Atwater’s "mug shot" and placed her in a jail cell for approximately one hour at which time she was released on bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.468" offset="418617">After pleading guilty to the seatbelt misdemeanor and paying the $50 fine, Atwater and her husband filed suit alleging that the officer’s actions violated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.125" offset="477236">The District Court rejected Atwater’s claim and granted summary judgment for the City and the officer and the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.564" offset="519032">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk of Court, we affirm and hold that the Fourth amendment does not forbid police to make warrantless arrest for minor criminal offenses like the seatbelt misdemeanor in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.432" offset="578487">Initially and we think significantly, there is no historical basis for such a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.464" offset="606594">In the years leading up to this nation’s founding for example, Parliament repeatedly authorized police officers to make warrantless arrest for misdemeanor-level offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.324" offset="650062">The relevant American evidences to the same effect, neither the history of the framing, nor subsequent legal developments, indicate that the Fourth Amendment was originally understood or has traditionally been read to forbid warrantless misdemeanor arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.109" offset="721220">On the contrary for more than 200 years now, legislatures have conferred warrantless misdemeanor arrest power and courts have sustained that authority against constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.489" offset="770748">We will not depart from that tradition today.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.716" offset="783600">Further we refuse Atwater’s request and mandate a new rule of constitutional law forbidding custodial arrest when conviction could not ultimately carry any jail time and the government shows no compelling need for immediate detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.326" offset="850056">For reasons more fully explained in our opinion, we believe that a standard requiring sensitive case-by-case determinations of government need, would be difficult, if not outright impossible for officers in the field to administer and would result probably in a crush of Fourth Amendment litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.696" offset="927587">We simply are not convinced that there is a sufficiently serious problem of police abusing their minor offense arrest authority to justify the development of a new and distinct body of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.074" offset="981086">Isolated incidents can and should be dealt with through the normal political processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.025" offset="1004909">Justice O’Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer joined.</text>
