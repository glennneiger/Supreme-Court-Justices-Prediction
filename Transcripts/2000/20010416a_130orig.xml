            <text syncTime="1517.587" offset="6218360">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.295" offset="6297145">I would like to start by framing what appears to be the central issue before the Court, and that issue is as follows: Maine and the United States argue that NH is bound by its position in the 1976 case concerning the meaning of the 1740 boundary decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.395" offset="6385543">That case involved the determination of the state's lateral marine boundary that ran between the mouths of Pourtsmouth Harbor and Gosport Harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.473" offset="6425876">Now the boundary decree in question which was issued as an order to counsel in 1740, describes the boundary as follows, and I will paraphrase the description: The boundary passes up through the mouth of Piscataqua Harbor and up the middle of the River into the River Newichwannock and through the same to the furthest head and it divides the Isles of Shoals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.838" offset="6531307">In 1976 Maine and New Hampshire agreed that three phrases in the 1740 decree had relevance in determining the location of their lateral marine boundary, and those phrases were as follows: Phrase number one: The boundary passes up through the mouth of the harbor; Phrase two: It passes up the middle of the river; and Phrase three, it divides the Isles of Shoals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.344" offset="6657321">Since that time, NH has determined for good historical reasons after a searching review of original records and maps that the phrase up the middle of the river has no relevance to determining the location of the boundary in the harbor and the tidal portions of the Piscataqua River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.977" offset="6759930">Maine and the United States claim that the stipulation in 1976 preludes NH from arguing in this case that that phrase, up the middle of the river, had no application to the location of the boundary in Portsmouth Harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.828" offset="6847284">NH contends that it is precluded from arguing that, because that phrase... up the middle of the river... was not essential to this Court's jurisdictions to enter judgment approving the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.455" offset="6913844">We say that it wasn't essential to the Court's jurisdiction and we say that if anything, it impeded the Court's ability to enter that Order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2281.699" offset="9274791">And that's... that's why I think that the 1976 order issued by this Court does stand for the proposition that the states have broad latitude in coming to agreement as to the lcoation of a boundary when the underlying boundary instrument is imprecise, and I think the second correlary of that is this Court need not adjudicate the actual true and correct historical meaning of the underlying decree in approving such an agreement of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.204" offset="9380743">I think later on in the Multi-state Tax Commission that we cited in our brief, in that case the Court explicitly cited this case as well as the Virginia v.

            <text syncTime="2329.073" offset="9464231">So I think it goes to the point of whether this Court could ahve approved that consent agreement entered into between New Hampshire and Maine, had that stipulation not been there, regarding the meaning of the phrase middle of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.783" offset="9523058">And the answer to that has to be yes, and particularly for the reasons you state regarding the dissent that was raised, because there is no legal or historical authority for defining the term middle of the river as it was used in 1740 to mean a ships' channel marked by 1956 range lights that clearly was not located at the location of the solweig.</text>

Maine case to litigate the legal extent of its seaward boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.097" offset="10092319">So this was not a case where the parties intended to negotiate or to conclude a boundary in the Harbor; the dogleg portion of it was done to accommodate Maine's interests in reserving its right to litigate the question of the legal extent of its seaward boundaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.101" offset="14248401">The notion that we can suggest today that the Attorneys General in the 1970s didn't know anything... didn't know what we know today... is exactly why we have res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.637" offset="14310572">The circus of what we almost would have to do is bring those folks back in and cross-examining them is why we have res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.966" offset="14347875">NH had the opportunity to press a shoreline boundary which had all the incentive and the fair opportunity to do it in the 1970s.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.290" offset="14381103">Its failure to do so precludes it from doing so now, and the reason we have these specific findings, rulings and legal principles accoridng to NH, as they explained in the 1970s was to avoid the Vermont v. New York problem where there was a decree without findings, without an adjudication of any issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.890" offset="14483503">Because of that concern that this decree might not be approved, these specific findings and rulings and legal principles were laid out here, and they are made without reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.466" offset="14537837">Getting back to Justice Breyer's question, paragraph five, if we can read the line, says quote... the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River, commencing in the vicinity of Fort Point and Fishing Island... so it's an effort... maybe not an exact effort, but it's an effort to lay out the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.769" offset="14635013">There may have been reasons to have it as a straight line in that channel, but it is an effort.</text>
