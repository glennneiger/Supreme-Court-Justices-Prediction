            <text syncTime="252.338" offset="1171205">That would be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.911" offset="1177579">There was some initial testimony at trial regarding other wetland uses, excuse me, other upland uses perhaps, but later on at trial that became clear that any other upland on this property could only be reached by filling wetland to access it.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.608" offset="1252289">And at trial the CRMC executive director made it quite clear that there were no residential structures could meet the compelling public purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1747.114" offset="7150320">It did not have to do with the ISDS system and that was based on testimony that was in the record about the fact that there are nitrates and things that wash into this pond and the wetland itself is the mechanism that filters those nitrates out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.373" offset="7863358">And to get back to the question about Lucas, that's significant, because the Court addressed the valuelessness issue and found that there was substantial value there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2031.931" offset="8289572">There is not in the first case, because he hasn't yet sold off the rest of the one square mile, but if he sells off the rest of the one square mile, and makes the very same application, gets the very same result, then there's been a taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.549" offset="8544109">I'd like to focus a moment on the ripeness issues that the Rhode Island Supreme Court raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.753" offset="8572949">And the first has to do, they found obviously that this case was unripe on two grounds, and the first ground was that there had been no application for the 74-unit subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.448" offset="8615685">And that to us makes perfect sense because in the Rhode Island courts, unlike in this Court, the petitioner presented that 74-unit subdivision as a proposal and not as a claim of value for determining the size of the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.847" offset="8697291">And so that is very likely responsive to the argument made to that court that this was a proposal, and even if it was not responsive to that, I would argue, even if they were asserting a proposition of Rhode Island ripeness law that we want in Rhode Island to have people when they come and apply for a use or come and make a takings claim for a particular use to have applied for that same use at some point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.082" offset="13338206">At least, in our view, the record in this case strongly supports the assertion that filling of wetlands has been a very rare practice in this part of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.543" offset="13380106">Now it's true that it wasn't until comparatively recently that statutory permit requirements were imposed as a prerequisite to the fill of wetlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.549" offset="13416051">But the record doesn't suggest that extensive filling of wetlands has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.477" offset="13431829">Now, my understanding is that even as to the dry land in this area it is only a short distance above the water table, and therefore even to construct a house on dry beach land you need fill, but it's not fill of wetlands and it doesn't have the same environmental consequences as wetlands fill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.002" offset="13497866">And the point we'd like to stress is that the requirements imposed most recently by the CRMP and informally by its predecessors are generally applicable limitations on the ways in which wetlands properties can be used and they secure a reciprocity of advantage to landowners in the vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.601" offset="13572263">So it's easy to say on the one hand that the Coastal Resources Management Plan hurts Mr. Palazzolo in one sense, in that it limits the use he can make of the wetlands portion of his property, but at the same time the fact that those prohibitions are imposed on his neighbors as well tends to benefit Mr. Palazzolo insofar as his tract also includes an uplands area, because presumably the prevention of filling by neighbors preserves the quality of the environmental resources in the area, most notably Winnapaug Pond and in practical effect the restrictions function as a sort of density restriction that is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.706" offset="13936723">And the explication in the body of the petition of that third question presented made it clear that Mr. Palazzolo was not claiming the wetlands portion are a... constitute a separate parcel and the value of that is zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.340" offset="13983221">Rather the basis of the takings claim as it came to the Court in the cert petition was that the parcel as a whole had a value of only 200,000 dollars and that that value was so small in comparison to the purported 3 million dollar figure as to amount to a total deprivation of economically beneficial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.812" offset="14053125">I think even if the point hadn't been weighed, there would be strong arguments for regarding this all as a single parcel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.167" offset="14074545">It was bought together, it was platted together, and the State's appraiser testified, and his testimony was credited by the trier of fact, that the presence of wetland areas even if they couldn't be separately developed would enhance the value of a home constructed on the uplands area, in the sense that a house constructed on a 20-acre parcel is going to be more valuable than a house constructed on a two acre plot, because you have open space, you have a feeling of privacy and seclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.888" offset="14201396">I think it's also important to recognize that the original investment in this property was something less than 13,000 dollars, that is... I say something less because SGI purchased a larger parcel for 13,000 dollars and partly in 1959 and partly in 1969 sold portions of it for prices that aren't revealed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.801" offset="14285092">So if Mr. Palazzolo or his predecessor, SGI, put in 13,000 dollars and now has something worth 200,000 dollars he's hardly had anything taken from him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.153" offset="14394493">Petitioner's appraiser, in arriving at the 3 million dollar figure, looked at a nearby tract, presumably on uplands, and said that lot sold for 125,000 dollars and he said the lots that could be constructed out of wetlands are... could be made comparable to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.659" offset="14460531">And if you sold 74 of them at 125,000 dollars each, you would come up with a figure of a little over 9 million dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="3635.560" offset="14704096">But if you look at the methodology that was addressed by Mr. Palazzolo's appraiser, he took as his starting point the price that was paid for a comparable lot in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.065" offset="14750176">Now obviously that price was paid in an environment where wetlands development in this region is subject to substantial restrictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3970.690" offset="16044596">--Mr. Burling, may I ask you a very brief question on the valuing, your third question, the value greater than zero, does that mean we should just assume there's a value greater than zero because the uplands has value, or do we assume for the purpose of the case that the wetlands also have value that enhances the value of the uplands?</text>

            <text syncTime="3986.547" offset="16108126">--Either way, Your Honor, the 200,000 figure does include a so called 7,000 dollar per acre attribution from the wetlands that cannot be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.990" offset="16157863">I am not sure that that is a legitimate way of looking at the value of this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.366" offset="16179388">If that remaining wetland belonged to the State, if it had been taken by the State, which is indeed what we assert here, the value to the upland owner would be the same, whether or not title allegedly belonged to the owner or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.557" offset="16236126">They're talking about the valley from a nice view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.211" offset="16246679">What we are saying is that nice view has been taken by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.878" offset="16269354">And so the true value of what the upland is, if you do not add in this attribution is probably significantly less than that, indeed in the trial transcript, in the testimony of Thomas Andolfo at pages 662 to... 682 to 683 is where this 200,000 dollar value comes from, it talks about a few dollars being spent to improve the road, and then primarily the rest of the value will come from this attribution of the remaining area.</text>

            <text syncTime="4058.161" offset="16394532">Well, under your view of the case, if you lose because there's 200,000 dollars worth of value and we hold that Lucas bars you, then some later purchasers could just purchase the 18 or so acres of wetlands and sue.</text>

            <text syncTime="4071.613" offset="16448345">A later purchaser of those 18 acres, after attempting to go through the permitting process, may indeed be able to sue if, as the question said earlier, this area is within the economically viable size of development in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.294" offset="16527025">I think that is one way of looking at it, we certainly know that there are three home sites on fill in the... immediately adjacent to Mr. Palazzolo's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.738" offset="16560880">Home sites that are very small as the record reflects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.587" offset="16576240">And if there are 18 acres of developable property on site, then indeed that should be looked at separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.813" offset="16613125">But that is something I do not think this Court needs to fully determine, what... what the situation would be in that hypothetical, because in this case we know that Mr. Palazzolo can make no use of his wetland, and we know that his... the value of the upland should not be enough to simply take this case out of a determination of whether there has been economically viable use.</text>
