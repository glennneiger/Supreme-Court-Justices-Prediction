            <text syncTime="60.198" offset="390127">The issue before the Court in this case is whether a State prisoner can extend the 1-year limitations period for Federal habeas corpus petitions by filing repetitive motions in State court that are procedurally barred from review under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.452" offset="447179">There are at least three reasons why these motions should not be afforded tolling.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.112" offset="545817">They provide State prisoners with a simple expedient to defeat the statute of limitations at will, and allowing tolling for such motions undermines core principles of comity and federalism.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.977" offset="645187">Under a plain reading of the statutory language the words, properly filed, must mean something more than simply filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.767" offset="728361">Maybe just properly filed in the sense of being timely and in the proper place, or maybe getting permission from the State, a certificate of appealability if the State requires it, that kind of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.833" offset="1032635">Properly filed must mean something more than filed, in addition to the ordinary rules of statutory construction, which would so indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.997" offset="1061370">In addition, here Congress used the word filed 24 times in the habeas corpus statute but modified it with the word properly only once, so it must have meant that the words properly filed had something more than an inconsequential or nominal meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.402" offset="1118944">Second, there's a plain sense, plain common sense reading of the words, properly filed, under which a document, to be properly filed, has to be filed in the right place, in the right court, and even some of the cases upon which the respondent relies so indicated.</text>

I mean, a procedural bar is something that can be waived and, as counterintuitive as it may be, I mean, we occasionally do get cases before this Court in which there seems to have been a procedural bar that the State didn't invoke, so it seems to me that we're not in the position of even being able to analyze this on a merely... or I shouldn't say merely, on a jurisdictional basis, because it really doesn't go to the State court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.814" offset="1476612">It goes to the discretionary decision by the State prosecutor to invoke the bar, and so I don't think we can do it on the third prong that you mentioned, which I understood was in a sense in effect a jurisdictional prong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.644" offset="5019861">The language, structure, and objectives of section 2244(d) tell us that Congress intended the tolling provision to harmonize the limitations period and the exhaustion doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.952" offset="5069181">Respondent's construction of the term, properly filed application, undermines the limitation period and reads the word properly out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.083" offset="5097706">I'd like to turn to some of the federalism questions that were raised in terms of how the State's construction of the term furthers the State's federalism interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.323" offset="5146607">It does so when we recognize the fact that the limitations period itself was enacted by Congress to further the State's comity concerns by speeding up the date at which the Federal habeas process will take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.011" offset="5197390">Congress was motivated by the fact that it often took many, many years for the Federal courts to possibly order a new trial, or generally to provide finality to the State conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.018" offset="5245455">It may be that as a consequence of the State rule there will be a protective Federal filing such as that which Justice Breyer and Justice Stevens mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.262" offset="5286415">Notwithstanding the fact that this may take place at the same time that the State proceeding is occurring, it still furthers the State's comity interest, because often the State... the Federal court will be able to recognize that the application is plainly procedurally barred, at which point the Federal court can proceed to rule on the habeas application and would be doing so many years sooner than it otherwise would have been, which is precisely the goal that Congress had in enacting the limitation--</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.186" offset="6390036">Respondents treat the word properly as merely modifying how a document is filed, almost the physical manner by which it's filed, but properly can also be read to modify the question of whether the document should have been filed in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.871" offset="6540815">Well, in the habeas corpus context, where there's such a focus on compliance with the various procedural bars, and where the procedural default context expressly exists to accommodate the situations where State procedural rules aren't complied with, but prisoners aren't considered to have done anything wrong if they have exhausted their State remedies but lost on the merits, we think that same... Congress had that same mind set here, where the prisoner isn't treated as having done anything wrong, having done anything improper or incorrect by bringing losing claims, but the prisoner has done something wrong by bringing claims that are barred by mandatory State court rules, and then attempting to delay the limitations period, possibly indefinitely, by filing repetitive, improper claims in the State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.675" offset="8252044">If... and I call it, for lack of a better word, the uncertainty principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.401" offset="8270957">If a petitioner, or the lawyer knows with certainty that tolling will be affected, the lawyer will not have to file a protective filing, but if there's uncertainty as to whether tolling will be affected, that uncertainty creates, there's no question, as I stated in my opening statement, that it be almost malpractice not to file a protective filing, and what's wrong with protective filings?</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.670" offset="8368028">I think the petitioner takes a somewhat relaxed view of how Federal district court judges are going to view protective filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.074" offset="8401674">I don't think Federal district court judges are going to be happy with them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.594" offset="8415675">What really will happen if there's uncertainty of tolling is that all State... word gets around quickly in the jails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.481" offset="8451306">We all know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.280" offset="8454441">This Court knows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.201" offset="8458098">These State prisoners will begin filing first in Federal court, and what they will be seeking and obtaining is essentially a declaratory judgment by the Federal judge on State substantive and procedural law, so they'll have a Federal judge in the first instance say, okay, these three claims are exhausted, these four claims are not exhausted, so now you can go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.672" offset="8543989">And now, of course, the certainty of tolling, which Congress set up to be in the mechanism of the properly filed application, now that certainty of tolling is resulted by pronouncement of a Federal district court judge and, of course, this increases a Federal judge's workload immeasurably, because many of these claims, or some percentage of these claims where a State prisoner is exhausting will be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.546" offset="8651509">Maybe the State prisoner will get relief on the merits in State court, and they'll never have to bother a Federal district court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.040" offset="8677527">But if there's uncertainty of tolling, the Federal judge will deal with all these cases before they're allowed to run through the State court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.938" offset="8709083">And the other thing to, I think respectfully to focus on is, as this Court stated unanimously in Michael Williams v. Taylor, quote, we start as always with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.927" offset="8769060">This statute says, properly filed application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.444" offset="8783061">Properly is an adverb, modifying the verb filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.617" offset="8795809">The subject of that phrase is an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.053" offset="8805527">The State and amici have suggested that although Congress chose the words, properly filed application, it really meant to say something else, a properly presented claim, an application presenting claims the defendant has a right to raise, but in fact, Congress had all of that phraseology and language at its disposal, and it's used that very language in other parts of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.284" offset="8902493">For instance, where Congress sought to define exhaustion, they did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.021" offset="8921406">2254(c), as this Court's recognized in the Wainwright and Duckworth and O'Sullivan decisions, that statute defines exhaustion, so if Congress... if Congress wanted to write a statute that conditioned tolling on actual exhaustion, they could have simply said that tolling will occur with a properly filed application presenting questions the applicant has the right to raise by any available procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.576" offset="9023597">That language was right there for Congress to use just a few pages later, after 2244.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.015" offset="9049406">Congress did not use that language. Where Congress sought to limit successive applications and predicate tolling on one application only, they did so not in one but in two places, 2244(b)(3), which requires judicial approval, and 2263 in the opting provision, where you have tolling for a first post conviction application, so Congress had that language available it could have used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.092" offset="9133729">In the very statute at issue, 2244, Congress specifically sought to address a claim presented in an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.486" offset="9171241">Those series of words occur a number of times, at 2244(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.403" offset="9194960">So all of this language that the petitioner suggests really, Congress really meant to say, was used, and under this Court's decisions we start with the language of the statute and I think in this case we also end with the language of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.005" offset="11541383">In 1989, the Chief Justice appointed the Powell Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.320" offset="11554653">The Powell Commission assembled, wrote a report called the Powell Commission report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.472" offset="11575238">Those findings were embodied in very large part in Chapter 154, so delays in capital cases is something that Congress has been concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.692" offset="11616093">They... a commission was... dealt with it, and they recommendations of that commission were largely incorporated in Chapter 154, so with respect to death penalty cases, one thing is for sure, Congress said yes, we're concerned about it and we have an answer, and our answer is the opt in provision, so if States comply with the opt in provision, they get the one collateral review, and they have 180 days to go to Federal court, with some exceptions, so that's clearly... Congress has dealt with that, number 1.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.838" offset="11876691">In addition, this Court's decision in Gomez is very important, because it sets an incentive for defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.473" offset="11907202">What happened in Gomez, this Court may recall is, the defendant did abuse the State court system and started bringing last minute claims, new claims on the eve of the execution, and finally came before this Court and said, well, please grant me a stay, and this Court in Gomez said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.460" offset="11975120">You've abused the State court process, you've let too much time gone by, you haven't properly presented your claims, we're not going to give you a stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.455" offset="12483150">Number 2, if that happens, the State can... State judge can simply send an order to the clerk's office, do not accept this defendant's applications either without leave of court, or simply don't accept them any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.461" offset="12535185">In death penalty cases, a State can say, we've had enough of this, we're setting an execution date, and that will force the defendant to go straight to Federal court, so I think there are a lot of ways to deal with the vexatious litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.623" offset="12583773">And also, keep in mind that even though tolling occurs, that during the periods of time that there is no tolling, that the clock is running, so if defendant files an application and the application is denied, and then a month later files another one, or 2 months later, that time is going to toll, but I think these are ad hoc problems, and that State courts are certainly well equipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.958" offset="12673112">If a State determines that there is a general, more general delay problem the State, under our version of the rule, has absolute freedom to adopt any kind of procedure the State wishes to do, whether it's timing requirements or successiveness limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.637" offset="12727865">In fact, 2244(b)(3) is a wonderful model that States could follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.351" offset="12758689">They could set up a system where, under successive application, the State prisoner must obtain judicial review first, or approval first to file, so there is a whole panoply, really, of options available to a State to deal with these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.618" offset="12815845">One concern that we suggest occurs with respect, however, to the interplay between 153 and 154 is the following hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.715" offset="12868194">If a State opts in, in a death penalty case, the State opts in, the defendant gets an attorney, a competent attorney, the defendant gets one run through of the State collateral review process, and there's no question that they can bring up any claim they want, there's no suggestion in the State's briefs that they're limited on what kinds of claims they can bring up in that one review process, be it procedurally barred claims or otherwise, when that petition is disposed of, they have 180 days to get into Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.100" offset="12989716">Now watch what could happen with a death penalty defendant if the State's rule is adopted, because under 153, the death penalty defendant now is convicted, files a post application, post conviction application, does... may or may not have a lawyer, because the State has not opted in, and it turns out all of the claims in the post conviction application are procedurally barred and more than 1 year has gone by.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.662" offset="13095982">The defendant, who is not represented because the State has not opted in, now has lost his or her right to even get into Federal court on a habeas, so that's a possibility with the State's view of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.792" offset="13164527">If I may just have a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.336" offset="13190650">The other cases that we respectfully suggest the State's rule conflicts with are this Court's decision in Rose v. Lundy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.692" offset="13244149">Rose said that an application, the mixed application should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.016" offset="13261390">The State suggests, well, we can kind of modify Rose v. Lundy and say that the application will be held in abeyance, but Rose v. Lundy says no, it should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.988" offset="13297334">Of course, if the application is dismissed, and 1 year passes, that defendant could be deprived of going into Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.553" offset="13323561">The O'Sullivan decision was just decided a year ago says the defendants must bring all their claims... must seek leave to bring their claims to the highest court in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.828" offset="13356684">There again, this is exactly, actually, this case, Tony Bennett's case, is O'Sullivan, because here Tony Bennett is, having lost in the trial court, now is trying to seek leave to the Appellate Division, Second Department, hasn't received the order for 4 years in which to do so, so he's trying to comply with O'Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.312" offset="13422617">But meanwhile, the clock is running, and under the State's rule... well, because the trial court determined that his claims are procedurally barred, he's already lost his right to get into Federal court, even though at the same time O'Sullivan says you must be trying to seek leave and appeal your petitions in order to exhaust, so there's a conflict there as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.416" offset="13511016">Finally, this Court's decision in Lonchar v. Thomas, this Court said that dismissal of the first habeas corpus is a very serious matter, and any rule that would deprive a first habeas corpus application should be clear and fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.148" offset="13577889">There's no limitation in 2244(d)(2) as to first habeases or second habeases, or first post conviction applications or second post conviction applications, so we respectfully submit that the State's rule is inconsistent as well with this Court's considered judgment and pronouncements in Lonchar v. Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.579" offset="13659600">And if no Justices have any further questions, I will submit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.549" offset="13699515">Your Honor, I would just like to address the question, I believe it was Justice Ginsburg's question actually about why adopt our rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.529" offset="13727414">If there are many different applications of the words, properly filed, there are many different reasonable interpretations of the words properly filed, why ours?</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.093" offset="13753745">Why not just the petitioner's?</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.330" offset="13758656">Ours because the purpose of a statute of... the purpose of a tolling provision is exhaustion, and our rule follows the purpose of the tolling provision to a tee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.966" offset="13797213">It follows it much more closely, certainly, than the respondent's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.052" offset="13809543">Exhaustion does not require a State prisoner to return to State court to exhaust a remedy that's no longer available under State law because it's procedurally barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.319" offset="13846637">The respondent also mentions the workload costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.501" offset="13867326">If the Court views the workload costs, it should view them as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.374" offset="13878820">The States are saving much in the way of workload here, and the Federal courts, for example, are pushing most of these defendants forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.059" offset="13905569">These are defendants who would in any event file in Federal court, but much later, and the purpose of the statute of limitations is being affected by drawing closer that period of time between final... between direct review and Federal review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.589" offset="13963665">And finally, as to time bars, the danger with requiring the States to enact time bars--</text>
