            <text syncTime="18.728" offset="232124">The Massachusetts Attorney General's advertising ban constitutes a prohibition, based on smoking and health, imposed under State law with respect to cigarettes and other tobacco products.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.952" offset="285100">For those straightforward reasons, it is preempted by Federal law and, for these and other reasons, it abridges free speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="61.222" offset="402129">Of course it is based on smoking and health, as one look at Massachusetts' First Amendment argument proves, and as they ultimately concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.310" offset="434520">Massachusetts' alternative argument is that the ban can be sustained so long as there are other permissible nonpreemptive grounds for the ban, but if--</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="131.235" offset="682161">--Well, the fact is, under the ban you're not allowed to have advertisements specifically with the warning label that is required under Federal law, so in that way, operationally, it's precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.693" offset="724062">But I just want to make sure that our position is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.376" offset="734720">It has both an effects and an intent component to it, the based-on-smoking-and-health language, and that's why it's banned under either theory.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="151.981" offset="765231">So the fact that the Surgeon General's warning cannot be advertised in conjunction with a proposal for a commercial transaction means that health is adversely affected?</text>

            <text syncTime="164.856" offset="816640">Absolutely, Your Honor, and here's the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.039" offset="825417">In 1969, when they were looking at whether to amend section 5(d) and how to amend it, one of the great concerns was that States or localities ultimately would respond to the FTC's warning requirement on advertising by ultimately expressing disagreement with that warning requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.484" offset="891245">The concern was after '69 they'd say, that's not enough, we don't like it, and so what they'd do in response is, they'd say, we're just going to ban advertising altogether, and that's exactly what California was considering in '69, New York City was considering in '69.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.641" offset="943804">It was before the Congress in 1969, and that's why they banned this very type of thing.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="201.695" offset="964075">Other than the elimination and the unavailability of the Surgeon General's warning, are there any other objective and not subjective or motivational features that I... that show that this is based on health that I can determine from the... by looking at the regulatory scheme itself?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="218.991" offset="1033247">Everything, Your Honor... you're saying specifically regulations themselves, and you're saying we're not going to look at why Massachusetts did that, and so just for a second we'll suspend that and assume you don't look at intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.798" offset="1076401">But even if you look at intent, at what they did in effect, it's not just that you can't get the warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.250" offset="1094269">Obviously, it just relates to schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.552" offset="1103464">I mean, that is a health-related reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.737" offset="1112241">They were concerned about underage sales to children.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="242.639" offset="1127810">Well, of course, the very fact that they applied this to tobacco advertising and no other kind of advertising suggests something peculiar about tobacco that they didn't like.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.228" offset="1162187">--Absolutely, Your Honor, and I mean, that alone on the face of the statute proves the very fact.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="255.347" stopTime="304.097">

            <text syncTime="255.347" offset="1178697">Mr. Sutton what are... the response to that was... or one response to that was in the Massachusetts brief, and it said, look, in the real world, any... as the Chief Justice suggested, any advertising ban or lmitation directed to tobacco is going to be based on smoke... on the relationship between tobacco and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.445" offset="1271066">We recognize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.064" offset="1277544">They said, however, if you read the ban that broadly, if you read the preemption that broadly, rather, then the words of limitation, which are... which refer to smoking and health are going to have no limitation at all, becasue it's going to include everything, and therefore you've got to pull back or the words become meaningless.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.097" offset="1373675">Well, Your Honor, that's an important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.632" offset="1383810">In 1969, the reason you had to have based-on-smoking-and-health language there is, otherwise this ban would apply to all general zoning laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.737" offset="1420173">In other words, you'd have ERISA II without the based-on-smoking-and-health language.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.080" offset="1481613">My point is that, without the based-on-smoking-and-health language you'd have ERISA in the sense that every State law that had any application to cigarette advertising would be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.453" offset="1523095">That would mean the States or localities couldn't have general zoning laws regarding advertising, billboards, or store front signs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.340" offset="8450664">Your Honor is correct that the 1965 preemption language preempted statements relating to smoking and health.</text>

            <text syncTime="2111.215" offset="8602070">Now, maybe the inference from that is that it left out, Congress wanted to leave out billboard and print media advertising, let that not be covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2141.467" offset="8723173">In addition, Your Honor, the fact that Congress at the same time prohibited advertising on television and radio, I don't think provides any basis for an inference...

            <text syncTime="2231.144" offset="9081782">But what you see in the legislative history is a great concern that the advertising dollars that were saved when TV advertising stopped would simply migrate to other places.</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.229" offset="12278125">--Well, a rule that says that you can't advertise at all is a blanket rule like a rule that prohibits deception, which might also prohibit some claims about smoking and health and isn't aimed at claims on smoking and health, so I would say it's not prohibited under that understanding of the preemption statute, but one could distinguish that from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.844" offset="12364643">I'd like to point out that based on can have different meanings in different contexts, but when one statute describes another statute as a rule based on something, as a regulation based on something, that language ordinarily refers to the operating criteria of the regulation, and not the reason why it was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.323" offset="12446563">For example, when Congress in one statute refers to another statute... to taxes based on revenues, or it refers to requirements imposed on vehicles based on size or weight, it is using a shorthand description of a category of statute, and it is describing the text of the... of that other statute, the criteria that that statute uses, and not the reasons it came into existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3186.911" offset="12904855">And then by adding prohibitions Congress reached State laws that would have the effect of requiring new warnings, but would do so in the form of a prohibition, say, for example, no advertising without this warning, which in effect requires a warning, but does it in the form of a prohibition, and it would also reach State laws prohibiting affirmative health claims about filters, say, or the safety of a particular cigarette.</text>
