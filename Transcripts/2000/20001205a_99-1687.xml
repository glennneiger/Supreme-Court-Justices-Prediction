            <text syncTime="46.665" offset="341694">And for that reason, Congress and the legislatures of virtually every state in this country have made it unlawful to gain access to a private communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.430" offset="1604766">I think there are two responses to the question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.031" offset="1615111">The first is there is in the law, as the Government's reply brief points out a doctrine of necessity which in some narrow circumstances, and it's not precisely clear how far it extends, in essence privileges what would otherwise be a violation of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.059" offset="1679268">If the statute doesn't rule that defense out.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.862" offset="1686477">So an action to protect life and limb may be an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.186" offset="1707793">The second answer though, is that... because it is a very hard question, but there are... when there are content neutral laws that say that because of the way in which information came to someone, that information is not to be revealed be it these statutes or be it for example a protective orders in the Seattle Times, that generally the fact that what was revealed is a matter of public importance does not automatically say that the interests that are being served by the content neutral law that says either you should not have this information at all or you should not be able to use it, they don't necessarily give way.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.734" offset="1878007">And that's indeed if this exact tape had been received in discovery I believe under Seattle Times the press could again be prevented from making use and publishing the tape.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="443.872" offset="1930461">Well, but in Seattle Times and Rhinehart and in the Aguilar case, we were controlling the people who received the information under a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.161" offset="1983646">They were within our immediate control.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.891" offset="1990543">The Rhinehart case would be as if somebody surreptitiously took this tape and gave if to a person and then that person gave it to the newspapers.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.829" offset="2094301">The interests are different granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.631" offset="2101511">And the Court did not say in Seattle Times that the fact that this information is coming in discovery means there is no First Amendment concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.647" offset="2133589">Quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.368" offset="2136515">The Court said the Court has to conclude that there will be harm to privacy interests and the like if it is disclosed and the Court applied intermediate scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.135" offset="2175594">But the Court said that because of interests of the justice system that are served by being able to limit disclosure of that which is given in discovery we can tolerate the fact that the press cannot tell the public something of great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.602" offset="2229406">Here we again have very vital interests, different interests, but the interests of people knowing that they will not come home some day and have a hundred thousand people hearing a phone call that they made.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.369" offset="2272456">And I submit that what unites those cases and in essense solves the problem here is the fact that we're dealing with a totally content neutral statute and one which as applied does not unduly interfere with the ability of the press--</text>

            <text syncTime="583.196" offset="2487810">In other words, we are not saying, we don't have to say, that some of this is a category of speech of no First Amendment significance whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.326" offset="2552280">If those are then taken into account through a content neutral statutory regime, we believe and we have argued that that in essence exhausts the First Amendment concerns both as to level of scrutiny and as to satisfying scrutiny as long as we are not in one of the rare situations such as City of Ladue, for example, where the Court would say granted it's content neutral, but you're just restricting too much speech and we think in this case the question would be, the concern about whether this content neutral law... and let me just pause for a moment because I think it's essential to emphasize when I say content neutral this law is neutral in a way that absolutely requires a determination of content neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.881" offset="2758543">It's neutral as to viewpoint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.312" offset="11908296">The plain text of the statute uses a much broader term than is suggested by the Solicitor General and let me continue with the other four problems with tailoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.360" offset="11956466">The second is that it applies to any piece of information about the conversation, not merely the tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.461" offset="11980917">The fact that, and Justice... there was a question about talking to my neighbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.795" offset="11998157">In this context if you receive innocently a tape recording and merely mention the fact that you have... you know that there was a tape recording of the conversation, it applies equally because the definition of contents is so broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.544" offset="12053224">It's literally any datum about the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.947" offset="12062837">The third is that it imposes civil and criminal liability and permits the commencement of litigation even when there has been no injury at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.723" offset="12097945">And the plaintiffs in this case disavowed any claim that they had been actually been hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.676" offset="12117694">The fourth is that it applies equally no matter whether the information and indeed the conversation in question was even private.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.941" offset="12146742">And this was Justice O'Connor's first question is that the information that was spoken and was heard and intercepted could have been a completely public fact but the fact that it was said in a conversation would be disclosed, and fifth and this one is the particularly troubling one that I began with, it applies even when the information is of vital public significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.835" offset="12230334">Now, the reason I mentioned these five is that you have to look at someone who is in the position of receiving a piece of information and there is the grave concern that when you get a piece of information notwithstanding the reason to know the limitation which is what the Solicitor General points had to saving the statute, you had real doubts about the provenance of information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.038" offset="14023170">I think maybe you and I, Justice Ginsburg, are speaking about two slightly different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.162" offset="14039679">The first is a point you identified to my colleague before which is, is it really difficult to identify people and stop them when they are doing these kinds of interceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.758" offset="14078027">I think this court can assume that to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.781" offset="14090148">The point that I am making is that Congress when it legislated here did not operate on an understanding or any evidence that there was a problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.248" offset="14144064">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.660" offset="14149707">Questions about the extent of the necessity defense which we mentioned in our reply brief or the meaning of the word disclosure are all, of course, questions of application that will be given judicial interpretation in appropriate cases where they arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.502" offset="14213028">The salient point here is that the respondents have not made a case, either in their briefs or here, that going solely against the wiretapper is going to significantly protect privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.579" offset="14261302">And contrary to their representation, the legislative history does, in fact, reflect both great solicitude for the privacy rights involved and that's quoted at page 3 of our reply brief and also repeatedly the recognition that wiretapping and bugging and now of course we have hacking into e mails is almost completely impossible of interception or even detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.118" offset="14371539">The nominal fine that Mr. Levine referred to Levine referred to is, of course, $5,000 which is not nominal with respect to most people, and in any event exists independent of the civil remedy under 2520 that Congress thought was appropriate and Congress said in the legislative history was appropriate to vindicate the privacy rights of the people whose privacy interests were not vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.927" offset="14486686">The notion that there is a limiting principal for facts of public significance, I think, is fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.202" offset="14519810">First of all, if there were such an exception, that would not... that would deprive the statute of being content neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.637" offset="14545619">And second of all, there is almost no way to draw the line, as Justice Scalia suggests, for what is publicly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.884" offset="14578533">This court has already held twice that the name of a woman who has been raped, not the fact that there was a rape or the name of the perpetrator, but the victim is a matter of public significance and public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.581" offset="14633390">So we don't think that there is a constitutional way to draw a line here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.055" offset="14655228">The Daily Mail principle that the other side bases its case on is distinguishable from this case and this law in five critical respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.833" offset="14702353">Those were laws that applied only to the press and not to nonexpressive uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.887" offset="14726595">They were content based laws reflected a determination that society should not know certain information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.263" offset="14756061">They reflect... they dealt with information that came from the Government that is not in the hands of private parties and there are, we understand, reasons to respect a censorial motive when the Government seeks to limit disclosure of information about its own activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.096" offset="14831398">They did not... they all obtained... involved information that was lawfully obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.493" offset="14860969">Every single one of the persons who gave that information to the newspaper got it lawfully.</text>
