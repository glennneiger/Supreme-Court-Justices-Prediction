            <text syncTime="14.222" offset="204323">The Court today considers what is the proper standard of review for appellate courts when faced with a constitutional challenge to a punitive damage award as grossly excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.090" offset="251762">In the instant case, the Ninth Circuit upheld a punitive damage award against Cooper Industries of 4.5 million, which 90 times the $50,000 compensatory award.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.929" offset="303171">It did so using an abuse of discretion review standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.993" offset="319367">We submit that that was error, that the court of appeals should have examined the constitutional excessiveness issue independently under a de novo review standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.859" offset="362834">This Court framed the gross excessiveness constitutional inquiry as it applies to punitive damages in BMW v. Gore.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.125" offset="399928">It identified there three guideposts for making what is essentially a comparative analysis, looking at the reprehensibility of the offense, the ratio, or relationship of the punitive damages to the compensatory award, in order to discern whether the punishment or any discernible relationship to the offense or was wildly disproportional, and as a third guidepost to look at other available sanctions, whether criminal or civil, that would bear on the question of how society generally punishes this sort of offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.155" offset="640046">I mean, the question is whether the court abused its discretion in not considering this wildly disproportionate.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.251" offset="676408">Does that really boil down to any difference for... between whether it is wildly disproportionate... I just find it hard to imagine a situation in which I would be reviewing a district judge for abuse of discretion, and would find that it is... that it is an abuse of discretion, where I wouldn't also find that it was wildly disproportionate.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.892" offset="4086955">I think you're making two different kinds of arguments for the value of the de novo review.</text>

            <text syncTime="999.294" offset="4144634">The second argument is sort of a practical one, that if all you have is abuse of discretion review of what the trial judge does when the trial judge reviews the jury verdict, you're not going to have very many appellate cases, and you're certainly not going to have many appellate cases with exhaustive discussions of the way jury verdicts ought to be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.862" offset="4266887">And I think you're saying that if you have de novo review, you're simply going to have more articulations by appellate courts of the way trial courts ought to look at jury verdicts, and if you are making the second argument, I suppose you're making... you're saying what ought to happen in the development of the review of punitive damages is the same thing that I think happened back in the old days on the review of jury verdicts of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.414" offset="4401052">If you go back in the law reports to the twenties and the thirties when negligence law was developing, you find exhaustive appellate discussions of whether, you know, the train was close enough to the intersection for the driver to have been negligent in going out on the track, and so on, and I think you're arguing for a sort of parallel between punitive damages development and maybe the old negligence law development, in that you're saying each one would profit greatly by having plenary treatment in appellate courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.808" offset="12678629">Well, it is in that way, although of course the Gore factors themselves are distilled from the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.391" offset="12704960">I mean, Your Honor did not mint them from new sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.835" offset="12722723">You traced back to the common law roots, and footnote 24 of Gore in fact refers to their deep rooted nature within the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.291" offset="12768594">So we think the common law precedents are still highly instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.573" offset="12781760">But going back to the line between compensatories and punitives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.325" offset="12792732">I mean, at common law there was not that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.357" offset="12804852">The courts did not treat the two differently and, in fact, in footnote 7 of Cooper's reply brief they discuss the common law tradition of treating them similarly, indistinguishably, in fact, in the same verdicts, so we agree that Gasperini here is controlling, and we don't think it should be overruled or modified, and we don't think a meaningful distinction can be drawn between punitive damages and compensatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.605" offset="12905894">I would just like to add, and this uniformity notion that we've heard about, first we believe the district courts are in a good position, but also, second, this Court in TXO essentially rejected a proposal for intrajurisdictional comparisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.998" offset="12979455">The BMW factors are guideposts, but only guideposts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.851" offset="12994815">They are nonexclusive, and the question of gross excessiveness lends itself to an abuse of discretion standard rather than the de novo one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3230.005" offset="13067435">On Gasperini, I'd just like to say there's no need to overrule Gasperini.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.747" offset="13086452">In that case, the Court was looking at an excessiveness issue as it relates to compensatory damages, not to punitive, where it was very much tied up with a review of the historical facts, and that's why the Court said that deferential review was what was required in Gasperini.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.841" offset="13162834">Here we have punitive damages that, as I've explained, are of a much different sort, and they're not tied up with the historical facts, so Gasperini does not, certainly, need to be overruled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.517" offset="13353528">Here, we are talking about not facts tried to the jury, the historical facts, but the judgment made on the punishment side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.171" offset="13380069">I do think that there is a difference between nonconstitutional excessiveness and constitutional excessiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.846" offset="13406818">This Court in Brown and Ferris did say that where you're dealing with an issue of nonconstitutional excessiveness on the punitive damage side, that the deferential review would be the appropriate review, but unless what the Court has said in BMW v. Gore is superfluous, unless we're going to say that there's no difference between the constitutional excessiveness and nonconstitutional, then there is something here that requires a de novo review standard that is not just the deferential review that you have in the nonconstitutional context, and we would submit that the... all the indicia that point to de novo review are in place here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.956" offset="13575256">And I would point the Court to the Salve Regina decision of this Court which does, indeed, explain why, when a de novo review is, is indeed required and necessary on a legal issue, especially of constitutional importance, that abuse of discretion is no answer to that review standard.</text>
