            <text syncTime="17.526" offset="223339">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.663" offset="235982">This case comes on a second time for review before this Court following the initial petition for granting petition for certiorari in 1999, when the Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and sent the case back for reconsideration under this Court's decision in American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company v. Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.564" offset="347578">We argued at that time that the decision of the Ninth Circuit was a radical departure from established principles of constitutional law, and the cases decided under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court, we would submit, has only paid lip service to this Court's decision in Sullivan and again renders a decision which compounds confusion in the law and is again a radical departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.952" offset="473070">The Ninth Circuit again takes the position that any interest or any declaim for payment under a public works contract is a property interest within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.062" offset="541511">That is a decision and a viewpoint which is contrary to every other circuit that has decided that question, including the Second District and the Court of Appeals in the First and Seventh Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.077" offset="625625">Also, in the Ninth Circuit the position has been for a number of years, as reflected in San Bernadino Physicians Services, that these types of interests in construction contracts, public construction contracts, were not within the concept of property within the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.741" offset="708276">This Court in Sullivan made it clear that in order to determine that there was a property interest, that a plaintiff had to pass certain minimum standards, had to surmount certain hurdles of pleading and evidence that were never surmounted in this case and it is clear in this case that, to use the language of Sullivan, that plaintiff has never made good on its claim.</text>
