            <text syncTime="9.287" offset="189429">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, The Ninth Circuit in our view made two critical mistakes in applying the Disabilities Act to this type of claim by a professional athlete.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.179" offset="257034">First it failed to recognize that Title 3 of the act, the public accommodations provision, apply only to claims by persons seeking to obtain inputs of a place of public accommodation, that is seeking to enjoy its goods or services, not to claims by persons seeking to supply inputs as employees or independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.086" offset="352642">Second, the Ninth Circuit never took account of just what a top level professional sport really is, nothing more or less than a competition that tests excellence in performing what its rules require.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.446" offset="406036">Any attempt to adjust the rules to compensate for an individual player's physical condition fundamentally alters the nature of that competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.952" offset="448041">Now in turning to the first issue, our position is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.055" offset="472492">That Title 3 of the act would not apply if Respondent were playing in tour events as an employee of the Tour, and the results should be no different just because he is playing in the events--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="93.987" offset="528185">Mr. Farr, the language of Part 3 of the act literally could cover the player.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.440" offset="566010">It says, it refers to any individual, and it refers to any kind of advantage or privilege on a golf course.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.060" offset="624524">So you have to construe it some way, it seems to me, to avoid that language.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.499" offset="674262">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.250" offset="677292">The argument made by Respondent is essentially that Title 3 covers any person who is present at a place of public accommodation, whatever he or she is doing there, whether they are a customer, an employee or an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.238" offset="733194">I think that's wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.481" offset="746255">First of all, just looking at the specific language that you point to, the notion of full and equal enjoyment of goods and services, it seems to me, is quite different from the notion of being allowed to provide the goods and services.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="162.709" offset="803097">Well, Mr. Farr, you keep talking about goods and services, but the statute is not limited to goods and services, as Justice O'Connor's question indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.947" offset="844057">It covers the enjoyment of, among other things, privileges, and I, it seems to me the straightforward argument is that the person who is making a claim here is somebody who says, like any other member of the public, I paid my $3,000 and I got my two references and I want to enjoy the privilege of competing at this, at this place of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.915" offset="951995">Why doesn't it literally fall within that quite easily?</text>

            <text syncTime="202.917" offset="963907">Well, if I may separate this into two things, because the $3,000 applies only to a very small piece, which is the qualifying tournament.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.782" offset="995463">There is no requirement playing on the Tour itself or on the Nike Tour.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.546" offset="1022422">But that's where one starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.237" offset="1025243">But in terms of privilege, I'm using the term goods and services not to skip over the others, but simply as a shorthand reference to all of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.742" offset="1051261">Well, except that it makes a difference because I think in a common sense kind of way we can say well, he is not getting any goods and services, but he is trying to exercise a privilege of playing.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="234.848" offset="1091698">Well, except for, it seems to me that in fact the word privilege, if it means the privilege to work for a place of public accommodation, to provide the input of labor to a place of public accommodation, then naturally following that logic, Title 3 would apply to anybody, an employee, an independent contractor or anyone.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="255.611" offset="1174768">But once again, when you phrase it the way you do, it makes it easier for your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.192" offset="1193053">You say a person supplying labor at a place of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.860" offset="1215728">Another way of looking at it, and I frankly would have thought in this circumstance an easier way of looking at it would be not that he's supplying labor, but that he wants to play a game and if he plays the game well enough to win a prize.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.486" offset="1270271">That's, that doesn't fall within the sort of aura of employment that Title 1 covers.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.272" offset="1297334">Well, I think it does, to be honest with you, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.773" offset="1307365">For example, this happens to be a game of golf.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.785" offset="1319382">But if one thinks of the game of football, for example, professional football is a game that is played by employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.668" offset="1346967">They are, they are hired I think, basically by the teams.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.532" offset="1362431">They compete against each other.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="303.984" stopTime="317.461">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="303.984" offset="1368178">Yeah.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.332" offset="1369641">And they get... and each one of them gets paid by his employer win, lose or draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.075" offset="1384583">In this case, maybe, maybe you'll have to help me out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.259" offset="1401302">I thought whether one got paid depended on whether one won the prize.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="317.461" stopTime="339.925">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="317.461" offset="1422095">Well, it depends on performance but in a very specific sense of course, the performance by any professional athlete determines ultimately what he or she gets paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.899" offset="1463891">So if in fact one can say it is a privilege of a place of public accommodation to be able to compete in a professional sport, then it seems to me that would apply to any professional sport.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.925" offset="1511956">Well, except that the statement is too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.177" offset="1516972">The football industry, I suppose, does not say we will give anybody who wants to come in and compete for a place on our team a spot.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.179" offset="1597011">Anybody who can start at the first qualifying level with his money and his references and keep on playing well enough is in a position the way the PGA is run to get to this top echelon of athletes and compete for a prize.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.638" offset="1758866">You think of it as just two dimensional, the PGA wants spectators, both public and on the television, and that's the service involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.233" offset="1793243">But the other thing, as Justice Souter's privilege question indicated, it also offers to a subset of the public, a very talented subset from all over the world, the opportunity to win a prize.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.374" offset="1853742">And that's also part of its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.335" offset="1865654">It is offering an opportunity to win a prize.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.917" offset="1875999">Well, the... the thing that I think makes it more confusing, it seems, is that normally, our position would be that the opportunity to earn something, to start with, without using the words win a prize from it, but the opportunity to earn something would not be the kind of privilege or good or service that is being offered by a place of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.659" offset="1962934">Indeed, people who want to provide the inputs would be the kinds of people who wanted to provide services and earn what they would get in return.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.186" offset="1993027">I think what makes this case seem different is because what Respondent in fact does for a living is something that other people do for recreational purposes or part of educational purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.983" offset="2044227">But again, to take an example, if the Tour constructed its operation just slightly differently, instead of saying we will have everybody just compete for the prizes as independent contractors, if they said what we will do is we will hire a group of approximately 200 professional golfers, we'll make them employees, we'll pay them a modest salary, just enough to kind of cover their expenses as they play and then whatever they win over and above that, that will be their earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.103" offset="2164704">Now, our argument would be that in that arrangement, the Tour would clearly not be subject to suits by those golfers under Title 3.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.785" offset="6319427">And the reason given for that in the preamble of the regulations is that Title 3 requirements are intended to assure access to the goods and services being provided, not to alter the mix in nature of the services typically provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.954" offset="6392048">Now, typically provided in this context we would say are the tournaments with uniform rules, including the walking rule, at the very highest level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.760" offset="6419319">That is one that has been typically provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.111" offset="6428724">And the reason I think for that, and I think this goes to your question, Justice Breyer, is that in a sense, any store or commercial entity is just whatever its goods are, a bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.879" offset="6471773">An example is a bookstore does not have to stock braille, braille books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.772" offset="6491417">And there isn't an inquiry every time as to how much trouble it would be to stock braille books, whether there's shelf space, whether they could get them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.258" offset="6525272">There's a categorical rule in the regulations that says that's not what we're talking about, that would be a fundamental alteration, and that's exactly the same point we are making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.956" offset="6568113">If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.770" offset="6719414">It's a qualifying school, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.619" offset="6726728">And the purpose of that Q School is to determine, it's a test of excellence, as Petitioner said, to determine who is the best and who can go on the Tour the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.578" offset="6782631">It's a very intense course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.452" offset="6798095">There are 14 sessions, 252 holes played on courses just like the PGA's regular courses that they play their tournaments on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.370" offset="6845742">The hard card, which is described in the briefs as the rules which impact tennis tournaments, golf tournaments under the PGA, the hard card applies to those events, but the walking provision of the hard card is eliminated for purposes of the Q School, and what happens is there is a winnowing down process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.696" offset="6943022">In 1997, when Casey tried out, there was something like 1,200 people, golfers from the public, who wanted to play on the PGA Tour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.143" offset="6980848">And they came in, paid their money, had their references, and started to play, and they winnow it down to 168 players by the third stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.607" offset="7018673">Every one of those 168 players is going to either go on the PGA Tour the next year or on the Nike Tour at the time, and none of those players need ever have walked a single hole, not only in the qualifying, but in their lives.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.970" offset="12692155">That is, in deciding that he couldn't take advantage of Title 1 for employees, the court said he is not an employee, and looked to the body of law that said people who aren't employees are independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.547" offset="12742519">But I don't think that resolves the question whether he maybe was something else entirely, a member or a potential member who was neither an employee nor an independent contractor as that term is commonly used in the working context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.185" offset="12801034">He simply wasn't a worker here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.278" offset="12809393">Petitioner argues that players can't be consumers of services because they are providers of entertainment to the spectators, but that is simply a false dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.213" offset="12849099">PGA offers services to these two different groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.226" offset="12861220">It arranges playing opportunities for golfers and viewing opportunities for the spectators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.451" offset="12882118">As a result, players both consume and provide services at the same time, just like the little league players who have uniformly been treated by the lower courts as protected users of a public accommodation.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="3434.859" offset="13891698">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.829" offset="13899639">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.550" offset="13902461">Just a few brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.431" offset="13909984">Responding in reverse order to the United States' argument, first of all, they say that the reason that employers, employees are not covered by Title 3 is because that covers Title 1, but Title 1 doesn't cover all employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.381" offset="13969857">It only covers employees of a covered employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.862" offset="13979783">You have to have at least 15 employees to be covered and if you are not an employee of a covered employer, you are not covered either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.377" offset="14005801">Yet, the United States' position is that no employees are covered by Title 3, but really independent contractors or people similar to that are in the same position essentially with respect to Title 3 as noncovered employees under Title 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.257" offset="14065360">Secondly, the district court specifically said that Respondent was an independent contractor, not just in talking about Title 1, but on page 53 of the joint appendix, it says, the district court says, I focus only on the issue of whether he is entitled to his requested accommodation, the use of a golf cart, as an independent contractor playing in defendant's tournaments which are held at places of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.823" offset="14167551">Now... but I should point out, I mean, while he is an independent contractor as defined by the district court, our point is not exactly it turns on whether he is an employee or an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.041" offset="14212482">Our point is he is not a consumer of goods and services, and there are a number of people who are not consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.035" offset="14240381">Employees are in the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.236" offset="14245187">Independent contractors are in the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.117" offset="14252711">Partners in a law firm, which is a type of public accommodation, are not in the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.032" offset="14272459">Insurance agents are not in the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.672" offset="14278937">The issue is what they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.143" offset="14288864">They are not people obtaining, seeking to obtain or gain access to goods and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.827" offset="14311643">They are all in the category of people who are providing goods and services to the public accommodation so it in turn can provide its goods and services to other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.814" offset="14351558">Secondly, just to make the contrast between the people who are also playing golf and who are covered, Title 3, we concede, it covers commercial opportunities, recreational opportunities, educational opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.153" offset="14408923">Those are all things specifically mentioned in Title 3 in terms of defining who's a public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.776" offset="14431388">What it doesn't cover is professional opportunities, the people who are trying to get, to make their living essentially working for the place, the operator, the public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.734" offset="14475169">So they are not like the tout at the race track who is there in common with the other people enjoying it for recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.048" offset="14500456">They are people actually working like somebody who is behind the betting counter at the race track who is working for the operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.464" offset="14530131">Now, just quickly on the points that Respondent raises, Rule 1.1 doesn't say golf is a sport of hitting the ball from the tee to the putting hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.590" offset="14582689">It says it's a game of hitting it from the tee to the putting hole in accordance with the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.154" offset="14604946">That is Rule 1.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.558" offset="14614559">And the rules for this particular competition include, as there are permitted to be, optional rules, and that in turn includes the requirement that competitors walk the course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.795" offset="14659489">So if you, if you are saying that you cannot, that you have to make waivers in that situation for someone who can't comply, then you are changing the game.</text>
