            <text syncTime="56.253" offset="372104">The Potawatomi Indian Tribe on August 25th, 1993 presented a contract to C &amp; L Enterprises for the construction of a roof upon a bank building that the tribe was building off of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.894" offset="426647">The contract contained an arbitration provision specifically adopting the rules of the American Arbitration Association and also specifically providing that the award, the arbitration award in such proceedings, would be enforceable by judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.856" offset="490490">There is no question that the arbitration agreement provided that the tribe waived its immunity as to the American Arbitration Association and its arbitration proceedings.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="97.414" offset="536779">Well, but it didn't use the magic phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.630" offset="545557">It didn't say waive immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="101.282" offset="552244">--That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.332" offset="556424">And we believe the standard, that no standard has required that it specifically state we waive sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.654" offset="589651">Rather they clearly stated we agree to be brought into the American Arbitration Association and to be subjected to arbitration, a binding arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.327" offset="628417">They went further than that and they said in the agreement we agree that a judgment may be entered upon that.</text>

            <label>Mr. John D. Mashburn</label>
            <text syncTime="126.847" offset="654435">And the ambiguity that the respondent attempts to raise is regarding which court is being referred to where the phrase recites any court of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.039" offset="699261">However, we believe that that argument of ambiguity fails for four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.108" offset="723503">First, the American Arbitration Association Rule 47C, which is incorporated by the very terms of the clause, states that awards under their procedures may be enforced as a judgement in any federal or state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.118" offset="783584">The contract itself selects Oklahoma law as governing law in addition to this Court's rulings in Mescalero, Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Potawatomi Organized Village of Cocky.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.343" offset="836456">All of those saying that when the tribe goes off the reservation, it is subject to the substantive laws of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.580" offset="861429">The third reason is the Tribal Court is not mentioned anywhere in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.233" offset="880028">And the fourth reason is we don't believe the Tribal Court would have had jurisdiction to even hear this case under the ruling in Montana v. United States because it is undoubtedly non-Indian not on the reservation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="196.541" offset="933214">But, what if the non-Indian brought the suit in the Tribal Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="210.051" offset="987339">It seemed to me you would waive any objection to tribal jurisdiction if you brought the suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.020" offset="1003117">--We believe that that type of jurisdiction is in fact subject matter jurisdiction because under the ruling in Montana v. United States, the court indicated that tribes don't have jurisdiction to hear matters unless it's been specifically given to them by the Constitution or statute.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="229.548" offset="1065289">But, there's a consensual exception to Montana too, is there not, where there's a consensual transaction between the tribe and a non-Indian?</text>

            <text syncTime="240.004" offset="1107085">One of the two exceptions that are carved out under Montana is for a party that enters into a consensual agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.674" offset="1133730">However, Montana doesn't even get to, we believe, those exceptions until you find that it's on reservation activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.597" offset="1169465">All of the activity discussed in Montana and in the cases we've reviewed following that regard on reservation activity.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="264.885" offset="1206664">Now, if the very same clause were in a contract that your client entered into with a state, do you think that we would have found a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity?</text>

            <text syncTime="287.651" offset="1297674">But, the question is more difficult and if I could explain.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="289.918" offset="1306765">I would have thought we wouldn't, that our cases would have said not, that wouldn't be enough to waive sovereign immunity.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_d_mashburn" startTime="297.341" stopTime="369.453">
            <label>Mr. John D. Mashburn</label>
            <text syncTime="297.341" offset="1336440">Under this Court's ruling in Edelman v. Jordan regarding Eleventh Amendment immunity, the Court stated that the rule is that the waiver, and again this one applies, as you know, to Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court, but the courts even there stated that the ruling regarding whether a provision waives such immunity is that it must be stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.728" offset="1469978">And in this situation, under the same circumstances, we believe that that standard would find a waiver because there is no other reasonable construction of this clause when you take what the clause incorporates.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.071" offset="1523372">And in fact, in this Court's ruling in Port Authority v. Feeney, and subsequently in Kimmel v. Florida Board of Regents, the Court recognized that the consent provision may look to other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.979" offset="1574990">In the Port Authority, it looked to a venue provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.747" offset="1590037">And in Kimmel, it looked for an ADA claim; it looked to the Fair Labor Standards Act and found--</text>

            <text syncTime="369.453" offset="1624936">Well, do you concede, Mr. Mashburn, that an Indian tribe has the same sort of immunity as the state under the Eleventh Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="378.309" offset="1660358">We believe that that is peculiar to the states and that that at the very most is the highest standard that this Court should apply and we don't believe that that is appropriate for an Indian tribe.</text>

            <label>Mr. John D. Mashburn</label>
            <text syncTime="395.084" offset="1727441">There is some discussion of that in the dissenting opinion in Cairo that it appears that that's what the Court is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.924" offset="1762758">We don't believe that that's what the Court intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.476" offset="1772998">And certainly, we don't believe that that's the rule that should be followed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.161" offset="1787731">We believe that the Court should find a waiver if there is simply a clear statement that using the usual rules of contract construction that the tribe agreed that upon a breach it could be brought to court and sued for the breach of that contract.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="430.508" offset="1869129">--Mr. Mashburn, as this respects foreign sovereigns, Congress in 1988 made the specific provision that if you agreed to an arbitration dispute settlement mechanism, then you have no immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.453" offset="1940913">The Congress did that by statute and doesn't that imply that when Congress doesn't do it by statute, the immunity persists?</text>

            <text syncTime="457.059" offset="1975290">No, Your Honor, we don't believe that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.527" offset="1989188">First of all, we believe that a distinction has to be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.813" offset="2002353">In that instance, Congress was attempting to bring some uniformity to a variation of rules that had been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.370" offset="2040597">And in fact, as this Court recited the history of foreign sovereign immunity in the Cairo case, there had been a move from virtually no immunity to virtually total immunity under I believe it was the Tate Letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.411" offset="2092737">And then, shrinking back from that, and then applying implied consent from commercial operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.517" offset="2121158">We don't believe that the fact that they acted there to specifically provide that as a waiver indicates that where they have not acted that there is no waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.658" offset="2169746">And in fact, we believe the Court can take guidance from the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and from cases leading up to that finding waivers from entering into commercial relations, or in particular arbitration agreements, and find that that is within the appropriate policy that the United States has followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.151" offset="2335676">But, as a general rule, we believe that if the arbitration agreement, first of all, if it incorporates rules, as this one does from the American Arbitration Association, then we think it's perfectly appropriate for the Court to look to those rules and the parties are both on notice that those rules are going to govern the procedures.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="567.213" offset="2415924">Well, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, of course, was just tracking developments in international law that had generally allowed suit on commercial transactions by states.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.039" offset="2471199">Why do you think it's open to us to apply such a rule to the sovereign immunity of Indian tribes, which we made up ourselves anyway, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="593.014" offset="2519160">And it is correct that it was simply a codification of what was the emerging case law in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.668" offset="2545805">It certainly is appropriate for this Court to draw a waiver rule as lenient as the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Rule, and certainly no more strict than the Eleventh Amendment Waiver Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.831" offset="2618425">And this Court has complete authority to do that because, as Your Honor has stated, this Court recognized in Cairo that it is a court created doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.787" offset="2658236">Especially in the context that it tends to impinge on the state's rights and be court created, we believe there's even more argument for the Court to move cautiously in; certainly in expanding any immunity that has been afforded to Indian tribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.934" offset="2746843">Mr. Mashburn, even if you could... you've agreed the agreement is saying yes, they agreed to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.354" offset="2768473">That's explicit right out there that but they are going to resolve this through arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.408" offset="2788744">But, where do you get tied to that, that the Court to enforce the arbitration award would be a state court?</text>
            <text syncTime="671.216" offset="2831898">There is no explicit agreement to that by the tribe, is there?</text>

            <label>Mr. John D. Mashburn</label>
            <text syncTime="675.501" offset="2849139">No, Your Honor, we believe that there is and the reason that there is is because first of all it adopts the American Arbitration Association rule which says the award may be enforced in state or federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.111" offset="2907548">Secondly, it adopts Oklahoma's Arbitration Act, which says that the award may be enforced in any court of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.651" offset="2957704">And we believe when you combine that with the fact that, in our opinion, the Tribal Court would not have had jurisdiction, there is no ambiguity that the court that is being selected is not the Tribal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.475" offset="3012979">So, the only other alternative would be to argue that the term, that the provision was meaningless and that it was selecting no court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1137.334" offset="4696414">First of all, the standards that the states have set for waiving their own immunity are matters of state law and the states have adopted a variety of standards so one can't speak of a uniform standard of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.241" offset="4752002">But, more importantly, the Eleventh Amendment developed in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.545" offset="4773214">This Court in Chisolm said that the states didn't have immunity from suit in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.616" offset="4793589">And it took a separate amendment to the Constitution, which now emanates from the federal government to protect the states from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.186" offset="4823787">It is a federally imposed limitation on the federal court's own jurisdiction that emanates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.174" offset="4847819">And therefore, we believe it is somewhat separate and apart from the state's own sovereign immunity with respect to waiver.</text>
