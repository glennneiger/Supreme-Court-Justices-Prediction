            <text syncTime="12.676" offset="204866">This case involves pregnant women who sought medical care at a public hospital and who then were searched by their doctors for evidence of crimes and arrested, seven of them right out of their hospital beds.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.333" offset="263484">The special needs exception does not apply to this case to excuse the lack of warrants for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.715" offset="292950">First, unlike every other special needs case, the threat of law enforcement, the use of arrest as leverage was the key element of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.867" offset="337568">It was, in the respondent's own words, what made the policy effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.358" offset="355540">Second, the searches were conducted here in the context of the private, physician patient relationship and thus there was no diminished expectation of privacy, again, unlike the other special needs cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.428" offset="411860">And finally, the defendants here skirted the warrant and probable cause requirements without demonstrating impracticability.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="73.247" offset="447073">Ms. Smith, with respect to the first of your reasons you point out that it is quite true, in a sense, that the law enforcement component of the whole scheme was necessary for success.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.437" offset="499840">I think success as you're using it is success in getting people into the drug treatment, the counseling program and finishing whatever course of counseling there is, and I understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.545" offset="556265">But isn't there a special need, independent of that, in the sense that the treating physicians need to know... regardless of whether anyone takes counseling or not they simply need to know whether there is drug use involved, because that affects the risks to the mother and the risks to the fetus, and those are the things that they need to provide for.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.495" offset="660128">So my question is, even if we assumed there were no law enforcement component and there were no counseling scheme, wouldn't they have a special need to know and, in fact, didn't they demonstrate that before the law enforcement component was even added to the mix?</text>

I'll grant you that the treating physicians had no special need, I guess, to get people into drug treatment programs, necessarily, but they did have a special need to discover the facts and, in fact, to get the evidence that ultimately was turned over to the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.122" offset="12662661">Mr. Hood, would you comment on this point?</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.031" offset="12674260">With minor variations, I think we're pretty much agreed that if in the normal course a doctor obtains the evidence that a patient is about to commit some kind of imminent violence or damage to another person, or if a doctor obtains evidence such as gunshot evidence which clearly points to a crime, that the doctor is permitted and obligated to turn that evidence over to the police and the police can use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.161" offset="12790766">Start with that premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.484" offset="12796095">The argument that I want you to comment on is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.994" offset="12810097">That kind of a rule was derived in situations in which the doctors are simply going about their business, acting independently as physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.036" offset="12854296">In this case, however, the doctors, as a result of their arrangements with the police, had become in effect agents of the police, and they were acting in a dual capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.606" offset="12912601">They had their medical responsibilities, but they were acting under an agreement with the police to look for certain things and to turn over information if they found it, and the argument is that in that case the police should not be able to use the evidence unless the evidence has been searched for and seized in accordance with the same rules that the police would have to follow if they were doing it in the first place because otherwise, in effect, the co option of the medical community will eliminate the Fourth Amendment whenever the police can use the doctors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.671" offset="13812781">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.755" offset="13821140">Three brief points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.522" offset="13832216">What distinguishes this policy from a medical protocol is that it was designed by and for law enforcement, and implemented by the hospital for the purposes of crime detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.856" offset="13877564">To say that the medical criteria was medically appropriate, as I said, is different from saying that it establishes probable cause or individualized suspicion, or allows the hospital officials therefore to search, as agents of the police, under a police policy that incorporates criminal sanctions for evidence of a crime, and to turn that right over to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.505" offset="13976203">And if it was probable cause, if they had probable cause here, why not obtain a warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.439" offset="14003892">Why not test your criteria with an objective magistrate to ensure that you're not the discretion that's allowed in those criteria is not being abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.051" offset="14042345">That's the purpose of the warrant requirement, is to protect against that kind of abusive discretion, and that's exactly the discretion we see that was used in this policy, where women who met the criteria were not tested, and women who didn't meet the criteria, perhaps, in some cases were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.602" offset="14116532">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.826" offset="14121444">We do know that some who met the criteria weren't tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.772" offset="14133251">In terms of the finding of fact, in the title VI opinion the court, in addressing the policy as a whole, talks about the goal of the policy, the ultimate goal of the policy, but when he's looking, when the trial judge looked at the purpose of the search, he recognized the dual nature of that searched... search, that there was a medical purpose and a law enforcement purpose, and that's what brought this search under the Fourth Amendment, and that's what makes this policy so insidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.858" offset="14269610">What happened here is that the doctors used the promise of confidentiality in the private physician patient relationship to obtain information from their patients in order to turn it over to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.230" offset="14343066">That's all they did here, and when they did that, when they took on the mantle of the police, they had to obtain a warrant based on probable cause, and they had to do that for all the reasons this Court enunciated in the special needs doctrine, when it limits that doctrine so that discretion will not invade police actions, so that Delaware v. Prouse is not okay, Sitz is, because of that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.358" offset="14471589">And that's why, even if this Court were to apply the balancing test here, we've got a case that's got discretionary criteria, we have a significant intrusion on the body, not a minimal intrusion like we had in Sitz, and we have no diminished expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.239" offset="14547135">In fact, we have a heightened expectation of privacy in our doctor patient relationship, and as the amici point out much better than I could, that's what's at stake in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.122" offset="14610665">So we ask this Court--</text>
