            <text syncTime="1572.854" offset="6440541">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.396" offset="6450781">Because something in this case does appear to turn on whether merely rationality review is appropriate or whether one needs something more important, we would suggest very much more important since we do think this is a free speech case, I wanted to begin with Justice Scalia's question, is there anything that Congress does that is not important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.428" offset="6538866">I think it's a question, however couched, that one really has to address in the context of these programs because, as the Solicitor General mentioned, there are a dozen programs in which Congress has essentially provided for the Government to mandate that growers and producers pay for advertisement and then although there is some other informational stuff, that's the core of it, and in this case, as we point out in footnote 7 of our brief, it's 98 percent of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.674" offset="6687868">These other programs are really quite haphazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.967" offset="6701034">They cover blueberries but not raspberries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.167" offset="6713781">They don't cover strawberries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.691" offset="6723917">They cover avocados, not artichokes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.242" offset="6734157">They cover popcorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.305" offset="6742412">At 1996 Congress found specifically that popcorn has all of the characteristics of mushrooms vital to the economy, and indeed it was in 1996 determined by Congress that canola is even more important to the survival of the economy and yet no canola program was put in place, and maybe that explains why problems are occurring.</text>

            <text syncTime="1679.654" offset="6867799">Not at all, but in Wileman you had an economic regulation essentially, and as the Chief Justice pointed out in his concurring opinion in the Greater New Orleans case, the various haphazard features of the commercial regulation there, of commercial speech might have been constitutionally tolerable if Congress had undertaken substantively to regulate the gambling industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.810" offset="6960377">That's a very fundamental difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.673" offset="6967901">Of course, one finds a crazy quilt pattern and one doesn't inspect Congress' findings when merely rationality is involved, but if we are to accept the Government's theory, and I want to turn to Government speech in a moment, if we're to accept the Government's theory that whenever there is an interest, not a program, not a regulatory regime, nothing like collective bargaining or a labor union with an integrated set of obligations or an integrated bar, as in the Keller case, but just an interest, like the interest in not having kids waste too much money on designer clothes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.054" offset="7513337">It's quite different to say that we're going to take money from private enterprise, private individuals, we're going to give it to other private individuals so that they can compose a message, like a message that brands don't make any difference, if you've seen one mushroom, you've seen them all, a message which is very much opposed to the interest of those who are forced to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.601" offset="8107571">Now, if that is Government speech, it seems to me that in a case like, oh, for example, it seems to me that in the Amtrak case where they rely heavily on Lebron, in Amtrak where this Court did hold that for purposes of making first amendment arguments against Amtrak, it is an instrumentality of the Government, but the artist who wanted to put something on that huge billboard in Amtrak's Penn Station was not going to be propagating a Government message simply because the Government was providing the facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.931" offset="13388903">I did want to correct the suggestion that, as Mr. Tribe put it, the Secretary of Agriculture does not have general censorial power over the speech of the Mushroom Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.261" offset="13442193">Indeed, she does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.651" offset="13447731">It's inherent in 7 USC 6104 (D)(3), no plan or project of promotion, research, consumer information or industry information or budget shall be implemented prior to its approval by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.699" offset="13496005">Indeed, I'm informed by the Department of Agriculture that secretaries of agriculture have censored speech of agricultural groups such as this one on grounds of taste as well as on grounds of lack of conformity with the statute and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.012" offset="13573223">Mr. Tribe referred to the theory that the Government should not be buttoning a person's lip or forcing them to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.327" offset="13602480">This program does neither for the reasons recognized in Wileman Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.011" offset="13621184">Respondent is not required to engage in any speech nor is respondent's own speech censored in any manner by the Mushroom Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.145" offset="13653785">The mushroom producers such as respondent are merely required to contribute to an economic program to promote their product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.560" offset="13687430">Sometimes perhaps, as this Court has recognized, money can be speech, but here it's just money.</text>
