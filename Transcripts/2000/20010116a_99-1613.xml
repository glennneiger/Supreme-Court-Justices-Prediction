            <text syncTime="182.070" offset="868168">It's our position that once the cloak of special protection is removed from the legal advice, the legal advice privilege as we termed it in the brief, the question is whether or not legal advice under the Turner analysis, or whether or not the prison's disciplinary policy under the Turner analysis is reasonably related to a legitimate penalogical interest, and we believe it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.036" offset="972031">Once that determination has been made, that the policy is valid and, in fact, the respondent has conceded that, he's not contested the facial validity of that policy, but once the validity of that policy under Turner is determined, then the only question, we believe, is whether or not Mr. Murphy in fact violated the policy and, as I mentioned to Justice Scalia's question, he has not raised that question, and that's a due process question that was not raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.901" offset="1091568">In Turner itself the court did not distinguish between legal communications and other types of communication between inmates, and there is no logical reason why legal communication should be entitled to any different standard of review than other types of speech, including political speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="954.751" offset="3958977">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="969.620" offset="4018431">The court of appeals' categorical protection of inmate legal advice from rules that reasonably regulate all other prison correspondence is inconsistent both with this Court's precedents and with realities of prison management.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.408" offset="4077572">In our view prisoners... and in this Court's view, prisoners have a right of access to the courts to press their own grievances and claims, but this Court has never recognized a freestanding First Amendment right on the part of other inmates to get involved in each others' litigation efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.799" offset="4143088">That is particularly true when the litigating inmate is already represented by an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.094" offset="4164299">In Lewis v. Casey, this Court held that while inmates must be allowed to bring suits challenging their own convictions and conditions of confinement, impairment of any other litigating capacity, and that would include serving as a legal advisor, is simply going to be incidental and perfectly constitutional consequences of conviction and incarceration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.119" offset="5856407">Clearly, any communication that is written between prisoners must be consistent with valid penalogical limitations on those, and those would include that communications not be insolent or incite one inmate against another, inmate against another or against guards or prison staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.936" offset="5919623">The important thing, we think, to keep in mind with respect to the Ninth Circuit's rule is that the Turner v. Safley test is sufficient for purposes of analyzing any First Amendment claims to speech or other rights invoked by prisoners and that beyond that, prison correspondence involving legal advice does not have any special exemption from those rules, should not be analyzed under any separate standard and, in fact, can present the exact same dangers that routine correspondence does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.960" offset="6039786">They can... according special status, as the Ninth Circuit has done, to inmate correspondence could allow that type of correspondence to become a ready vehicle for secretly coded communications and other illicit communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.263" offset="6092972">Jailhouse lawyers are frequently a menace to prison discipline, and they could be allowed through special treatment to set up an order or a hierarchy that would compete with the prison order system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.752" offset="6142918">In addition, the circulation among inmates of potentially volatile allegations and accusations can, in the judgment of prison officials, exacerbate the already extremely tense relations between prison officials and inmates and that, much like in Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners Labor Union, where this Court held that prisoner communications, prisoner assertions of First Amendment speech and association rights that are focused on encouraging an increase in adversarial relations between prison and staff can be regulated and restricted consistent with legitimate penalogical objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.595" offset="6306340">And finally, it's important to keep in mind that there are ample alternative channels for inmates to communicate information bearing on a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.811" offset="6335179">They can communicate with attorneys, Government officials, courts and other members of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.556" offset="6354196">They may bring their own grievances or lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.753" offset="6366944">The appropriate analysis, we think, is Turner v. Safley and, beyond that, the... to the extent someone is concerned about information getting into courts.</text>
