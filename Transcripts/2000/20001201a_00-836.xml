            <text syncTime="171.191" offset="777257">But among these things, what Congress wanted to accomplish with Section 5 was not only to provide the benefit to the states, but to provide the benefit to the United States of the states accepting that implicit proposal.</text>

            <text syncTime="5144.596" offset="20670860">I'm not actually clear about that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.965" offset="20680368">I have thought about it a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.848" offset="20683921">It seems to me that under Smiley v. Holm and similar cases, the general principle is that the Constitution takes the state government and its arrangement as it finds it, and that when the legislature is identified, that really does not mean the legislature in some specialized capacity, as with Article V.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.830" offset="20771797">Now, if that's the case and if it's therefore assumed that the legislature is surrounded with both executive and judicial authority, then a decision by the legislature to completely exclude the judiciary from any possible role, the state judiciary, might be inconsistent with the underlying meaning of Article II itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="5233.987" offset="21028424">May it please the Court: It seems to me that it's very difficult to read the Florida Supreme Court decision as saying anything else other than the Florida Constitution in their view, in that court's view, is trumping everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.965" offset="21100313">The second paragraph of the conclusion says because the right to vote is the preeminent right in the declaration of rights of the Florida Constitution and so forth, this opinion is full of language--</text>

            <text syncTime="5265.309" offset="21153707">But suppose they refer to the declaration of the rights of man, to 1789, the French revolution, I mean, the right to vote is a value in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.064" offset="21188711">Are they actually saying... I didn't see it?</text>

            <text syncTime="5277.116" offset="21200937">Or are they are saying the statute means one thing, but the statute is unconstitutional because the Constitution of Florida says the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.253" offset="21225492">I didn't see that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="5284.136" offset="21229044">--I think that the only reasonable fair reading of the decision is that the Florida Supreme Court felt that, and it says it over and over again, that we are going to be... attempt to discern the will of the people, the will of the electorate and discern, and enhance in whatever way we possibly can the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.167" offset="21305113">And because of that, these provisions of the statute which are very much quintessentially legislative, the timetables that are involved in this statute, particularly the November 14th deadline, is a part of a composite package.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.177" offset="21369165">There is one week for a protest and certain recounts to the extent that they can be done and there are four weeks for contests.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.782" offset="21399572">When the Florida Supreme Court truncated, when the Florida Supreme Court expanded the protest period from 7 days to 19 days, it necessarily limited the contest period to a shorter period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.340" offset="21449831">It changed the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.190" offset="21457250">It allowed certain things to occur that couldn't have occurred and it justifies all of those things on the grounds that the Florida Supreme Court, the Florida Constitution trumps those legislative concerns, and that's why it said we are not going to be dissuaded by hypertechnical statutory considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.068" offset="21528721">So the court was doing what this Court said in the McPherson vs. Blacker case that it cannot do, allow itself to insert itself or the Florida Constitution over what is required by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5374.846" offset="21591833">It also seems to me quite evident in response to what Justice Kennedy was asking earlier, that there was concern about the Federal statutory provision, the language to which I think Justice Kennedy was referring is on page 32-A of the appendix to the petition from the court's decision, and there is a footnote there that does refer to reference to 3 U.S.C. 1 through 10, which of course includes Section 5, and it says so in conjunction with the statement that the exercise of the discretion by the secretary of state could not be done in such a way that would preclude Florida voters from participating fully in the Federal electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.006" offset="21760479">The court was assuming, it seems to me, that it did not, was not conflict... the decision that it was rendering was not going to cause a conflict with the Federal statutory scheme, and it was, we submit, in error in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.914" offset="21812097">So the... the... to sum up with respect to this, the Florida Supreme Court radically changed the legislative scheme because it thought it could do so under the Florida Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.824" offset="21867791">By doing so, it acted inconsistently with Article II of the Constitution, and inconsistently with Section 5 of Title III, and it has brought about precisely the circumstances that Section 5 of Section 3, Title III, was designed to avoid.</text>
