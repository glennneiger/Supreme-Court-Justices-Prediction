            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.852">This case concerns the rights accorded freelance authors and a privilege accorded their publishers under Seciton 201(c) of the Copyright Act of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.856">The plaintiff’s six freelancers contributed articles to three print publications, two newspapers, the New York Times and Newsday and one magazine, Sports Illustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.812">Without the author’s permission, the print publishers authorized LEXIS/NEXIS to place the author’s articles into the Nexis database.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.112">The Times also authorized University Microfilms International to place Times articles into the New York Times OnDisc and General Periodicals OnDisc.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.198">The three databases have several common features, each contains articles from sequential editions of periodicals spanning many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.790">In each, the user may search for articles based on criteria such as author, subject or headline.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.950">The user may view, print or download each article yielded by the search, each story appears to the user separately clear of the context provided by other items originally published in the same edition.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.276">The freelance authors complained that their copyrights in their individual works were infringed when the defendant Electronic Publishers as licensed by the defendant Print Publishers, distributed the author’s articles to the databases.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.829">In response the publishers asserted that their actions were shielded by Section 201(c) of the Copyright Act, the meaning of that provision is “key to this case”.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.004">The Section leaves author and publishers free to negotiate whatever arrangement they will, in default of private ordering, Section 201(c) declares that the freelancer retains, the copyrights in her contribution to a collective work like a magazine or newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.132">The publisher in the words of the statute is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution, as part of that particular collected work, any revision of that collective work, and a later collective work in the same series.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.391">The US District Court for the Southern District of New York, granted summary judgment for the publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.661">In that court’s view, the databases copied to freelancers articles as part of a revision of the original periodical edition and so qualified for the Section 201(c) privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.806">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed ordering entry of judgment for the authors.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.526">In the Court of Appeals' view, massive databases loaded with multitudes of individually retrievable articles are not revisions of particular newspaper or magazine editions.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.611">But we hold that the Court of Appeals correctly construed Section 201(c) and we therefore affirmed its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.337">The 1976 Copyright Act, aimed to improve the situation of freelance authors vis-à-vis their publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.966">To that end Section 201(c) assures that if there is a demand for a freelance article, either standing alone or when a new collection, the freelancer can benefit from that demand after authorizing initial publication, the freelancer can sell the article to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.478">The crucial statutory term of Section 201(c), relevant here, allows the publisher to reprint the article as part of a revision of the original collective work.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.941">Like the Second Circuit, we cannot see how the databases perceptively copy articles as part of a revision of a particular edition of a newspaper or magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.121">One might view the articles as part of a new compendium, the entirety of works in the database.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.382">But the massive Database no more constitutes a "revision" of each constituent edition than a 400-page novel quoting a solid in passing would constitute "revision" of that poem.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.609">Alternatively, one could view the articles in the databases as part of no larger work at all, but simply as individual articles presented individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.861">But 201(c) does not authorize the publisher to copy individual articles discretely.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.279">The publisher’s privilege is in the collective work only, the edition as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.955">The publishers have warned that a ruling for the authors will decimate the electronic record of history, but today’s decision means only that the publishers have infringed the author's copyrights and must provide appropriate regrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.084">The opinion does not necessitate a court order barring inclusion of the freelancer’s articles in the databases.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.572">Speculation about the publisher’s response to our ruling moreover, provides no cause for this Court to shrink rights, Congress safeguarded to authors under Section 201(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="332.132">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Breyer Joins.</text>
