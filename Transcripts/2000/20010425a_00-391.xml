            <text syncTime="1485.658" offset="6075264">The facts in this case are very, very different from the facts confronting the officer in Belton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.261" offset="6097729">In Belton, the officer stopped a car for speeding on a busy Thruway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.863" offset="6116119">It was the New York Thruway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.366" offset="6122180">The officer was confronted with four individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.898" offset="6136286">When he approached the car, he smelled the odor of burnt marijuana, and he looked inside, and saw an envelope marked Super Gold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.462" offset="6174529">That envelope he immediately recognized as being associated with marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.786" offset="6191770">Therefore, he had probable cause to believe not only that these four passengers were in possession of marijuana, but that they had used marijuana because of the burnt marijuana smoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.355" offset="6238059">He ordered the passengers out of the car and placed them under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.529" offset="6258748">He did not handcuff them, either because he could not, because there were four of them, or because he chose not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.963" offset="6292498">What he did to protect himself was merely to separate them on the Thruway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2344.713" offset="9511515">It would be our point that, first of all, what the Supreme Court of Florida has done has remanded to determine whether the Chimel factors exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.758" offset="9543698">That is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.458" offset="9550490">No matter how that is determined below, the question of law that has been decided, the question of Fourth Amendment interpretation made by the Florida Supreme Court limiting this Court's Belton holding is going to survive, and we therefore submit that this Court certainly has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.220" offset="9617572">It's the final decision of the highest court in the State, and it will not be modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.742" offset="9635649">Lastly, I would just like to point out, at pages 31 and 32 of respondent's brief, they make a statement that the danger arises to the officer at the moment that contact is made with the arrestee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.840" offset="9684028">Well, in this case, as in many cases that we've cited, that danger arises regardless of the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.377" offset="9714225">Therefore, if the arrestee voluntarily exits, it makes no... there is no constitutional distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.920" offset="9744318">Thank you.</text>
