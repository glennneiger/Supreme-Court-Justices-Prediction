            <text syncTime="864.983" offset="3598468">Now, both the tribes and the water users corresponded with the Bureau of Reclamation, or BOR, and BOR received a FOIA request from both the tribes and the users association asking for the documents that the others had submitted, and for better or for worse BOR turned everything over.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.273" offset="3675686">BOR was absolutely evenhanded in divulging both tribal communications and the water users association communications.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.938" offset="3750292">BIA is set up with the special responsibility of exercising the Government's trust responsibilities to the Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.856" offset="3781952">It essentially corresponds with the Indian tribes, and it would be unusual for the water users to correspond with BIA at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.088" offset="3810896">BIA was the subagency within the Department of the Interior that refused to disclose some of these documents, with one exception of the seven.</text>

            <text syncTime="973.815" offset="4033773">If the BIA is not independent of them, then your analogy between the tribes and the consultants fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.515" offset="4076613">If we accept the consultant situation as being inter or intraagency, we can rationalize it by saying, as several have said, that the consultants really are doing something that the Department itself might be doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.820" offset="4141815">It's an extension of the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.584" offset="4148920">It's reportable only to the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.615" offset="4156966">But if, in fact, the Indian tribes are consulting with an agency which is concerned not only with the Indian tribes' interests, but in adjusting those interests as against the interests of other claimants, which seems to be the case here, then you don't have an analogy with a situation in which the Department and the consultant alone are involved, so it seems to me your whole argument either stands or falls on the independence of BIA, and we know that the BIA is not somehow totally independent of the rest of the Department of the Interior, whether it's preparing a KPOP or whether it's representing the United States in Oregon litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.844" offset="4369916">First, you're correct that the BIA is not an independent agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.155" offset="4383186">It is a subagency of DOI, and therefore is ultimately subject to DOI control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.698" offset="4409309">At the same time, the Government is attempting to deal in a pragmatic fashion with the sort of combination of responsibilities that no private party would ever be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.273" offset="4451627">That is, things would certainly be cleaner from our point of view of DOI could either say, we will treat the tribes exactly like we treat everyone else, or it could say, we will treat the tribes exactly as a private trustee would treat the beneficiary, namely, show it a duty of undivided loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.282" offset="4523725">It's clear, I think from first principles and from this Court's decision in Nevada v. United States, that the Department can't pursue either of those courses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.918" offset="4558207">It must on the one hand fulfill its trust responsibilities but on the other hand it has other responsibilities that would be considered conflicting if they were imposed on a private person, so giving BIA primary responsibility for the carrying out of the Department's trust mission is a pragmatic response to an admittedly messy situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.519" offset="4648591">The other thing I would say is, we don't contend that the tribes are analogous to a consultant in the sense of stepping into the shoes of an agency employee or doing what an agency employee would otherwise do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.387" offset="4704075">To the contrary, we think the input from the tribes is essential if the Department is to carry out its trust responsibilities, but that's precisely because the tribes have an expertise and a perspective that no agency employee would have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.915" offset="8630174">Well, in this case the Government has asserted the deliberative process privilege protects all seven documents that remain in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.413" offset="8660163">They have also asserted that the attorney work product privilege protects two of those seven, and that's an additional basis for withholding those documents within the rubric of FOIA exemption 5, and those two documents for which the attorney-client privilege was claimed...
