            <text syncTime="12.320" offset="202022">The president and founder of Marketing Displays, Incorporated, MDI, invented a new type of sign stand, one with a dual-spring design that allowed the stand to resist the wind.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.891" offset="252281">MDI patented that invention and, for the term of its patents, MDI labeled its sign stands as patent-protected to warn of copiers, touted in its trade literature the benefit of its, quote, patented dual-spring design, end quote, and when another company, Windproof, tried to market a copy of MDI's patented stand, MDI sued it for patent infringement and won.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.270" offset="357816">But then MDI's patents expired, as under the Constitution all patents eventually must.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.650" offset="387387">Sometime thereafter, Traffix Devices, the petitioner, copied MDI's stand, added some improvements of its own, and marketed a competing version.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.098" offset="429183">No longer armed with its patents, MDI tried a new tack to exclude competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.031" offset="452902">It claimed that the configuration of its stand, the same dual-spring design that it had touted as patent-protected during the term of the patents, was protected as trade dress and could not be copied.</text>

            <text syncTime="96.070" offset="537016">I think in the record, in the material here, we have a copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.474" offset="550600">Does it include in this case the legs and the whole structure, or just the dual spring, and how do we normally determine what the patent covers?</text>

            <text syncTime="111.598" offset="599187">Well, in this case, of course, it's easy to determine that the patent covers this particular sign stand because MDI labeled that sign stand as patent-protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.939" offset="688526">That's what allows it to resist the wind, and it said, this is our patented dual-spring design and, of course, it not only labeled the stands but in its trade literature, and in the Windproof case it sued when somebody made an exact replica, the same replica that Traffix Devices--</text>

            <text syncTime="212.566" offset="1003040">The steel stand is one color and the aluminum stand is another, but in terms of what they claimed in the patent as... the part that makes the invention work, it's not the legs that made this invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.968" offset="1052673">It's not the sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.716" offset="1055599">It is the dual-spring design.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.955" offset="1064585">That's what they said was patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.764" offset="1071795">When they marketed this, when they had the exclusive right to do so, they focused on that in their trade literature, said this is our patented dual-spring design, and that is the same claim they now raise in their trade dress assertion.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.709" offset="1199586">I thought that's--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="262.688" offset="1203556">It said we... it said we basically had to design around their stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.211" offset="1221633">Now, if they said, you could use three springs or four springs, I guess it would never end, five springs, or you could put a little skirt around the springs so people wouldn't see them, or, as Your Honor points out, if you're going to use the springs you have to change something else so it doesn't look like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.278" offset="1281819">But that's not what this Court's cases have held.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.379" offset="1294254">What the Court has said, Singer and Kellogg and Sears, is that the public has the right to copy the patented invention in precisely the form in which it was practiced, and that's critically important.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.004" offset="1344722">The idea of designing around what had previously been patented is a significant hindrance to competition, and this case is a good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.347" offset="1378159">When we copied the sign we added an important improvement of our own, the step-and-drop leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.745" offset="1399684">Under MDI's stand you have to bend over and pull the pins out.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.918" offset="1412431">Under ours, you just step and the legs come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.053" offset="1421000">Now, if the rule were the rule that the respondents are arguing for, we would have had to add that new improvement to some different sign stand, but the right to copy attaches to the product as it was practiced during the term of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.979" offset="1476693">We don't have to design around their superior stand... that's why it succeeded in getting the patent... to add improvements of our own.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.493" offset="2850734">There may be other limitations on a trade dress claim going to competitive need, available alternatives, any of the various multi-factor tests, but if functionality is going to serve the purpose of demarking the regime of trademark and trade dress and patent law, it must be satisfied by a showing that it is a useful product feature and in our case that's significant, because you can't get a utility patent as MDI had, without showing that it's a useful product feature, so the fact that they had a utility patent, that it covered the dual-spring design, should be enough to establish functionality and therefore should be enough to reject their trade dress claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.230" offset="3305682">But when you start saying that the configuration of the product itself is entitled to protection as trade dress, you bump right into the patent law, because the key to the patent bargain is, if you're going to control a useful product feature, as the Court said in Qualitex, that's the regime of patent law, and it's no answer to say, well, we're protected by patent law and when the patent expires we're protected under trade dress law, because that takes away the public's half of the patent bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.766" offset="3415814">We're giving exclusive right to an inventor for a term of years on the condition that he or she disclose what the invention is, and that the public obtains a right to copy it when the patent expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.685" offset="3459491">So yes, I mean, it is the expansion of product configuration trade dress that has given rise to this problem, and I would at least suggest that the Court should not get on board with that expansion without waiting for Congress to say something about it, particularly given the fact that it so directly impinges upon the central patent bargain underlying the patent system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.729" offset="4419648">Our brief is built on the premise that the functionality doctrine, the traditional functionality doctrine of trademark law is what makes trademark protection of trade dress and other symbolic elements consistent with this Court's patent law jurisprudence, as synthesized and reaffirmed as recently as the Bonito Boats case, but I think part of the reason the two laws harmonize is because the use of functionality doctrine is to limit the scope of protection of the device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.926" offset="4640435">Its traditional function was to bar the holder of a patent or other utilitarian device, even if nonpatented, from withdrawing that device from the public domain when there's no longer the protection of the patent as trade... withdrawing it from the public domain as trade dress because people have a right to practice and use as the building blocks for further innovation whatever devices are in the public domain that are utilitarian in nature, including their overall configuration, but there is still protection against confusing similarity through requirements of labeling, packaging, avoiding palming off and other misrepresentations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.184" offset="4865506">Functionality really goes to the scope of protection, and limits the scope of protection available under trademark law by preventing someone from monopolizing and withdrawing from the public domain utilitarian features or the entire utilitarian device in the absence of valid patent protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.250" offset="4969787">That is the domain of patent law, and one must qualify for a patent and have a valid patent in order to have a legal monopoly that withdraws, that prevents others from using the device, but there... as I say, these other protections are still available as well as the ability to exclude ornamental or incidental features.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.541" offset="5970903">The difficulty has arisen because an alternative test of functionality has also become appropriate as the scope of trademark protection has extended to matters that don't have utilitarian features to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.421" offset="6130459">There were other amicus submissions in the Qualitex case in which people were making claims that raised issues that went quite beyond what was involved in the press pad that was at issue in Qualitex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.204" offset="6205587">One of them, for example, involved orange-colored sprinkler system piping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.249" offset="6229725">Well, it raised other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.153" offset="6237352">I don't say the result would necessarily be different but one would have to examine whether a competitor who wanted to compete for replacing a portion of the piping would be disadvantaged if he couldn't match the color of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.416" offset="6302449">It was a different case from the Federal Circuit's Corning, Owens-Corning case involving the pink-colored insulation, because that goes behind the wall and people don't see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.938" offset="6356471">The orange coloring in some contexts connotes danger, and perhaps there is marketing significance to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.626" offset="6403282">But the mistake that I think some of the courts of appeals have made, including the Sixth Circuit in this case, is to say that that is now the exclusive approach, and you wind up with multi-factored tests that don't really give an adequate guidance to what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.098" offset="6489173">A very good example is found on page 17 of the light green amicus brief filed by the International Trademark Association in this case, in which they speak approvingly of various multi-factored tests that the courts of appeals have adopted in this area, which leaves open what this Court in its salutary opinion in Wal-Mart v. Samara Brothers referred to as the plausible threat of litigation which can discourage competitors and become an impediment to the benefits that consumers would get from competition, and to have tests of this kind applied to displace the traditional approach to functionality would be very detrimental to competitors for the very reasons the Court has recognized in the cases synthesized in the Bonito Boats opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.220" offset="13445685">That's only one of several issues in that patent case, and the fact that the others happened to use this coil spring, they used the other parts, that shows you that you can change one or two parts of this particular trade dress and comes up... have something that looks completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.035" offset="13500856">In that case, the competitors made a flat spring, they had a horizontal spring, they put two springs at 45-degree angles, you could change the legs, you could change the upright... all of those might give a different visual impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.105" offset="13545160">That's what the Sixth Circuit said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.842" offset="13552160">See, the district court in this case concentrated on just the two springs, and the Sixth Circuit said that was not proper because it's the overall appearance, visual, visual and image of the product which really controls.</text>

            <text syncTime="3384.141" offset="13689356">As long as you don't confuse the patent law with the trade dress law, Your Honor, two separate and distinct, but from a patent law standpoint you're right, but not from the trade dress standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.584" offset="13727076">There's another... right now we're looking at the public domain, and the difference is where it comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.918" offset="13748392">If it comes from a patent, it's given special recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.737" offset="13763752">You can't use it for the trade dress, but if it doesn't, then you can use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.982" offset="13776709">Now, that to me is not a real consistent... not a real consistent argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.234" offset="13801682">You also have the fact that as... where do you look at the trade dress and this functionality, look at one patent, look at two patents, what if there are several patents that show it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.690" offset="13831566">You know, what if you don't even own the patents?</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.786" offset="13839925">What if we were just a licensee and asserted it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.922" offset="13848494">What if you didn't own it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.765" offset="13851837">Would that make a difference, or if a third party owns the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.746" offset="13863749">There are several things, questions we raise at the back of our brief that Traffix and the Government really can't answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.506" offset="13882766">They really do admit that if someone is the subject matter of one patent by one person, and it expires, somebody else's trade dress will expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.324" offset="13922054">I mean, right now we also have a situation where they're trying to get special protection for utility patents, which is different than, for example, for design patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.101" offset="13961134">Or, talk about something being nonfunctional, design patenting in which having this right, as you mentioned before, of an exclusive period of 14 years develop secondary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.658" offset="13995406">There's no question whatsoever that courts do allow parties to get trade dress protection in such a matter of design patents, and there you've got this secondary meaning over 14 years in which you've used it exclusively, and that goes to the look and appearance of the product, but there's no problem with having trade dress protection afterwards because it isn't functional, so why should utility patents be treated any differently?</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.452" offset="14078580">And as I said initially, there are different areas of intellectual property law, you have different standards, different tests, different remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.102" offset="14105120">You know, in trade dress law you have... in trademark law you have much different remedies to protect the public and consumers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.471" offset="14567070">There was until this morning no dispute that moving the springs closer together was functional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.914" offset="14566965">If you look at petition appendix page 54a, there is the explanation from MDI's chief engineer that doing so makes the sign more compact and weighs less, very important if you're ferrying these things up and down the highway, and also makes it less expensive to manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.703" offset="14566861">As far as the two different sign stands, the diamond one with the closely spaced springs, joint appendix page 236, MDI said that those signs, even though the other one was depicted in their patent, that the closely spaced springs were, quote, slavish copies from the standpoint of function of the sign stand described and claimed in the Sartesian patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.326" offset="14566756">Third, that is the form in which they practiced their patent, the closely spaced springs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.801" offset="14566652">Kellogg, Singer, Sears, that line of cases gives Traffix Devices and any member of the public the right to copy the patent in the form in which it was practiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.500" offset="14566547">That is critically important to maintain competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.370" offset="14566443">Whether you begin with patent law and the right to copy from an expired patent, or trade dress law and the definition of functionality that focuses on usefulness, is it a useful product figure, you come to the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.216" offset="14566338">Traffix Devices had the right to copy the MDI sign stand when it came off patent, and it did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.616" offset="14566234">It did so in the way Bonito Boats explains enhances competition, imitation and refinement through imitation by adding an improvement of its own that made a more competitive product better for highway safety departments.</text>
