            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.914" offset="124480">Now, the question in this case is whether an unlawful increase in a federal prison sentence and the increase was somewhere between 06 to 21 months can be non prejudicial when the prisoner claims the illegal sentence, the improper increase resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.050" offset="197100">After a petitioner Glover’s conviction the pre sentence investigation report recommended that his convictions for labor racketeering, money laundering, and tax evasions be grouped together under one of the sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.252" offset="253838">The government objected to grouping those counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.564" offset="267108">In Trial Court Glover’s attorneys did not submit papers or offer extensive oral arguments contesting this no grouping position on the part of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.742" offset="315801">When the District Court decided not to group the money laundering counts, Glover’s offense level was increased by two levels that yield a concomitant increase in the sentencing range.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.364" offset="358328">On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Glover’s attorneys did not raise the grouping issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.776" offset="388003">The Seventh Circuit affirmed his conviction and the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.847" offset="400228">Then Glover filed a pro se 2255 motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.634" offset="419455">He argued that the failure of his counsel to press the grouping issue was ineffected the assistance of counsel at the sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.154" offset="449443">Under Glover’s theory of the case is 84 months sentence for somewhere, as I have indicated between 06 and 21 months more than authorized by law because of the Trial Court’s alleged error in not grouping the offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.239" offset="501793">The District Court denied Glover’s 2255 motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.418" offset="514540">It determined that under the Seventh Circuit precedent an increase of 06 to 21 months was not significant enough to prejudice for purposes of Strickland versus Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.778" offset="556023">As a result the District Court did not decide whether Glover’s attorneys fell below a reasonable standard of confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.415" offset="578488">The Court of Appeals affirmed and it relied on the same no prejudice theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.308" offset="594057">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.267" offset="601894">The government now acknowledges that the Seventh Circuit’s rule is inconsistent with this Court’s cases and unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.110" offset="629270">It appears that the Seventh Circuit drew the substance of its no prejudice rule from our decision in Lockhart versus Fretwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.097" offset="657273">That case held that in some circumstances a mere difference in outcome will not suffice to establish prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.692" offset="683605">But we explained last time that our holding on Lockhart does not supplant the Strickland analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.270" offset="701995">The Seventh Circuit was incorrect to rely on Lockhart to deny relief to persons alleging deficient performance by counsel, because the alleged unlawful increase in sentence does not meet some baseline standard of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.446" offset="754658">Our jurisprudence suggests that any amount of actual jail time has Sixth Amendment significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.293" offset="782034">Now, the Seventh Circuit’s rule is not well considered in any event because there is no obvious dividing line by which the measure how much longer a sentence must be to constitute substantial prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.303" offset="826129">We express no opinion on the ultimate merits of Glover’s claim because the question on deficient performance is not a force, we also express no opinion on the alternative grounds of performance advanced by the government which were neither raised in nor passed upon by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.998" offset="900839">The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.228" offset="921737">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
