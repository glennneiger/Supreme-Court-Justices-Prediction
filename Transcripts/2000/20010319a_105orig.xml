            <text syncTime="8.688" offset="185143">Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the8 Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.388" offset="199980">The parties are here on exceptions to the third report in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.722" offset="221296">After the Court determined that the State of Colorado had violated the Arkansas River Compact in 1995, the case was returned to the Special Master for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.759" offset="269466">Subsequently, the Special Master determined that Colorado had violated the Arkansas River Compact in every year from the inception of their compact to the date of filing of this case in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.909" offset="322024">He further determined that, since the filing of the lawsuit, that Colorado has continued to violate the compact in every year through 1996, except for 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.829" offset="373747">Colorado does not challenge those determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.370" offset="387853">Each of those determinations is in the unit of acre feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.824" offset="409691">Altogether, for the period 1950 through 1994, the period at issue here for the remedy, he determined that approximately 420,000 acre feet of water had been depleted from the Arkansas River by Colorado and its water users in violation of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.265" offset="483461">That amount of water is about 125,000 times the size of this courtroom, or a column the size of this courtroom extending upward about 1,000 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.683" offset="525152">He has determined that the proper remedy for these losses, which are both past and future, because of the lingering effects of the violations by Colorado, should be compensated in money rather than in water.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.311" offset="587637">At the end of trial, Kansas had determined that its losses were $62 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.636" offset="612924">Colorado's corresponding number was $9 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.590" offset="628806">The Special Master recognized losses that we calculate to be approximately $57 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.104" offset="654824">However, the Special Master was persuaded by Colorado not to accord Kansas full compensation for its losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.280" offset="695471">He reduced it further by denying part of the prejudgment interest that had been quantified by Kansas at trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.472" offset="956277">The taxpayers of the State of Colorado will end up footing the bill, and it just seems odd to me that we would all of a sudden craft some rule allowing prejudgment interest against a sovereign State.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.649" offset="1000999">I mean, the States presumably had ample opportunity to negotiate at the time of the compact for the kinds of things that should go into a damages award in the event of a breach.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.841" offset="1133805">The Court has said in 1987, in the Texas v. New Mexico litigation, that the contract remedies should be looked to to determine the proper remedy for breach of a compact.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.861" offset="1305796">Both sides wanted to resolve the case with monetary payment instead of with water, so that's hardly, you know, solid precedent for the proposition that money damages are awardable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.420" offset="7484068">That's the closest analogy to the contract situation, and in the Restatement of Contracts, since 1932 the rule has been that, where damages are a fixed sum of money, or a performance that has a fixed value, prejudgment interest does apply, but in those cases, in all other cases prejudgment interest is applied under a rule of reasonableness, based on the aspects, the circumstances of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.609" offset="7592842">So our position really simply suggests that the Restatement rule is what ought to be applied here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.868" offset="7657835">The Master properly determined, in accordance with this Court's decision in Texas v. New Mexico, that Kansas is entitled to money damages as a basis for Colorado's compact violations, as a remedy for the compact violations, and he calculated those damages by determining the value of the water that Kansas was entitled to but did not receive and, in making that determination, he evaluated the cost to Kansas farmers, which was reflected in two matters, increased groundwater pumping costs, and also lost crop production.</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.933" offset="9046086">There was no contemplation in this compact that Colorado... I want to draw a distinction between other compacts that States have entered into, the Colorado River Compact, where the obligation to deliver water is set out at 75 million acre feet over 10 years by the Upper Basin, the Rio Grande Compact, where there is a table of relationship located right in the compact, where each signatory understands what it must do each year to comply with the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.962" offset="9166250">In the case of the Arkansas River Compact, there was no obligation on the part of Colorado to deliver a particular quantum of water in any year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.331" offset="9207732">Rather, both States sought to have the opportunity to continue to develop unused waters, and both States agreed that they would be vigilant, working through the interstate agency, to investigate when and if a violation or an under delivery was occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.174" offset="9287144">Now, no investigation was requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.596" offset="9300832">Under the compact, under Article 7(h)... 8(h), I'm sorry, until 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.433" offset="9336150">Prior to that time, both States cooperated together and worked together on the operation of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.887" offset="9369900">Neither State expressed an understanding that there was any way in which the river was being depleted by activities in Colorado or in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.917" offset="9414099">Remember, if you look again at Article 4(d), it applies to both States, not just Colorado, so what we need to do here is understand what the deal was, and the deal wasn't that Colorado was automatically guaranteeing that it was going to deliver a certain amount of water every year, which would be what would be assumed by the argument which Kansas has made, and therefore failing to deliver some amount over a 40-year period, we automatically should owe them significant damages, when, in fact, the concept here was that both States would work to allow full development of the system, and both States would be responsible to ensure that if overdevelopment occurred in one or the other State that affected usable flows, an investigation would be undertaken and appropriate enforcement undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.007" offset="9602390">So in our view, at a minimum, on prejudgment interest, until 1985 Colorado knew no more than Kansas.</text>
