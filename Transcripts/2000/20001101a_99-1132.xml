            <text syncTime="403.066" offset="1766010">One of them, of course, is that there was no entry necessary in this case, and we believe that that substantially lesser intrusion is very important.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.184" offset="4062487">For three reasons, police officers who have probable cause to believe that a residence contains incriminating evidence may prevent entry for a reasonable period of time in order to preserve the evidence while they obtain a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.685" offset="4108567">First, there's a strong law enforcement interest in preserving evidence pending issuance of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.031" offset="4129883">Second, securing the premises from the outside by preventing entry is a limited and temporary intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.629" offset="4156319">Third, it's less intrusive than other means of preserving evidence, and it promotes fidelity to the Fourth Amendment's preference that searches be authorized by a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.894" offset="4189337">When a residence contains evidence of a crime, there's an inherent danger that the evidence may be damaged or destroyed if people are allowed on the premises, and therefore, unless police have a means to protect the evidence during the time that it takes to obtain a warrant, the search pursuant to the warrant may often be fruitless.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.277" offset="5751251">As I was saying before, the... part of the reason that the intrusion is so small, is limited here, and that this is particularly reasonable, is that the other alternatives such as arresting the occupants, such as a warrantless entry, are more intrusive, involve invasions of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.546" offset="5835992">They're more serious, and by providing an alternative to immediate warrantless entry this external impoundment option actually encourages police officers to seek a warrant before they search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.181" offset="5886461">The Court has therefore recognized a principle that the interest in protecting evidence can temporarily supersede possessory interest in property for the time that it takes to get a warrant in a variety of contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.430" offset="5951453">As I noted before, the Court's done it in dictum in situations involving securing premises, but the Court's held that that's true in a variety of cases like container cases, where the Court has held that if the police have probable cause to believe the container holds evidence they can seize the container pending a warrant to search it, and the Court's held that if the police have probable cause to believe that evidence that's in plain view is associated with criminal activity, they can seize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.814" offset="6073079">The same principle that underlies that, the interest in protecting the evidence, the inherent danger that the evidence may be damaged or destroyed if there isn't an ability to freeze the status quo while the police get a warrant, the fact that the police are getting the warrant here, all point to the fact that it's eminently reasonable for the police to be able to secure the premises from the outside for a temporary time while they obtain a warrant to search.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.499" offset="6231799">The question presented by these facts is, what analysis should this Court employ in determining under what circumstances and by what method the police can seize a home in order to preserve evidence of a crime?</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.310" offset="6287075">The State of Illinois and the United States of America want this Court to issue a broad rule that it is always all right for police officers to seize a home on the basis of probable cause alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.670" offset="6340469">This Court should find that such a rule violates the Fourth Amendment for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.629" offset="6368263">First of all, it does not take into account the high esteem in which this Court's decisions place the home, and it is also not a logical extension of other cases concerning the seizure of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.635" offset="6448302">Your Honor, in the dicta in Segura there is some suggestion that external seizure of the home would have been justified in Segura's case, and perhaps that is because everyone with a possessory interest in the apartment in Segura was in custody and therefore the police really weren't interfering with anyone's possessory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.885" offset="6553315">In this case you do have the homeowner present, and his possessory rights in the home are being substantially interfered with, and the Government's test of probable cause only simply does not take in to account the high esteem in which the home is held and the fact that it's very intrusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.019" offset="6845886">The only way they had to preserve evidence of Mr. Welsh's blood alcohol level is to do what they did, which was to enter the home without a warrant and arrest him before his blood alcohol level went down.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.439" offset="7067509">First of all, I'm suggesting you reject the probable cause only test and stick with the probable cause plus exigent circumstances test, and the reason the quantity of the drugs would be important is because that goes to the exigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.937" offset="7133546">As this Court observed in Welsh v. Wisconsin, the prevention of the destruction of evidence is not an exigent circumstance when you're talking about a minor offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.198" offset="7174611">Presumably, then, it is when you're talking about a major crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.327" offset="7211078">I think you just told us, and correct me if I'm wrong, that if the crime would be a felony, then what was done here was okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.209" offset="7254650">Secure the premises pending receipt of a warrant by the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.242" offset="7254546">But if the crime is only a misdemeanor, then, too bad, you have to take the risk that the evidence will be destroyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.231" offset="7326748">First of all, the line that I'm drawing is that the officers have to have probable cause and exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.340" offset="7359140">In this case, it's my position that they had neither, but the line I'm asking the Court to draw again is probable cause and exigent circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.152" offset="7414415">That's what I don't fathom, because I thought from your brief and from what you said before that you were making a distinction between lesser offenses and felonies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.580" offset="7456106">I am, Your Honor, that's true, and the reason I make the distinction is again, it's part of that analysis of whether or not the exigent circumstance of destruction of evidence is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.562" offset="7508038">That's at least what the Welsh decision suggests, that if you're trying to preserve evidence of a minor crime, then the officers are not justified in entering the home to preserve evidence of that crime, so it's a factor of determining whether or not there's an exigent circumstance of destruction of evidence.</text>
