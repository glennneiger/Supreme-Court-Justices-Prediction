            <text syncTime="1620.464" offset="6633897">What Misco taught us is that in the 301 context, a court may refuse to enforce an arbitrator's award because it is contrary to public policy if and only if it violates an explicit public policy that is well-defined and dominant, and is ascertained by an examination of laws and legal precedents, and not general supposed notions of public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.536" offset="11330190">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.124" offset="11376479">The arbitrator in this case treated the employee's drug use as a serious offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.748" offset="11394974">He considered it worthy of serious punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.153" offset="11408662">With respect to those aspects of the arbitrator's decision, the petitioner really has no complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.471" offset="11429874">Petitioner contends that the arbitrator's award is contrary to public policy only in that the arbitrator chose to impose a suspension of slightly over 3 months plus costs of the arbitration in lieu of outright discharge, and therefore the question is whether the punishment imposed by the arbitrator can reliably be said to conflict with public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.484" offset="11513988">This Court emphasized in Misco that a court asked to vacate an arbitral award in the labor context on the basis of public policy must draw that policy from positive law, from statutes and regulations.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2856.696" offset="11578772">We would say that there are limited circumstances under which an arbitral award can be vacated even though the award would not compel the employer to violate positive law, and to give you a hypothetical example, the Department of Transportation has a regulation that says that a driver who is convicted of driving under the influence is disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle for a period of 1 year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.388" offset="11673544">Now, in a hypothetical case in which an employee was believed to have driven under the influence, was not convicted, but conceded at the arbitral proceeding that he had, in fact, driven while under the influence of alcohol and drugs, in such a case, if the arbitrator imposed a 3-month suspension and then put the person back behind the wheel, that would not literally compel the employer to violate positive law because there would be no conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.759" offset="11775108">But given that there was an alternative basis for feeling highly confident that the prohibited conduct had occurred, such an award would be explicable only on the ground that the arbitrator disagreed with the policy judgment reflected in the DOT regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.500" offset="11834040">But we do... while we don't think that the vacatur of the award is limited to those situations in which a violation of positive law would otherwise occur, we do think that the relevant public policy must be drawn directly from positive law, and therefore the question is, is there anything in the testing act or the DOT regulations that identifies discharge as the mandatory penalty for a second drug offense or not, and in our view there's no way that the regulations or the statute can fairly be read to compel that conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.681" offset="12214801">And if he's evaluated by the substance abuse professional, if the substance abuse professional certifies that he has complied with the recommended course of treatment and that the employer is therefore legally free to employ him again in driving a truck, that provides the basis for assurance that a person who poses a substantial risk will not be on the roads, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.334" offset="12485325">Mr. Stewart, do you think that there is a difference and that public policy overrides, say, something that would just come under the FAA, a question the Chief asked, say a consumer contract that's drawn by the seller, and that's dictated the contract, and a... adding on top of the collective bargaining contract public policy in the case of a... of an employer-union negotiated contract?</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3112.271" offset="12601100">Well, we would certainly agree with the Chief Justice that there is also a strong policy reflected in the language of the Federal Arbitration Act in favor of enforcement of arbitration agreements in the commercial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.855" offset="12651464">There is in the labor context the additional consideration of preserving industrial peace, but we don't... I don't know that we would say that the two are different in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.402" offset="12693678">Now, certainly in the State system it is up to a State government to determine how it wants to allocate power among the branches, and therefore State courts may assume far greater authority to devise public policy to set aside contracts that violate it even if they aren't drawing the relevant public policy from positive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.458" offset="12769851">That's up to the State system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.803" offset="12775284">But within the Federal system I think even whether within the FAA, or under the labor management statutes, there is a strong policy in favor of enforcement of contractual choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.134" offset="12820528">And so in 1992 to 1994 the Department of Transportation conducted an extensive rule-making, it heard comments from a number of interested people, and its mandate from Congress was to consider both the need to protect the public safety against the ill effects of transportation employees who use drugs, and the testing act also included a congressional finding that rehabilitation is a critical component of any testing program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.495" offset="12942050">And it was the Department's mandate to balance those potentially competing objectives, and specifically with respect to the problem of a recidivist drug user, the initial regulation proposed by the Department of Transportation would have mandated a 60-day disqualification period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.619" offset="13010491">And I think, as Justice Breyer suggested, part of the irony of this case is that if that provision had been adopted, we think the petitioner would have no basis for challenging the arbitral award here, because if DOT had said, suspension of at least 60 days, and the arbitrator had imposed a suspension of a little over 3 months--</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.796" offset="13079245">May I ask this question, following up on some of Justice Scalia's?</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.289" offset="13093142">Do you think there's a public policy that would require arbitrators in cases such as this to assess the likelihood of recidivism in the future?</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3244.853" offset="13131490">--I think it all depends on what powers the parties elect to confer upon the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.530" offset="13158135">That is, if the collective bargaining agreement specified that the punishment for a first positive drug test will be a 30-day suspension followed by reinstatement if the individual has complied with the DOT regulations, I think there would be no room under the contract for the arbitrator to say, I'm not sufficiently confident that this person can do the job again, and therefore I'm ordering him discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.598" offset="13242458">And conversely, if the collective bargaining agreement said, anybody who violates the drug policy twice will be dismissed, the arbitrator wouldn't have authority to determine that really the policy in favor of rehabilitation was more important and therefore he should be given another chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.969" offset="13299928">But where, as here, we have a collective bargaining agreement that gives the arbitrator very broad discretion to decide whether there is just cause in a particular case, we think the arbitrator would naturally look to public policy considerations, among others.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.414" offset="13389684">And so the Department of Transportation considered a provision that would have imposed a mandatory 60-day suspension for recidivists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.839" offset="13423434">It seemed clear to us that if that provision had been adopted, the 90-day-plus suspension that was imposed here couldn't be said to violate public policy, and although it's not terribly clear from the Federal Register notice exactly why the Department declined to adopt that provision, it's very clear that the Department understood that the consequence of deleting that proposed rule was to leave to the contracting parties the determination whether reinstatement would occur even after a second positive test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3367.459" offset="14206794">I have just three very brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.595" offset="14206690">First, the lower courts did not address the questions we have been discussing this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.534" offset="14206585">They adopted the position that because this award was not illegal, the public policy exception does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.255" offset="14206481">I understand the Solicitor General's representative to agree with us that that is an incorrect statement of the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.383" offset="14206377">At the very least, then, it seems appropriate to vacate the decision and send it back for the lower courts to at least apply the correct standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.706" offset="14206272">Second, take no comfort in the certification of the substance abuse professional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.684" offset="14206168">My brother for the union said that he certifies that the employee successfully completed rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.410" offset="14206063">That is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.649" offset="14205959">All that the substance abuse professional certifies is that the employee properly followed the program, not that it worked, not that it was likely to work, and certainly not that the employee does not present a risk to the public, and also keep in mind that the professional obligation of the SAP is to the employee, not to the public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.568" offset="14205854">He could easily determine that it's best for this employee to be back on the job, even if that represents a threat to public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.598" offset="14205750">Finally, you can look through the regulations in excruciating detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.999" offset="14205645">You will not find a provision addressing the problem of a recidivist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.095" offset="14205541">The Department may have considered some things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.559" offset="14205436">It didn't adopt them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.425" offset="14205332">It seems an awful lot of weight to place on the failure to adopt a provision to conclude that someone who violates these rules 20 times is to be treated exactly like someone who violates it one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.922" offset="14205227">That is insufficient to protect public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.678" offset="14205123">What the regulations provide is that this issue, reinstatement, is left to contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.981" offset="14205018">If it is left to contract, the public policy exception applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.913" offset="14204914">In the reported cases alone, you will find examples of arbitrators ordering the reinstatement of nurses who prescribed the wrong medication and stood by while patients were dying, the helmsman of a 635-foot oil tanker who was on marijuana and ran it aground, the nuclear plant operator who diffused the safety system at the plant so he could leave early for lunch, and the pilot of a 727 who flew it while blind drunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.835" offset="14204809">The public policy exception is needed for those types of cases, and we respectfully submit that the case of a driver of a 25-ton vehicle in West Virginia who has twice failed drug tests fits in that category.</text>
