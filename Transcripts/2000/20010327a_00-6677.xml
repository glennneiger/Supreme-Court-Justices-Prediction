            <text syncTime="19.509" offset="77949">I think my first task here is to show you that what the Texas Court did was contrary to or an unreasonable application of your previous decision in Penry in this case, and I believe that your decision in Penry or Penry One as we call it in our brief was fairly clear in saying that as to this man, a retarded man like this with a life long history of really gruesome child abuse where virtually his whole case is based on the retardation and the horrible child abuse, that the three questions of the old Texas statutory scheme just don't work or at least they do not work unless you take the first question which asks whether the defendant acted deliberately and give "deliberately" a definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.532" offset="306051">It would have to be a rather unusual definition of deliberately that will tell the jury, contrary to the normal meaning of the word, that you can find that conduct resulting from child... from retardation maybe even from child abuse, although that's perhaps a stretch, could be a basis for a finding that the defendant did not act deliberately.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.883" offset="395494">When you summarized in Grand v Collins the Penry holding, you said and I'm quoting from page 474 of 506 U.S. Reports, you said that</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.771" offset="6783060">--I agree and what you taught us Your Honor in Sapple is that while we must channel and limit the discretion that a sentencing jury has in finding out if a defendant is eligible for the death penalty, it is not unconstitutional to shape and to structure that jury's consideration of all of the evidence so that they can make a life choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.012" offset="6883997">Isn't the difficulty in this case that what you describe as the structure is in effect an instruction that says you may act irrationally and as against that possibility there were at least two avenues open to the court that would have allowed the jury to do just what Penry One required and to do it in a rational way?</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.017" offset="6976052">One way would have been to add a fourth question and say</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.344" offset="6989322">"even though you answer yes to one, two and three you also have a responsibility to consider mitigating evidence and if you do so, you may in fact answer this fourth question. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.682" offset="7042717">however it might be structured</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.073" offset="7048255">"in a way that says don't impose the death penalty any way. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.023" offset="7064033">A second rational way to do it... I don't how easy it would have been but I assume it could have been done, would have been with a definition of deliberately and the question the second question I guess, which instructed the jury that a person of some degree of retardation simply does not... is not capable of the mental process that "deliberately" assumes or requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.075" offset="7172284">So what it boils down to is the state had at least two ways in which Penry could rationally have been given consideration, and instead the court decided to do it in an irrational way saying even if all the evidence leads to a yes answer, you can say no any way, and that's to me the nub of the problem here because if as we have repeatedly said the jury is supposed to engage in some kind of a reasoned moral process, this was not a reasoned moral process; it was an irrational process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.300" offset="10389107">Second, in Estelle we learned that there was no attempt at all to introduce the mind set or the psychiatric evidence in that case, and so it was a reasonable application of Estelle for the Court of Criminal Appeals in Texas to rule that Estelle was distinguishable and not clearly applicable to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.209" offset="10816784">He's a psychopath and so therefore it's very important in determining personal culpability and whether he should get death instead of life to be able to demonstrate from the prosecution's point of view this man is not any less culpable because his violent behavior, his future dangerousness is not the result of mental retardation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.388" offset="10901525">It's the result of the fact that he's a psychopath and therefore he is not any less culpable than any one else absent such evidence of mitigating circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2792.643" offset="11170482">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, despite the lip service that the petitioner pays to Edpa, the fundamental flaw in both of his claims is that they ignore the statute's threshold requirement and that is that the principal of federal law on which he relies be clearly established in this Court's decisions and not just arguably established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.440" offset="11313737">Let's take first his challenge to the jury instruction, the first question to ask of course is what principle did this court's Penry jurisprudence clearly establish as opposed to arguably establish when the state courts made their decisions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.965" offset="11375804">I submit that what Penry clearly established is summarized at page 328 of the Penry opinion in which the court said that a defendant is entitled to instructions informing the jury that it can consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence by declining to impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.411" offset="11449574">This is how the Penry One holding was characterized in subsequent opinions of this Court including Graham and Sapple and others, and it's true that Penry One discussed some of the ways that Texas might comply with this principle but it did not clearly establish that these additional instructions either had to include a separate special issue or had to expressly tell the jury that it could answer no to a special issue even if the literal answer was yes or that it had to expressly define deliberately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.085" offset="11580291">The Court I submit did not attempt to micro manage Texas procedure in any of those ways and in fact as later opinions pointed out it could not have done so without creating a new rule under Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.627" offset="11626475">Indeed the term after Penry One both Boyd and Sapple made crystal clear that Penry One had left intact the state's freedom to structure and shape the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence.</text>

I take it that if we found a deficiency on such points as that that you would not feel that Edpa stood in the way of granting relief here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2993.530" offset="11974113">I take it you would agree that at least those requirements are implicit and clearly implicit in what we hold when we say the first instructions are inadequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.256" offset="12060944">It seems to me the only real question under Edpa with regard to the jury instruction is whether that instruction was a reasonable application of this court's Penry jurisprudence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3142.924" offset="12571690">In fact in this case to me the key distinguishing factor between this case and Penry One is that here unlike Penry One, the trial court actually gave a very extended instruction on the subject of mitigating evidence as Mr. Taylor has discussed earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.651" offset="12638563">That was instruction number four and there was no corresponding instruction given in Penry One and so the only question... so clearly this case is distinguishable from that and clearly the lower courts at least attempted to apply this Court's precedent in Penry One.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.035" offset="12712124">Whether they did so reasonably is the real question of the day and I think on that point it's significant although not dispositive that of the ten state judges and the four federal judges who address this issue on the merits, not one of them concluded that the instruction was an unreasonable application of Penry One.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.512" offset="12785998">There was one judge in the Fifth Circuit who concluded that it was incorrect but again under Williams versus Taylor it's not enough that the application be incorrect and especially not less than perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.663" offset="12834586">And so even if it would have been better to add a fourth special issue, that doesn't make the Texas decision unreasonable especially in light of Boyd and Sapple which say that the states retain their right to structure and shape the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.957" offset="13323807">I think the way the word nullification was used by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, it was simply that the jury could in essence nullify what it might otherwise consider to be the correct answer to one of those three special interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.483" offset="13385874">I don't think they were saying that nullification instructions as a general matter are proper or anything like that but as used here that's what nullification means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.307" offset="13421192">I don't think there's any magic.</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.557" offset="13426207">The word nullification instruction is almost an oxymoron, isn't it, because you think of nullification jury as refusing to follow an instruction rather than following one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.990" offset="13475944">Right and that was the situation in Roberts, but that's not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.753" offset="13494962">At the end of the day the instruction at issue here was reasonable in my view, if for no other reason that it gave the jury at least one clear path to a life sentence based on the petitioner's mitigating evidence and that is all that this court's decisions clearly required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.449" offset="13565701">Now finally I think it's important to remember as the Court considers the statute here that Edpa was designed to curb what Congress saw as an enormous and undue federal burden on the state's criminal justice systems.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="3412.567" offset="13650233">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.770" offset="13659011">Let me... I'm going to try to use that time just to try to convey some information on some points that may be of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.688" offset="13686700">On the question of what a Texas court could have done my Texas colleague advises me that there was a case called McPherson in which a Texas court before the statute was amended did give a fourth special issue and that that was ultimately upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.136" offset="13748454">That had not occurred at the time of our trial but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did approve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.041" offset="13764127">There was an escape hatch available and it was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.445" offset="13777711">I do not have the citation to the McPherson case here; if there's an appropriate way to provide it we'll certainly do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.005" offset="13799967">Secondly on the question of... I learned to say voir dire when I was in Texas and I'm trying to unlearn it, but it's one or the other voir dire or voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.580" offset="13838315">I suggest that it is perilous to rely on voir dire of all things to undo or to cure a problem with an instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.387" offset="13893486">Mr. Taylor is quite right, that this process in Texas goes on for weeks and weeks and a lot of things get said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.697" offset="13926713">If you'll look at volume 22 page 1792 of the record, you will see one of the jurors, one of the jurors who actually sat being instructed by the prosecutors, you should not automatically answer these questions a certain way to achieve a punishment, you should not answer one of them no because I want him to get a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.485" offset="14017933">Possibly technically correct but surely in the context of what these jurors were supposed to do, likely to confuse, my point is simply a lot of things get said in voir dire over a long time and it would be a mistake to say that that cured what I think is a hopelessly confusing instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.635" offset="14082508">On the Peebles Report where Mr. Taylor made the argument that what they were really trying to show was that Penry was a psychopath, I have a very short response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.616" offset="14118452">The Peebles Report doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.069" offset="14124199">There's nothing in the Peebles Report that says he's a psychopath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.708" offset="14134753">Sure they said it; everybody else said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.537" offset="14142067">Peebles said pretty much what our expert said, he said he has mental retardation and anti social conduct, but antisocial personality disorder, you won't find that in the Peebles Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.892" offset="14183549">Unless there are further questions I'll submit.</text>
