            <text syncTime="71.528" offset="442522">The central flaw in the jurisdictional and the enforceability of holdings in the court of appeals in this case is the manifest hostility that court demonstrated towards arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.686" offset="483169">The view reflected in those holdings is, to use a phrase that this court used in similar circumstances, quote, far out of step with this Court's endorsement over the past 15 years of arbitration as an effective and an efficient method of dispute resolution of Federal statutory claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.780" offset="615453">I do, Mr. Chief Justice, largely because it's reasonably clear that had the Court treated that order as an interlocutory order, then this matter would have gone immediately to arbitration, and the arbitration process would have been allowed to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.604" offset="674803">By treating it as a final judgment, as the Court did, it then undertook to review the merits of arbitrability--</text>

            <text syncTime="137.256" offset="705418">Well, Mr. Phillips, there was a crucial difference here. The Court purported to dismiss all the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.902" offset="747946">It didn't just enter a stay order, as would typically be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.369" offset="769889">It said everything else is dismissed, and I take it that would mean then that the statute of limitations might run before the case ever got back, or something like that, and isn't there a real difference between the entry of a stay order pending the arbitration versus a dismissal?</text>

            <text syncTime="204.985" offset="976360">What I see that as telling me is, don't move forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.511" offset="994437">It's not stay versus dismissal, but it's stay versus letting the case continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.564" offset="1022649">Why should a district judge who says, there's nothing to come back to me, this is not a case where some issues are to be referred to other... to the arbitral forum, and then there are other issues that I'll decide after the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.609" offset="1086806">Why isn't it perfectly proper for a district judge to say, there's nothing here for me to decide, everything is for the arbitrator?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.109" offset="1120765">Well, I think at the end of the day this is still an embedded proceeding, and even though he ultimately dismisses everything, it is certainly available to come back to him at the end of the arbitration and have these issues reviewed, and it would certainly be much easier--</text>

            <text syncTime="398.908" offset="1751988">So I could see if you're right about that, that the proper result here is always stay, never dismiss, then the court of appeals says, this judge was wrong in dismissing, we certainly have to review that, that's as final as it could be, and on the merits of that decision to dismiss, just as we would do with a summary judgment, we say, district judge, you're wrong, you had no authority to dismiss, you should have stayed.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.067" offset="1976641">This is the plaintiff's choice of forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.088" offset="6736778">Very importantly, the Federal Arbitration Act did not divest the district courts of discretion to dismiss cases, as the district judge did here, as opposed to staying a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.239" offset="6781291">Therefore, the district court had that discretion, exercised the discretion and, as Justice Ginsburg observed, I think once the decision was made to dismiss with prejudice there was nothing else left for the Court to do, and that satisfied the classic standard of finality that made it subject to immediate appellate review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.646" offset="7030917">Section 3 was designed to ensure that there would be no further pursuit of the merits of the action, that that would be the end of the litigation of the action in that court until the arbitration concluded.</text>

Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.352" offset="12065758">That's clear, and it is also clear that there was issue about the cost presented to the district court, and about their being excessive, and the record was developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.993" offset="12108390">Whether it was sufficient on the costs in that case or not to satisfy the court, I think we may have a difference of opinion, but I think it's fair to say that the issue of costs was raised early, and it was raised several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.147" offset="12164919">It was not a last minute concern, and it was raised to the court of appeals in the same fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.123" offset="12184876">And if I might add, if I can turn for just a moment to the class action issue, which I understand was not decided by the court of appeals, because it apparently didn't feel it needed to reach the issue, but I think at least I want to make clear that much the same kind of approach we advanced here could be taken with respect to the class action issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.926" offset="12264080">Ms. Randolph has taken the position here that, not that class actions under Truth in Lending Act are always exempt from arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.366" offset="12321862">The position is likewise, the agreement was silent on class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.070" offset="12336700">The district court viewed it as silence meant it's excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.555" offset="12354568">That's the end of the discussion, even though the district court expressed some sympathy for Ms. Randolph's concerns about aggregating small consumer claims in the absence of that, the parties being left with no recourse, and I submit that once again the district court could have and should have been able to say to the parties, I see also that Ms. Randolph has styled this case as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.513" offset="12450385">I believe that the Truth in Lending Act, while the language of the statute itself contemplates class actions, but more importantly, Congress made it clear, echoing the views of the Federal Reserve Board, that there was great importance attached to the enforcement of the statute through class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.521" offset="12526453">And the district judge could have said and should have said, I think that the view... I don't know whether you intend to include class actions here, although Green Tree had already made its position clear by opposing class certification, that it presumably didn't want it and may very well have hoped that it would never see another class action again and these kinds of boiler plate agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.306" offset="12605552">But that I'm going to send this to arbitration, but I want you to understand that I regard... the district court says this, I regard class action to be an option, either left to the arbitrator to determine whether to certify the class, or for the district court itself to determine whether to certify the class, and then, upon review at the end, to satisfy itself that the interests of absent class members have been adequately protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.660" offset="12694996">I think the district court viewed its role in a way that was much too passive for the circumstances of the Federal Arbitration Act, but we do not take the position, and I want to be very clear about it, that we do not take the position that all TILA claims should be exempt from arbitration, or even all TILA class actions should be exempt from arbitration, nor that the district court was without recourse to have the parties put in place some assurances about cost, or to actually insert a provision about cost, as the Cole court seems to have contemplated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.634" offset="13306888">Unless you have further questions on the jurisdictional issue, I'm going to focus on the question of enforceability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.296" offset="13325591">It was only at the very tail end of Mr. Sellers' remarks that he identifies the fact that there is a national policy favoring arbitration, and I don't think we should lose sight of the fact that in this context there was a voluntarily entered into arbitration clause that ought to be enforced under these circumstances, and there are no guarantees, when you go down arbitration as opposed to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.326" offset="13409706">We are in a situation now where we have litigated this issue in three different jurisdictions and levels of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.745" offset="13435306">I don't think anybody going in anticipated any of those costs, and certainly no one is in a position to give a guarantee that any process of dispute resolution is going to be cost free or have cost constraints and, indeed, the plaintiff never asked the district court for any of the specifics that counsel has identified in the context of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.004" offset="13528406">What she said is, plaintiff does not have the resources to arbitrate, notwithstanding her agreement.</text>
