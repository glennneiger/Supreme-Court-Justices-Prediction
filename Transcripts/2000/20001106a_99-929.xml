            <text syncTime="2845.875" offset="11529996">Well, it's still the case that it's, that it's an enforcement, one, because of the pejorative language, which you have asked me to set aside, but is present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.496" offset="11564477">Two, because it is a decision by the state legislature to focus the attention of the voters and judge candidates on a single issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.149" offset="11607109">And three, because it is done in the voting booth and not in a public forum where there is an opportunity to respond and to debate, so it is an effort, it has the intended purpose and the effect of disadvantaging a class of candidates, and that's something this court said in term limits that the state cannot use its elections clause authority to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.092" offset="11706897">It interferes with, as Justice Kennedy said, the direct relationship between the national government and its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.603" offset="11748902">There is no other example of an effort to enforce an instruction with ballot labels in the case of a federal senator or representative, except for the... the only one we have been able to find is the Arizona recall pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.579" offset="11828837">That went off the ballot in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.984" offset="11838450">There is still a request to pledge, but it is no longer enforced by a ballot instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.419" offset="11860184">And of course, it doesn't involve a position on an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.559" offset="11872722">It doesn't involve a commitment to take a position on a particular issue in the legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.346" offset="12279919">There is a question as you have noted, about whether the time, place and manner authority that the Constitution gives to the state legislatures goes to any entity that the state gives legislative authority to, or whether it actually only goes to legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.683" offset="12353271">We haven't... in either case, even assuming that it isn't restricted to the legislature as such, it's our position that the power has simply been exceeded, doesn't go, doesn't authorize the making of nonneutral regulations that are designed to and have the effect of attempting to influence the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.578" offset="12448775">With respect to other labels that do sometimes appear on ballots, party labels and incumbency designations, those have, those are all understood as helping the voter identify the candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.010" offset="12514603">They are objective, identifying information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.382" offset="12524007">They don't, for one thing, involve a state official in assessing whether the label should apply or not, as this regulation does here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.629" offset="12557026">The secretary of state, subject to a state review process, has to determine whether the label applies, and the label is a judgmental label, not simply an identifying piece of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.327" offset="12615854">The other thing about parties, of course, is that party labels recognize the role political parties play in the electoral process, provide candidates with a reasonable level of community support, provide voters with a means of exercising their First Amendment right of political association, and the party label therefore reflects that the party is the mechanism that put the candidate on, on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.629" offset="12721075">It's quite different from a label that is designed to influence the election and also to constrain the behavior of the legislator after having been elected as this, as this provision does.</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.662" offset="12861196">The Court of Appeals actually didn't... well, the elections clause has been in the case from the beginning because it is the provision that the state has used to defend its authority against all other attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.546" offset="12916680">That is the argument, when the argument is made that this is a qualification, or this is an improper this or that, the state has said it's a proper exercise of its authority under the elections clause, and we say it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.212" offset="12975403">I think that's the simplest way to decide this case, even though there are a number of other issues that could also be reached.</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.754" offset="13029529">It Tashjian, this Court said, any claim that we enhance the ability of the citizenry to make wise decisions by restricting the flow of information to them must be viewed with some skepticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.734" offset="13081460">This is precisely respondent's claim, and it should be viewed with considerable skepticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.434" offset="13108210">As to the elections clause claim made by the respondent, the Court said in Smiley that the time, place and manner language are comprehensive words that embrace authority to provide a complete code for congressional elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.912" offset="13170172">And in Tashjian they said state control over the election process for state officers is coextensive with that grant to the states under the elections clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.892" offset="13210087">It is a broad power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.204" offset="13219282">The alleged damage done to congressional candidates because of the ballot label is something that needs to be analyzed under a punishment analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.198" offset="13271318">There is no evidence in the record that suggests this language is punishing, and that was respondent's burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.023" offset="13302561">Under the qualifications clause, it was Respondent's burden to show that the sole basis for putting this on was to add a qualification indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.941" offset="13346237">The language of the amendment itself indicates that it is not the sole basis to add a qualification indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.110" offset="13378943">It is the sole purpose to one, inform the voters, and two, to amend the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.233" offset="13399423">It was argued that the severance issue was waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.636" offset="13421052">This is contained in the response to the, or pardon me, to the reply to the cert. In point four, we say specifically because we use the word or in the first question, we preserve the severance question and we have already dealt with that in the reply suggestions.</text>
