            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92513">The opinion of the Court in No. 99-1792, Director of Revenue of Missouri versus CoBank ACB will be announced by Justice Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.936" offset="136190">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.025" offset="160536">CoBank is the successor to a bank for cooperatives, which is designed as a federally charted instrumentality within the Farm Credit System.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.951" offset="208288">In 1996, CoBank amended returns on behalf of this bank requesting an exemption from all Missouri corporate income taxes and refunds on the taxes paid in 1991 through 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.762" offset="279550">CoBank asserted that the Supremacy Clause accords federal instrumentalities immunity from state taxation, unless Congress has expressly waived this immunity, and that because the Farm Credit Act's current version does not expressly do so, banks for cooperatives are exempt from Missouri's corporate income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.169" offset="381114">The State denied the exemptions, but the Missouri Supreme Court reversed for the reasons asserted by CoBank.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.160" offset="417058">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.429" offset="434195">The Farm Credit Act of 1933 subjected banks for cooperatives to state taxation, except when the United States held stock in the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.608" offset="482887">As soon as governmental investment in the banks was repaid as it was by 1968, the banks have to pay state income taxes because the exemption no longer applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.167" offset="533146">Congress did not change that rule, when it amended the Act in 1971, nor did the 1985 amendments expressly changed that rule, although Congress deleted the two sentences within the Act that exempted such banks from state taxation when the government held stock in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.477" offset="614335">The logical interpretation of this deletion and one that accords with the Act’s more than 50-year history is that Congress merely deleted language that had become superfluous once the United States no longer owned and no longer could own stock in the banks for cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.220" offset="689359">It would be surprising if Congress had eliminated the state’s ability to collect revenue from such banks sub silentio.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.537" offset="726557">The Act’s structure confirms that banks for cooperatives are subject to state taxation, because it contains the taxation provision that specifically delineates the tax immunity for each lending institution within the Farm Credit System.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.026" offset="792595">Had Congress intended to confer upon banks for cooperatives, the more comprehensive exemption it provided for other types of institutions, it would have done so expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.729" offset="835331">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
