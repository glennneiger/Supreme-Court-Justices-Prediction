            <text syncTime="9.454" offset="192299">Mr. Geller.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth Steven Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="10.486" offset="196478">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="15.111" offset="214973">The plaintiffs in this case are people who underwent back surgery in which particular medical devices were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.663" offset="245171">They brought this suit under State law to recover for injuries allegedly caused by their... by these devices, but this is a very unusual form of State law product liability action.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.437" offset="288325">The plaintiffs don't claim that these devices were in any way defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.606" offset="304939">There's no claim here of manufacturing defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.496" offset="316537">There's no claim here of design defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.468" offset="328449">The plaintiffs also don't claim that the surgeons who used these devices did anything wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.548" offset="348720">There's no claim here of medical malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.603" offset="360945">Instead, the plaintiffs' sole claim in this case is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.978" offset="378395">They assert that the Federal Food &amp; Drug Administration was deceived into giving regulatory clearance to these devices, that, absent this deception, these devices would never have been on the market, and that, if the devices had never have been on the market, they wouldn't have been used in their surgeries and they wouldn't have suffered any injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.008" offset="454568">So this lawsuit is, in other words, a direct attack under State law on the decision of the Federal Food &amp; Drug Administration applying Federal law to allow these devices to be marketed in interstate commerce and, if this suit is allowed to proceed, it means that a jury applying State law would have to decide such issues as, what sorts of disclosures have to be made to the Food &amp; Drug Administration in the context of seeking 510(k) approval for a device?</text>
            <text syncTime="101.425" offset="560207">What did the FDA know about these specific devices and their intended use?</text>
            <text syncTime="106.338" offset="579851">Was the FDA deceived in any way in granting regulatory clearance?</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="110.341" offset="595838">Do they really have to get into all of those issues, because I thought at least one theory of the plaintiffs' case was simply representation as determined on an objective basis and the only thing the jury would have to decide was whether, on an objective basis, the representation that the devices were intended for, what was it, long bone surgery, something other than spinal surgery, was true or false?</text>
            <text syncTime="135.938" offset="698238">Why would they have to go beyond that?</text>

            <text syncTime="137.628" offset="705030">Justice Souter, they would have to do that because there's a fraud claim and if you look at the complaint--</text>

            <text syncTime="142.913" offset="726137">Well, that would be a question of intent on the part of the company, but it--</text>

            <text syncTime="149.434" offset="752260">--It would be more than that, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.457" offset="760305">If you look at the complaint, for example, at page 21 of the joint appendix, paragraphs 131 and 132 allege not only that a false statement was made but reliance and causation and all the things that you have to prove in order to prove a State law cause, State law fraud action.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.145" offset="823104">So it's not enough simply to prove that a misrepresentation was made in order to recover on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.808" offset="841807">You would also have to prove whether the misrepresentation was material, whether the FDA knew what was allegedly not told to it, whether the FDA thought that it was relying on the absence of the information, relied on the misrepresentation and then finally, what would the FDA have done if it had been told the truth, the causation theory.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="189.148" offset="911084">Mr. Geller, why wouldn't it be adequate to show that, that there had been two prior applications that were rejected for use of this device for spinal surgery?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="203.304" stopTime="261.926">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth Steven Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="203.304" offset="967718">Your Honor, the... what the manufacturer has to show in seeking 510(k) is, in addition to showing that the device has the physical technological characteristics of the predicate device the manufacturer also has to put down what the intended use of the device is.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.734" offset="1033442">It's... the manufacturer under the law is entitled to put down any intended use it wants, as described in the labeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.556" offset="1056743">What the plaintiffs seem to claim here is that the FDA, is that the manufacturer had to allege not simply that the intended use was for the long bones, which was the manufacturer was entitled to allege, but also, according to the complaint, that once the device got on the market the manufacturer intended that it be used for spinal applications, and that our... and therefore a State jury would have to determine what would the FDA have done, if it had been told, as the plaintiffs allege the manufacturer should have told the FDA, that once this device gets on the market the intent was to see it used significantly for spinal applications.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="261.926" stopTime="276.620">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="261.926" offset="1202193">But my point was simply that we do have two applications that said the intended use is for spinal surgery and both of those applications were turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.964" offset="1238346">Isn't that enough to infer that if they had for a third time said the same thing they'd be turned down again?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth Steven Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="276.620" offset="1261020">Well, I think the opposite, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.683" offset="1269275">I think it shows that the FDA was well aware of the possibility of using these devices for spinal applications and when the manufacturer came in, as it was entitled to do, and that now we want to seek 510(k) approval to label these devices for the long bones of the arm and leg, the FDA was well aware that the devices had some possibility of being used for spinal applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.853" offset="1357987">After all, I think the mistake here--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="302.543" offset="1364674">So you're saying in effect that there would be an issue of whether the FDA was complicit in the deception itself?</text>

            <text syncTime="309.769" offset="1393618">--Absolutely, what did the FDA actually know about the use of these devices, and that's in our view not an inquiry that should be made under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.487" offset="1424442">In fact, one of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="318.314" offset="1427786">We know... I mean, as Justice Ginsburg's question suggests it would be fairly easy to prove what the FDA knew about possible applications, but I think, if I understand your answer to her, your answer is, well, that still doesn't simplify the case, because the issue then would become, even on that assumption, did the FDA understand perfectly well that this fraud was nothing but a fraud, and they winked at it and said, sure, this is an easy way of letting them do what they want to do even though we've said before that we won't let them do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.886" offset="1558085">In other word... is that in effect what you're--</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth Steven Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="352.865" offset="1566026">--In effect, although whether it was even a fraud at all... you see, I think one of the problems here is in viewing the intended use statement under 510(k) as a factual representation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.691" offset="1605314">It's not a factual representation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.548" offset="1612733">It's simply a request for marketing clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.149" offset="1623078">The manufacturer decides by its labeling what sort of marketing clearance it seeks for its devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.556" offset="1644707">The FDA's role is simply to look at the labeling and determine whether there was a device on the market prior to 1976 with those physical characteristics and that labeling.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.958" offset="1686398">--It's really a misnomer, then, if you're going to use it the way you say they have been and ought to use it, they shouldn't call it intended use.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.784" offset="1725687">They should have... it should be called permitted use, or approved use, or something like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.235" offset="1747420">Absolutely, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.557" offset="1748779">I think intended use is a misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.669" offset="1757242">It's a term of art in the food and drug law, and I think the statute and the regulations are as clear as can be, it is simply a request for marketing clearance by describing how you intend to label your device.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.071" offset="1798829">It is not at all a factual representation as to how that device will actually be used off label once the device is on the market, which is, I think, one of the many problems with the plaintiffs' claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.474" offset="1840416">But the point that I was simply making is the sorts of inquiries that a State judge or jury would have to make if this State law claim were allowed to proceed are inquiries that would delve heavily into the intricacies of the Federal regulatory process and, in addition, in addition to prevail on their claims the plaintiffs would have to convince a State jury that these devices should never have been on the market and were not lawfully on the market, even though the FDA has decided as a matter of Federal law that the devices are lawfully on the market, so to rule for plaintiffs, a jury under State law would have to essentially disregard and nullify a binding decision of the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.022" offset="1998614">Now, our position is that a claim such as this, which essentially amounts to an attack under State law on a binding determination by a Federal agency is both expressly and impliedly preempted by the Federal food and drug laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.220" offset="6023456">The claims there, the State was performing its traditional role in enforcing ordinary duties of care running from the manufacturer to the consumer, whereas here it's seeking to impose an obligation on somebody not to defraud a Federal Government agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.248" offset="6083538">The claims there had an existence that was completely independent of the Federal scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.116" offset="6102973">This claim is entirely derivative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.595" offset="6112900">Without this Federal regulatory scheme you could not have a fraud on the FDA claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.911" offset="6138186">And finally, the claims there were not preempted by the Federal clearance decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.784" offset="6369631">In Medtronic the Court was confronted with the question about whether or not the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the medical amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act preempt State common law claims which are founded on a violation of Federal requirements, and what the Court said, and said so unanimously, was that there is nothing in Federal law which prevented the States from affording a private damage remedy, one not given by Federal law at all, for violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the medical device amendments to that act, and that was not limited to negligence cause of actions.</text>

Astro Pharmaceutical, which held in the early 1980's that the failure to discharge duties of disclosure in connection with a drug or device rendered the product defective per se under section 402 of the Restatement, and allowed a court to award damages based on the theory that the FDA, had they received appropriate disclosures, would have acted differently and would have protected the plaintiff from injury and therefore which allowed recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2425.146" offset="9855097">One, I do believe it's a traditional principle of tort law, not as a matter of implying cause of action but as a matter of negligence per se, or liability per se, that where somebody violates a statute or regulation, regardless of who's in charge of administering that statute or regulation intended for the protection of the public, any harm caused by that is actionable under State law, not because you're implying a, in the case of Federal law a Federal cause of action, but just as a matter of negligence per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.524" offset="9960632">So the question then is, is this a substantive safety regulation that we're talking about here, or is it a procedural regulation, and I say it's a substantive safety regulation, because the heart of the Federal scheme, and there's hundreds of cases on this regulating food, drug, and cosmetics, is, you are only regulating by... with respect to what the device or drug is, and that is a function of two things, both what it physically is and what it's conceived to be for marketing purposes, and if you misrepresent to the public what it is, or you misrepresent to the agency what it is, you're undermining the central safety aspects here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.992" offset="10134503">For... it's easy to see that in this case, because when the agency was told this was a spinal fixation device and that that's what it was, they said, you can't put that on the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="2518.563" offset="10228753">The... if you push it towards the substantive side, then I get into the problem of the agency having a bunch of powers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth Steven Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3320.312" offset="13435754">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.707" offset="13445367">Just a few things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.656" offset="13449128">First, in response to Justice Scalia's question, there is no precedent for this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.364" offset="13467936">Every court of appeals, with the exception of the court below, has held that the so called fraud on the agency claims are preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.544" offset="13496671">Secondly, I want to address Medtronic, which is the centerpiece of the plaintiff's argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.912" offset="13518196">This case is completely unlike Medtronic, in part for some of the reasons Mr. Gornstein was getting into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.575" offset="13536795">Medtronic was a garden variety product liability claim under State law, design defect, failure to warn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.057" offset="13562709">There was no requirement in Medtronic that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act be construed, there was no suggestion that you had to inquire into any agency determinations, there was no fraud on the agency claim in Medtronic, and there was no claim of implied preemption in Medtronic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.745" offset="13625507">In fact, the existence of Medtronic suggests, the decision in Medtronic suggests that the plaintiffs have many common law claims available to them if these products were defective, so it's not a case that the Court was confronted with in Medtronic, where the argument of preemption would have wiped out many preexisting State law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.699" offset="13697291">Here, no claim... the States would not be ousted of any claim that would have existed prior to the enactment of the medical device amendments in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.584" offset="13728847">Third, I just want to focus for the Court's attention at, if you look at page 136 of the joint appendix there's a strong suggestion here that what the plaintiff's label as fraud on the FDA the irony here is, actually was an idea that originated with the FDA to break up this one device into its two constituent parts and to seek 510(k) approval for each, so the notion that a State court years later could conclude this was a fraud on the FDA and enter a judgment that would... might have the effect of removing the device from the market is completely inconsistent, we think, with Congress' scheme here, which is to centralize enforcement authority with the FDA.</text>
