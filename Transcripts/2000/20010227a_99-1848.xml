I think this is a dumb law that's on the books, and I would really like to change that law, but then the fire marshal comes to me and he says, you know, if you change that law, the State is going to be liable for millions of dollars in attorneys' fees, because it will be held that the suit was the catalyst for the change, and we'll have to pay all this money.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.696" offset="12839062">Mr. Cleek was assuming a hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.061" offset="12856512">I want to assume a hypothetical for the Court as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.192" offset="12873021">Let us assume this Court does not accept the catalyst theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.836" offset="12891620">This Court is concerned with the issue of administration of justice, and I am concerned that if this Court does not accept the catalyst theory, then the game's been shifted we talked about that Justice Scalia pointed out, where a defendant that might be incredibly guilty on the eve of trial, after the plaintiff has incurred a lot of expenses, can moot the case out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.151" offset="12984930">On the other hand, there may be motivation on the plaintiff's part to start engaging in gamesmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.295" offset="13009485">We recognize that once we had the consent or the agreed order, we did not have damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.511" offset="13042295">The home wasn't shut down, the people weren't thrown out, we had no damages, so we stipulated to take damages out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.573" offset="13066536">Had we known that this rule might have jumped up at us, we might have thought otherwise about the damages issue, so there can be gamesmanship on both sides if we don't have the catalyst theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.943" offset="13124006">We think... and one of the points that seems to get lost, we often talk about this as if the catalyst theory doesn't exist, but the fact of the matter is, the catalyst theory has existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.151" offset="13164861">It has been applied for 30 years, and the courts have not had trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.102" offset="13180639">When you look at the cases, the courts are able to apply the causation test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.565" offset="13202582">They are able to deal with these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.009" offset="13212300">The district courts are equipped to make these decisions, and they have made these decisions for 30 years, and we think that the Fourth Circuit is wrong, and this Court should find, inasmuch as it did in the Laidlaw case, that Farrar had no catalytic effect, that the Fourth Circuit has misread Farrar, and that we should have our opportunity, our day in court to present the motion for attorneys' fees.</text>
