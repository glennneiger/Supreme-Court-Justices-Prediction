            <text syncTime="29.241" offset="259960">Before Raymond Cobb confessed to murdering Maggie and Korie Rae Owens, he was more than once meticulously informed of his right to counsel and the consequences of his choice to waive that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.420" offset="320669">His confession was properly admitted at trial and should not have been rejected under Jackson, because Cobb's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had never attached to the murders and therefore did not need to be waived, or, alternatively, because Cobb validly waived whatever Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.695" offset="405723">Applying McNeil's rule of offense specificity to exclude factually related but uncharged crimes from the scope of Sixth Amendment attachment is true to and, we think, required by both the text and the purposes of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.927" offset="474687">In evaluating attachment, the court is interpreting the Sixth Amendment terms, criminal prosecutions and the accused, and for decades this Court has consistently interpreted that text to limit attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the formal initiation of judicial criminal proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.566" offset="1297230">I don't think that courts have established any kind of consistent test, but yes, most of the courts that have addressed this issue have said there is this test, although most of them have found that there is, in fact, no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.897" offset="1350520">It's a relatively small number that have found a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.070" offset="1359297">But we would go back and say that they're erroneous in applying that test at all, and as I was saying, Escobido aside, this Court has never, ever held that the Sixth Amendment attached prior to the initiation of formal judicial proceedings, prior to indictment or arraignment.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.111" offset="1435470">Well, under the hypothetical we were just discussing and the answer you gave to Justice O'Connor, I suppose the police could say, and we're now going to question him about that murder so we want you out of the room.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.169" offset="1475699">Under Moran that might be constitutionally permissible, but remember, the important aspect of the analysis is what happens in the room, because the defendant does have a Fifth Amendment right to counsel that he needs to be informed about, and he has an opportunity to waive that, so that would only happen if the defendant or suspect has actually waived his Fifth Amendment right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.199" offset="1595758">What I'm concerned about is the possibility for some manipulation, if the police hold and charge on the lesser offense merely to bide their time until they begin questioning about the more serious offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.338" offset="1652287">I'm actually very anxious, Justice Kennedy, to debunk this idea of abuse or manipulation, because when the police are doing an investigation, and they might be investigating a number of related crimes, once they have enough evidence to convict, admissible evidence to convict on one of them, there's certainly no problem with them bringing that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.363" offset="1740476">They have a serious societal interest in continuing to investigate other crimes, but if you compare that defendant who has had one crime charged against the defendant where they haven't brought any of the charges, once you charge that defendant he has the right to counsel that has now attached not only to the Fifth Amendment but also the Sixth Amendment, and our system ensures that that person will not only have a right to counsel but will relatively quickly actually be represented by counsel, who will then, of course, advise the client as to the charged offense and almost certainly as to the uncharged offenses and will say, don't talk to the police about this charged offense or anything else and, in fact, Mr. Ridley had given that counsel to Mr. Cobb.</text>
