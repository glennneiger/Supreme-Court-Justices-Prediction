            <text syncTime="7.216" offset="109751">This case comes to us on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Thrid Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.235" offset="133784">The former presiding officers of the New Jersey Legislature seek to appeal a judgment declaring unconstitutional the New Jersey law providing for a minute of silence in the public schools of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.510" offset="194910">We do not reach the merits of the holding of the Court below because in the opinion filed today, we hold that public officials who have participated in a lawsuit solely in their official capacities may not appeal an adverse judgment after they have left office.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.844" offset="268262">Mr. Karcher and Mr. Orechio participated in the judgment below only in their official capacities as the presiding officers of the New Jersey General Assembly and the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.550" offset="319044">Since they no longer hold those positions and since the incumbent presiding officers have withdrawn the legislature's appeal, Mr. Karcher and Mr. Orechio may not pursue this appeal in their capacities as presiding officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.821" offset="384141">They have never participated in this lawsuit in their capacities as individual legislators or as representatives of the expired 200th New Jersey Legislature which enacted the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.508" offset="434923">For that reason, we hold they are not, in those capacities, parties entitled to appeal in the Court of Appeals judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.859" offset="464285">Because we have no proper party appellant before us, we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.699" offset="495632">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
