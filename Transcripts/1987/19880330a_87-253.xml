            <text syncTime="42.561" offset="305898">It undertook to enlist the aid of a wide variety of community groups to combat this problem in providing the assistance of federal grants for two kinds of services: prevention services, aimed at discouraging adolescent sexual relations, and care services, directed principally at pregnant adolescents, and intended to give among other things, services of the following kind: pregnancy testing, health services, prenatal and postnatal care, venereal disease screening, psychological and nutritional counseling, and a wide variety of other services.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.507" offset="533686">Congress sought to draw on the widest possible range of community resources, and therefore specifically provided that among the class of grantees should be included religiously affiliated organizations where appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.030" offset="615710">Though religiously affiliated organizations have participated without question throughout our history in the care and counseling services funded at all levels of government in areas such as juvenile delinquency, runaways, drug addiction, physical and mental health, foster care, adoption, and aging, the District Court struck down... on its face and as applied as violating the Establishment Clause... this Act insofar as it specifically adverted to the inclusion of religiously affiliated organizations within the class of permissable grantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.920" offset="779341">The District Court's standard and reasoning was such that I think no one in this Court... not us and not the Plaintiffs and their Amici... defend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.289" offset="832840">The District Court found a valid secular purpose here, and properly so, but found that the Act had the primary effect of advancing religion, thereby failing the second prong of the Lemon test, because... and I am quoting here... of its use of religious organizations for education and counselling of teenagers on matters relating to religious doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.826" offset="934926">We pressed on the District Court and renew the argument here that the correct standard for determining whether a law has the effect of advancing religion has been set out many times in the decisions of this Court, and perhaps most neatly in the decision of Hunt v. McNair, where it was said that aid has the effect of advancing religion if, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="228.033" offset="1047775">"it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subserved in the religious mission, or if it funds a specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting. "</text>
            <text syncTime="247.072" offset="1123948">And I suppose examples of that would be Stone v. Graham or Abington School District v. Schempp.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.914" offset="1151325">Instead of applying this familiar test, the District Court held that its quite original and unprecedented test should be applied, at least where, as in this act, this statute explicitly adverts to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.047" offset="1219870">The District Court thereby was able to reach its conclusion that the Act was unconstitutional without making any of the findings of fact which would be necessitated by the established decisions of this Court, because it found that its, and I quote, "more neatly put test" allows it to strike this statute down on summary judgment on its face and on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.192" offset="1340451">This odd state of affairs explains the unusual, I believe unusual submissions of this Court on the part of the Plaintiff and their amici.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.236" offset="1528533">It is quite possible that the grants which are funded would be grants which, unlike the activities in Schempp or Stone v. Graham, are not specifically religious activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.277" offset="1728735">Well, plainly, by answering the first question in the affirmative, then what must be done is that the relevant authorities must be directed to cease applying the statute in an inappropriate way.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael W. McConnell</label>
            <text syncTime="1081.595" offset="4461980">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.979" offset="4507537">The single most important point I wish to make this morning in my brief ten minutes is to clarify precisely what the legal question in this case is, because I agree with Solicitor General Fried that the many factual allegations are not appropriately before this Court on an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.832" offset="4579008">The legal question is whether otherwise qualified private organizations must be excluded from the Adolescent Family Life program solely on the basis of their religious affiliation or inspiration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.546" offset="4633865">Our position is that the Establishment Clause does not require and the Free Exercise Clause does not permit religious belief or affiliation to be the basis for a civil disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.384" offset="4681199">AFLA grantees must be judged according to their conduct and their performance, and not according to their beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.208" offset="4712442">I would have thought that Cantwell v. Connecticut was sufficient authority to establish that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.643" offset="4742221">Thus the issue is not whether some grantees may have violated the terms of the grant or even whether the terms of the grant are binding on them; those are not disputed questions among any of the parties in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.904" offset="4791227">If the District Court had held only that grantees who use AFLA funds to teach or promote religion must be disciplined, and in appropriate cases perhaps excluded, we would not be here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.094" offset="4915988">This Court has consistently held that programs of aid to parochial schools... which are predominantly sectarian institutions, in most of the cases before this Court over 95 per cent of them being sectarian... is not a neutral program of secular education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.822" offset="4982966">The reason for that seems quite evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.618" offset="4990071">Even though the description of the program... private education... may sound neutral on its face, in fact everyone understands that the institutions involved are predominantly, almost exclusively religious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.982" offset="5251609">Should the Court, on remand, determine whether any of these organizations are pervasively sectarian, or is that an improper test?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_w_mcconnell" startTime="1289.916" stopTime="1665.982">
            <label>Mr. Michael W. McConnell</label>
            <text syncTime="1289.916" offset="5295286">We have no quarrel with the test of pervasively sectarian, and for this reason: under this Court's definitions... which were, frankly, ignored by the District Court... a pervasively sectarian institution is one that is simply incapable... by virtue of being so permeated with religion... of distinguishing between the teaching or promotion of religion on the one hand, and the carrying out of secular purposes on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.779" offset="5398731">Such an institution would be unable to comply with the terms of the grant, which are legally binding in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.231" offset="5424540">Thus the exclusion of a pervasively sectarian organization is not on the basis of its belief or affiliation, but on the basis of a conclusion about its conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.773" offset="5466753">And that is the fundamental point which I wish to make this morning, which is that it is the conduct of the grantees and not their tie to religion or their inspiration of religion that has to be the basis for judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.549" offset="5517849">We agree that religious organizations, like everyone else, has to comply with the terms of the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.468" offset="5541464">There is nothing non-neutral about that, but neutrality, again, is the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.466" offset="5569467">This is a program in which Congress intended and then the Secretary has administered in a way so as not to either favor or disfavor religious organizations as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.337" offset="5612935">It seems rather clear to us that the way in which to be neutral in these matters is to insist upon objective, secular, neutral criteria for the selection of grantees, and not to either grant a grant to someone because they are religious, or to deny the grant to the same organization because they are religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.969" offset="5695482">How they are going to perform the secular functions of the program has to be the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.482" offset="5713558">That is the way in which we can see through to neutrality in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.010" offset="5739681">I would like, if I could, to run briefly through how this case ought to be viewed under the Lemon test, because I think that the court below quite misunderstood the Lemon test in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.300" offset="5804882">Now, the court did find that this program has a secular purpose, and I don't want to belabor the point, because obviously we agree with the District Court on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.765" offset="5846678">However it is important to note Appellee's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.233" offset="5864546">While they do not directly contradict the notion that this statute is secular in purpose, their view that for the government to support an approach to sex education and care for pregnant adolescents that support sexual self-discipline as opposed to, say, contraception as a means of family planning, and that promote adoption and care as opposed to abortion, they believe that that is itself an impermissible purpose because those beliefs are also associated with the views of some prominent religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.154" offset="6024206">Now, that point of view was rejected in Maher v. Rowe, and more pointedly in Harris v. McRae, and I don't want to repeat that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.713" offset="6058479">The important things is that if that is correct, it would also be true that the opposite kind of sex education program would be equally impermissible under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.710" offset="6098499">If it is impermissible for the government to fund sex education with a view to sexual self-discipline, it would be equally unconstitutional for the government to fund... as it does in the Title X program... sex education with a view toward contraception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.328" offset="6160984">We do not take this position, the government does not take this position, and I cannot really believe that the Appellees support the logical conclusion of this argument about purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.307" offset="6200899">Now, as to effect, the important thing, according to the Lemon test, is whether the program as a whole seeks to advance or infringe religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.367" offset="6245098">Here the question is does the program... taken as a whole, not concentrating just on the religious aspects, the religious grantees, but the program as a whole, does it favor religion over non-religion, or does it favor non-religion over religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.687" offset="6306329">The point is for it to be neutral, not for it be stacked in favor of secular grantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.372" offset="6329108">It infringes the rights of religious organizations to be included simply on the basis of religious affiliation, just as it would infringe the rights of non-religious organizations if religious organizations were granted a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.242" offset="6388562">As to the issue of entanglement, here I would like to emphasize that this Court has always used the term excessive entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.535" offset="6421790">And this is because any interaction between government and religious organizations inevitably have some degree of entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.188" offset="6456376">The question is excessive in comparison to what.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.078" offset="6467975">In Walz v. Tax Commission, being the first case of this Court that invoked the notion of entanglement, is a good place to begin, because the Court there noted that there were problems both ways... either including religious organizations for tax exemptions or excluding them... and the question was which way leads to the least damaging constitutional consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.397" offset="6561180">Here Appellees' position has presented us with a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.708" offset="6574450">Either we can exclude all organizations solely on the basis of their religious affiliation, or some degree of monitoring to ensure that they are judged on the basis of their conduct is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.295" offset="6628784">It is our belief that it is not excessive entanglement for a program to be administered in a way so as to avoid the more serious constitutional violation of a flat out discrimination on the basis of religious affiliation or belief, which could not be a plainer violation of the Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.584" offset="6709973">If Congress had passed a statute that says grants are going to be available to all voluntary and charitable organizations except for those who have religious beliefs, this Court would not have any hesitation in declaring such a statute unconstitutional, either under the Free Exercise Clause or under the equal protection component of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.982" offset="6799521">But Mr. McConnell, is that different from a grant that says it can go to religious organizations provided the religious beliefs are of a certain kind?</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.582" offset="6885934">An organization that believes in abortion, for example, is perfectly eligible to put on an AFLA program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.047" offset="6919788">It simply may not urge or facilitate abortions in the context of the program itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.669" offset="6946329">It is free to do with its own money and in its other operations whatever it cares to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.839" offset="6970988">The contrast here is with the District Court's judgment, which prevents the organization from pursuing its religious purposes even with its own funds, and in its own way, and ways that are not promoted by the AFLA grant itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.878" offset="7055103">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.857" offset="7099093">I would first like to address the answer to Justice O'Connor's question, because I believe that the answer the Solicitor gave was dead wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.228" offset="7136500">Her question was what do we do when we are shown some unconstitutional applications of a statute, which most certainly has happened in this case, probably more than any other case reviewed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.161" offset="7184252">This is a facial challenge, and facial assessments have been the rule of this Court even when statutes have been applied for ten or twenty years, and even when trial courts have upheld them on as applied grounds, as the trial court did in Meek v. Pittenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.169" offset="7252275">In fact, out of over thirty cases heard by this Court since 1947, only one was labeled a narrow, as applied holding, and that was Hunt v. McNair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.196" offset="7300445">Justice Powell said, I am only calling it as applied in this case because the South Carolina legislature hasn't worked out the details of the statute yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.489" offset="7333568">Nevertheless, despite the fact that the Court has always looked at the facial assessments, it's done so because the standard in Establishment Clause cases is different than in other kinds of constitutional cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.937" offset="7387380">You can look at the language of the First Amendment to see that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.076" offset="7399919">The language says laws respecting an establishment of religion, and therefore this Court has always looked for the certainty that it will not so advance religion, or the risk and potential in a statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.070" offset="7919860">Well, the basis was described by this Court in your majority opinions both in Grand Rapids and in Aguilar, where you said the fact that there had been no proof in 18 years of unconstitutional application, that didn't mean that there wasn't a high risk, and that there were certain factors mitigating against those kinds of unconstitutional applications being brought to the forefront.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.170" offset="8024350">I would also like to address the question about the fact finding, because I think some misstatements were made to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.541" offset="8053816">In the District Court there were cross motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.227" offset="8068549">The government never argued that there were any disputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.007" offset="8083700">The Plaintiff submitted 1,251 undisputed material facts backed up by a plethora of deposition evidence taken around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.956" offset="8131452">Sixty per cent of these were written, admitted, by the government, right on the face, and only 29 of those facts did the government dispute and put in any kind of evidence, and those were not found legally relevant by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.496" offset="8201565">So this is not a question where there are disputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.931" offset="8215357">And Rule 52 makes it very clear that in cross motions for summary judgment it is not up to the trial court to decide disputed facts and make findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.474" offset="8257571">In fact, that is an improper role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.224" offset="8264572">Nevertheless, that doesn't make our whole list of undisputed facts irrelevant to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.043" offset="9267779">I would like to point out that the government admitted below all of our expert affidavits from religious theologians saying that these values could be secular.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.581" offset="9509986">That is a good example, because I think if the public schools want to teach, for example, AIDS education, and abstinence would be a major factor in that, but if they would give that to religious authorities, and religious authorities would not mention condoms or, as some of our programs do, say such things as condoms cause birth defects, in order to discourage teenagers from learning about condoms, that that would certainly would be a religious rule that prevented secular teaching on abstinence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.553" offset="13937846">By finding the Adolescent and Family Life Act unconstitutional, this Court furthers the original intent of the framers, that religious instruction and indoctrination are not within the scope of Congress' power to tax and spend for the general welfare.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.169" offset="14036275">I would like to just briefly indicate that the joint appendix, Justice Kennedy, has an affidavit from Father Bruce Ritter, who is the president of Covenant House and an AFLA grantee, setting out the programs, and that was available to the District Court on the summary judgment motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.126" offset="14152154">I think the heart of the difference between Ms. Benshoof and ourselves came out pretty clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.076" offset="14183919">I think the Plaintiffs are distressed at the abortion and family planning limitations in this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.539" offset="14229790">That is what troubles them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.070" offset="14235955">They do not accept the judgment of this Court in Maher and Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.927" offset="14259361">That is the heart of the difficulty, because from that premise, which is, of course, an inadmissable one, they conclude that any organization, if religiously affiliated, while it might otherwise not become pervasively sectarian, it becomes pervasively sectarian if that religious organization has doctrinal limitations which coincide with the limitations which Congress put into this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.726" offset="14398541">Therefore, a hospital becomes pervasively sectarian in the mind of the Plaintiffs because it has doctrinal limitations on abortion and family planning methods, which coincide with limitations which this Court had said Congress may put on the provisions of those very same services by any federal grantee.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3595.682" offset="14518391">In fairness, General Fried, I think it is more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.508" offset="14533646">I think that they would say not just the limitations but even the affirmative goals of the program, if those goals are pursued for religious reasons, that that would be disqualifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.456" offset="14593415">In other words, it's quite all right to say you should not have premarital sex, but it is not all right to say you should not have premarital sex because it is a sin.</text>
