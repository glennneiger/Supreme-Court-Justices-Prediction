            <text syncTime="13.641" offset="187792">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="33.721" offset="268040">Our disagreement with the Fifth Circuit decision in this case rests upon two basic grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.743" offset="308164">First, we think that final judgments should not be set aside because of after the fact recusal motions, unless there is a showing of actual judicial impropriety.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.050" offset="353408">Second, we think that such relief is particularly inappropriate when at the time of judgment that the district judge did not even know of possible grounds for recusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.208" offset="406071">Because a judge without knowledge cannot possibly favor one side or the other, it is in fact is more unfair in this case to throw out the judgment than it is to give it effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.785" offset="464376">Now I would like to just spend a few minutes at the outset on the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.356" offset="490603">The findings made by a separate district judge showed that at the time that he rendered his judgment and at the relevant time that the case was before him, that Judge Collins had no recollection of and no knowledge of any discussions between Petitioner and Loyola University regarding the possible purchase of some Loyola land.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.375" offset="598646">The judge found that there were numerous individuals who had been discussing the possible purchase with Loyola, and that Judge Collins did not have any recollection that Petitioner was among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.683" offset="647965">Now the Court will recall that this case did not involve Loyola University in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.770" offset="676281">Loyola was not a party to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.954" offset="689029">Its land was never mentioned in the case, and its interest was never mentioned in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.708" offset="712017">There was some discussion of land in the opinion, but that is completely different land that has nothing to do with Loyola University.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.481" offset="751096">Judge Collins was said to have known at an earlier time, because he was present at some board meetings where the matter was discussed and after his judgment, but the specific finding is that at the time of his judgment that he did not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.176" offset="817865">Now I should take this opportunity to correct a statement that I did make at the first argument, which is that he did not have earlier knowledge either.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.198" offset="849944">The Court did find that he had had earlier knowledge, but said that at the time that the case was before him that he did not have any knowledge of these discussions.</text>

            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="189.321" offset="890486">Was the finding that he did not know or that he did not remember?</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="198.177" offset="925908">Well, I think both.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.279" offset="930296">I think that the specific finding actually is stated in terms of knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.481" offset="951090">But I think that it is implicit in that that he would not have remembered any earlier information that he might have had by virtue of having attended the board meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.187" offset="985989">Now the Fifth Circuit did not reverse its finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.673" offset="1011903">In fact, it reaffirmed that Judge Collins did not know at the time of his judgment about the discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.012" offset="1041264">What it held was simply that the judgment had to be set aside, because in effect he should have known.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.968" offset="1073029">Now in discussing this decision, I would like to begin with what I think is an obvious but important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.141" offset="1113780">That the question here is not simply one of getting another judge at the beginning of the case, which is what Section 455 is basically aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.782" offset="1172295">The question here is one of setting aside a final judgment based on a motion that was made after the judgment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.708" offset="1220046">Now usually, this Court has set a high threshold for claims raised for the first time after judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.045" offset="1249408">There are, of course, plain error rules on appeal and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.730" offset="1264141">And for Rule 60(b)(6), which is the rule under which this particular motion has been made, usually the Court has required a showing of exceptional circumstances before it would find a basis for a judgment being set aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.718" offset="4652118">But anyway to answer your question, Justice O'Connor, I think that there might be a possible reading under (c) which says that the way that we are going to enforce the provisions of Subsection (c) is to assume that a judge knows at least about what he is required to inform himself about, and perhaps what he is supposed to make reasonable efforts about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.834" offset="4748562">But even if that were so, that still would not mean that he would have to know not just what he owned, what his wife owned, what any private trust that he served as a trustee owned or any university, but also anybody who might buy that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.463" offset="7147021">We submit to Your Honors that the single most important finding of fact by the Fifth Circuit was its finding that the public would not believe the Judge Collins forgot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2415.884" offset="9796778">Now one of the points that this Court, of course, is well aware of is that a judge should not act as a judge in his own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.733" offset="9892177">And this Court in Aetna v. Lavoie established that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.654" offset="9911821">Also the law does not look at just actual bias, but it looks at the question of the appearance of bias or the appearance of impropriety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.884" offset="9988726">And this was an important holding by the Court in the Commonwealth Coatings case back in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.704" offset="10019968">In fact, it was that case that was used as a source of 455(a) in the Senate and House hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.394" offset="10046822">Therefore, in the absence of a designation of a remedy in Section 455, the remedy applied by this Court in Commonwealth Coatings is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.016" offset="10089245">I was asked before at the earlier hearing as to the basis for any remedy under 455.</text>

            <text syncTime="2527.625" offset="10243681">And I would cite the Court to U.S. v. Brown in the purview of a fair trial, that it is the judge himself who is on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.612" offset="10267609">If we ever get to a situation where the judge can say I forgot or I do not remember and completely exculpate himself from any finding of impartiality, then I think that we would do violence under those circumstances to the congressional intent of 455(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.025" offset="10345245">I think that the cases have clearly established that we must rely upon on objectively ascertainable evidence rather than the judge's memory or the judge's professing of not remembering.</text>

            <text syncTime="2578.925" offset="10448899">I mean if the thing that he claims not to have remembered is something obvious to all of the public and he is the only one in the world who did not remember, then you could say whether he remembered it or not, that there was an appearance of impropriety, because the whole public knew that this land was involved in litigation and that he was a trustee of Loyola.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.708" offset="10543984">But it is a much narrower situation when you say that it is a little thing that the public would not know about, and that it is that he claims not to remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.664" offset="10583899">What is so bad about letting that be adjudged by a separate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.300" offset="10602394">And if the court is persuaded that he did not remember it, there has neither been an appearance of impropriety nor any actual impropriety.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.418" offset="12646841">But in a situation of extreme facts, strong facts, compelling facts, as we have in this case, that is the only vehicle by which we can preserve our right to a fair trial, if you will, a fair trial in a fair tribunal, which after all is the purpose of the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="3159.787" offset="12772334">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.389" offset="12782783">Counsel talked briefly about Aetna Life Insurance v. Lavoie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.043" offset="12809323">And I think that the decision of this Court in that case points out what I think is a very important part of this case, which is that there is a difference between a judge who sits knowing of a possible interest and a judge who sits when he does not know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.885" offset="12864703">In Lavoie, the Court did hold that one of the Justices of the Alabama Supreme Court should be disqualified, because he sat knowing of an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.193" offset="12909947">The Court was also asked, however, to disqualify all of the other judges of the Court because they were class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.080" offset="12933561">And in discussing that claim, this Court pointed out that they were not even aware of any interest in the case when they sat on it up until the time of the rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.472" offset="12975044">And the Court assumed, and I think correctly, that they could not have had any reason to be biased, at least up to the time that they knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.375" offset="13006704">I think that what this case really is coming down to from the gist of Respondent's argument is the question as to whether you believe Judge Collins or not, and he says that reasonable people in this case will not believe him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.568" offset="13063442">And if in fact he did something wrong, certainly the judgment should be thrown out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.837" offset="13080579">But the question is what facts do you have to follow through on in order to reach that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.693" offset="13111926">You have to assume, first of all, that Judge Collins sat in a case violating his judicial oath, knowing that a university that he served as a trustee had an interest, and yet sat to favor that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.135" offset="13173784">When it was called to his attention eighteen months later in a motion, he falsely denied that he knew about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.006" offset="13413170">His deposition is taken under oath, and he says I did not know about it.</text>
