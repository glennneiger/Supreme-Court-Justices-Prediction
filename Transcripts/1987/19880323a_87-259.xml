            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="127109">We will hear arguments first this morning in Number 87-259, Jonna R. Lingle versus Norge Division of Magic Chef.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.998" offset="159083">Mr. Levy, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_alan_levy" startTime="11.981" stopTime="255.741">
            <label>Mr. Paul Alan Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="11.981" offset="174965">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, under Illinois law as in approximately two-thirds of the states an employer may not fire an employee for seeking workers' compensation benefits, and an employee who is thus victimized may seek redress in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.004" offset="243093">The reason why Illinois provides this cause of action is that it doesn't want employees to be discouraged from seeking workers' compensation benefits by the risk that they will be discharged from their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.204" offset="291889">Next Illinois had to decide whether an employee loses those rights by going to work in a shop which is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.949" offset="330864">The Illinois Supreme Court held, no, you don't lose those rights; rather, the right of action is available to union and non-union employees alike, and again Illinois in this respect is in accord with the majority of state courts that have considered the question, at least as a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.832" offset="406410">The question in this case is whether Congress has deprived the State of Illinois of the right to make this judgment by passing Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act, which provides a means for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements, or by passing Section 203 of that same Act, which enunciates a national policy favoring abitral resolution of disputes about the application or interpretation of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.664" offset="521662">Although the Court has held that Congress intended to supersede state laws providing for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements, there is no basis for concluding that Congress also intended these statutes to supersede state substantive regulation of the terms and conditions of employment in work places covered by collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.451" offset="616853">Given the presumption against preemption of state law claims, the burden is on respondent to show that Congress would have wanted to preempt the type of claim at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.556" offset="669307">Now, there is nothing in the text of the statute or in the legislative history suggesting that Congress wanted to preclude state regulation of the substantive terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.488" offset="717058">Indeed, to the extent that the language provides any guidance at all, it is actually helpful to our case because the statute speaks only of suits for violations of contracts, and suits or a policy concerning the application and interpretation of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.824" offset="794381">The court below nevertheless held that Lingle's claim was preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.900" offset="810681">The case on which it relied and on which respondents principally relied below was Alice Chalmers versus Lueck.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.148" offset="843700">In our view, not only does Alice Chalmers not help respondents, but to the contrary it is strong authority against preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.502" offset="877032">In Alice Chalmers the Court held that Section 301 preempts an employee's tort claim for bad faith denial of contractual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.546" offset="913290">In order to rule on that claim, the Court reasoned, it would inevitably be necessary to define the employee's contract rights, to decide whether they had been denied, whether they had been denied in bad faith, and what consequences should show from that denial of contractual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.789" offset="982253">Thus the Court said in order to... that state law claim is substantially dependent on interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement, and allowing that sort of state claim to proceed would interfere with a policy favoring uniform interpretation of collective bargaining agreements under principles of federal law by arbitrators selected by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.748" offset="1074100">Here, however, the state has conferred a non-negotiable right on individual employees, the right not to be discharged in retaliation for making a workers' compensation claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.009" offset="1123106">That cause of action is independent of rights which may be enjoyed under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.155" offset="2915628">In any event, in Alice Chalmers the Court tried to distinguish between the contract based claims that were at stake in the Lewis case and state claims that are based on substantive regulation of employment, and what the Court said in Alice Chalmers, equally applicable here, we believe, is that it would be inconsistent with Congressional intent under Section 301 to preempt state rules that proscribe conduct or establish rights and obligations independent of the labor agreement, and if there is any state employment cause of action which is independent of the labor agreement, Lingle's claim ought to be one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.279" offset="3084170">So, consistent with the Court's analysis in Alice Chalmers, which has been reaffirmed in several cases since then, Lingle's claim should not be held to be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.650" offset="3125653">Indeed, although respondent has not pointed to any indication that Congress would want to forbid lawsuits for retaliatory discharge, there is at least some evidence of Congressional intent which cuts against preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.082" offset="3179360">Congress has enacted numerous substantive regulations of the terms and conditions of employment in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.250" offset="3212066">In our brief we have cited 29 federal statutes governing discharge alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.999" offset="3231083">Not only do those forms of substantive regulation exist side by side with rights which may be granted by the collective bargaining agreement, but this Court has repeatedly ruled in the Gardner-Denver and Barrentine line of cases that employees may enforce their rights under those statutes, including the right against discharge, independent of collectively bargained grievance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.036" offset="3319168">Evidently Congress doesn't see this form of regulation as inconsistent with collective bargaining or as inconsistent with a national policy favoring arbitration of disputes about the interpretation or application of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.047" offset="3379249">Now, it is true those cases involve federal claims while this case involves a state claim, but there is no reason to think that Congress would want to treat state claims differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.604" offset="3421463">Indeed, this Court has treated them similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.103" offset="3435465">For example, in Metropolitan Life Insurance the Court cited Barrentine and Gardner-Denver as authority for the lack of Congressional intent to preempt state substantive regulation of employment conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.035" offset="3483217">And in Alice Chalmers, in Footnote 8 the Court pointed to Gardner-Denver as an example of an independent cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.079" offset="3515400">Now, in this Court respondent has relied for the first time on Teamsters v. Oliver and similar cases which hold according to respondent that the federal labor laws preempt any state cause of action that relates to a mandatory subject of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.995" offset="3583005">Now, leaving aside whether that argument, essentially based on NLRA preemption as opposed to Section 301 preemption, was properly preserved in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.802" offset="3630234">For present purposes it suffices to note that the argument has been repeatedly rejected by the Court in recent years, most pointedly in Metropolitan Life Insurance, where the Court said that it would turn the policy that animated the Wagner Act on its head to understand it to have penalized workers who have chosen to join a union by preventing them from benefitting from state labor regulations imposing minimum standards on non-union employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.886" offset="3730649">Similarly in Fort Halifax and Caterpillar the Court rejected the same argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.883" offset="3754577">Indeed, the argument was rejected as long ago as 1943 in the Terminail Railroad Association case.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.427" offset="3780804">The Court should not accept respondent's invitation to reopen this long settled question, but rather, the decision below should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.359" offset="5068536">Resolution of this question, we feel, calls for an analysis of two central policies informing Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.012" offset="5103122">First, the policy... the section... that if within Section 301 scope Section 301 completely preempts any state law cause of action within its scope.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.951" offset="8342828">Each of those cases, as we read them, held that where independent state rights existed, and they flew in the teeth of a labor contract, they were preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.524" offset="8385147">We don't think the rule should be any different here where this particular petitioner is protected by contractual grievance arbitration procedures, and also we feel this is the teaching of the Republic Steel case and the U.S. Bulk Carriers versus Arguelles case, where this Court said, at least in Arguelles, that the contractual exclusivity principle of resolution of claims extends to even those claims that are arguably extracontractual in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.982" offset="8498936">And I think that point holds up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.481" offset="8508967">Justice Harlan was the author of the Republic Steel case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2238.499" offset="9081049">Metropolitan Life permitted the state law to be... or the state action to be maintained because a law requiring mental health benefits in an insurance policy was not deemed to be inconsistent with a duty to bargain, a duty of collective bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.290" offset="9156177">We agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.368" offset="9160565">I mean, it has nothing to do with the duty to bargain under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.710" offset="9177911">In this case, under that balancing analysis, that type of cause of action was permitted to go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.379" offset="9204556">In this case the discharge claim of Jonna Lingle is right at the heart of Section 301 and the federal policies that directed these parties, the IAM and the company, to agree to contractual grievance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.575" offset="9261398">So the second half of the equation is, one, the type of state law, and two, whether the state law conflicts with the federal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.838" offset="9294417">And as I stated a little while ago, part of the difficulty is the definition of minimum standards and petitioner's lack of definition of minimum standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.737" offset="9362022">Under their analysis as we read it even a state could promulgate a general just cause for discharge statute just as the State of Montana, for example, has already enacted and under that Montana law, with exceptions for collective bargaining, all employees of the State of Montana have a right not to be fired except for just cause, and presumably there is going to be a common law developed as to what is just cause in Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2452.101" offset="9935462">With respect to this Gardner-Denver point of the petitioners, Gardner-Denver and the Buell case decided last year are said to provide a basis for recognizing this independent wrongful discharge tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.624" offset="10013516">We don't agree with that, and what that argument does is, it is essentially a shorthand way of saying there is no such thing as preemption, because the distinction under Gardner-Denver between what is a federal right and a state right makes a world of difference, as Justice Stevens pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.992" offset="10083001">There was that arbitration case last year that came out of California that this Court decided, Perry versus Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.334" offset="10104422">So the question is whether the states have the opportunity to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.707" offset="10125842">Gardner-Denver doesn't provide any indication at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.298" offset="10144232">It doesn't say anything about whether states have authority to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.126" offset="10155517">In fact, under Gardner-Denver in Titlte VII Congress has said explicitly that unions and employers are bound by the anti-discrimination provisions of Title VII and explicitly under that statute the states are authorized to set up Title &lt;VII&gt; [= VII] deferral agencies and regulate anti-discrimination concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.977" offset="10230959">The same is true of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Barrentine case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.022" offset="10243184">So, again, I don't think those decisions provide any support for the argument that petitioner's claim isn't preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2566.461" offset="10392918">This contractual grievance procedure here that gave Jonna Lingle full relief, put her back to work, gave her back pay, this type of agreement is exactly what takes place between countless other employers and unions every day.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.334" offset="10560415">But we maintain that it is precisely because the courts have not embraced petitioner's theory of non-preemption that arbitration has been preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.642" offset="10605659">Alice Chalmers in a very careful case-by-case way is a manifestation of a desire to prevent proliferation of state law causes of action that could undermine arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.800" offset="10746302">--I think that's precisely correct, and the problem with that is that in terms of national labor policy, it is going to depend upon the strength of the parties in any given bargaining situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.998" offset="10795099">But this is different from Title VII, which has been around since 1965, and unions and employers have gotten used to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.666" offset="10829685">It's different from other federal laws which have imposed statutory obligations on employers they have long accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.258" offset="10852046">This would be authorization for states to articulate and define causes of action that would give remedies to employees irrespective of what is provided under the collective bargaining agreement, and I think it would create an unacceptable incentive to undermine arbitration and... which is an institution of enormous importance in American labor law that I don't have to emphasize, I don't think, any longer to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.184" offset="10959775">In sum, we feel that the claim is inextricably intertwined with analysis of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.884" offset="11002616">If it is not inextricably intertwined, it is nonetheless, we feel, preempted under the rule of Teamsters versus Oliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.785" offset="11038247">And third, we feel that the exceptions that... the reasons that petitioner gives for avoiding preemption don't hold up on the narrow facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2741.437" offset="11092791">The NLRA balancing case does not control because the objectives here are different from those in Metropolitan Life, and the type of right asserted is much different from the one in Metropolitan Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.526" offset="11137199">And finally, we don't think that the Alexander, Gardner-Denver line has any teaching on the question now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.710" offset="11173875">For the foregoing reasons respondent respectfully submits that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
