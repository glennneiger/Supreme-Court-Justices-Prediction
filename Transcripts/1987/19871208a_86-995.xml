            <text syncTime="15.510" offset="199203">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.712" offset="208085">This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.747" offset="228147">The Court granted certiorari to consider a question whether evidence uncovered during a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth Amendment may nevertheless be admitted to evidence on the basis of the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.808" offset="296379">The following pattern of events gives rise to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.195" offset="318008">In this case, the events took place on a Wednesday afternoon in Boston in April 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.433" offset="342877">Officers violated the Fourth Amendment, which is assumed in this case, by entering premises without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.753" offset="368163">During the illegal search that ensues, they discover evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.305" offset="382374">They prepare an affidavit for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.241" offset="394181">The affidavit omits the fact that the earlier entry and what they found.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.661" offset="415811">The warrant issues and the officers remove the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.597" offset="431589">Our position in this case is that whatever the officers find during their illegal entry, whatever they discover, has to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.285" offset="462309">Under the Court's decision in Segura, whatever they find later during the warrant search comes in and may be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.641" offset="491775">The Government contends that nothing should be excluded from evidence, despite the unlawful search, and that is what the Court of Appeals held in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.414" offset="526883">The facts shall summarize as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="100.866" offset="540676">By noon on April 6th, the Wednesday, as I said, in 1983, a joint FBI/DEA investigation was on-going involving a total of about fifteen agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.924" offset="588846">Before 1 p.m. that day, the agents began keeping a warehouse in South Boston under surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.594" offset="619566">They had concluded by that time, and even earlier, that it contained marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.981" offset="641091">The building was located on the corner of First and D Streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.217" offset="658018">It had two garage doors facing First Street and a black steel door facing D Street, the only entrances to the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.372" offset="690723">About 1:45, agents saw a white truck and a green camper pull up, go into the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.494" offset="719145">A few minutes later, the vehicles left, they were followed by some of the agents on the scene, and later stopped; one on the Massachusetts Turnpike, another in Dorchester, both of the vehicles contained marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.670" offset="783824">In the mean time, many of the agents, at least seven, had assembled at a parking lot about one mile from the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.509" offset="815275">The Pier Restaurant parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.045" offset="825411">With them was the Assistant United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.163" offset="837845">The two agents who were in charge of this investigation and a DEA agent named Keaney, an FBI agent named Cleary, were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.786" offset="880372">They saw a green camper pull into the parking lot, arrested its occupant, only to find they had arrested an electrician from New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.474" offset="911092">They looked through the vehicle and there was no marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.410" offset="918825">Petitioners then drove into the parking lot in another vehicle, a blue van, with ladders on top.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.497" offset="951217">They, too, were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.766" offset="956232">The agents looked through their vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.218" offset="966054">Again, no marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.584" offset="975563">Several minutes later, most of the agents, except the two agents in charge, Keaney and Cleary, left the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.442" offset="1014955">They headed for the warehouse and converged there, met there with several other agents, three at least, who were already there, as I said, keeping the warehouse under surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.232" offset="1058110">After walking around the warehouse and announcing, according to Agent Kennedy,</text>
            <text syncTime="234.867" offset="1076709">"DEA/FBI, Open Up. "</text>
            <text syncTime="237.736" offset="1088098">one of the agents took a tire iron from his car, broke open the side steel door and entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.992" offset="1117146">The immediate entry into the warehouse was through a small office.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.044" offset="1133342">They proceeded through the office into a large bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.228" offset="1150061">Four vehicles were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.347" offset="1154554">One of the vehicles, a camper, a Scottsdale camper, had twenty-five bales of marijuana in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.934" offset="1180885">The agents looked under the vehicles, inside vehicles, went around the warehouse, found no one, but also discovered in the course of their tour approximately 270 bales of marijuana strewn around the floor in the far left of the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.944" offset="1244937">After they were in the warehouse, the two agents at the parking lot drove up.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.165" offset="1265835">They also took a tour of the building and one agent, who was outside, an Agent Newton, and had been posted there for security, was allowed to come in and he went inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.472" offset="1307109">I'd like to freeze the frame right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.174" offset="1321842">Stop the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.840" offset="1328529">Because I think what you see, at least so far, is a search, an illegal search, that is at the heart, the core, of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.065" offset="1369489">It's in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.748" offset="1376177">Agents break down the door of a warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.052" offset="1389447">They're searching for smuggled goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.352" offset="1398642">They're accompanied by a court officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.938" offset="1408986">All of that is very familiar American history because that is exactly what the writs of assistance allowed, and James Otis, of course, gave his argument more than 200 years ago, which, according to some people, including John Adams, lit the spark of the American Revolution to stop that and that's why we have the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.786" offset="1496340">The Government's argument in this case is very similar to the Attorney General of England's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.905" offset="1512849">They couldn't get a warrant because if we did, the goods would be removed, and I've set out the Attorney General of England's argument 200 years ago as precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.344" offset="1550570">The fact that the agents had probable cause in this case is also of no moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.998" offset="1573140">In case after case in this century and in this Court, many of which are cited on pages 32 and 33 of our brief, the Court has held</text>
            <text syncTime="368.604" offset="1611592">"although the agents had probable cause, they still have to get a warrant and the fact that they possess it without going to the Magistrate is of no moment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="376.792" offset="1644402">"The magistrate is to interpose his judgment or her judgment between the police and the citizens. "</text>
            <text syncTime="383.463" offset="1671047">"More than that, the warrant confines the ensuing search because it has to be specific. "</text>
            <text syncTime="390.052" offset="1697378">What else happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="392.186" offset="1705946">There was a seizure at that moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.604" offset="1715559">The marijuana that those agents found in that warehouse was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.325" offset="1734472">There are several reasons for that, and this was not an issue in the District Court of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.812" offset="1756415">The Government has raised it in this Court and I'll confront it.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.279" offset="1766341">1.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.014" offset="1769267">Seizure is defined as interference, meaningful interference, with possessory interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.233" offset="1790165">We had ten agents go into a warehouse, break the door down, and then surround the warehouse, as I'll get to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.821" offset="1816497">Their purpose, according to the Government, was to prevent the removal or destruction of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.957" offset="1836977">That is interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.975" offset="1845127">More than that, a statute which I did not cite in the brief but have informed the Government makes it clear that once the agents find contraband, they possess it.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.200" offset="1889953">It's the property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.735" offset="1900088">It's in the custody of the Attorney General of the United States, and they must seize it, with or without court order.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.389" offset="1926733">Let's assume a case where agents believe that there is contraband in a warehouse, they surround the warehouse in order to prevent it from leaving while one of them goes to secure a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.264" offset="2074273">--I think Segura so held, Justice Scalia, and I think it was that basis on which the Court said</text>
            <text syncTime="491.002" offset="2101231">"therefore, there's no difference between securing the property from the outside and going in and staying there nineteen hours. "</text>
            <text syncTime="497.571" offset="2127458">But our proposition is there was a search here, and that that search violated the warrant clause because they broke the door down, and once they got in there, then our position is that the evidence that they find has to be suppressed for three reasons, which I'll get into.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.450" offset="2199034">Number 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.116" offset="2201646">If it's not, then all the incentive is there to conduct a warrantless search before you get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.620" offset="2231634">They had nothing to lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.972" offset="2237068">Number 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.206" offset="2241979">The purpose of the warrant was to confine the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.674" offset="2255876">If anything they discover, whether by pulling drawers open or looking, is suppressed, then the search is confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.113" offset="2289626">Number 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.148" offset="2297777">And I use the Government's argument and this Court's in Segura, when the Government Attorney was asked what is there, what incentive do agents have when they go on premises to leave, and the Government said the incentive is to suppress what they find when they're inside, and if they stay longer, they probably will find something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.360" offset="2374681">So, that gets them out.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.544" offset="2899324">That's what I'm getting to.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.629" offset="2903713">Now, the question is what rule of law does that embody.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.081" offset="2917505">That means if the agents had decided to get a warrant before they went in and violated it under the Government's theory, then all the evidence comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.456" offset="2958988">I think that kind of a law, kind of a rule, under the Fourth Amendment, completely destroys the warrant clause, and here's why.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.562" offset="2995455">First of all, any knowledgeable officer, if the Court so holds, as he's breaking into premises, will suddenly have an on-rush of contemplation, a desire to get a warrant, as he's walking in without one.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.035" offset="3045297">The purpose of the warrant clause is when officers have a desire to search and it was inevitable this warehouse was going to be searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.955" offset="3077061">The question was, was it going to be searched legally or was it going to be searched illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.259" offset="3094198">And the purpose of the warrant clause is to make sure, and the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to make sure, that there's compliance with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.698" offset="3132023">So, if you have a rule, number one, that says whenever you're contemplating and you've already decided to get a warrant, then if you go in without one and violate the Fourth Amendment, there's no consequence, then that seems to me to be completely contrary to the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.429" offset="3318955">One would have to suppose that an agent, as the agent is going into the premises, not knowing for sure what's in there, has the following thoughts going through their mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="864.924" offset="3596898">They're intending to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.776" offset="3604317">We might as well go in right now, and if the... suppose the magistrate doesn't issue the warrant in that situation, regardless of the officer's intent, then what have they lost?</text>
            <text syncTime="876.897" offset="3644754">All that shows is they never had probable cause and couldn't have gotten a warrant and shouldn't be in there anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.368" offset="3662622">More than that, if it's the intent to get a warrant that controls in this case, then they go in, the search is unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.391" offset="3694805">It's not controlled by what the magistrate says you can search for.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.849" offset="3848614">The agents, after they're inside, there's a conference, and they decide... the conference is to go to get a warrant at the courthouse which is a short distance away, and two of them depart and eight hours later, about 10:40 in the evening, a magistrate signs the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.126" offset="3917682">The agents then, who were still at the warehouse guarding it, immediately go back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.161" offset="3933878">They don't even know what the terms of the warrant are.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.280" offset="3942341">They receive a telephone call and that's admitted, the prosecutor so stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.398" offset="3958746">About a half hour later, the warrant arrives and they carry off within the next twenty-four hours the goods that they found.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.236" offset="3986123">The Government in this case, in addition to the notion of inevitable discovery, is now saying that there is no... that there is an independent source.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.693" offset="4031994">There's no connection between the illegal search and the evidence that was sought to be introduced at trial and was, in fact, introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.732" offset="4064072">I've already addressed one of their arguments, one of the reasons is well, it really wasn't seized until the warrant arrived, and I think there's nothing to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.036" offset="4093329">The other argument is, look, if they hadn't searched the warehouse illegally, even if they hadn't done that, they would have searched it legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.309" offset="4126452">That argument, I think, is fallacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.629" offset="4147664">One can say that in every case this Court has ever decided, suppressing evidence when the police have probable cause and didn't get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.818" offset="4184444">The fact is there's only two ways to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.870" offset="4196670">One is with a warrant and one is without.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.805" offset="4208372">One is legally and one is illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.674" offset="4215896">And you cannot base a decision on the following that, well, even if we didn't do it illegally, we would have done it legally, which is essentially what the Government's argument revolves down to, and it's... I'm reminded of this when I was coming here this morning, it's like the warehouse door had a big stop sign on it, and it said "Stop, Fourth Amendment", and the police go through it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.741" offset="4320177">And, then, when that's found out, they said, wait a minute now, we can do this legally, watch, and they come out and this time they stop at the door and get a warrant and go through and duplicate what they did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.732" offset="4372108">Now, that argument wouldn't persuade, I don't think, many police officers, and I hope that the argument will not persuade this Court because that is essentially what the Government's arguing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.167" offset="4893825">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.521" offset="4919321">I'd like to try to make clear at the outset exactly what the Government's position is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.110" offset="4945652">When evidence is seized pursuant to a valid untainted warrant, we submit that the fact that there has been a prior illegal search does not require the suppression of any of the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant, unless there is a causal connection between the illegal search and the seizure of the evidence pursuant to the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.790" offset="5036350">Now, Mr. Randolph disputes our position that there's no causal connection in this case, but it's also important to understand before getting into the merits of that question that Mr. Randolph contends that this evidence, all the evidence seen during the assumed illegal search, must be suppressed whether or not there was any causal connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.473" offset="5123076">If the Petitioners are right, then there's no need to get into the question of causal connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.542" offset="5147318">So, the first question I'd like to address is whether they are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.578" offset="5159543">The Government's position, as I stated it a moment ago, is with one qualification exactly what this Court held three years ago in Segura v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.302" offset="5210430">The one necessary qualification, which has already received some discussion this morning, is that the Court was addressing only part of the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant in Segura.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.610" offset="5255674">Only the evidence that had been present but not seen during the unlawful entry was at issue in Segura.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.216" offset="5290051">The 2nd Circuit had suppressed all of the evidence that was seen during the unlawful entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.786" offset="5316382">The Government had not cross petitioned on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.255" offset="5330175">I would note for the record, however, that we were very careful in our brief in Segura in Footnote 21 to state that our position was that that evidence should not have been suppressed either, even though we did not cross petition on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.979" offset="5381061">Footnote 21 of our brief stated that the independent source and the inevitable discovery documents should apply to the previously-seen evidence just as to the previously-unseen evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.139" offset="5429754">And when Mr. Fry, in his argument in this Court, discussed the distinction between seen and unseen evidence, he was quite careful to say that that was a distinction the Court of Appeals had drawn, not necessarily a distinction the Government was making.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.198" offset="12422002">My only point is they are using this argument to show there's no causal connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.884" offset="12436735">They're using it in their independent source, no causal connection part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.354" offset="12450632">They're not using the argument as I understand it in their inevitable discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.390" offset="12466723">The two are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.590" offset="12471530">Inevitable discovery is really a hypothetical independent source whereas independent source means you've got it somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.428" offset="12498906">So, I find myself being inconsistent because the positions of the Government are inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.649" offset="12519804">I'd like to make two final points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.415" offset="12526805">The arguments that we've heard here today from the Government are not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.803" offset="12548434">Those arguments have been made before in this Court, and they have been made very vigorously in situations that were far more compelling, I would think, than this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.092" offset="12585528">In the National Security Wiretap case and in Katz, the Government argued strenuously that it should be permitted to get after-the-search warrants, that it should be able to search first, get a warrant later, admit the evidence, and the Court rejected, particularly in the U.S. District Court, in the stirring opinion by Justice Powell, rejected that position flat out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.238" offset="12670165">The other point I'd like to make is there really is not very much need to speculate in this case about what would happen if you unleash agents, police, from the warrant requirement, from the constraints of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.498" offset="12731187">One doesn't have to speculate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.834" offset="12848529">Segura rested on the independent source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.069" offset="12857515">The warrant was an independent source for finding things that remained unseen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.223" offset="12878100">Segura did not address the next point, although Justice O'Connor and Chief Justice... I'll give you an example that maybe is the best I can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.361" offset="12906625">If the police had gone into Segura's apartment and there was an individual hiding in a closet, I don't think... a secret room, I don't think one could say that individual had been arrested; that is, seized from the moment they were there and the nineteen hours they remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.488" offset="12971096">Therefore, because they were in there illegally, there was no connection between that individual and police, but when the warrant arrives, they break down the secret room and they find the individual, then I think at that point there is an independent source so long as the warrant itself rested on probable cause before the entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.069" offset="13057509">I think that's the best I can do, but when they find things illegally, when they're in there, then if they're not suppressed, then we're not deterring, we're giving an incentive for illegal entries, we're giving an incentive for searches beyond the scope, and I might add, I might add that even the illegal entry part of the proposition is not necessary under what I'm contending here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.867" offset="13148624">The entry could be legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.717" offset="13156043">For example in the Chimel case, and then the scope of the search is wider, and the Government would still come back and say inevitably we could have gotten a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.159" offset="13193868">The last points I wanted to make, I was leading up to, was the experiences in Colorado and California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.711" offset="13216020">In the majority opinion in the California Supreme Court and in the concurring and dissenting opinion that we cited, this situation, this factual situation came up, and both the majority and the concurring opinion pointed out that they had to put a stop to it because it had become standard police practice to go in before the warrant arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.107" offset="13297626">They stopped it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.476" offset="13303060">California had the same experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.594" offset="13311523">They had initially in one case allowed... accepted the Government's argument here, and what they found after a few years was it had become standard police practice, and I'd also, and this is speculation, I admit, but one has to wonder why suddenly we find case after case after case with this factual situation coming up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.842" offset="13400549">Take a look at the cases that we've cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.227" offset="13410057">There are tons of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.544" offset="13415386">They are coming out of the woodwork now, and there's... I would submit to the Court that the reason is once you allow this to happen, once you allow warrantless illegal searches to be duplicated by a search later and that allows the evidence to come in, then what you will find inevitably, inevitably, is that searches with warrants will be preceded by illegal searches without warrants.</text>
