            <text syncTime="1198.176" offset="4933888">If he simply indicates I do not want counsel, that would not be an indication that he is willing to discuss the case with the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.801" offset="4976416">If he foregoes his right to counsel and in addition indicates a willingness to discuss the case without counsel, the authorities can then proceed to get the waiver through the particular warnings, but if the accused retains his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by not communicating with the authorities a willingness to discuss the case, then he has not abandoned his Sixth Amendment right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.294" offset="5142346">Where should the control over the questioning be placed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.596" offset="5159586">And wherever the control is placed, it indicates the protection that that right to counsel receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.852" offset="5188635">After indictment it should remain, as it was in Edwards, as it was in Jackson, at the discretion of the accused, and if he undertakes to forego his right to rely on Sixth Amendment counsel, then he can be confronted by the police, but until he does so, he retains his right, and that is a right which must be protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.793" offset="9360390">In Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.277" offset="9362271">That's my understanding, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.131" offset="9381706">But... so I think not only do the Miranda warnings convey everything he needs to know at custodial interrogation in order to effectuate a valid waiver, but I think what petitioner's position misses is that Miranda, while it serves the Fifth Amendment, it also impacts on the Sixth Amendment concerns, and I think the Miranda opinion itself recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.217" offset="9502078">In the opinion written by Chief Justice Earl Warren, this Court explained that these warnings are good not just for the privilege against self-incrimination, but they come with residual benefits, and it talked about some of those residual benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.493" offset="9567175">So the Miranda opinion itself is replete with such references to Sixth Amendment concerns as counsel's presence in helping to maintain a fair balance between the state and the individual and making available the advice and good professional judgment of counsel, and referring to the custodial interrogation as an adversarial encounter, so I think petitioner's position sells Miranda short by saying it merely protects Fifth Amendment concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.246" offset="9686189">That may be the purpose of the warning, but even in Miranda this Court noted that the impact was greater than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.351" offset="9722656">I would also like to address what Mr. Honchell does think is the issue today, and that is that no interrogation could take place just by the filing of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.009" offset="9769258">I think that would not be a good result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.778" offset="9776364">It serves a function, as I explained a little bit earlier, in the situation where there is a request for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.551" offset="9807397">Then it is a good rule, because now we know that the defendant has asked to proceed in all encounters with the police only with the help of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.989" offset="9845118">But as I said, our system of justice, criminal justice has a great interest in securing confessions because they make... they are the best evidence of a reliable guilty verdict, so that police should be able to approach a defendant and talk to him about the case with the intention of using his own words against him in this case even after indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.070" offset="9933516">I think it helps the criminal justice system because it means the prosecution can come forward not only with an adequate case or with a good case but with the best case it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.342" offset="9970610">So that rule goes way too far and exacts a cost from the criminal justice system, I think, that is unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.032" offset="10005301">One last point I would like to bring up, I would just like to address, in our brief we raised an alternative ground for affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.019" offset="10037275">Our position is that the statements were volunteered, so that there is no Sixth Amendment right... no Sixth Amendment waiver issue here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.042" offset="10069353">What I would like to say about it is, the response to Mr. Honchell's argument in the reply brief that that issue is waived, in support of his argument, he points out that that issue is not contained in the opinion of the appellate court or the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.567" offset="10131420">Well, as far as that goes, he is correct, but I still think it is disingenuous for him to raise the issue, since the state's brief raised this argument on direct appeal, and Mr. Honchell was counsel for defendant on direct appeal, and he responded to that argument in his reply brief on Page 2, and on Pages 6 through 7 he argued his response and that the appellate court just didn't address the issue because they affirmed on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.302" offset="10234447">We again re-raised that issue in the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.987" offset="10245105">Again it was not resolved because the issue was affirmed... the case was affirmed on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.907" offset="10268824">So we have preserved that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.092" offset="10277601">Therefore, Your Honors, we ask this Court to affirm the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.247" offset="10418140">The test that this Court has announced several times in evaluating the knowing standard of a waiver, whether the suspect knew the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.823" offset="10472475">Taking the first part of that test, Miranda warnings expressly convey to petitioner the substance of his Sixth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.013" offset="10501209">They told him that he had a right to the assistance of counsel at the interrogation, and we think that is the right itself, and it is hard to argue that the warnings do not convey that knowledge of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.321" offset="10550528">The Miranda warnings also inform petitioner the consequences of his decision to waive that right, first, that he would not have the assistance of a lawyer in deciding whether to speak or to stand on his right to remain silent, and second, that if he chose to respond to the questions that he would run the risk that his uncounselled answered would create incriminating evidence that could be introduced against him at trial, and we think again that is the consequence of the decision--</text>
