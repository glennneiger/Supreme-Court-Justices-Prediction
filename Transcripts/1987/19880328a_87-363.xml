            <text syncTime="20.478" offset="217384">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the process of deregulation under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.685" offset="254268">That Act divides natural gas into a number of categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.404" offset="273181">Those categories overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.439" offset="281227">Some of the categories are subject to price ceilings.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.558" offset="293766">Some are now deregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.910" offset="303170">Producers have gone to the agencies that handle the qualification of gas for sale in particular categories, and have obtained qualifications for some gas in both the regulated and deregulated category.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.901" offset="355101">The principal question in this case is how such gas should be treated for purposes of determining the price at which it may lawfully be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.156" offset="388120">The Commission concluded that such so-called dual qualified gas should be treated as deregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.910" offset="415183">We are here asking this Court to uphold the Commission's view of the statute, and to uphold a second Commission ruling which gave rise to the second question in this case and which I plan to discuss at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.368" offset="460949">In considering how this case arose it is useful to have in mind one very common type of gas sale contract that producers entered into in the mid to late 1970s and early 1980s.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.926" offset="511209">Those contracts were for long terms, 20 years or more, and they expressly anticipated the coming deregulation in 1985 and 1987 of the most important of the categories of natural gas under the NGPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.019" offset="567633">The contracts provided that until deregulation occurred the gas would be sold at the highest applicable ceiling price set by law or Commission order, and when deregulation occurred, either the price would be renegotiated or it would be determined by reference to some market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.747" offset="642552">To ensure the highest possible ceiling price during regulation while providing in advance for a change in pricing upon deregulation, producers obtained qualifications for particular quantities of gas in several different categories under the NGPA, some of which would be deregulated in a few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.810" offset="718726">Gas at the time was in very short supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.012" offset="731578">Market prices were high, and it looked like prices were going to continue to rise into the indefinite future.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.583" offset="753834">Producers included the deregulation clause in their contracts in the expectation that when deregulation occurred they would obtain higher prices under those clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.872" offset="795003">As the May 1985 deregulation date approached, market prices had dropped drastically and were now well below ceiling prices in some of the alternative categories for which producers have qualified their gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.616" offset="845994">Many producers therefore sought to escape deregulation clauses in their contracts by trying to prevent their gas from becoming deregulated and having it treated under one of the still regulated categories for which it had been qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.856" offset="898970">The Commission in late 1984 proposed and issued a rule that rejected this effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.660" offset="922167">The rule stated, when gas has been qualified in the deregulated category, it must be treated as deregulated, even if it also happened to be qualified for a still regulated category.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.087" offset="975875">On review, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Commission had misconstrued the NGPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.574" offset="997818">It declared a different rule for how to treat gas that falls into a regulated-deregulated overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.811" offset="1022791">The Court of Appeals rule says look at individual producers' contract prices and let the producers choose the category under the contracts that actually results in the highest price.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.368" offset="1068975">This means that two producers with precisely the same overlap of pricing categories can be subject to different legal treatment depending on what prices they happen to include in their contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.741" offset="1114428">What is more, the producers can make the change of status daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.878" offset="1131042">Depending on market conditions, they can move the gas back and forth between regulated and deregulated status whenever the deregulated price exceeds the regulated price.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.484" offset="1173465">We think the Commission's view is much the better reading of the NGPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.722" offset="1190392">It is a better interpretation of the relevant statutory language and more in accord with the overall NGPA scheme of phased-in deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.010" offset="1227591">First, Section 101(b)(5) of the Act, which addresses the general question of how to treat gas that is qualified in two categories, says that if more than one of the NGPA pricing provisions applies,</text>
            <text syncTime="286.753" offset="1282552">"the provision which could result in the highest price shall be applicable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="291.622" offset="1301988">That language does not, as the Court of Appeals thought, refer to particular producers or to their contract prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.478" offset="1337410">It requires a determination of which of several statutory ceiling prices is the highest.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.898" offset="1363114">The provision with the highest ceiling price is the one that "could result" in the highest price, and of course if one provision says that there is no ceiling price, that is the provision that could result in the highest price, and so the gas must be treated under that provision, that is, it is deregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.759" offset="1434585">That Section 101(b)(5) should be read as concerned only with ceiling prices and not with particular contract prices is also supported by the approach taken to price regulation by the NGPA as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.853" offset="1498951">The NGPA only sets ceilings, and in fact it expressly provides that the Act is concerned with producers' contract prices only to the extent of ensuring that they are below any statutory ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.862" offset="1550987">In addition, the contracts like the ones I described at the outset show that it is the law that was meant to determine when gas is deregulated under produers' contracts, not the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.420" offset="1601246">It is not the contracts that determine when the gas is deregulated under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.490" offset="1621517">One clause of those contracts says, if the gas is regulated, a specified price, often the legal maximum, will apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.180" offset="1656208">Another clause says, if the gas is deregulated the price is determined by renegotiation or some market reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.834" offset="1686824">The contracts look to some external action by law or regulation to determine which of those clauses applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.622" offset="1722037">In fact, there would be a serious circularity if the statute required reference to the contracts, which then required reference back to the statute, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.295" offset="1756727">The Court of Appeals' view would also transform the statute from one that set ceilings to one that established price floors.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.817" offset="1790791">Ceiling prices set for a regulated category could always be charged by producers, even if market prices were lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.673" offset="1826213">That turns the statute upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.209" offset="1836348">There is not the slightest indication that Congress believed that the problem with the market was that deregulated prices were too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.962" offset="1867382">Indeed, the very nature of a price ceiling is that it is intended to hold prices down.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.516" offset="1889534">That view is confirmed by Congress's overall plan in the NGPA for phased-in deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.705" offset="1918373">Congress did not intend to create a scheme of ever-increasing producer price subsidies, with the producers always having the option to select a higher regulated price even when market conditions did not justify such a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.382" offset="1981067">Rather, Congress intended that a market mechanism with all of its natural consequences would be introduced for the determination of prices and levels of production of the designated kinds of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.289" offset="2032685">Again, the NGPA as a ceiling price statute is not a producer subsidy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.843" offset="2054837">The Commission's view is further confirmed by evidence that Congress intended--</text>

            <text syncTime="757.570" offset="3165772">That's why we stress so much the words</text>

            <text syncTime="762.624" offset="3186043">To read the "could result" language here as referring to the highest price set in a particular producer's contract would really make this provision an anomaly in a statute that otherwise is not concerned at all with contract prices but simply says you may charge no more than a certain level.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.221" offset="3264410">We think the language</text>
            <text syncTime="786.506" offset="3281547">is an explicit reference to a ceiling price.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.958" offset="3295339">Congress, as I had suggested, had no intent to allow producers to opt out of deregulation and return gas to regulated status.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.051" offset="3347689">when market conditions did not prop up prices to the level set in the statute for particular categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.955" offset="3371304">Congress intended a one-way transition to deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.324" offset="3384783">That basic design of the statute which generally deregulates new gas indicates that Congress intended market forces to apply to an ever-increasing proportion of the market as old gas was generally depleted and a higher and higher proportion of the gas available in the market became new gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.718" offset="3458344">And finally, the possibility that deregulated gas would come back under regulation is one that Congress did address in Section 122 of the Act, and it provided there precisely one mechanism for a return of regulated status, action by Congress or the President one time, and only temporarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.366" offset="3537024">Congress did not envision daily returns of regulated status... to regulate status at producers' option into the indefinite future.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.972" offset="3575372">Finally, let me say a word about the second question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.840" offset="3590837">Section 107(c)(5) of the Natural Gas Policy Act allows the Commission to define categories of gas that would get special production incentive pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.099" offset="3647888">The Commission defined a category called new type formation gas, and said that in order to be qualified in that category gas must first be determined to meet the qualifications under Section 102 or 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.193" offset="3704312">That definition is not challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.328" offset="3716851">What is challenged is the Commission's subsequent declaration that state and federal agencies when they granted a qualification as new type formation gas must be treated as simultaneously having granted the qualification under Sections 102 or 103, which they had to determine to be applicable in order to grant the new type formation status.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.176" offset="3808175">This ruling, which means deregulation of the gas is a reasonable exercise of the Commission's power, including most notably its power of definition under Section 107(c)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="929.901" offset="3855091">It imposes no additional burden on the state and federal agencies that handle the qualification process.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.138" offset="3880064">It merely implements the unchallenged definition, and it sensibly declares that the special production incentive pricing should not be available for a category of gas whose production levels can be set by the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.052" offset="5107715">You were wondering why people would buy high-priced gas, and the answer is a contractual one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.475" offset="5145436">These contracts not only provide for pricing, but they also provide for take or pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.181" offset="5180231">In other words, if you are fortunate enough to have... to be a producer with a high priced contract, you also have with that contract an obligation for the customer to take 85 percent, 90 percent, some cases even 100 percent of the maximum deliverability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.427" offset="5269256">So while given their choice obviously pipelines would take the lower cost gas, they are not given their choice in all too many cases, and that's the point on high priced gas versus low priced gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.706" offset="5638314">Justice Stevens, we do rely on Section 121 as well as 101(b)(5), which we think are consistent with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.418" offset="5709158">We do think, and the Commission said this, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.969" offset="5727444">It's not just something we are dreaming up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.671" offset="5734236">We do think that Section 121 of the Act in and of itself makes clear that what is involved in the deregulation process is the removal of all price controls from the specific types of gas which are deregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.318" offset="5816783">Certainly that's what Congress thought that language meant, because if you look at the conference agreement explaining what 121 of the Act means, what they say, and I'm reading from Page 92 of the conference agreement, they say the conference agreement provides for the elimination of federal price controls for certain categories of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.069" offset="5927751">Thus the agreement... that's the statute... deregulates those categories for ceiling price purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.193" offset="5968293">In other words, as we believe and have argued, the language of 121 also makes clear what was being deregulated were categories of gas, and what that deregulation did was to make inapplicable the price control provisions of Title 1, and that is, of course, the ceiling price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.610" offset="6078007">So we believe that the Commission was clearly correct in its interpretation of Section 121 and that that is an additional reason supporting the Commission's interpretation of 101(b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.424" offset="6165256">They are consistent, and they are both at least as good a construction of those two sections as the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.152" offset="6232130">On the contrary, it said it was a rational position, but then said it was overruled by their construction of 121... I mean, 101(b)(5).</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.261" offset="6404538">As I said, the court position is entirely based on the fact that the Commission's construction of 101(b)(5) can't be right, and the reasons the Court of Appeals judge gave for her views are set out essentially on Page 16 of the Joint Appendix, 16A of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.932" offset="6527209">And what you see she is saying there is, she says the deregulated price is theoretical, and while it could be higher, there are all sorts of provisions for raising the other ceiling prices, and therefore maybe they could be higher at some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.060" offset="6603800">But the answer to that is the X plus one rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.297" offset="6620727">Whatever price a ceiling is raised to, the absence of a ceiling allows you to set a price one cent or more higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.670" offset="6662210">And therefore her argument as to... on Page 16 as to why the Commission's position can't be right is in our view clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.596" offset="6721873">What is more, she talks about the price of regulated gas could be higher than the price of deregulated gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.869" offset="6754997">That, of course, is true under the contract, and that is what this whole case is about, but while the price of regulated gas under a contract can be higher under certain circumstances than the price of deregulated gas under a contract, the statute says that the applicable provision of the Act, either this regulated price or a nonregulated price, is what could lead to the higher price, and the Commission is obviously right that what could lead to the higher price is the absence of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.862" offset="6914970">It may not lead to a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.929" offset="6923225">What this case is all about is, faced with this statute, a number of producers and pipelines agreed to contracts which said, in the event of deregulation the price shall be X, usually they said, immediately on deregulation it will stay the same as it was but it shall be subject to bilateral renegotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.413" offset="7029178">The thought at the time, the producers thought at the time that bilateral renegotiation would raise the price above what it was, but the pipelines insist that if you are going to get this right, make it bilateral so that if the situation--</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Davidson</label>
            <text syncTime="1902.424" offset="7745246">That's absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.193" offset="7752247">That doesn't change the fact that prices negotiated into that contract are by any definition when negotiated actual market prices and they are continued as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.399" offset="7793103">As FERC itself was at pains to point out in Note 3 of its reply brief, market price merely means the price a particular purchaser can obtain... a particular producer can obtain from a particular purchaser at a particular moment, and there could conceivably be as many market prices as there are producer-purchaser transactions, and that is certainly the case and certainly would be the case for a commodity like gas, which is historically priced pursuant to such long-term contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.353" offset="7920894">In discussing these particular issues, let me start with the undisputable propositions that in the NGPA Congress established different categories of gas and set different ceiling prices for the various categories, and further, that against that regulatory framework producers and pipelines then negotiated different pricing provisions for the different NGPA categories, one example of which Mr. Taranto gave in his remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.222" offset="8040430">For example, high cost, high risk Section 107(c)(5) gas may be priced according to, say, Paragraph 5(A) of the contract, whereas general new 102 gas may be priced according to Section 5(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.566" offset="8101766">Categorizing gas as high cost and risk Section 107 gas means only that the parties themselves price the amount of that gas priced during the prior month according to Paragraph 5(A) of their contract rather than Paragraph 5(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.928" offset="8171251">There is no other regulatory consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.914" offset="8187134">In every respect relevant to this case the NGPA is merely a price ceiling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.168" offset="8216182">Saying that gas is "regulated" means only that it is subject to a ceiling price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.489" offset="8237498">It involves no certificates or filings or hearings or administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.709" offset="8258396">So the fact that a gas is regulated or deregulated changes from one such category to another involves no regulatory burden on FERC or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.851" offset="8310954">It means only that the parties to a private contract themselves refer back to that contract to determine how that quantity of gas should be priced according to the particular contract provision that they have agreed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.008" offset="8363512">The whole reason for Section 101(b)(5) being in the statute is that Congress knew the gas could be qualified in more than one such category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.982" offset="8407398">With respect to the particular kinds of gas which are really at issue in this case, high cost, high risk, section 107(c)(5) gas, and low production Section 108 stripper wells, gas of that type is virtually always, if not always at least qualifiable in one of the more generic NGPA categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.831" offset="8498827">It is either old or new gas, offshore or onshore, interstate or intrastate, in addition to having those special attributes which also make it qualifiable for Section 107(c)(5) or Section 108.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.607" offset="8561939">Now, despite the inevitably of such dual qualification for such gas, Congress provided in the NGPA that high cost and risk Section 107(c)(5) gas and stripper well 108 gas were entitled to higher ceiling prices, thus leaving producers free to try to negotiate higher prices for that kind of gas than they could obtain for the more generic kinds of gas that were subject to lower NGPA ceilings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.440" offset="8677295">Now, where the producers were successful, such as in the case of my client, Martin Exploration, which entered into a long-term contract with the petitioner, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, the price it negotiated for its high cost and risk gas is higher than the price for its more generic kinds of gas, but then it was always intended that that price be higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.806" offset="8770709">These were prices negotiated under higher ceilings that Congress expressly labeled as incentive prices, designed to call out additional gas production on the margin, and in reliance on those higher prices which Martin negotiated in its contract with Panhandle, it went out and drilled and explored for this high cost and risk gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.738" offset="8866422">For Martin to now receive those higher incentive prices for that category of incentive gas is in no manner an unanticipated windfall, a producer assistance policy outside the parameters of Congressional debate, or any of the other labels that the petitioners have fashioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.670" offset="11834246">With that general background, I'd like to address what we do believe to be the central legal issue in the case, which is just that Order 406 is inconsistent with the language of Section 101(b)(5) of the statute as well as the conference committee materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.881" offset="11911046">Our position is that Order 406 is inconsistent with the plain meaning of Section 101(b)(5).</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.641" offset="12074050">They just have to establish a meaning that's in the ballpark, that justifies FERC in interpreting it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.259" offset="12092544">Assuming that the Congressional intent can also not be determined from the legislative history, but we believe that the language, the interpretation which FERC has adopted is inconsistent not only with the language, but also with the materials in the conference report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.453" offset="12149282">Our plain meaning argument is simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.637" offset="12162030">The plain meaning of language is the meaning one first and naturally attaches to it when one sees it or hears it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.391" offset="12189093">As the unanimous Court of Appeals held, the plain and ordinary meaning of the relevant language of Section 101(b)(5) that if any natural gas qualifies under more than one provision, the provision which could result in the highest price is, the producer gets the highest price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.770" offset="12254608">Moreover, if that was the thought that one wanted to convey, this is how you would write it, or perhaps something very close to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.192" offset="12288254">If on the other hand the thought one wanted to convey was that if gas qualified for at least one NGPA category, which is deregulated, it shall be deemed deregulated, this probably isn't the way that you'd write it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.451" offset="12349276">And that in a nutshell is our plain meaning argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.903" offset="12363173">Now, FERC has a different problem, and that is illustrated no better than on Page 2 of its opening brief, where Section 101(b)(5) and Order 406 are laid out right next to each other for easy comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.080" offset="12423881">The fact is that when you just read these two sentences, the interpretation that FERC is adopted in Rule 406 just doesn't leap out at you in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.888" offset="12467036">Indeed, when you read those two sentences, they just seem inconsistent, and for that reason FERC's plain meaning argument is different in character than respondent's, and oddly enough, for an argument of this type, it keeps changing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.516" offset="12537566">FERC has suggested at least three plain under-standings of this statute in the course of these proceedings, and of course we know that Mr. Solomon has advanced yet another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.990" offset="12583437">In its current iteration, FERC's argument about the language of Section 101(b)(5) goes on for almost seven full pages, parses through that one sentence in great detail, several individual words and phrases are expanded into full explanatory paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.885" offset="12655013">There are references to other NGPA provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.987" offset="12667447">There are references to FERC's view of the overall structure and approach of the statute, and even to bits of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.907" offset="12699108">That argument gets so complex and involved that whatever else one wants to say about it, it just isn't a plain meaning argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.715" offset="12738396">The natural reading of this statute is the one that the Court of Appeals adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.067" offset="12755741">Moreover, the Court of Appeals' pleading of the statute is supported by the conference committee materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.840" offset="12782908">First, the House conferees stated when discussing Section 101(b)(5) in their explanation statement that a producer was entitled, to qualify his gas in whatever NGPA category which yielded the highest price to him, which necessarily requires the producer to go back to his contract to see which NGPA category accomplishes that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.840" offset="12890846">Now, there is no logic in then coming along later and telling the producer, forget about the relative price levels in your actual contract that you looked at originally because what you... the way you are really going to be paid is according to the abstract notion of whether or not the NGPA category has a price ceiling, and if it does, which price ceiling is higher, as the government argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.670" offset="12978200">Mr. Davidson, if we think that the language in the statute is capable of being read as the government would have us read it, do you then lose because of the difference that is owed to the agency interpretation?</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.282" offset="13044655">--First of all, this is not an agency deference case in our view because the intent of Congress can be determined not only from the language but also in addition from the conference materials, one of which example I just gave and another key one which I will come to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.344" offset="13120933">But moreover, it is not an agency... the government doesn't even win on an agency deference standard because it is not a permissible reading of the statute and does not satisfy certain purposes of Congress when it passed the NGPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.538" offset="13185717">For example, the purposes that these special categories of incentive priced gas were entitled to incentive prices pursuant to Sections 107(c)(5) and Section 108.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.596" offset="13233886">Similarly, FERC's order has the practical effect of depriving the producers of actual contract prices they negotiated in their contracts, and that is certainly inconsistent with at least the spirit of Section 101(b)(9), which says that nothing in the NGPA's maximum lawful price provisions or a ceiling price or deregulation should operate to nullify or supersede a contract price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.997" offset="13339526">The second piece of the legislative history which we think is key is the conference report itself, which is intended to be the definitive explanatory statement of the NGPA, and was probably crafted as carefully as the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.840" offset="13402846">Page 83 of the conference report states that upon deregulation, wells qualified in both the Section 108 stripper well category as well as the Section 105 intrastate category, gas from those kinds of wells could be sold under the regulated provisions or Section 108 rather than taking deregulated treatment as Section 105 gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.776" offset="13514650">Now, FERC has tried to avoid this part of the conference report by arguing that it was addressed to a particular question not directly involved in this case, and in its reply brief by trying to make the whole thing look as complicated as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.184" offset="13572224">I think the simplest response to FERC's argument is that the nature and complexity of the question addressed on Page 83 of the conference report really doesn't matter here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.575" offset="13613811">Whatever the question was, the answer that the conference report gave says clearly, and clearly expresses the understanding that dually qualified 108 and 105 gas could be sold as regulated 108 stripper gas as opposed to deregulated intrastate Section 105 gas, and FERC's order does exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.042" offset="13715689">FERC's order mandates that gas which is so duly qualified must be sold as deregulated Section 105 gas rather than as regulated Section 108 gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.103" offset="13987885">The fact is, they have not done that and have no proper record for doing that as they themselves... as FERC itself conceded in Order 459, issued not just four months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.391" offset="14033129">In that order, FERC expressly refused to rescind or modify its original Order 99, which defined what high cost and risk gas was, and said that it met the Congressional standard for being produced under such conditions of extraordinary risks or costs that it was entitled to the Congressional incentive prices that Congress imagined... envisioned in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.526" offset="14129573">For FERC to now argue in light of that order that it has in effect done that redefinition, after just refusing to do that in December, and the reason that it gave in December was that it did not even at that point have a proper record on which to base such a determination, for them to now argue that it is in effect accomplishing that same result merely highlights the improper nature of and lack of support for that part of Order 406.</text>

            <text syncTime="3564.051" offset="14391738">If I could just make one point, the problem in this case arises solely because producers contracted to renegotiate upon deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.209" offset="14440326">If they had set a fixed price for a particular quantity of gas regardless of whether it was regulated or deregulated, then this case would not have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.132" offset="14480032">The producers here have argued that there is a statutory glitch that entitles them to opt out of those deregulation clauses and collect higher prices under the regulatory ceilings our position, simply stated, is that there is no glitch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.724" offset="14542412">Producers must live by the deregulation clauses and take the lower prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.878" offset="14562997">Thank you.</text>
