            <text syncTime="537.417" offset="2286039">Now, before the decision below, the first, second, seventh and ninth circuits had recognized that agreements under the Railway Labor Act may expire in accordance with their terms, but that because of Section 6, the conditions established by those agreements nevertheless continue during the status quo period during which negotiations are carried on for the purpose of trying to reach a new agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.247" offset="2405366">With specific relevance to the question in this case, the Second Circuit, in the Manning case, held that a dues checkoff agreement may expire in accordance with its agreed termination date, but is then continued for the limited status quo period, even though the carrier had not proposed to change it but merely to let it expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.814" offset="2495646">The proposal of the union in that case to include a dues checkoff provision in the new agreement would not seem any different from what the parties here intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.893" offset="4155988">Every other Court which has construed a similar contract, which has construed the contract, without the baggage of its interpretation of the Railway Labor Act, have held that this kind of a contract provides for the non-renewal and the termination of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.746" offset="4231430">So the only way that the Eight Circuit reads the contrary result... and they said specifically, we will not follow the rationale of Reeve Aleutian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.722" offset="4275316">The practical effect of the Court's decision offends all reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.692" offset="4327143">What the Court has done is to say that after an agree contract term has ended, if a union insists upon striking to attain its new contract objectives, and the employer decides to maintain its operations by recruiting and employing permanent replacements, the employer must induce the replacements to come through the union's picket line to work in order to defeat the strike, and in the same breath, tell those permanent replacements and crossovers that they must pay initiation fees to the union... not only dues, but initiation fees... to the same union which is conducting the picket line so that the union will have the funds to continue the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.126" offset="4540929">That is the effect of the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.229" offset="4553363">In the many cases in which this Court has defined the scope of Section 211, and parallel provisions of the NLRA, it has never suggested that without a current agreement, and in the self-help period, 211 permits such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.937" offset="4664122">Nor do I think it needs much argument to establish that if the Unions had asked Congress to pass a law in those words to achieve that objective, that they could have attracted much support.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.157" offset="8125033">This is, I believe, the case the Court envisioned 22 years ago in FEC when the Court said that it would make a sham of the bargaining and mediation processes of the Act if the carrier could unilaterally achieve what the Act requires be done by the other orderly procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.820" offset="8199744">And TWA has barely mentioned the rationale of the FEC Court in its brief, and with good reasons, because that rationale really has nothing whatsoever to do with duration clauses in contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.789" offset="8247600">The Court talks about the spirit of the ACT.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.493" offset="8258362">And I think we have to ask and answer the question today of what is the spirit of the Act the Court was talking about in FEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.516" offset="8282499">TWA claims that spirit is that existing agreements be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.580" offset="8298695">But that has nothing to do with the rationale of FEC which talks about the community of carrier and employees which is only interrupted by a strike, which talks about a reversion to the jungle if the carrier may use the occasion of a strike to tear up the entire contract, which talks about a carrier using a dispute over limited issues to make sweeping changes that the carrier did not bring to the bargaining table, and which talks about providing the carrier an incentive to provoke or prolong a strike so that it may break the union and simply annul the entire collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.460" offset="8430248">They key word is "incentive".</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.244" offset="8441428">The purpose of the RLA, which flows directly from Section 1, is to promote bargaining to the fullest extent possible so as to avoid self help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.292" offset="8481553">And what violated the spirit of the Act in FEC was the carrier's interpretation of the ACT, which would have given the carrier a substantial incentive to engage in self help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.148" offset="8525020">We have these elaborate processes, what the Court has described as machinery, designed to adjust disputes and avoid self help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.707" offset="8567234">But if the carrier can so easily side step that elaborate machinery merely by submitting some changes to the processes of the Act while hiding others until self help, then those procedures are indeed a shambles.</text>

            <text syncTime="2387.047" offset="9684648">There is no agreement requiring TWA to eliminate the union security provisions or the grievance procedure or make any of the other changes that it made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.945" offset="9724250">So that leaves us with the question of what changes may be made in the manner prescribed in Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.981" offset="9752357">And Section 6 requires that carriers and unions give notice of their intended changes and agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.975" offset="9776286">So when you may make changes in the manner prescribed by Section 6, is that any change or is that just the changes of which you gave notice?</text>

            <text syncTime="2426.506" offset="9842428">We should then perhaps focus a little more closely on the language of Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.860" offset="9863848">Section 6 says three times in the space of a single paragraph, it uses the phrase "intended changes or intended change".</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.875" offset="9895926">A carrier and union must give 30 days' notice of intended changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.267" offset="9909510">If the services of the NMB are invoked, no changes may be made until the NMB has finally acted upon the quote "controversy" close quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.254" offset="9941484">What is the controversy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.994" offset="9948380">I think obviously the controversy is the changes intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.828" offset="9967711">So when a carrier may make those changes of which it has to give 30 days' notice, what changes are those?</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.282" offset="9993520">The only logical conclusion it seems to me is that they are the changes which were the subject of the controversy, the changes which were acted upon by the NMB, the changes which were the subject of the Section 6 notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.002" offset="10040436">Any other conclusion would simply completely eviscerate the meaning of the words "intended change".</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.605" offset="10066872">And as to the contract itself, it provides that it renews itself indefinitely without change unless you give notice of specified intended changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.601" offset="10102816">And again, as with its construction of Section 6, as with its construction of Section 7, TWA contends that what was intended was that notice of specified intended changes would be a signal that the carrier could do anything it wanted during self help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.102" offset="10164883">There is just nothing in the Act, or in the contract, I believe, that allows, much less requires, such an interpretation, so at odds with the Act's primary objective, which is the prevention of strikes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2534.352" offset="10273866">The position espoused by TWA would make those procedures optional for carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.356" offset="10297899">It would allow, as the District Court said, the carrier to opt out of the bargaining process and submit only selective changes or perhaps no changes, if the Union had submitted some, knowing that there are no limitations once self help begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.995" offset="10352442">Moreover, it is absurd to contend that the result below has somehow deprived TWA of its right to engage in self help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.750" offset="10383371">TWA has engaged and is engaging in massive self help.</text>

            <text syncTime="2587.968" offset="10488279">And all that is at issue today is whether TWA may unilaterally implement that which it never proposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.776" offset="13339492">It accepted a distinction of FED which its own District Court said was not clear and which has nothing to do with the rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.731" offset="13367391">It says that the Act is concerned with changes in agreements, when the Act in Section 2 Seventh and in the FEC Opinion, clearly we are concerned with unilateral changes, where there is no agreement to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.759" offset="13415456">And Reeve gave us the anomalous result that a carrier that proposed no changes in bargaining could make any change it wished during self help.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.640" offset="13687025">Thank you, Mr. Fehr.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.530" offset="13694548">Your time has expired.</text>

            <label>Mr. Murray Gartner</label>
            <text syncTime="3393.283" offset="13709595">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.384" offset="13717954">I wish I had more time to respond to many issues, but I know I do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.908" offset="13736031">One issue I would like to deal with immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.301" offset="13749615">I have heard this and the Court has seen it so many times in the Respondent's brief, that TWA was under an obligation to negotiate about and to deal with the changes it intended to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.710" offset="13803218">TWA did not intend to make a change in the union security clause in the new agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.775" offset="13827564">And that is all that the Railway Labor Act requires it to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.216" offset="13845327">The Railway Labor Act says you shall tell the other party for the purpose of negotiation what changes you want in the new agreement... not what changes you want during the self help period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.955" offset="13888273">The self help period is uncontrolled by the statute and this Court has said so many times, but most recently in the Burlington Northern case that the self-help period is not dealt with by the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.115" offset="13932890">Now, to a few other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.325" offset="13941771">Counsel says that there was a request for a declaration in the complaint below with respect to the expiration of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.926" offset="14004152">The prayers for relief in both with respect to the plaintiff and the defendant appear on Page 94 and 107 of the Petition for Certiorari and they very clearly limit themselves to a request for a declaration that the union security clause and related provisions have expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.540" offset="14102581">That's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.012" offset="14104462">That is the request for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.215" offset="14113239">Counsel says that the framing of the issues by the Court below did not even mention the union security clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.392" offset="14166006">If the Court looks at 1(A) to the appendix to the Petition for Certiorari, the very first sentence by Judge Bright in his Opinion is:</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.470" offset="14214281">"The question presented in this case is whether the union security induced checkoff provisions contained in Article 24(AL) of the 1983 Collective Bargaining Agreement between TWA and the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants are now in effect and should be enforced. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.561" offset="14278646">That is the Court's statement of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.133" offset="14288991">And counsel says that in framing the issue the Court did not even mention union security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.396" offset="14309993">The FEC case, I think, has been dealt with adequately in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.720" offset="14335280">I have no problem with Justice White's dissent.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="3552.583" offset="14346774">It wouldn't make any difference if you did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.853" offset="14355864">It was a dissent.</text>

            <label>Mr. Murray Gartner</label>
            <text syncTime="3555.704" offset="14359208">But it was also pointing out that the majority was dealing with a contract which everybody acknowledge was effect which was in effect at the time.</text>
