            <text syncTime="282.095" offset="1255357">It is a balancing approach, and I believe that the Court in any acts of misconduct, even under the balanced approach that is suggested in Hastings, and under the supervisory authority, must determine first whether or not that kind of misconduct is deliberate, whether or not it is pervasive, and the importance of pervasiveness, Justice Scalia, is whether or not that kind of misconduct is likely to recur, whether or not that kind of misconduct is substantially influential.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.017" offset="1387118">And, third, whether or not that misconduct is directed at the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.744" offset="1418047">For example, in United States v.

            <text syncTime="903.762" offset="3742109">The problem you have in the grand jury context is that the probable cause standard is very low compared to the burden of proof in a criminal trial, so that prosecutors know, and the record in this case shows that they know, that it is virtually impossible to establish that the grand jury's decision was substantially influenced by any errors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.581" offset="6885372">The general principle in this Court's harmless error cases is that you don't reverse a criminal conviction, or dismiss an indictment in the absence of a showing of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.176" offset="6927690">And the question in this case is whether or not that general principle is applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.630" offset="6949528">Now, the Petitioners are contending that this case is a case which fits into that small class of cases in which the Court had said the dismissal is appropriate without a specific showing of prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.154" offset="8747589">The prosecutor sent Mendrop back to double check this, find out what he could find by way of corroboration of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.628" offset="8777577">Then at Joint Appendix 189-190 Mendrop explained to the grand jury there was this visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.743" offset="8805998">Waters, who didn't testify, but who was questioned by Mendrop, Waters said it was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.119" offset="8839540">The chauffeur said it was true, the chauffeur for Kilpatrick, and, in fact, Kilpatrick had himself said it was true when he told Waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.715" offset="8877887">And, in fact, Waters later testifies at the obstruction trial against Kilpatrick that Kilpatrick did, in fact, say that Smith visited him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2218.624" offset="9001499">And, secondly, he said the grand jury was never informed of these mischaracterizations, or of any alternative basis for Mendrop's summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.060" offset="9031278">So you are saying that those findings are clearly erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2229.393" offset="9044549">Well, the second is absolutely clearly erroneous because Mendrop simply said the chauffeur said this was true, and in relating what Waters had said, he said that Waters had said that Kilpatrick had said that the visit had occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="2246.423" offset="9112676">I am sure you are representing the record correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.883" offset="9118527">But do you think as we sit here, should we go behind the District Court's findings to dispose of this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="2252.839" offset="9138380">I don't think you have to because the Court of Appeals said... while the Court of Appeals did not resolve the question as to whether this had... the source of Mendrop's evidence was misleading... in other words, the Court of Appeals did not look behind the District Court's finding that the grand jury was misled as to whether Mendrop's evidence came from prior evidence presented to the grand jury, or from his own investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.444" offset="9232839">But what the Court of Appeals did say, and this is it Pet App, I think, 822, No. 12, was that there was no perjured testimony inadvertent or knowing presented to this grand jury, and that was enough to persuade the Court of Appeals that a) there was nothing that would justify dismissal in this case under the Costello rule; and b) that there was no unfair misleading of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.613" offset="9353525">Now, it may be that the Court of Appeals should have gone ahead and resolved the question, which we asked them to resolve, as to whether, in fact, the District Court was simply flat wrong as to its characterization of the events dealing with that visit, but that wasn't necessary for the Court of Appeals, and we don't think it's necessary for this Court to resolve the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.547" offset="9429176">I think that point, once you find... at least once you find that there is no intentional perjured testimony, or even unintentional perjured testimony as the Court of Appeals found, that resolves the case under Costello, resolves that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.546" offset="9489257">Now, the very few situations in which this Court has said that there is no need for specific proof of harmless error are those situations... excuse me, of prejudicial error... are those situations in which, as the Court has said, there is a fundamental error, one, that undermines confidence in the whole proceeding, or as the Court said in Rose v. Clark, necessarily renders the trial fundamentally unfair, or an error that renders the... that means that the criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.875" offset="9658531">Those errors include, and are in the main limited to errors such as complete lack of counsel at trial, bias on the part of the judge of the fact finder, bias on the part of the prosecutor, discrimination in the selection of grand jurors, or petty jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.646" offset="9733659">This case is simply not in that class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.489" offset="9749019">This is a case which if you look at these errors in terms of what effect they would have at trial, you would look at the trial and say</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.464" offset="9784859">"these errors can be assessed for their prejudicial impact, they have to be assessed for their prejudicial impact. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.619" offset="9809518">and you would conclude that they were either non-prejudicial, or that they were prejudicial and required reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.942" offset="9830834">That is exactly the way the Court of Appeals treated this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.395" offset="9844627">And that we submit is correct under the... not only the cases that this Court has decided in the harmless error area, but also under the two non-case law authorities that we cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.638" offset="9917561">One is the statute, the harmless error statute, 28 USC 2111, and the other is the Rule of Criminal Procedure, Rule 52(a), both of which require a violation... a showing of prejudice in the context of any violation to grant either reversal of a conviction, or a dismissal of indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.050" offset="9999272">The District Court dismissed on three grounds in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.236" offset="10035948">First, Rule 6(d) violations; second, Rule 6(e) violations; and third, the totality of the circumstances, including the 6(d) and 6(e) violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.752" offset="10078057">Now, we believe that this Court's decision, and the Court of Appeals agreed with us, in Mechanik, resolved the first two points, and resolved the question of whether violations of Rule 6(d), and by clear implication violations of Rule 6(e), are violations that require showing of prejudice, and that are subject to the harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.886" offset="10162589">We believe the Court clearly accepted that proposition, and therefore, the District Court is clearly wrong in dismissing in this case for violations of 6(d) or 6(e) in the absence of showing of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.284" offset="10216193">Now, the next ground is the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.797" offset="10230194">As we have argued, we think that you can't plug into the totality of the circumstances, either 6(d) or 6(e), and get any more mileage out of them than you can by reciting them as bases for dismissal separately, unless, of course, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, they somehow add to all of the prejudice and result in a finding of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.252" offset="10324026">But in this case the Court of Appeals found that neither the 6(d) nor the 6(e) violations resulted in any prejudice at all, so they contribute nothing to the ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.852" offset="10378465">Now, there are other points that the District Court focused on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.945" offset="10406782">Some of them we think are absolutely lawful, not unlawful at all, such as the use of informal immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.130" offset="10431546">The Court of Appeals said there is nothing wrong with that, and therefore that washes out all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.623" offset="10449518">There are other points that the District Court found were unlawful, but the Court of Appeals didn't find it necessary to resolve, but we submit are completely lawful, such as calling witnesses before the grand jury who invoke their Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2594.262" offset="10504062">The alternative would be simply to take someone's informal word that if they are called they are going to take the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="2599.955" offset="10526841">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.606" offset="10529453">And while there is some suggestion the Department of Justice policy is contrary to the position that was taken in this case, and what the prosecutors did, in fact, Department of Justice policy authorizes, except in the case of targets, calling individuals before the grand jury even if they are expected to invoke their Fifth Amendment privilege, simply to determine if they, in fact, are going to invoke their privilege, and to make a record that you tried to get evidence from that particular witness, something that can be of great use later on if the witness decides to be forthcoming in a different setting, and you are implicitly or explicitly charged with not having really done your homework by calling the witness and finding out what he had to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.832" offset="10690367">Similarly, while we admit that the mistreatment of the expert witness was improper, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a) there was no prejudice that flowed from that; and b) it is just not the kind of error that could possibly be sufficient to invoke a reversal without showing of prejudice rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.505" offset="10773019">If this occurred, for example, at trial, and there was an argument between the prosecutor and the witness, which happened as the jurors were filing out, and there is no doubt in my mind that a Court of Appeals would say this is something that has to be assessed for actual impact on the trial, and if it didn't have an impact on the trial, that would be the end of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.966" offset="10886913">There is no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.684" offset="10889734">That was a mistake, and I wish it hadn't happened, and I'm sure that the prosecutors now wish that it hadn't happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.339" offset="10912408">I might say that if you look closely at the evidence, it was not as if the prosecutor was beating this fellow with a stick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.833" offset="10942397">This was a law professor who was very firm in his views of what the law was, and the prosecutor, and the law professor, got into what amounts to a little bit of a shouting match.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.033" offset="10995164">It didn't last very long, and in the course of which the prosecutor said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.924" offset="11010733">"well, I'll see you in Court on that one. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.917" offset="11018674">challenging his assertion as to what the law was on a particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.199" offset="11035811">The witness took umbrage of that and felt that he was threatening him, but the witness later said that he did not feel intimidated, and in fact, he did not change his testimony in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.177" offset="11091713">The reply brief suggests that there was a recantation on his part, but there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.990" offset="11106968">Now, they attempt to get around the general principles of harmless error that this Court's decisions have set forth, and that Rule 52(a) and Section 2211 require, by invoking the magic wand of the supervisory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.232" offset="11183977">But we submit that if you look at this Court's recent cases in the area of harmless error, and supervisory power in the inner section of those two documents, you can't find support for their submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.541" offset="11229221">The Payner case... it's an important case in this line... establishes that where the exercise of the supervisory power, as here, is invoked in order to deter misconduct that was engaged in in bad faith, and Payner was the ultimate bad faith misconduct case, it is improper to apply the supervisory powers to dismiss an indictment where the exclusionary rule would not have required suppression or dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.839" offset="11350429">The Morrison case, similarly, again invocation of a power to dismiss because of bad faith misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.997" offset="11383030">No question that it was bad faith conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.146" offset="11391598">But once again, the Court said you can't dismiss for deterrence purposes without a showing of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.242" offset="11420020">The Hasting case, again repeated misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.835" offset="11438410">The Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, felt that there had been repeated instances of the violation in that case in the circuit, and wanted to do something about it by way of deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.591" offset="11477385">Once again, the Supreme Court said that there was no basis in the law under the supervisory power, or otherwise, for ignoring the question of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.998" offset="11527017">And finally, in Rose against Clark, the Court reiterated, and summarized this line of cases, by saying there is a strong presumption that errors other than this very small class of errors that really taint the entire process from beginning to end, and make it impossible to assess the possibility of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.722" offset="11605907">There is a strong presumption that other errors are subject to harmless error analysis, and that's our submission in this case, that this case falls into the large group of cases that are subject to harmless error analysis, and not into the very small group of cases that are not subject to that analysis--</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.763" offset="11674034">If there are no further questions, I have nothing further.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.890" offset="11710606">With respect to the questions of Justice Stevens, I would like to point out the government spends virtually half of its brief relitigating the findings below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.819" offset="11770269">And I suggest if the government is entitled to relitigate the findings of misconduct, we're entitled to relitigate whether or not there was prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.775" offset="11806109">We disbelieve that the Court of Appeals properly made that determination, in the same manner that they contend that the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not properly reach their findings with respect to the deliberate, purposeful, and intentional violations of law and standards of conduct in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.325" offset="11880297">I would suggest that the harmless error rule is not sensitive to the problem in the grand jury context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.362" offset="11912480">To preserve respect for this grand jury, and all grand juries, and to deter misuse of the grand jury process, this Court simply cannot rely exclusively upon harmless error because the answer of the government will always be as they argued below, as they argue in all of the circuits, yes, you found misconduct; yes, it was flagrant; yes, it was egregious; yes, it was outrageous, but it didn't prejudice you in the grand jury's decision-making charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.922" offset="12030763">And I submit that this Court should not sponsor that perception of the grand jury system, and the criminal justice system.</text>
