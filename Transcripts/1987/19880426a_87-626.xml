            <text syncTime="12.549" offset="173181">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this statutory construction case presents the question of whether Congress intended that the intentional tort exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act would preclude all suits from which the government negligently failed to prevent an employee from committing an intentional tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.705" offset="253743">The court below held that this is in fact what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.225" offset="271924">Thus the Court below sanctioned a construction that would, for example, absolve the government of its negligence in allowing a child at a federally run day care center to be molested if the assailant happened to be a federal employee, or indeed if the victim couldn't prove that the assailant was other than a federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.931" offset="358650">This construction would also absolve the government of liability for injuries resulting from a weapon possessed in contravention of a federal hospital's regulations if the injuries happened to be intentionally inflicted and if the assailant happened to be a federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.082" offset="435346">This construction cannot be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.265" offset="447989">Congress could not have intended the government's liability to hinge on such fortuitous circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.139" offset="475575">It could not have intended to create the fine spun and capricious distinctions which this construction requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.803" offset="686226">In the day care center case, the government owes its duty to the children at the day care center, not because it may or may not employ the assailant, but because it has chosen to run a day care center, and if indeed they do assume this task voluntarily, then it is hornbook law that they must use due diligence in performing that duty, so yes, certainly you can more narrowly define it and say, yes, the source of the duty determines the applicability of Section 2680(h).</text>

            <text syncTime="206.748" offset="949958">The government owes that duty to whomever that mental patient may come across and injure, so it owes that duty indirectly, but either way it owes the duty to the victim, and that--</text>

            <text syncTime="422.399" offset="1812522">Well, Your Honor, I think again what you have to do in that respect is go back into the historical perspective and see what Congress was considering when it was enacting this particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.409" offset="1872603">And what it was looking at was the fact that, A, there was a distinction between negligent supervision and intentional torts, and B, many commentators, some states, were expanding the doctrine of respondeat superior to reach intentional torts simply as a matter of social policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.141" offset="1959539">And the government cites and we cite to legislative history where the committee is stating, let's take it step by step.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.148" offset="1999558">Let's proceed cautiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.881" offset="2006455">Let's forestall adoption of the liability for intentional torts until considerable experience is had under the Act, and we submit that what Congress was talking about there was wanting to forestall the inclusion of respondeat superior for intentional torts of government agents, and that is all they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.817" offset="2114288">That is why Congress saw it was necessary to say that, because some states do allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.521" offset="2133096">The Congress didn't have the benefit, obviously, of this Court's decision in Laird versus Nelms.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.523" offset="2161099">It may have assumed that these... this conduct, wrongful conduct may have been attributed to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.999" offset="2194954">So that, I submit, is what Congress was after in adopting that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.544" offset="2221181">We have spoken briefly about the source of duty, and we have briefed that fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.104" offset="2275411">The only other point I'd like to make about that is that it, unlike any of the analyses the government has put forward, is consistent with underlying tort law, which the Federal Tort Claims Act was modeled after, and it doesn't have the internal consistencies, it doesn't have all the exceptions popping up that we have to navigate our way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.480" offset="2376871">That is the central advantage of the scope of the duty argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.236" offset="2403934">The final point I would like to make would be just to address myself briefly to the government's argument, which is that the intentional tort exception doesn't apply when an excluded action is an essential element of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.046" offset="2479166">That argument is inconsistent with... first of all, it's inconsistent with Panella, which says that federal employees... non-federal employees who commit intentional torts, that is not outside the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.367" offset="2544473">Those acts are just as essential to a claim as would be the claim of a federal employee having committed that identical assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.524" offset="2585119">It is also inconsistent with the source of the duty argument which the government endorses.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.118" offset="2603405">There is no reason to say that this failing to control a prisoner or mental patient and allowing him to commit assault is not an essential element of a claim for negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.156" offset="2655650">That doesn't follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.967" offset="2662859">And another point that we raised in our brief which I think is also important here is that the government characterizes the language as, when governmental conduct is essential, an essential element, and frankly, we don't have here governmental conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.389" offset="2740495">What we have here is conduct of an individual who happens to be a federal employee, and there is, quite obviously, a distinction between the two.</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.739" offset="4941886">I'd also, while discussing the extremely sweeping language of this statute like to point to the Court's opinion in Kosak, too, where the Court... where the whole issue, the dispute between the majority and the dissent was whether "arising in respect of" is as broad as "arising out of", which everybody agreed was simply extremely broad language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.712" offset="5073857">Petitioners have made three arguments designed to evade the sweeping language of the statute, and I'd like to address each in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.026" offset="5115130">Their broadest argument is their argument that Congress meant to bar claims involving batteries only when the plaintiff asserts that the government is liable under respondeat superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.445" offset="5164763">There is no basis for the distinction petitioners urge and that the Ninth Circuit has reasonably found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.730" offset="5197886">The language of the statute arising out of, any claim arising out of assault and battery doesn't hint at a distinction between respondeat superior and negligent supervision, as four Members of this Court noted in Shearer, and as petitioners demonstrated in their brief, and noted a few minutes ago, both theories, respondeat superior and negligent supervision, were known to courts at the time the Federal Tort Claims Act was passed in 1946.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.283" offset="5400074">Section 317 of the restatement of torts sets out the broadest case where someone can be responsible for the tort... for the intentional tort of another, and that frequently occurs when an employee is diligently supervised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.275" offset="5472068">We have reprinted Section 317 in a footnote in our brief, but the language covers both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.659" offset="5501638">If Congress had intended to limit it in some way, it could have done so, as the plurality noted in Shearer, by saying any claim for assault and battery, because a respondeat superior claim is a claim for the battery rather than arising out of the battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.602" offset="5577393">If that's what Congress had meant, especially since it was well known that there were these two theories at the time the Act was passed, we think Congress would have done something to make that clear, and it certainly didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.504" offset="5760982">First, if you take the gloss added in Panella seriously, as if it were really part of the statute, then in the one case where with the government employee the intentional tort exception would bar the suit, in the other case, where there's a non-employee, the intentional tort exception would not bar the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.253" offset="5832035">That, we think, is a perfectly reasonable reading of what Congress might have meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.170" offset="5863695">After all, the Court in Panella didn't just grab committed by a federal employee out of thin air, as I might say some of the other exceptions that have been proposed do come out of thin air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.498" offset="5920956">It looked at what Congress was doing in 1946, and it is true that Congress was focusing on torts committed by federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.014" offset="5955019">That was what was uppermost in their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.266" offset="5968081">The postal truck hitting a pedestrian was the prime case Congress was after.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.414" offset="6000682">I might note that if a postal driver purposely runs over somebody, the intentional tort exception bars that claim, which certainly would seem anomalous from the standpoint of the person who got hit, who suffers the same injury whether or not the driver negligently hit him or intentionally ran him over, and in cases like that the pedestrian has to argue that the... in order to collect, that the postal driver intentionally hit him... did not intentionally hit him, wasn't out to get him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.445" offset="6140802">So there is that anomaly that flows from the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.899" offset="6162536">We think it's reasonable, Congress could well have decided, as the Panella gloss has it, that Congress wanted to preserve sovereign immunity in those vast bulk of cases where an intentional tort was committed by a federal employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.791" offset="10658105">I submit that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.514" offset="10669077">In any event, that is a question for the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.977" offset="10678899">Justice Kennedy, you asked the question, what if the assailant had been an FBI agent, what would be the liability in this case, and the government said, well, if he is an FBI agent, therefore you could sue him directly for his intentional tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.996" offset="10738980">I don't think that that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.278" offset="10752042">The legislative history of the 1974 amendment makes it quite clear that Congress was only waiving that with respect to FBI agents, law enforcement individuals acting within the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.238" offset="10807944">Now, there is nothing in 2680(h) that says acting within the scope, yet there is quite a bit elsewhere in the Federal Tort Claims Act that says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.892" offset="10846500">I believe it is 2674 and 1346(b) certainly says within the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.307" offset="10872205">You asked about the Panella gloss and where does it come from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.201" offset="10887774">Where it comes from is reading these provisions together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.595" offset="10905328">There is nothing in 2680(h) admittedly that says it has to be a federal employee who commits the intentional tort, but it is all over 1346(b) and it is all over the rest of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.092" offset="10959349">Indeed, what Congress was concerned with was federal employees acting within the scope of their employment, and that's the gloss that needs to be read into Panella, not federal employees, not people who happen to be federal employees, but people who are federal employees, and it matters that they are a federal employee, i.e., they are acting within the scope of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.495" offset="11040956">If you apply that gloss, if you will, you end up where we submit Chief Judge Winter was in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.835" offset="11090275">He says, if there is an independent duty, then the government must be held to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.767" offset="11113994">Now, I don't want to forsake my argument that the Ninth Circuit is correct because I believe that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.081" offset="11143251">Historically, if you look at it, this is what Congress was up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.275" offset="11160074">It wanted to say, no respondeat superior for intentional torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.778" offset="11182122">That's what we're after in 2680(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.129" offset="11191526">Negligent claims may proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.663" offset="11205632">That's what Congress was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.102" offset="11211379">But you know, as to which of our claims survive depending on which, if any, of these arguments the Court adopts, certainly our first claim of the Navy knew or should have known that this man posed a threat would not be able to survive if the Court only went with the scope of the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.048" offset="11303121">The scope of the duty would focus on whether there is a duty independent of the employment status, and that would be gone if you are talking about duties that arise solely out of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.375" offset="11352440">On the other hand, of course, if you go with the Ninth Circuit approach, the broader approach, negligent supervision is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.622" offset="11385459">There is no reason to distinguish between the two, between negligent supervision and any other kind of tort claim, and therefore that case may proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.048" offset="11435196">Those are our two principal allegations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.536" offset="11469155">You follow the statute, you end up with a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.848" offset="11482321">If you take the government's argument, you do a lot of this, you end up with all kinds of exceptions, you end up with all kinds of anomalies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.302" offset="11512205">They suggest that it is merely line drawing, and is an acceptable amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.446" offset="11536760">Doe versus United States demonstrates the total lack of principle in the government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.542" offset="11565181">You simply can't say, well, if you can't prove that he was other than a federal employee you are out of here when in fact the government's duty is the same, the breach of the duty is the same, the injury is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.260" offset="11620038">It simply doesn't make sense.</text>
