            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="7.739" offset="30929">This case is before us on appeal from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.855" offset="51409">It presents a facial First Amendment challenge to an ordinance enacted by the Town of Brookfield, Wisconsin that prohibits residential picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.287" offset="93100">The District Court held that the ordinance violated the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.930" offset="111700">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.708" offset="126746">This panel decision was vacated however and the case was reheard en banc by the Court of Appeals which ultimately affirmed by an equally divided vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.491" offset="169900">The town appealed here and we postponed consideration of jurisdiction until the hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.730" offset="198844">In the opinion filed today, we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.156" offset="212532">Rather than decide whether appellate jurisdiction is proper, we choose to treat the jurisdictional statement as a petition for a certiorari and have granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.748" offset="258926">The ordinance operates against speech in a public forum since it bans picketing on the public streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.398" offset="285571">The fact that the streets or residential does not affect the First Amendment analysis, but since the ordinance is content-neutral, it is permissible if it leaves open ample alternative channels of communication and if it is narrowly tailored to serve as significant government interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.816" offset="359236">We conclude that the ordinance passes this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.861" offset="375432">In order to avoid constitutional problems, we narrowly construe the scope of the ordinance as limited to picketing targeted at a single residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.809" offset="419213">So construed, the ordinance leaves out an ample alternative since marching, leafleting, or even more broadly focus picketing is not prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.884" offset="459442">The ordinance serves the significant interest of protecting residential privacy and the tranquility of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.984" offset="491833">Within their own homes, individuals should not be forced to listen to a speech they do not want to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.382" offset="517433">Since the very means of expression involved is inherently damaging the residential privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.573" offset="542198">The picketing ban is narrowly tailored.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.771" offset="555050">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.485" offset="565917">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.721" offset="582844">Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Marshall joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.852" offset="603324">Justice Stevens has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
