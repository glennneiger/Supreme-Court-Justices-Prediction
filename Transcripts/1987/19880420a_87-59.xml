            <text syncTime="17.093" offset="207112">This case comes to the Court on a writ of certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.913" offset="230414">That Court held that the Postal Service must comply with an arbitration award that orders to reinstate to a letter carrier position an individual who has been criminally convicted of failing to deliver over 3500 pieces of mail, and who an arbitrator found posed a risk of again delaying the mail in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.660" offset="305333">We have sought review by this Court, because we believe that the Postal Service cannot comply with the decision below without defaulting upon its statutory obligations to ensure that the mail is reliability delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.718" offset="353607">The facts of the case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.253" offset="367713">In June of 1984, postal inspectors made a lawful search of the personal automobile of the Grievant in this case, Mr. Edward Hyde.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.775" offset="401777">In the course of that search, they found over 3500 pieces of mail in the back seat of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.512" offset="424765">Some of the mail contained United States Treasury checks, and some of those checks were dated April 1, 1983 indicating that the mail had been delayed, some of the pieces of the mail had been delayed at least a year and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.689" offset="481503">The Postal Service immediately had Mr. Hyde arrested, and charged him with unlawful possession and unlawful delay of the mails in violation of 18 U.S.C.--</text>

            <text syncTime="272.308" offset="1227978">An arbitrator convened a hearing with respect to the grievance, and ruled in Respondent's favor for Mr. Hyde.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.430" offset="1264445">The arbitrator found that Mr. Hyde had in fact unlawfully delayed the mails, but he also found that it was attributable to what he characterized as the Grievant's mental disease, his affliction for compulsive gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.273" offset="1323795">He thus saw his own task as what he termed balancing the needs of society, the needs of the mentally ill, and the needs of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.529" offset="1356814">And he identified the differentiating factor in that balance what he called and I quote, "The possibility of rehabilitation".</text>
            <text syncTime="312.599" offset="1389101">He then found that he did not know what the future prospects of rehabilitation were for Mr. Hyde.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.253" offset="1411775">And indeed, this was a tough decision for him, because he saw that there was a threat of recurrence of the misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.007" offset="1438734">But in that balance where there was a possibility of rehabilitation, he concluded that this is not a risk free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.346" offset="1468095">And thus, it is the Postal Service and the Postal Service's patrons who should bear the risk of that future misconduct while there was a reasonable hope of rehabilitation for Mr. Hyde.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.244" offset="1971736">But let me address why it is so important that the Court not only recognize that it pay attention to the public policy exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.599" offset="2005068">The argument in this case is that somehow allowing a public law to trump an arbitration decision would somehow destabilize the arbitration process.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.372" offset="2044252">But quite the opposite is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.507" offset="2052716">The Court has to remember how collective bargaining agreements are negotiated, and how arbitration provisions get put into collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.597" offset="2085107">Typically, in a collective bargaining context, an employer and a union will have approximately ninety days upon which to agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.017" offset="2114783">If an agreement is about to expire, they will give notice ninety days before the expiration of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.738" offset="2133695">And the union will come forward with a series of demands on numerous topics that they would like the employer to agree to.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.808" offset="2157937">And the employer will respond to those demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.943" offset="2166505">And over the course of ninety days, they will deal with provisions dealing with the various economics of their relationships, and the various work rules that govern their relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.164" offset="2199419">Every one of those proposals can and oftentimes do have legal ambiguities in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.270" offset="2223765">And the fact of the matter is that if the parties had to resolve every legal ambiguity, just as they had to resolve every contractual ambiguity, before they entered into the contract, they would never be able to enter into a contract in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.494" offset="2272667">The public policy exception simply greases the wheel, so to speak, of the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.398" offset="2296281">It allows the parties to reach agreement on general contract language like a just clause provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.968" offset="2318642">And if the language is subsequently interpreted in a way that one or the other party thinks would put them in violation of public law, if they had to comply with it, they have the freedom to go to Federal Court and to seek to have that provision declared unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="819.213" offset="3415576">I think that it goes without saying that it is a fundamental premise of our entire economic and political system that the mails will be reliably and securely delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.103" offset="3459148">The right to establish a post office and maintain it is recognized in the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.879" offset="7546267">And that is the question of whether there is an alternative job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.747" offset="7561731">This arbitrator's decision requires the Grievant, Mr. Hyde, to be reinstated to the payroll of the Postal Service and that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.437" offset="7600497">At that point, the Postal Service is free to implement the full range of its managerial rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.126" offset="7631217">And among those rights is to make a reasonable determination that someone is disabled for physical or psychological reasons, and cannot perform the functions of his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.433" offset="7676461">At that point, the Postal Service can assign a man to other duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.811" offset="8293996">Let me begin by making the point that I think that the case, as it has been defined in the briefs, is extraordinarily narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.286" offset="8335896">The Postal Service has conceded that it may employ persons who have been convicted of crimes, including persons who have convicted crimes in his phrase against the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.610" offset="8385215">It concedes that it can employ persons who have had physical and mental disorders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.199" offset="8415517">And there is even a concession in the reply brief that the Postal Service can employ an individual with a history of compulsive gambling.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.657" offset="8469329">That is now the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.376" offset="8476226">The issue is that this is a special case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.744" offset="8485734">That Edward Hyde has been found to be so dangerous, that to continue employment with the Postal Service is literally a violation of the Postal Service's duties under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.885" offset="8534218">Now we think that this case can be disposed of on the basis of a very simple proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.289" offset="8555847">That there has been no clear showing of the kind of explicit conflict between the Postal Service's duties under the statute and the requirements of the award, which is the kind of conflict that is required in Misco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.130" offset="8611227">Let me begin with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.299" offset="8619899">The relevant provisions of the Act consist initially of the mission defining provisions, which are essentially Sections 101 and 403.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.921" offset="8658456">Those provisions tell the Postal Service in effect to deliver the mail promptly, reliably, and efficiently, deliver the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.710" offset="8701610">The statute does not contain any provisions which specify who the Postal Service is to employ to deliver the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.233" offset="8735674">It does not specify any minimal qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.600" offset="8749153">And it does not specify who the Postal Service must discharge, with a couple of very specific exceptions for striking and in some instances for unlawful political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.475" offset="8792621">The statute leaves those decisions to the discretion of the Postal Service with one obvious and highly significant qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.331" offset="8824072">The Postal Service must exercise its right to hire and discharge in a manner that is consistent with its collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.918" offset="8858345">The statute also provides that collective bargaining agreements may include provisions for resolution of adverse actions through binding third party arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.094" offset="8915083">Now that is all that the specific language of the statute says on these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.581" offset="8940996">The actions of the parties and the arbitrator are completely consistent with this framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.552" offset="8964925">The Postal Service and the Union negotiated an agreement which preserves the Postal Service's authority to manage the Postal Service, to discipline, and even discharge employees for offenses against the mail, with the one qualification which is provided for in the statute, that any disputes over whether someone should be discharged are to be submitted to an arbitrator for binding resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.120" offset="9067220">That is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.004" offset="9078714">Hyde unquestionably committed a serious offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.523" offset="9092820">We do not challenge that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.475" offset="9100657">But the Union presented a very substantial case that there had been a material change in circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.379" offset="9128242">That the dereliction of duty occurred during a period in which Hyde was suffering extreme emotional instability, and that he was now in therapy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2281.135" offset="9263243">Well, actually, for the most part, we are talking about junk mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.937" offset="9278498">That is clear from the criminal case file which we lodged with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.991" offset="9302740">Most of the mail apparently was junk mail that arrived during the Christmas rush.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.229" offset="9323638">Hyde could not complete his route, put the mail in the trunk of his car, and his car was stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.781" offset="9341819">Now obviously, he should have reported that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.799" offset="9349969">He should never have brought the mail back home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.585" offset="9357075">But what emerged in the criminal case and what led ultimately to a very favorable report from the probation department and the sentence of probation was that at this point that the gambling had taken over his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.527" offset="9416843">That was the accepted fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.577" offset="9424993">And that is consistent with what the literature reports about compulsive gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.498" offset="9448712">That it can lead to this kind of distraction and dereliction of responsibilities on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.418" offset="9472432">So that was the factual posture of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.239" offset="9495628">The arbitrator was then called upon to determine whether there was just cause for discharge, and with the understanding that he could not foretell the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.864" offset="9542231">Now I recognize that the arbitrator said that I cannot foretell the future and that there is a risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.517" offset="9564800">But I would submit that if anything that those sentences which I think are the foundation of the government's entire case strengthen the argument for enforcing the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.925" offset="9606387">Because what they show is that this arbitrator recognized the problem and thought about it before he made his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.329" offset="9636063">And I think that it is important if we are really going to focus on exactly what the arbitrator said to emphasize that those sentences which establish that he cannot foretell the future occur essentially in the middle of the opinion, which consists of a general discussion of the evidence and the issue before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.726" offset="9709623">The arbitrator's actual conclusions are on the last page of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.844" offset="9730103">And they consist first of a reference to another arbitrator's decision for the proposition that society must be prepared to take a small risk, and a conclusion that Hyde's emotional problem did not render him unfit for further employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.687" offset="9789454">And the ultimate conclusion that he was not totally convinced that Hyde presently had the ability to perform in an acceptable manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.060" offset="9826965">Now that may be doubt, but I would respectfully submit that that is a very small doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.880" offset="9850267">And the arbitrator dealt with that doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.899" offset="10270316">Well, let me respond to that question, which I think goes to the heart of the case in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.137" offset="10299259">If we had a crystal ball that we could peer into and we could see that if Hyde were placed back on the job that a significant amount of mail would be placed in the trunk of his car or otherwise mishandled, yes, this award would violate public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.999" offset="10362685">The problem is that obviously we cannot foretell the future, which is exactly what the arbitrator recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.652" offset="10385359">Because we are dealing with uncertainty, the question is whether the statute prohibits the employment of individuals who may be a greater risk than the average employee, or in this case the next employee hired off the employment register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.797" offset="10457875">I do not think that that statute creates any prohibition against the employment of high risk employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.470" offset="10488595">Now it could be argued, I suppose, as a matter of policy, that that would be a good idea, to prohibit the employment of high risk employees in the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.826" offset="10526002">But the fact is that Congress did not do that, and that is absolutely clear from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.229" offset="10551602">Congress intended these matters to be decided by arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.716" offset="10573545">Now frankly, I do not think that there is more mishandling of the mail now than there was before the Postal Reorganization Act when the Postal Service had the authority to do exactly what it is seeking to do here, to walk away from an arbitration award on the ground that it is inconsistent with its statutory responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.011" offset="10650763">Prior to 1970, the old Post Office Department pursuant to executive order had the authority to conduct advisory arbitrations in its dealings with unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.954" offset="10718577">But the Department always retained the authority to overturn an award for whatever reason that it chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.161" offset="10759328">And what Congress found, and this was after extensive studies of the Post Office Department, is that that system did not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.815" offset="10789943">It led to extremely low morale, low productivity, and tremendous frustration among the workers, which actually culminated in 1970 in a nationwide postal strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.556" offset="10836964">That was the context in which Congress reorganized the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.694" offset="10853473">I think that it would be completely inconsistent with congressional intent to attribute to Congress a purpose which is not stated anywhere in the language of the statute to give either management or the courts the authority to in effect substitute their judgment for an arbitrator's that the risks involved in reinstating an employee are too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.809" offset="10953992">This public policy exception to the enforcement of arbitration awards has existed for a long time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2731.328" offset="11064020">In Misco obviously, in the last footnote of the Court's opinion, the Court left open the question of whether the public policy doctrine is limited as the D.C. Circuit saw it to violations of positive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.636" offset="11113235">Now the government has told us in its brief that that question, which was left open in the footnote, is not raised here, that the Court does not have to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.325" offset="11156076">Because it sees this case as involving nothing more than a violation of positive law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.379" offset="11892206">If there is a difference, and if it is the kind of difference which justifies overturning the award here, I am afraid that you are setting the threshold of risk so low that virtually any case involving misconduct can be brought into the courts for a second look.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.841" offset="11962110">As I see it, what the Postal Service envisions is a bifurcated process, whereby first the arbitrator plays the role of something akin to an insurance actuary and figures out what the statistical likelihood that this fellow will commit further misconduct is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.986" offset="12042672">And then management and then the courts pass judgment on whether that risk is acceptable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3014.160" offset="12195331">So I think that the answer to that point is exactly what then Circuit Judge Marshall said in Otis Elevator in 1963.</text>

            <text syncTime="3168.826" offset="12814015">So that an arbitrator could decide that even if the proof did not rise to the level that a man could be convicted beyond the reasonable doubt standard, that there was still sufficient reason to discharge the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.011" offset="12934805">I would like to respond now to certain specific contentions that the Postal Service advanced in its reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.986" offset="12986632">The government makes reference to cases which involve contracts which have been held to violate public policy, because of their tendency to induce improper conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.865" offset="13054133">And that perspective, I think, underlies the argument that enforcement of this award may encourage misconduct by Hyde's coworkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.724" offset="13113587">I do not think that that is a fair interpretation of the award or of the Union's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.461" offset="13136575">The beginning of the award makes clear that the Union acknowledged throughout that delay of the mail is improper and that it is cause for discipline, and that it could be the basis for discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.804" offset="13193940">The Union's argument here was that there was a change in circumstances, a material change in circumstances, based on the fact that Hyde is now being treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.476" offset="13236676">I do not see how by any rational calculus, that whatever benefits a reasonable employee might determine he would derive from delaying the mail, and I do not know what they are, would not be outweighed by the costs recognized by this award, which include criminal conviction, a suspension of almost one year in length without pay, and the possibility of discharge, if he is unable to convince the arbitrator that there are grounds for reinstatement based on mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.374" offset="13416190">In addition, I want to make the point that at this point that to assert that the award may encourage others, may set a bad example for other employees, is in Misco's language sheer speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.204" offset="13507514">Because there has been no evidence no way or the other on that issue, none presented to the arbitrator and none presented to the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.477" offset="13544608">The reply brief also makes reference to the balancing test which was enunciated as an element in a public policy inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.634" offset="13589225">I just want to state the position that under the Town of Newton v. Rumery, we would take the position that in any case involving the public policy doctrine that a balance of the interests at stake is appropriate and necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3621.284" offset="14623883">Whether the mail in junk mail or whether it is checks for AFDC benefits to unwed mothers, all of the mail is important from the Postal Service's perspective.</text>
