            <text syncTime="24.448" offset="240246">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.733" offset="249441">This case presents a rather intriguing problem of cryptography.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.269" offset="267622">The cryptogram in question is contained in the Maryland capital sentencing proceeding used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.173" offset="291237">It sets forth on page 14 of the Petitioner's brief, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="41.410" offset="308164">"Based upon the evidence, we unanimously find that each of the following mitigating circumstances, which is marked "yes", has been proven to exist by a preponderance of the evidence, and each mitigating circumstance marked "no" has not been proven by preponderance of the evidence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="55.968" offset="366365">The court of appeals determination is that a reasonable juror reading that language will conclude that even though there is only the possibility on the form for "yes", and "no", that there are actually three possibilities; that you have all agreed for "yes"; all agreed for "no", or you have a split decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.679" offset="437209">Then this reasonable juror, without being instructed to do so will conclude that,</text>
            <text syncTime="78.266" offset="455599">"If I disagree I'll leave it blank. "</text>
            <text syncTime="80.785" offset="465630">"Then I will retain the memory of my mitigating circumstance, and when it comes to weighing aggravating and mitigating, I as an individual juror will weigh this, even though my other jurors may not. "</text>
            <text syncTime="91.676" offset="509203">None of this with instructions to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.276" offset="519652">An additional problem, however, is precisely the same language with the substitution of "beyond a reasonable doubt", for "preponderance of the evidence", is used to preface the aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.452" offset="572315">Now the court of appeals has held in Maryland that the aggravating circumstances is that simply they are either unanimous or it doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.208" offset="603348">So that, once again our reasonable juror, when he comes upon this language in the aggravating circumstances, he looks at this language and says,</text>
            <text syncTime="121.962" offset="630306">"The only possibility is either we all agree or it doesn't exist. "</text>
            <text syncTime="126.497" offset="648488">A few moments later, encountering precisely the same language, a reasonable juror who is now somewhat schizophrenic concludes,</text>
            <text syncTime="133.253" offset="675550">"This language must mean something different now: it means indeed that there is a third possibility... this leaving it blank. "</text>
            <text syncTime="139.491" offset="700419">I submit is the test, unless it becomes a schizophrenic rather than reasonable, juror, it is difficult to accept the Court of Appeal's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.679" offset="733229">Moreover, there are several external factors cutting against this interpretation.</text>

            <label>Mr. George E. Burns, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="297.422" offset="1332164">Yes, Justice White, and I seem to have gotten lost in the "cryptic" avenue in this instance, but I think that the forms are, this first form is... and the second one is not real important anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.759" offset="1365497">It's just a stylistic change.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.694" offset="1369258">And the new form, as I think the Court will note, the new form is, at best, a distant cousin to the first form.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.932" offset="1394231">It specifically sets out the possibility you either all agree; you don't agree; you're divided; and you mark three alternatives for each mitigating, you mark according to these three possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.655" offset="1441147">At the end of that form it provides each juror to individually assess what he thought; she thought; the mitigating factors were.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.845" offset="1473852">So if you had a situation where six jurors thought there were five mitigating factors; and six didn't; those six jurors would weigh those mitigating factors against the aggravating.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.867" offset="1513977">In short, I think it is very difficult to accept the court of appeals' assurance that every juror who understood the first form, when the court of appeals thought it was necessary on an emergency basis to drastically change that form.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.775" offset="1565595">I also think it is worth pointing out, as the dissenter did in the court of appeals, that prior to this case, there is no evidence that any juror ever indicated in any way that there was a divided jury on any mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.184" offset="1623273">Subsequent to this case there was an opportunity in the forms and instructions to show division, two of the three capital cases that were decided jurors indeed demonstrated that they were split on some mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.028" offset="1674577">I think that the dissent persuasively points out that it defies reason to suppose this is all a matter of coincidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.598" offset="1704879">I also think it's important to look at the interplay between the court of appeals' opinion and the brief of the state in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.288" offset="1735599">The court of appeals has held that this reasonable juror is going to sit around and think of a rather intricate procedure to follow, even with instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.457" offset="1764334">The state, on its part, disagrees with the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.928" offset="1786172">Indeed, the state says the court of appeals is wrong in how they interpret the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.313" offset="1803727">The state says that what the statute actually meant was that if you disagree, any disagreement, any mitigating factor; hung jury; mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.688" offset="1841239">The court of appeals specifically rejected that interpretation in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.907" offset="1862137">The point of this, I think, on the one hand we have the court of appeals offering an interpretation in which it then says every reasonable juror would have understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.246" offset="1891498">Yet the state, even to this day, doesn't understand that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.031" offset="1906649">On the other hand, the state offers us an interpretation that the court of appeals says it's wrong and didn't understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.268" offset="1927547">I submit that if the state and the court of appeals can't agree, it's far too much and far to optimistic to assume somehow that this hypothetical reasoning juror would have understood all this, or indeed, any of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.687" offset="4977291">The problem, of course, is if you have improper evidence to come in, then that also affects in the weighing in balance perhaps of whether you decide a historical fact really is worth bringing back a mitigating.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.839" offset="13041813">Can it be that this Court intends for victim impact to be so excluded that it would simply give the victim a number?</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.349" offset="13095939">So that when a jury is making that ultimate determination, that moral judgment, what was the loss of society from this victim?</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.003" offset="13122479">They'll never know who he was or what his contribution to society was... I think that really goes too far, and I think there is a principled reason that the Court could say Booth was right because it was outrageous, goes way beyond what we can tolerate, but that some evidence about the victim alone tempered by the trial judge's admonition to avoid undue prejudice, could be appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3278.640" offset="13257062">Initially, I think the crucial problem with the state's position as I now understand it to be, is the court's opinion set forth in the joint appendix at 136... 141, curiously there is not one word about a new law announcing new forms; what the court says is Petitioner has got it all wrong; this is what it's always meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.969" offset="13346401">The crucial point for the state to be right is just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.521" offset="13360612">It's just that the court is changing the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.687" offset="13369284">But the court specifically rejects that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.556" offset="13376703">And when the court does that, the instruction on 95, of course, cuts against the state's case because you only need yes or no, and the court very clearly at 139 and 140 says we always imagine the jury would know that you had this "maybe"; leave it blank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.233" offset="13431456">On the victim impact I would only say that I don't agree with the state that anyone is in the lowest rung of humanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.803" offset="13457683">I don't think it's necessary to build up his contribution to society for all of us to take into consideration as the jury does, that at the trial, the facts and circumstances of the crime.</text>
