            <text syncTime="57.494" offset="360893">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.454" offset="428811">The issue in this case is the extent to which the Employees Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, ERISA, preempts state garnishment laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.934" offset="474682">The Petitioner is a longshoreman's vacation and holiday fund which is an employee benefit fund, a welfare fund governed by ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.322" offset="516269">The case arose when a collection agency in Georgia, the Respondent Lanier Collection Agency, attempted to garnish the vacation and holiday benefits of 23 longshoremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.222" offset="567887">They brought a proceeding in the County Court of Chatham County, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.736" offset="589934">In the decision under review, the Supreme Court of Georgia held that while the state garnishment procedures were not preempted as applied to ERISA welfare funds, the exception in the Georgia statute, which removed from the effects of garnishment welfare funds, was preempted as being contrary to the provisions of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.301" offset="704142">The real issue in this case, it seems to me, is whether Congress means what it says, because we are dealing here with an expressed preempt section, Section 514 of ERISA, which says that any state law that relates to an employee benefit plan is preempted, so there is no need to psychoanalyze Congress or to go into legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.385" offset="800481">It is right there plain and simple in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.602" offset="813333">And the words "relate to" have been construed by this Court in a unanimous decision which has been relied on in five different cases with no change from the definition that relate to as the ordinary, common sense dictionary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.222" offset="883864">If something relates to something, if it has an effect on it, it has reference to it, it has a connection with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.721" offset="901836">So really the only question in this case is whether or not when you have an attempt to garnish these funds, does the state garnishment law have an effect upon the funds.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brian J. Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="903.109" offset="3743436">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="912.762" offset="3781993">We agree with Petitioner that ERISA, in general, preempts the application of state garnishment laws to employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.541" offset="3813131">Our view is also based on 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.367" offset="3824416">But before I get to the 514 point, I'd like to respond to a couple of points of Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.646" offset="3849598">The sue and be sued clause in Section 502 seems to us to mean that a plan may be sued on any valid federal claim or non-preempted state claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.845" offset="3886378">It does not override the preemptive provision of 514, whatever that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.952" offset="3906754">And with respect to 206(d)(1), which provides that pension benefits may not be assigned or alienated, we do think there is a bit of overlap between 206 and 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.244" offset="3955968">But we think that to conclude it, this overlap makes much more sense in a complex ERISA statute that was built over the course of years than to conclude that 206, by addressing pension benefits and not welfare benefits, silently excluded garnishment of welfare benefits from 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.627" offset="4029425">Exclusions from 514 are in 514, 514(b) in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.953" offset="4050741">Justice Scalia raises the obvious question, where does the line draw in 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.824" offset="4090238">We think that there are a number of ways to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.635" offset="4109464">One rule of decision would be a state law that determines whether plan benefits will be paid to a plan participant is a law that relates to that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.303" offset="4148125">I think this Court's decision in Shaw and in Metropolitan Life would support that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.144" offset="4171531">In those cases the state law required the payment of benefits in the cases of mental illness and pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.033" offset="4195146">Another possible decision, rule of decision would be the state law that requires, or forbids the payment of benefits is preempted if, in addition, it imposes administrative duties on the trusties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.622" offset="4245405">In this case we have those duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.153" offset="4255541">They have to answer a garnishment summons within 45 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.916" offset="4266617">They have to pay over the funds if they can calculate them to the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.206" offset="5375776">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.765" offset="5405973">The Solicitor General and the Petitioners are searching for a line on how to interpret Section 514's relate to language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.230" offset="5439933">There is no question it's a difficult task.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.290" offset="5456128">But in all of the other cases, with the exception of Franchise Tax Board in which this Court has considered the preemptive scope of Section 514, it was dealing with actions which were brought by trustees or beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.458" offset="5508791">Trustees and beneficiaries are provided specific remedies under Section 502 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.376" offset="5532511">And the Court has found that when you are dealing with claims by beneficiaries and by trustees within the core of the Act, that all state law, all state substantive law and even the causes of action are preempted because those are within the core of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.871" offset="5594473">The only case where this Court has considered the scope of preemption in an action brought by a party not covered by Section 502, such as a creditor of the fund or as in this case, a creditor who seeks garnishment against a beneficiary, was Franchise Tax Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.458" offset="5660824">And in that case this Court specifically drew the line by saying that ERISA was not intended to preempt all causes of action by third parties against a fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.250" offset="5711919">It doesn't speak to the question of what a third party's remedies against the fund may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.452" offset="5732817">Instead, it says that the causes of action themselves are preserved, but the substantive law that will be applied to the right to recover has to be consistent with federal law under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.087" offset="5791332">So, in effect, in Franchise Tax Board, the Court drew a line and said the action to enforce the tax levy, which was brought by the state, was not in and of itself preempted, but the question of whether or not the trustee could comply with that remedy had to be answered under federal substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.718" offset="5877849">So, in effect, this Court has said that while a conflicts analysis for preemption isn't required in a case which is brought by an beneficiary or by a trustee within the realm of rights covered under Section 502, it is required when it is an action which is brought by a third party against a fund for remedies which are collateral to the substantive purposes of ERISA.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="1472.689" offset="6021732">In that, it was a case involving the question of whether or not an action which was brought by the State of California to enforce its tax levy could be removed to federal court as a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.934" offset="6074708">And in looking at that question, this Court had to decide whether or not ERISA preempted that cause of action in its entirety such that it couldn't proceed in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.055" offset="6123191">And the Court very explicitly said, we don't answer the question of whether or not ERISA precludes garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.006" offset="6150986">That's a question that has got to be answered under the substantive law of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.112" offset="6171361">In other words, the question of whether or not the trustee should comply with a writ of garnishment is one which has to be answered under common law principles developed by this Court pursuant to ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.450" offset="6224755">So it seems to me that the question in this case is whether or not the garnishment action that has been brought by the Respondent in this case conflicts with the substantive law of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.460" offset="6276791">And essentially the Petitioners in the United States maintain that it conflicts in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.163" offset="6299570">First, they say it conflicts because ERISA was intended to prevent any creditor from ever asserting a claim for garnishment against the fund, or ever attempting to alienate the benefits in favor of creditors; that that was a substantive protection which ERISA was intended to provide which would be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.141" offset="6379505">Second, they maintain that ERISA was intended to prevent the fund itself from having to endure the burdens of garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.746" offset="6417957">With respect to both of these issues, I think the answer is that there simply is no such federal purpose under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.913" offset="6458604">And that if we look at each of these questions separately, it becomes apparent why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.051" offset="6479188">First, on the question of whether or not Congress intended to protect beneficiaries in all welfare plans from involuntarily alienation of benefits, we look first to what ERISA says on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.625" offset="6537493">Under Section 206(d), Congress very explicitly provided that pension benefits cannot be alienated, can't be alienated in an involuntary or a voluntary fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.931" offset="6586708">And when it did that, it was acting against the backdrop of the common law, and I think it's important to understand how you protected benefits, or wages, or property from creditors at common law in order to understand the significance of what Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.566" offset="6653268">Essentially at common law any property in the hands of a third party could be alienated in favor of creditors unless it had been donated, placed in the trust and the trust had a spendthrift clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.810" offset="6710215">So when Congress came to this problem for pension benefits, it went ahead and it required that pension... promises to pay pension benefits have to be funded, they have to be placed in a trust, and they have to have a spendthrift clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.757" offset="6773954">Well, Ms. Mahoney, Congress also, though, enacted Section 514, and that's what obviously the government and the Petitioner are relying on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.299" offset="6816168">And in the process, Congress also, in 514(b)(7), exempted domestic relations orders from the preemptive effect of 514(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.232" offset="6863919">Now why would it have done that if it didn't think it had prevented in 514(a) the garnishment pursuant to a child support order, for example?</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.067" offset="6943227">It was directed at the substantive law question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.895" offset="6954512">In other words, what the exception to 514 for domestic relations order does, because it says that the substantive law of whether or not a wife is entitled to support will be determined under the state law of domestic relations order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.672" offset="7165686">But I think that you... that the exception is necessary only to the extent that it affects the substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.170" offset="7191599">And that in this case, no exception to, or no exemption from 514 is necessary, because federal substantive law does have to govern the question of whether or not the trustee is obligated to comply with the garnishment order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.650" offset="7245516">I think that is the critical difference, and that's why the exception for domestic relations orders shouldn't be read to just mean that any garnishment has to be approved by a specific exemption to the section, because it did much more than approve garnishment orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.361" offset="7312390">In fact, it's not even clear that garnishment orders itself are within the specific definition of domestic relations orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.797" offset="7466199">I think that the section which exempts ERISA plans from garnishment has to be preempted by Section 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.138" offset="7499531">And the Georgia Supreme Court was correct in that, because that section, its only purpose is to regulate ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.994" offset="7534953">In effect, what the exemption does is it says trusts in the State of Georgia have valid spendthrift clauses whenever they are created for an ERISA plan beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.723" offset="7589810">That will create the precise disuniformity which Congress intended the preemption clause to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.563" offset="7621262">If Georgia is permitted to say that in our state spendthrift clauses are in force, then there will not be a uniform substantive law governing trust administration throughout the United States, and that's why this Court in Franchise Tax Board said that the question has to be answered under the federal common law developed under ERISA and cannot be answered under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.569" offset="7729199">And also, Your Honor, to the extent that that section is preempted, the rest of the garnishment laws remain in tact, and the remedy can proceed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.801" offset="7902130">In fact, there is no exception for vacation benefits that are not in an ERISA fund under the Georgia law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.146" offset="8067537">And ordinarily garnishment of vacation funds occurs just in the ordinary course of wage garnishment, because the vast majority of American workers are paid vacation pay through their regular wage distributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.608" offset="8129395">And, in fact, the Department of Labor has found that vacation pay shouldn't even be subject to ERISA except to the extent it's placed in a trust fund, because Congress didn't have any substantive intent to protect vacation pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.430" offset="8196687">And what that really says here is that Congress must not have intended to prevent the alienation of vacation pay in favor of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.270" offset="8236079">Otherwise, all vacation pay should be subject to ERISA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.339" offset="11264298">They did it under a state cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.993" offset="11278927">The trustees of the plan that were sued removed the case to federal court, and the question which was ultimately decided by this Court was whether or not the removal was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.331" offset="11328246">And they found that they had to answer two questions in determining whether or not the removal was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.266" offset="11352070">The first was whether or not that cause of action raised a federal question on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.030" offset="11375057">And the answer given was it does present a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.576" offset="11389268">The federal question is whether or not the trustees are obligated to comply with the levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.511" offset="11412987">But that is raised by way of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.026" offset="11423018">Therefore, it's not removable under the well pleaded complaint rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.007" offset="11442976">But the looked to a second question, and that was whether or not it was removable because the cause of action itself was preempted in its entirety by ERISA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.206" offset="11487802">This Court said that ERISA does not speak to the question... in fact, it says that ERISA neither creates nor expressly denies any cause of action in favor of state governments to enforce tax levies or for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.295" offset="11544122">It doesn't purport to reach every question relating to plans covered under ERISA.</text>
