            <text syncTime="28.150" offset="251896">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on Mr. Huddleston's petition for certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.523" offset="289407">There are two major issues facing this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.327" offset="304663">First, by what standard of proof must the government prove that the defendant engaged in a prior bad act before it may be admitted under Federal Rules of Evidence 404(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="51.516" offset="345414">And secondly, if such evidence is erroneously admitted, which harmless error test should govern on appellate review, the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt test enunciated by this Court in Chapman or the effect on substantial rights test enunciated by this Court in Kotteakos?</text>
            <text syncTime="71.179" offset="423990">Finally, once this Court decides which standards should be adopted in this case, the Court must apply them to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.350" offset="456696">Now, petitioner contends that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting petitioner's involvement in the sale of black and white televisions prior to the sale of VHF tapes which he was charged with when the government did not prove they were stolen by at least a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.699" offset="542064">We also contend that the jury's hearing about these TVs was not harmless error, that it affected his substantial rights and amounted to a miscarriage of justice under the Kotteakos standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.939" offset="599115">I will concentrate in my argument on the standard of proof question, contending that both rules 104(a) and (b) of the federal rules require that the government show that the prior bad act was committed and that the defendant committed it by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.253" offset="672362">Then I intend to show that the government did not meet this standard in this case, that they did not show by a preponderance of the evidence that these TVs were stolen or that the defendant knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.959" offset="715099">And finally I will argue that the erroneous introduction of the TVs was not harmless, that it did affect his substantial rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.798" offset="746550">Now, this Court is faced in our briefs with deciding between three different standards of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.218" offset="776225">First, of all, the clear and convincing standard of proof which was adopted by the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.558" offset="805587">Many federal commentators also support it, as did our position, the federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.712" offset="830142">The preponderance of evidence test has been supported by six different circuits, using the 104(b) test, and if this case is analyzed also under 104(a) I believe that this would be the required holding of the Court under the recent case of Bourjaily, and if I am not pronouncing that correctly... I believe the case is Bourjaily, and that was decided by this Court last summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.683" offset="954067">The government argues for a different standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.235" offset="972248">The government argues that a trial court should admit this evidence when there is a basis for finding that the defendant committed the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.443" offset="1013104">It is our position that there is absolutely no support for that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.897" offset="6406867">The last issue is that if this Court agrees with my analysis and also agrees that there was not a preponderance of the evidence, then you have to reach the harmless error standard, and I would admit to the Court that this Court has never held that the harmless error standard in nonconstitutional claims, and I am not claiming that this is a nonconstitutional claim, should be by the Chapman rule, should be by harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.132" offset="6507804">The Sixth Circuit applied both standards in their opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.066" offset="6523582">They first said, in the first opinion, a two-one decision reversing Mr. Huddleston's conviction, they said that it hadn't been proven... that it hadn't been proven harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and then they also said, though, that there was some question as to whether there was a sufficient objection raised here, and they analyzed the case under a plain error standard under Rule 52(b), which I take the position that the plain error standard is the same as the Kotteakos standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.836" offset="7050629">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, our position in this case is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.140" offset="7071840">It is that Rule 404(b) does one thing and one thing only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.994" offset="7095246">It prohibits the use of similar act, what we are calling similar act evidence for the purpose of showing propensity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.215" offset="7124189">That is to say, it prevents the government in a criminal case from using similar act evidence to show that a person is a bad man, and then asking the jury to draw the inference from the fact that he is a bad man that he did the bad acts that are charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.243" offset="7196287">As we read the rule, once the judge has performed that act of screening, once the judge has said, this may not be used for propensity, then that evidence is treated just the same as any other evidence that comes before the Court for admission to the jury under a relevance standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.073" offset="7279566">The question then is under 401 is the evidence relevant, and the question is under 403 is the evidence too prejudicial to be admitted given its probative weight?</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.359" offset="7604738">The way we view the question of relevance in this case on the television sets is that, Number One, these were sets that were sold in a barroom, basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.405" offset="7680911">The initial contact was made by somebody walking into a barroom and saying, are you interested in television sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.376" offset="7704839">Number Two, this was a case of someone who had announced that he had a truckload of television sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.246" offset="7736291">Now, this wasn't a case of somebody trying to get rid of the television set that wouldn't work at home and trying to bring the television set into a barroom and see if he could get rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.271" offset="7784356">The televisions were being sold for an extremely low price, $28 for a 12-inch black and white television, and in fact the evidence from the defense, which was the evidence of this lawyer who participated in the sale of other televisions was that the defendants paid a total of, by his claim, paid a total of about $10,000 to $12,000 for the whole truckload of televisions, which works out to be about $13 to $16 for each set, so the combination of the price, the circumstances of the sale, and the volume are, we think, sufficient evidence just standing by themselves to justify the inference on the part of the jury that these were stolen television sets, and then if you add to that the fact that in other instances Mr. Huddleston was dealing with the same people in part of the same operation with goods that he admitted to the FBI agent were hot, then that makes a very convincing case to go to the jury, we think, on the question of whether they were in fact stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.565" offset="8045580">Now, our backup position, of course, is that it isn't necessary to establish that these televisions were stolen in order for that evidence to be admissible, and this was an argument that was made in fact in the closing argument in the rebuttal summation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2877.617" offset="11649747">Now, we were stuck with what the Court had previously said as our alternative argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.786" offset="11678482">The Sixth Circuit had previously adopted a preponderance test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.555" offset="11689558">Obviously it would have been better if we had put in a foot-note and said that we believed that even the preponderance test is not correct, but I think we would have had little hope of persuading the Sixth Circuit to abandon its previous position on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.863" offset="11738772">But the... even the preponderance test, I think, is a test which has created a lot of confusion because several courts have failed to distinguish between the question of whether a judge makes a finding by a preponderance or whether the judge says, a jury could find, which is to say, a jury could find by a preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.578" offset="11829574">In 104(b), just as in any other case of foundation evidence, the question is, can the judge find or conclude that the jury could find by a preponderance that a particular fact is proven, and that is, we say that is a basic relevance inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.373" offset="11904807">That, we think, is the correct view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.725" offset="11910240">You can call it a preponderance view of a sort, although I think that is misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.027" offset="11927376">But it is definitely not the judge making a determination that there is a preponderance and therefore making, for example, credibility determinations that are properly left for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.652" offset="11969904">Now, I think in order to focus on this distinction between Rules 104(a) and 104(b), which is the crux of petitioner's argument now, it is important to note that 104(a) deals basically with questions of competence, not questions of relevancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.421" offset="12084947">The rule applies, for example to preliminary questions in determining whether hearsay evidence should be admitted, preliminary questions in determining whether a witness is qualified, that sort of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.562" offset="12133535">It does not apply and specifically excepts that class of cases which deals with relevance, which is 104(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.167" offset="12168016">This question in this case as we see it is a pure question of relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.136" offset="12183899">I think petitioner is correct that if this were a 104(a) question, a question committed to a judge to make a decision as the judge sitting under a Lego against Twomey type situation, that the preponderance test would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.879" offset="12242831">That is to say, the judge would have to decide on his own whether the evidence had met whatever factual condition there was by a preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.735" offset="12278253">That does not apply in the case of Rule 104(b) where the rule specifically states that all that is necessary is for the judge to conclude that there is enough evidence to justify the finding, that is to say, to justify the jury making a finding, and the advisory committee notes to 104(b) specifically lay out that this is a question for juries, this is not a question for judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.731" offset="12362263">That is the question we have in this case, which is one of conditional relevance, if we go solely on the stolen property theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.520" offset="12401342">Conditional relevance may not apply at all, if we go on the theory that the evidence is admissible without regard to whether the TVs were stolen, so that's the way we view the relationship between Rule 104(a) and 104(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.180" offset="12460065">In any event, the clear and convincing test has nothing to do with any of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.048" offset="12471455">It was invented, we think, by the courts in just sort of expression of antagonism towards evidence of this sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.314" offset="12676568">--Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.731" offset="12678240">I think it would be wrong for a judge to say as a matter of course in my courtroom from here on out I am going to read Rule 403 and you are never going to get anything in unless it meets the preponderance test, no matter how minimally prejudicial it is, or like your red hat example, it is not prejudicial at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.360" offset="12740725">I mean, I have an aversion to red hats, and you had better prove it by a preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.995" offset="12759324">That would be crazy, and it would also be wrong, but the test that we suggest and what I think the advisory committee and the various committees that commented on the rules at the time they were being devised wanted to focus the attention of the court on the question of, A, relevance, and B, prejudicial versus probative, and that is the question that is just an inherent part of the whole Article 4 relevancy provision in the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.335" offset="12892653">Now, petitioner claims that a number of circuits have adopted his 104(a) analysis here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.972" offset="12927239">As we read it, only one circuit has adopted Rule 104(a), and that is the Seventh Circuit, and it has done it in a kind of backwards way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.612" offset="12965796">What it has said is because we adhere to the clear and convincing test, and the Seventh Circuit is one of the courts that adheres to that test, we believe that it would be odd to ask a jury to make a finding like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.687" offset="13018041">Therefore a judge must make such a finding, and therefore because the only rule that requires judges to make findings is Rule 104(a), therefore this must be a Rule 104(a) question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.126" offset="13055762">Well, if you don't start with the assumption that the clear and convincing evidence test is the right test, then you don't end up with Rule 104(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.149" offset="13087944">Every other court that has addressed this question has either ruled that the clear and convincing or preponderance test applies without focusing on the rule at all, simply by applying old common law notions from their own common law developments, or have been courts that have said this is a question of conditional relevance, which is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.295" offset="13168506">Now, we think that some courts have incorrectly said it is always a conditional relevance question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.616" offset="13193793">It isn't always a conditional relevance question, but there may not be any preliminary fact to be found, but when it is, then it is decided under Rule 104(b), just like any other piece of evidence.</text>
