            <text syncTime="15.176" offset="185599">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="27.983" offset="236904">This case presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.952" offset="252786">One, whether the withdrawal of an unfair labor practice complaint by the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board pursuant to an informal settlement entered into prior to the commencement of the hearing on the complaint constitutes agency action that is subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.122" offset="361455">The second question is whether, assuming that the GC's action is subject to judicial review, the General Counsel must hold an evidentiary hearing whenever the party who file the unfair labor practice charge objects to the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.570" offset="459258">Now, before addressing these questions, I should like to spend a few minutes outlining the statutory scheme and the Board's procedures for implementing it because I think it's important to understanding the resolution of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.032" offset="537103">The National Labor Relations Board confers upon the National Labor Relations Board authority to prevent any person from engaging in an unfair labor practice affecting commerce, and it sets forth in general terms the procedure to be followed in determining whether an employer or a union has engaged in an unfair labor practice and the appropriate order, therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.884" offset="664476">However, Section 3(d) of the National Labor Relations Act provides that the Board's General Counsel, who is a statutory officer appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate, shall have final authority on behalf of the Board in respect to the investigation of unfair labor practice charges and the issuance of complaints in respect the prosecution of such complaints before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.140" offset="801462">Now, the procedure the Board has devised attempts to effectuate this separation that 3(d) makes between the Board's prosecutory authority on the one hand and its adjudicatory authority on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.136" offset="885472">An unfair labor practice charge case is initiated by the filing of a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.242" offset="921939">It's investigated by the Regional Director, and if the investigation indicates the charge has merits,--</text>

            <text syncTime="272.437" offset="1214719">At this stage of the proceeding, the settlement is usually what is called an informal settlement, which does not require the entry of a Board order or a court decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.197" offset="1273756">It consists of a commitment by the charge party to take the agreed-upon remedial action and the case is closed upon compliance with that commitment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.767" offset="13668022">I guess the way we view this case, Justice Scalia, that two aspects to the judicial review question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.241" offset="13713893">Aspect Number 1 is what did Congress intend with regard to the procedures within the agency, and then Question Number 2, which we think depends on the resolution of Question Number 1, is if the agency doesn't proceed in that way, does the party disadvantaged have a right to have a court say that you have followed an improper procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3437.985" offset="13876897">Just a couple of points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.989" offset="13900930">In the first place, Congress' basic intention in enacting 3(d) was to separate the Board's prosecutorial authority from its adjudicatory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.017" offset="13969057">At the time of the '47 amendments, the Board had delegated some of its prosecutorial authority, but it had retained some aspects of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.062" offset="14041155">We submit it is clearly unreasonable to conclude that Congress intended to freeze the situation which would have left prosecutorial authority that the Board was continuing to exercise still with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.873" offset="14116388">So, the point that Congress intended to freeze the situation pre '47 just doesn't stand up.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="3509.181" offset="14161632">Mr. Come, could the Board require informal settlements by the General Counsel to be reviewed by the Board?</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.485" offset="14298931">--post-complaint, I think that the Board could not go back to the point of the issuance of the complaint without doing violence to 3(d) because 3(d) talks about the General Counsel's final authority, extending not only to the investigation of charges and the issuance of complaints, but with respect to the prosecution of such complaints before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.039" offset="14433096">So, you have to allow some room post-complaint for the General Counsel's final authority to operate in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3584.526" offset="14463085">So, your answer is no, the Board could not require him to get the approval of the Board for informal settlements after the complaint is issued?</text>

            <text syncTime="3610.577" offset="14567261">At that point, I think that the adjudicatory process has commenced and that the Board as the adjudicator has the inherent authority of all adjudicatory bodies to regulate the order of proceedings once the adjudicatory phase has opened, and barring any restriction in the statute, which there is none here, the Board was reasonable in drawing the line at the opening of the hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3656.522" offset="14751059">Just to settle terminology, do you consider that a formal settlement or an informal settlement, where all the Board approves is a dismissal of the complaint, no order from the Board?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="3667.747" offset="14795885">I would regard that as an informal settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.049" offset="14813126">The formal settlement requires a Board order that requires a party to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.171" offset="14853668">Now, whether that order provides for enforcement by a Court of Appeals or not does not deprive it of being a formal settlement because since the order... the parties have consented to the order, the Board can go into the Court of Appeals and get automatic enforcement of that order because under 10(e) the respondent has waived his right to contest the order and we have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.626" offset="14987415">My last point is that we read 10(f) the way you have suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.219" offset="15037779">Judge Scalia, as the type of order that is referred to is a 10(c) order, and that is made even plainer when you look at 10(e), which is the provision for the Board--</text>
