            <text syncTime="18.930" offset="215750">The question in this case is whether copies of presentence reports that are in the possession of the Parole Commission are subject to mandatory release under the public disclosure provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.767" offset="2251106">And 3(b) is particularly apt in this case we think because Congress specifically focused on the question, really the question in this case, whether the subject of the report should have a right to receive a copy of that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.777" offset="2307113">And Congress, like this Court, in promulgating the rule decided that he should not.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.661" offset="2682649">And here we think that's particularly clear because Congress has in effect recognized that the probation officer prepares the report for the Parole Commission as well as the Court, directed the probation officer to furnish it to the Court, and directed the Parole Commission to consider the report as part of its deliberative process.</text>

            <text syncTime="776.121" offset="3244491">In a number of cases we've referred to, these are private persons who are in effect part of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.775" offset="3275106">This is on intra agency rationale, the outside consultants are really part of the agency for that purpose because it's necessary for the agency to use their services in connection with a deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.159" offset="3328710">As we point out in our brief, this view is also reflected in the background of FOIA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.814" offset="3351279">Both as this Court recognized in Weber Aircraft for example, the Machin Privilege which protects reports concerning aircraft accidents, the Machin Privilege was specifically considered by Congress and one that Congress intended to make applicable under Exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.382" offset="3437588">Well, in Machin itself, the witness statements that were involved were statements of outsiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.834" offset="3455351">They were not statements of... perhaps some of them were but the principal focus was on a report that was not submitted by a person in the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.611" offset="3498506">And other privileges under Exemption 5 such as the work product privilege, it would be odd to cut the privilege off depending upon whether the person submitting a statement was in the Government or outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.122" offset="3548556">So there are a number of privileges where the agency might have to rely on some materials submitted from outside, and for that purpose, the submitter is regarded as part of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.147" offset="3600592">With respect to the further requirements of Exemption 5, as I've said, I think now eight circuits have made clear that presentence reports are not routinely available to person seeking them in civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.781" offset="3683139">And the test under Exemption 5 is whether a document is routinely or normally available to a person on civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.920" offset="3715740">Not whether it might be made available to a person who has a special connection with it or a special interest in it, or a special need for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.968" offset="4699929">And it seems to us to be quite anomalous if the defendant has no private right of access under the Privacy Act which was designed for that purpose, that he should be able to invoke the public access provisions of the Freedom of Information Act to obtain a copy of the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.491" offset="4765967">And going back to the question you asked, Justice O'Connor, it seems to us that where the document really has a dual status, it's an important essential document for the Court and an essential document for the Agency, it makes no sense for the Parole Commission, either voluntarily or for it to have to under FOIA to disclose a document that the Court would not disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.528" offset="4866172">And therefore the Parole Commission has tried to reach a harmonious approach in this area, whereby it will not release a copy of the presentence report to the defendant if the Court wouldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.305" offset="4909222">Otherwise, they would be working at cross purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.000" offset="5828001">He can brood about it, he can pore over it, he can look for things that may be wrong or look for persons to retaliate against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.105" offset="5864468">That's much different than simply having a recollection of something he might have read.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.709" offset="5914832">And this was again one of the principal concerns that the Administrative Office explained to the Parole Commission on behalf of the judges who are part of the Probation Committee of the Judicial Conference, and also on behalf of probation officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.174" offset="5964778">They were afraid that sources of information would be more reluctant to cooperate with a probation officer if the formal embodiment of their comments were freely distributed to third parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.493" offset="6894006">Much of the Government's argument seems to be contending that unless Congress has in some way required it in a statute other than the Freedom of Information Act that presentence reports be disclosed to prisoners who are otherwise entitled to see them before sentencing and parole hearings, that it needn't provide copies of those reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.077" offset="6984390">But that stands the entire concept of the Freedom of Information Act on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.373" offset="7001526">The whole purpose of the FOIA was to essentially require the Government to make available to requesters Federal agency records, unless the Government can point to a specific exemption which authorizes the Government to withhold that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.398" offset="7061608">We would submit that it is quite plain that neither of the two exemptions relied upon by the Government here, Exemptions 3 or 5, are applicable to requests by the subjects of presentence reports for copies of material they have already been permitted to see pursuant to not one but two statutory directives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.915" offset="7203714">Your Honor, I believe that Exemption 6 was crafted to deal precisely with the distinction between first party and third party requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.538" offset="7234225">The phraseology of that Exemption states that information shall not be released, or may not be released if in fact the disclosure of the information would create an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.516" offset="7294097">I would submit it is quite plain that when personal information is released to the individual who is the subject of the information, there cannot in the language of the exemption be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.590" offset="7338401">However, if a third party seeks access to that information, there may very well be an invasion of personal privacy subject to that particular exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.650" offset="7374659">Well, that's true as far as personal privacy is concerned, but as far as exposing the identity of people who spoke about the individual were, what they said, and other such matters, that could be obtained not only by the defendant but by anybody, presumably.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.375" offset="7453549">I think again, it would depend upon an analysis of the particular exemption involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.999" offset="7472043">For example, if one were dealing with confidential sources, then one would look at whether Congress has in some way exempted confidential source information not only from the defendant but from the world at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.557" offset="7514257">And we would submit that it's quite clear, as we have conceded in this case, and I think as two circuit courts have now held, the confidential source material clearly can be withheld not only from the defendant but from the rest of the world as well.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1856.740" offset="7567025">But if it has to go to the defendant, it has to go to the rest of the world, isn't that right, except for those personal matters that relate only to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.425" offset="7593774">That arguably could be kept out from the rest of the world under 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.470" offset="7605895">But all the other stuff about confidential sources, if the defendant can get it, anybody can get it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1874.154" offset="7636615">I think it's conceivable if I might just amend that partially that there could be in some instances a Governmental privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.463" offset="7669947">I don't think one exists here, that protects disclosure from third parties but not necessarily from first parties, depending upon the kind of Governmental interest that was being articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.054" offset="7712266">I don't think this qualifies as such a privilege as I will indicate in my remarks in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.052" offset="7740269">But I think it's conceivable that justice Exemption 6 may turn on whether the exemption would apply depending upon who the requester is, it is conceivable that there is privileges that are crafted by the courts for discovery proceedings could turn on the nature of the requester.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.028" offset="7812158">But I would say as a general rule that you're absolutely right that release of information to one party would involve release of information to the world at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.134" offset="7844550">I just have a few remarks about the Exemption 3 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.774" offset="7859178">Because I believe it helps to put in perspective why the Government is really overreaching in this case in an effort to argue that these particular documents are exempt from their subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.722" offset="7902959">As we have argued in our brief, Exemption 3 was amended in 1976 for the precise purpose of very carefully narrowing the kinds of statutory schemes that would qualify as withhold statutes under the particular exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.356" offset="7977461">As it is now crafted, as Mr. Kneedler pointed out, it only covers information that specifically is exempted from disclosure by statute providing that the statute either a) requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or b) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of materials to be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.815" offset="8071292">In crafting that language, the legislative history of the amendment makes it quite clear... and this is how it's been largely construed by the courts... particular documents cannot be withheld unless Congress has in some way told an agency how to exercise its discretion in order to release or withhold that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.792" offset="8143181">And thus where a statute does not tell an agency in some way to withhold material from a requester, the exemption does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.758" offset="8175051">We would submit in this case it is quite clear that as to three specific categories of information which are sometimes contained in presentence reports, Congress made that determination quite explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.581" offset="8222385">And thus under Section 4208(c) of the Parole Act, the Parole Commission is authorized to withhold from everyone, including subjects of the reports, material revealing sources of confidentiality obtained under a promise of confidentiality as well as two other specific categories of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.448" offset="8293856">That clearly reflects Congress' judgment that that kind of information could occasion some harm if released.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.961" offset="8319874">It is just as clear that as to other portions of presentence reports which may otherwise be shown to the prisoner, then there is no harm that Congress foresaw in the disclosure of that information, and it did not direct the Parole Commission to decline to release that particular information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.251" offset="8393017">In fact, the Chairman of the Parole Commission has himself recognized that in various documents that we have included in our brief, as well as documents attached to the Government's Petition for Certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.712" offset="8478907">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.163" offset="8484654">Rule 32(c)(3)(e) specifically gives the courts the authority to disclose copies, or I think in the language of that provision, to require return to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.721" offset="8530943">But I think that helps our case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.643" offset="8538571">Because Congress did not adopt that provision when it enacted the provisions of the Parole Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.687" offset="8558842">Tellingly, it adopted virtually every other portion of Rule 32(c) verbatim, when it enacted the Parole Act, including almost precise parallels for the three categories of data including confidential sources that may be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.853" offset="8623417">But it did not include the requirement that is contained in Rule 32(c)(3)(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.412" offset="8649643">The conclusion seems inescapable therefore that that was a purposeful deliberate determination by Congress to essentially authorize the Parole Commission to release copies of the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.127" offset="8688514">And as the Chairman of the Parole Commission himself has said, the fact that the Parole Commission is authorized to withhold confidential sources suggests that in response to FOIA requests,</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.577" offset="8730310">"in cases where there is confidential material which is not to be shown to the defendant, such material can be withheld under the FOIA, as well. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.683" offset="8766777">He went on to say that giving prisoners copies of presentence reports that they have already been permitted to read will pose,</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.962" offset="8795929">"no threat to the willingness of confidential sources to come forward because the probation officer can still guarantee confidentiality under the FOIA. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.463" offset="8941901">And if I have a statute that arguably prevents the Parole Commission just as it prevents the Court, I'm inclined to read the law to make some sense.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Robert Glitzenstein</label>
            <text syncTime="2242.197" offset="9108876">I think the reason it makes sense is when you look at the purpose of Rule 32(c) was essentially to give the Court control over that document up until the end of the sentencing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.145" offset="9160599">There have been cases from this Court including Williams v. New York, other cases which have talked about the need for the sentencing judge to supervise the sentencing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.140" offset="9200618">And I think what Congress was saying was that up until the sentencing judge completes sentencing, then the sentencing judge could essentially exercise that kind of supervision and control over all of the documents that come before the Judge and are used in the sentencing process, perhaps to prevent unnecessary delay if he believes that a particular defendant will take the presentence report and do things with it that the judge may not like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.848" offset="9295390">But whatever the reasons, what I think Congress was doing was splitting this up and saying, up until the time of sentencing you are using the report exclusively, and you can keep control of the materials that are being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.892" offset="9339590">But once it goes to correctional authorities and it takes on entirely different kind of significance and is used in totally distinct kinds of determinations, then we want the Federal Statutes, including the Parole Act and other relevant statutes to kick in and to control the way in which these reports are used and disseminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.323" offset="9413359">And I think in keeping that in mind, it's crucial to focus on the fact that presentence reports are not only used in parole determinations by the Parole Commission, but as our brief points out, they are used in a whole host of correctional decisions the second that that prisoner walks through institutional doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.612" offset="9478457">It's used to determine the kind of institution that person will be put in, the nature of the security that will be imposed, furloughs, what sorts of rehabilitation and correctional systems will be put into place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.389" offset="9525581">Virtually every aspect of the prisoner's day to day life will be impacted perhaps by the presentence report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.762" offset="9555048">And what Congress was saying was since that is the case we do not want the sentencing Court and its use of this report and control of the report under Rule 32(c) to have a continuing bearing upon what the Parole Commission does with that document and what other correctional authorities do with that document.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.456" offset="9641879">It's very strange for Congress to serve those purposes by saying the document shall be available to the world at large under the Freedom of Information Act, which doesn't require any particular showing of need.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.403" offset="9709692">Well, first of all, Your Honor, again, I think that Congress did focus on the need of the particular defendant in passing the Parole Act, where Congress specifically required that the document be made available to the prisoner, it did not impose any limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.258" offset="9765072">But secondly, and I think the more general answer is, the exemptions to the FOIA apply to any Federal agency record that a Federal agency happens to have ink its possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.205" offset="9804883">And the Government has conceded since the Crooker case that these presentence reports are Federal agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.204" offset="9828915">And therefore the only way to analyze pursuant to Congressional intent, whether the document may be withheld in a particular circumstance, is by analyzing whether a specific exemption might apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.201" offset="9872801">And as I mentioned before when one is looking at giving out documents of this nature to the world at large, then Congress intended the Exemption 6 privacy analysis to be the kind of test that would be applied by courts in applying the FOIA exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.646" offset="9938630">And just like any other personal information that might be involved in any determination made by an agency, medical records, social security records, Veterans Administration records, the Exemption 6 test was crafted for precisely that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.079" offset="9996412">And I think that is the way in which courts should analyze this kind of case as well as other kinds of cases in which an individual may be permitted to obtain access to some material, but the world at large would not necessarily be in a position to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.505" offset="10106022">Your Honor, I think it is clear that some lower courts have in some instances withheld copies of presentence reports from third parties trying to obtain them from sentencing courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.827" offset="10155341">And I think that it is very important to look carefully at what those courts said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.217" offset="10172896">Because it is useful in analyzing why Grolier, why Weber, and the other cases that this Court has decided under Exemption 5 are inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.526" offset="10210199">In those cases, the Courts began their analysis, and again, this is sentencing courts, usually codefendants were attempting to obtain copies of other peoples' presentence reports by specifically saying, that the usual rule when a defendant is trying to obtain his or her own presentence report is created by Rule 32 and the Parole Act, and first parties ordinarily permitted to obtain copies of their presentence reports without showing any special need, without demonstrating that they have any overriding interest in obtaining that information just by showing that it's relevant to the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.759" offset="10367038">Then those Courts, and again, I'm referring precisely to the cases that are cited by the Government, Figurski, Hancock, Charmer Industries, go on to say that because Rule 32 and the Parole Act do not say anything about third party access, then we, the sentencing courts, must craft our own rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.049" offset="10444256">And in crafting our own discovery rules, we will take a number of factors into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.952" offset="10463900">One of the factors we will take into account, as those cases indicate, is the Court's desire to exercise control over the documents, because we deem them to be Court records and that they will stay court records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.073" offset="10508308">In that connection, I think it's useful to quote from Charmer Industries, one of the cases principally relied upon by the Government, which says, right at the outset, that notwithstanding any secondary uses, the presentence report is a court document and is to be used by non-judicial Federal officials and others only with permission of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.176" offset="10576749">Went on to say that in light of the nature of the presentence report as a Court document, designed and treated principally as an aid to the Court, we conclude it would not properly be disclosable without authorization by the Court to third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.404" offset="10629621">I think two things become quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.670" offset="10638711">One is that if there is any kind of recognition of confidentiality, it involves third-parties and not first parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.589" offset="10662430">And secondly, those cases are in large measure dependent upon an argument which the Parole Commission now concedes it is no longer making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.070" offset="10700360">And that is the sentencing courts' continuing control over the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.835" offset="10719377">In essence, what the Parole Commission is doing is using cases which recognize perhaps a certain kind of confidentiality but with very precise contours and based upon certain presuppositions and saying, we are going to take those cases and expand the privilege far beyond the contours that those cases themselves recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.545" offset="10802238">That is, in cases involving first parties as opposed to third parties, and in cases involving Parole Commission discovery proceedings as opposed to situations where the sentencing court is itself the party in control.</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.213" offset="11000873">I think every court which has looked at third party access has said that in order to give out a presentence report to a third party, there must be some demonstration of specialized need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.052" offset="11048207">Again, the reasons why the Court said that are totally inapposite here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.269" offset="11065134">One reason being the control of the sentencing court over the document forever, and the second reason being the need to protect privacy of the subject of the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.186" offset="11104840">But I think it is fair to say that courts will be reluctant to give these documents out because they are so personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.825" offset="11127306">And because they have so much sensitive information about the defendant to give them out to third parties without a substantial showing of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.930" offset="11159802">By the same token, it is quite clear that Congress has specifically said that when you have first parties, there need be no showing of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.521" offset="11190104">,--</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.818" offset="11191358">In fact, the case we cite in our brief, which I think answers Mr. Kneedler's arguments quite effectively is Rone v. United States, a Seventh Circuit Case, in which the Court reviewed amendments to Rule 32(c), as well as the Parole Act that was adopted in 1976 and said these cases not only give prisoners a right to get access to these documents by initiating an FOIA request, they go even further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.606" offset="11286443">They impose an affirmative duty on sentencing courts and on the Parole Commission to come to the defendant and say, this is material that we may very well rely upon in making a sentencing determination or in making a parole decision, and therefore, you have a right to see that document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.145" offset="11356661">So these cases go beyond the routinely available standard in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.300" offset="11369199">They in fact declare, as well as the statutes that Congress crafted, that prisoners and defendants have an affirmative right to have these documents made available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.703" offset="11414861">And it is therefore difficult for us to see how the Government can argue that these are not routinely available to prisoners in discovery proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.792" offset="11443178">The final point that I would like to make, or one of the final points I'd like to make about the Government's analysis, is that it would cut against the grain of what this Court said in the Federal Open Market Committee v. Merrill case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.304" offset="11497304">In which this Court in the process of recognizing a certain kind of discovery privilege, stated that it would,</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.239" offset="11521023">"hesitate to construe Exemption 5 to incorporate a civil discovery privilege that would substantially duplicate another FOIA exemption. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.705" offset="11554878">Here, it is quite clear that any conceivable interest the Government has in withholding these documents is adequately, more than adequately met by other exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.293" offset="11593226">As I noted above, we concede the Ninth Circuit held, the First Circuit has held, that confidential source material constitutes an Exemption 3 statute under the Parole Act, and can be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.789" offset="11635230">By the same token, any legitimate privacy interest clearly could be met through the contours of Exemption 6, and by applying that Exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.770" offset="11667100">And so it's also quite possible that other exemptions would apply to specific portions of the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.565" offset="11694267">But it is quite clear that the Government's presentence report privilege is certainly not needed because of the other FOIA exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.313" offset="11721330">In addition, it would do something that would have very untoward effects on Exemption 6 and the rest of the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.139" offset="11748602">In effect what it would do as we read their approach to Exemption 5, is prevent individuals from ever using the Freedom of Information Act to obtain their own personal information, because the more sensitive, the more personal the information, it seems quite clear the more the Government would be able to argue that it is note quote unquote routinely available to third parties in discovery proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.707" offset="11842852">And that could then be used under Exemption 5 to prevent first parties from obtaining access to their own reports and their own documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.157" offset="11872631">And in that connection, I think it's quite important to focus on the fact that Congress itself saw the FOIA as a tool for obtaining first party information, that is, individuals getting their own records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.199" offset="11924876">Contrary to the suggestion by Mr. Kneedler, Congress did not only look at the privacy act as the vehicle for obtaining first party information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.663" offset="11958731">In fact, in 1984, Congress amended the Privacy Act for the specific purpose of saying that just because information is not exempt under the Privacy Act does not mean it would not be available under the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.377" offset="12009513">And the legislative history says we see both of these statutes in appropriate circumstances as vehicles for obtaining personal information.</text>

            <text syncTime="2974.968" offset="12039919">Mr. Glitzenstein, the argument you just made that there are other protections which would keep away from the public or from any requester information that impinges upon some privacy right or some other Governmental interest, you can always make that argument under Exemption 5, can't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.398" offset="12117660">I mean, you can always say, hat do you need Exemption 5 for if it's really private, Exemption 6 will cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.239" offset="12140961">If it's going to disclose informants, the Criminal Information exemption would cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.219" offset="12184951">You can always run that argument, and you would just read Exemption 5 out of the Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.968" offset="12199893">For some reason, the Statute says if it's an interagency or intra agency memorandum, regardless of whether these other interests are impinged or not, it won't be provided.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_robert_glitzenstein" startTime="3023.278" stopTime="3272.367">
            <label>Mr. Eric Robert Glitzenstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3023.278" offset="12233121">Your Honor, I think if one looks at the classic Exemption 5 privileges which the courts early on incorporated into the Exemption and the ones that are highlighted in the legislative history, one would have to come out a different way on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.149" offset="12284635">Because, for example, deliberative process privilege, which specifically was designed to protect drafts, working papers, other kinds of documents shedding light on the deliberative process, I think much of that material, and the courts have made it clear that much of that material would not necessarily be withholdable under other FOIA exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.687" offset="12358822">By the same token, attorney client material, attorney work product doctrine material, the two other core privileges that the Courts have incorporated into Exemption 5, I cannot see how those would for the most part be withholdable under other exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.307" offset="12421307">And so I think it is quite consistent with Congress' intent to see whether or not a particular withholding that the Government is interested in really goes to those kinds of core Governmental interests that could not be protected under other exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.318" offset="12473343">Because as this Court said in Federal Open Market Committee v. Merrill, Congress drafted other exemptions of the FOIA for the precise purpose of incorporating certain other kinds of discovery privileges which were known to criminal and civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.078" offset="12532380">And therefore, it would really subvert the whole purpose of Congress drafting those other specific exemptions to lock stock and barrel put everything into Exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.481" offset="12565921">In a sense, I think the Government's argument threatens to really sweep up all those other exemptions and to either make them irrelevant or worse, to essentially undercut the kinds of tests for example under Exemption 6 that Congress really wanted the courts to apply in making those kinds of determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.411" offset="12633735">And so I think that the only way really to avoid that kind of hazard in really reading the rest of the exemptions out of the statute is by doing what the Ninth Circuit did and that is by recognizing that Congress can effectively say that particular documents are not subject a discovery privilege and that particular individuals are entitled to receive access to those documents, and thus Exemption 5 should not apply to those materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.746" offset="12731015">The last point that I would like to make involves the fact that the Government's argument under Exemption 5 reads another entire area of the law out of discovery, and that is the law of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.757" offset="12779080">The notion being that in basic discovery cases when the Government or some other party is arguing a privilege applies, it is generally held that when your forfeit confidentiality of the material, then you are no longer able to argue that that information should be withheld from a party in subsequent proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.936" offset="12851805">And I think in response to Justice Marshall's inquiries, it is my understanding that not only prisoners and their lawyers generally allowed to look at these documents, it is my understanding that the Parole Commission in most sentencing courts actually allow the prisoners and their attorneys to take notes from the copies of the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.132" offset="12924530">So if one were really concerned about passing along information of that nature to third parties, clearly taking verbatim notes from the copies that are already provided the prisoners would involve that kind of a harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.815" offset="12979283">And that is why the Parole Commission in the documents that we cite in our briefs has said that we do not see any incremental harm, quite frankly, in giving out copies of documents that prisoners were already allowed to see on several occasions and even take verbatim notes of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.058" offset="13040305">I don't mean to suggest, I want to make it clear, that we think there is a genuine risk that prisoners will take these reports and given them out to the world at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.102" offset="13072488">These contain very sensitive information about prisoners' family backgrounds, psychological characteristics, and there's no evidence o the record that prisoners are simply waiting to give this incredibly sensitive personal information out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.706" offset="13122852">But if that was a concern, that is a concern which this particular exemption claim would not do anything to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.531" offset="13150123">As a result, for these reasons, we believe that it is quite clear that the Ninth Circuit was correct, both in its application of the FOIA exemptions, and its determination that there were no significant Governmental interests to be protected by withholding copies of presentence reports, and we therefore ask the Court to affirm the Ninth Circuit decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.631" offset="13246568">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.365" offset="13257539">There are several points I'd like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.036" offset="13264226">First, the privilege at issue here is not a privacy privilege as respondents repeatedly suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.097" offset="13288468">The reason why, and we point this out in our reply brief and a number of cases say this, the reason why courts do not disclose presentence reports to parties seeking to discover them in litigation is not the privacy of the defendant, that may be subsumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.137" offset="13348550">the overreaching rational is the Governmental interest, Governmental privilege in protecting the free flow of information to the Government, to the probation officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.399" offset="13385643">rationale applies equally to giving a copy of the report to the subject of the report as it does to third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.927" offset="13415737">Also, the nature of the privilege requires that it be as absolute as possible, so that the sources of information will have confidence that their information will be tightly held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.861" offset="13455443">And in fact, as the Administrative Office pointed out to the Parole Commission in the rulemaking proceeding, sources of information are specifically told that their information will be only shown to the defendant and not made available to third parties.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3341.778" offset="13507165">Well, it's not really absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.950" offset="13511867">This exemption is not mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.028" offset="13524197">The Government, even if we agree with you that the exemption applies, the Government need not invoke it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3351.119" offset="13544572">No, it's but that's true of a lot of privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.166" offset="13552723">The Government may choose not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.461" offset="13565888">And related to that is the second point I wanted to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.882" offset="13579577">Respondents make something of the point that the cases we rely on refer to disclosures by the sentencing court, and not the Parole Commission, and somehow they are different considerations or different uses by the Parole Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.206" offset="13632866">First of all, the use is essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.220" offset="13640912">The presentence report is the essential document on which the sentencing decision is made, the parole decision is made and incarceration decisions are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.498" offset="13670065">But beyond that, the purposes of the privilege are precisely the same in both contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.965" offset="13687932">The purpose of the privilege is to protect the integrity of the document by securing the information from the sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.604" offset="13710502">That purpose applies equally to whether disclosure is made by the Parole Commission or by the sentencing court, and in fact, the probation officer makes the report for the Parole Commission as well as the sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.787" offset="13759195">The third point I want to make is that respondents are arguing for an exception to a general privilege under Exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act, an exemption which they essentially concede applies to members of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.971" offset="13803916">Exemption 5 as Judge Wald said in her dissenting opinion in Durns permits no such distinction between the requesters unlike Exemption 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.950" offset="13843831">But more importantly, if there was any doubt about the existence of a special exemption, it's dispelled by Rule 32(c) in which Congress focused on the precise question here, whether the subject of the report has a right or should have a right to get it, Respondent's position would completely undermine that decision.</text>
