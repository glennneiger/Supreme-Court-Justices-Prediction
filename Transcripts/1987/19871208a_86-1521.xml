            <text syncTime="63.042" offset="378363">In this case, the Appellees are executors of estates that included among their property state or local public housing agency project notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.954" offset="438027">The question before the Court is whether testamentary transfer of those project notes is exempt from the federal estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.181" offset="486928">In urging that the testamentary transfer is not exempt, we have two grounds, either of which would independently support a judgment in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.904" offset="561742">Our principal contention is that the transfer of such notes never was exempted from the federal estate tax by the Federal Housing Act of 1937, the so-called Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.018" offset="654216">Our other contention is that even if they had been so exempted, Congress repealed that exemption in 1984 for taxpayers situated such as the Appellees, and that contrary to the District Court's holding, the application of that repealer provision was not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.924" offset="753899">There are three reasons why we urge that the Court should address our principal contention first, that the transfer never was exempt from federal estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.768" offset="829236">The first is that if we are correct about this statutory issue, it avoids the necessity of addressing a constitutional contention or even the necessity of construing the effect of the 1984 Repealer Provision in light of the constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.626" offset="932681">The second reason why we believe that question should be addressed first is that there are presently pending, the Internal Revenue Service has done a survey on this, 101 cases which would not be disposed of were the decision to rest on grounds of the scope or constitutionality of the 1984 Repealer Provision because there were 101 cases pending, either administratively or in the courts, with a total value of project notes at issue of slightly more than $90 million, in which the returns were filed after the Haffner decision came down in 1984, and no tax was reported as owing on these returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.140" offset="1202787">They are cases that would be controlled by whether or not Haffner was correctly decided, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="438.285" offset="1879359">Under the 1937 Act, which was the only issue before the Tax Court since the Repealer Provision, would not have affected the Tax Court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.322" offset="1911437">Now, the third reason why we think that the Court should first consider that question is because we think it is the correct answer that Congress never did have to retroactively repeal an exemption that never existed, and so far as we can tell, that's what Congress itself thought when it enacted the Repealer Provision less than three months after the District Court decision in Haffner without even waiting to see whether the Court of Appeals would affirm or reverse the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.263" offset="2107251">Now, on this issue, the District Court in our case simply relied on the District Court decision in Haffner.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.371" offset="2151659">So, we'll turn to the analysis used by the District Court in Haffner.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.116" offset="2178618">That decision surely is one of the most remarkable, is one of the most remarked-upon tax decisions of our time, in that it discovered a tax exemption that had lain dormant for almost forty-five years, a tax exemption of very elastic scope which had gone unnoticed by the Tax Bar, unclaimed by taxpayers, and unrecognized by either the Internal Revenue Service or any court for a period of almost forty-five years, and the Court did so while conceding in its opinion that the language used by Congress in the 1937 Act would not in itself be sufficient to confer this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.262" offset="2439215">That language is set forth in the Appendix to our brief on pages 2A and 3A at the very end of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.360" offset="2499610">It's Section 5(e), which provides in the second sentence that obligations issued by these local public housing authorities and then skipping to the end of the paragraph</text>
            <text syncTime="609.051" offset="2562409">"shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="617.479" offset="2596054">As the Tax Court recently said in Estate of Egger, that language had been definitively interpreted by this Court as well as other courts by 1937, at the time the Wagner Housing Act was enacted, and it had been definitively interpreted to apply to taxes on the obligations or the income themselves, income or property taxes, and not to taxes on the transfer of the securities, namely estate or gift taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.366" offset="2767627">The interpretation of such statutory provisions, and we have collected the cases on pages 18 and 19 of our brief, in a lengthy footnote as well as in the text, the interpretation was closely tied in to the constitutional question of the validity of the estate and gift tax in light of the requirement of Article I, Section IX of the Constitution, that direct taxes must be apportioned among the states, and the reason why nothing comparable to the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution authorizing the income tax had to be adopted for purposes of the estate and gift tax is because the Court in the cases we cite had definitely held that the estate and gift taxes are not taxes on the obligations, but are taxes on the act of transfer.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.252" offset="3059153">Then, Mr. Wallace, why would there be specific exemption language in Section 20 of the earlier act?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="744.282" offset="3103352">Well, that brings me, Mr. Justice, to the first ground relied upon, we think erroneously, by the Court in Haffner, the difference in the drafting between this language we just looked at in Section 5 and the language that appears on the next page, which is Section 20(b) of the 1937 Act, a provision which has not existed in the Act since 1949, and that is referring to obligations of the Federal Housing Authority, a federal agency, which was to furnish money to the state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.989" offset="3262177">It says that though it shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation, except sur taxes, estate, inheritance and gift taxes, now or hereafter imposed by the United States or any state or local taxing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.421" offset="3335842">The principal difference, and we think the basis of the error in the Haffner case, is that looked upon in historical context, this was a much more limited exemption from income taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.936" offset="3421942">From 1913 until 1954, the income tax was really divided into two taxes; what was basically the flat rate at a rather low level income tax, and the graduated aspect of it, called the sur tax, and the taxable income was defined slightly differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.881" offset="3529671">The determination was made with respect to the federal obligations that they, unlike the obligations of the local housing authorities, would be exempted from the flat tax which, in 1937, was a four percent tax, but they would not be exempted from the graduated aspect of the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.546" offset="3624338">The sur tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.199" offset="3630921">And, therefore, it was necessary in drafting this provision to put in an exception to accomplish the result Congress wanted to accomplish, to say except sur taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.587" offset="3684525">Once an exception was mentioned, then cautious draftsmanship would call for enumerating all the exceptions to ward off the possibility of an argument that expressio unius est exclusio alterius, as it's sometimes called.</text>

            <text syncTime="949.309" offset="3923388">We have on page 29 of our brief collected a number of references to other federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.725" offset="3953063">This was the standard mode of including exemption from taxation for federal obligations, whereas 5E reflected the standard mode that was used in formulating an-exemption from state obligations which was a broader exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.980" offset="4038118">We have in the Footnote on page 29 and in the related text, a number of other examples that use the same standard mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.737" offset="4077093">The other point to be kept in mind is that these two provisions were not drafted simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.813" offset="4113455">Section 20(b) was carried over from a bill that was first drafted in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.991" offset="4154102">It was carried over to another one in '36, and then finally to this one in '37, whereas Section 5E was drafted in 1937, almost surely by different people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.131" offset="4206660">So that it is as we term in our reply brief, fallacious to compare the two as if they were intentionally drafted by the same person to accomplish two different results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.711" offset="4260995">Instead, they are reach a standard form of accomplishing what was an established result at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.925" offset="4293909">I'd like to turn next to the remaining items in the legislative history that are relied upon either in the Haffner opinion or in our opponent's briefs in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.834" offset="4401533">Keeping in mind, however, that relying on these matters, none of which is unequivocal as we shall see, is really contrary to the established principle stated over and over again by this Court, that tax exemptions do not rest upon implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.380" offset="4499649">They have to be unequivocally stated in the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.205" offset="4518980">So, the entire inquiry that was undertaken in Haffner once the Court admitted that the language used by Congress would not support the exemption was really contrary to this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.457" offset="4576031">The first thing relied upon was a statement made on the Floor by Senator Walsh in the course of a lengthy statement interrupted by many colloquies, many of which consisted of corrections of things that Senator Walsh had been saying, and the particular paragraph from the Congressional Record, I'd like to read it in full, so the Court will get the flavor of it, was as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.867" offset="4705599">"Obligations, including interest thereon, issued by public housing agencies and income derived by such agencies on such projects are to be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.949" offset="4778010">"In other words, the bill gives the public housing agencies the right to issue tax-exempt bonds, which means they are free from income tax, sur tax, estate, gift and inheritance taxes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.709" offset="4837047">It is that appositional clause which means, which is the basis on which the Appellees and the Court in Haffner relied on, Senator Walsh's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.943" offset="4905906">Our view is that this is simply a mis-description of what the meaning is for a bond to be exempt from all taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.280" offset="4959300">What it means to issue a tax-exempt bond that had been clearly established in the Court's cases, and it was stated in a way that suggested that this would be the ordinary tax-exempt bonds, such as municipal bonds, which have never been exempt from estate and gift taxes, and he was merely parathetically describing the attributes of a tax-exempt bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.179" offset="5070895">This is not the way that the Congress unequivocally would adopt so pronounced a change from the ordinary way of doing business in conferring tax exemptions on municipal and other local bonds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.690" offset="5808907">So, they just went on to something else, and one could hardly attribute significance of the sort required for an unequivocal conferral of a tax exemption to the fact that no one happened to rise at an inopportune moment on the Floor of the Senate to correct this mis-description that occurred in the course of Senator Walsh's remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.802" offset="5925413">Now, the two other matters on which the Appellees and the Court relied are, if anything, even less substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.998" offset="5970134">One is the fact that an alternative bill, the Ickes Bill, had a more comprehensively-drafted exemption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.090" offset="6034500">That was a bill that differed in many important respects from the Wagner Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.564" offset="6060413">A written statement was submitted to the committee on behalf of Secretary Ickes, describing in some detail the differences between the two bills, no mention was made of any difference in tax consequences between the two bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.259" offset="6143169">It was the Wagner Bill that was reported out of committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.640" offset="6156753">There was no indication that anyone on the committee thought that a choice was being made with respect to tax consequences of these project notes, and certainly even less reason to think anyone on the Floor was aware of any difference in the draftsmanship between the two bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.746" offset="6237210">And, finally, the reference is made to a speech that was made by a federal official after the enactment of the Wagner Housing Act, a speech by Mr. Warren Vinton, which expressed the view that these notes would be exempt from transfer taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.369" offset="6335640">That speech displayed considerable confusion on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.225" offset="6355075">Mr. Vinton was not a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.107" offset="6362598">He had been helpful in aspects of the legislative history of the housing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.116" offset="6406693">He was an employee of the Department of Agriculture, the Resettlement Administration there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.131" offset="6426650">He knew something about low-cost housing, but he was not definitively interpreting the statute on behalf of either the agency that would be issuing the bonds, which was the state or local agencies, or on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service, which has the responsibility to construe the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.829" offset="6529468">I would like to reserve the balance of my time, if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.419" offset="6587878">This case comes down to whether the United States Government may refuse to return a citizen's money for no other reason than that the Government has acquired possession of that money and the District Court quite properly answered that question in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.745" offset="6641168">I'll turn first to the question as to whether project notes are exempt from federal estate tax under the 1937 Housing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.032" offset="6678262">As the Government recognized, the starting point is the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.426" offset="6695920">Section 5(e) of the '37 Act, which exempted project notes unequivocally from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.902" offset="6737821">Section 20(b) contained a much more limited exemption for federal housing obligations, not project notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.639" offset="6768750">These obligations were exempt from all taxation except inheritance taxes relative to estate taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.243" offset="6795186">Mr. Rotstein, if all we had before us was the language of Section 5(e) and we didn't have the language Section 20, would you concede that the Government's position is correct in that we would not ordinarily give that broad language such a broad effect?</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.844" offset="6865507">Your Honor, I would so concede if there was not also the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.266" offset="6883271">I believe, although it would be a tougher case, if you had the legislative history plus just the Section 5(e) exemption, I would still say that project notes are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.782" offset="6917334">Fortunately, you have a simpler case here because you do have Section 20(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.723" offset="6929037">Now, the Government argues that Section 5(e) doesn't exempt project notes by relying on a line of cases, beginning with Murdock v. Ward, which holds that exemptions for all taxation in certain circumstances relating to bonds don't include an exemption for the estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.059" offset="7022451">These cases make a distinction between a direct tax on a bond and a transfer tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.232" offset="7047111">The courts recognized recently that this is a formalistic distinction without economic consequences, and significantly none of the statutes considered in the Murdock line contain statutory language like 1937 Act, that has two sections; one with a blanket exemption and one with a more limited exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.724" offset="7121089">Similarly, none of the cases in the Murdock line consider statutes as legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.560" offset="7148466">So, it clearly shows that Congress intended to bestow an estate tax exemption on the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.125" offset="7182634">Now, we discussed the legislative history in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.299" offset="7199352">I won't repeat it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.841" offset="7205517">It is unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.070" offset="7210428">I just want to comment, make the comment that the Government really offers no affirmative history to the effect that Congress intended to subject project notes to the estate tax, and absent such affirmative evidence, there's no reason to disregard the plain meaning of the '37 Act and the legislative history affirmatively showing that project notes were exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.936" offset="7301961">And, so, the Government actually resorts to--</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.941" offset="7513971">You may call it a formalistic distinction, but the fact is when you tax the bonds, you're imposing an annual tax or some other tax on the bonds themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.747" offset="7557125">This estate tax does not apply until... unless and until there's a transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.271" offset="7579277">So, it's really a tax on the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.444" offset="7587950">You may call that formalistic, but that's plain language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.649" offset="7608743">We're not denying that, but the plain language argument is simply that when you look at the '37 Act and compare Section 5(e) and 20(b), it couldn't mean anything, 5(e) could not have any other meaning than a congressional intent to exempt project notes from the estate tax, read in light of 20(b) as the statutes are to be read.</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.435" offset="7691917">The Government falls back on two arguments that we believe are really only attempts to elicit a visceral antagonism to the District Court's interpretation of Section 5(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.690" offset="7740923">They first argue that Section 5(e) couldn't have exempted project notes from the estate tax because to do so would have resulted in wholesale avoidance of estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.169" offset="7790869">First, this is merely an impermissible attempt to have the Court rewrite the 1937 Act, but, second, it's inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.914" offset="7817827">In 1937, when Congress passed the 1937 Act, far from being concerned that all taxpayers are going to run out and buy project notes, they were concerned that there wouldn't be a market for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.884" offset="7869759">So, from the perspective of the 75th Congress, there's no reason to believe that they were concerned and, in fact, there's reason to believe that the estate tax exemption was an incentive to make project notes saleable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.815" offset="7917406">The Government also argues that Section 5(e) exemption couldn't include an exemption from estate tax because the Tax Bar was taken by surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.911" offset="7969860">With due respect to the Tax Bar, I don't think it would be the first time that they were surprised by a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.207" offset="7999013">I'll quote Justice Frankfurter, I'll take the risk of doing it,</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.330" offset="8011447">"wisdom too often never comes, so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes too late. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.244" offset="8031196">Just because the Tax Bar became wise a little late doesn't mean we should reject the proper interpretation of Section 5(e) of the 1937 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.963" offset="8074036">I'll next turn briefly to the question of the proper interpretation of Section 641(b)(2) of the Deficit Reduction Act, which the Government says, irrespective of what Section 5(e) means under the 1937 Act, retroactively taxes the estates here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.726" offset="8157106">As we discuss in our brief, it's a proper construction of Section 641(b)(2) that it should not be construed retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.322" offset="8199424">That will avoid the serious constitutional questions raised by retroactive interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.238" offset="8223143">I just want to make two additional points to the ones we make in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.240" offset="8239130">Under the Government's interpretation, Section 641(b)(2) by implication repeals an estate's right to sue for refund, and it does so by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.029" offset="8282285">This right has been established for decades and given the fact that there was very little, if no, legislative consideration of Section 641(b)(2), it's not plausible that Congress would have had such an intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.145" offset="8334738">This leads to the next point and that is when, in enacting DEFRA in 1984, Congress wanted to repeal a right to refund, it said so explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.351" offset="8371623">They did so in DEFRA Section 2662(g), which, in much clearer language, makes the statute there retroactive and in the legislative history of which Congress specifically said that they wanted to repeal a right for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.864" offset="8445602">So, juxtaposing 641(b)(2) with 2662(g), as a matter of statutory construction and, I believe, logic, would lead to the conclusion that in enacting Section 641(b)(2), Congress didn't intent to make the section retroactive, and that has the presence for a non-retroactive interpretation in the opinions of this Court in Schwab v. Doyle and Hessett v. Welch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.701" offset="8544972">Now, I want to indicate what will happen here if the Government's interpretation of Section 641(b)(2) as being retroactive prevails, and that is that taxpayers are going to be encouraged in doubtful cases to take aggressive positions vis-a-vis the taxability of an item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.394" offset="8627728">That is, in a doubtful case, because Section 641(b)(2) retroactively applied penalizes the reporting taxpayer, the conservative taxpayer, the taxpayers will be more likely not to report a doubtful item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.335" offset="8691467">In other words, taxpayers will be encouraged to play the audit lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.739" offset="8705155">This goes against mainstream tax thinking and congressional thinking that has been established for years and the concomitant costs to the Government, I think, are evident.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.947" offset="11261916">The record indicates that they paid the tax and reported them as taxable by virtue of the Revenue Ruling, and at that point, that was the only public pronouncement of any kind regarding the taxability of project notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.030" offset="11330252">Section 641(b)(2) retroactively applied also works to violate the due process clause by depriving the estates here of procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.215" offset="11411022">By precluding judicial review of the question whether project notes are exempt from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.070" offset="11446445">The Government in its reply characterizes Section 641(b)(2) as merely a substantive change in the law, but in its opening brief, the Government, I think, more accurately describes Section 641(b)(2) as permitting certain taxpayers who did not report project notes as taxable but not the estates here</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.816" offset="11529409">"to continue to litigate the questions of taxability. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.217" offset="11542993">At the same time, the Government describes the effect of Section 641 as permitting the non-reporting taxpayer</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.591" offset="11568593">"to go ahead and have their day in court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.652" offset="11576743">These are words of procedural due process and they're accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.278" offset="11599313">The executors have been deprived of their day in court by virtue of the Government's invocation of DEFRA Section on 641(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.585" offset="11632541">Effectively, the Government's interpretation of Section 641(b)(2) has caught the estates in a procedural trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.860" offset="11665664">On day one, there were two equally available and well-established alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.804" offset="11681442">One, the estates could have chosen not to pay the tax and to litigate the matter in Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.767" offset="11705266">Two, they could have, as they did, pay the tax, expecting that at least for the statutory period, they had the right to bring a suit in District Court or the Court of Claims for a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.524" offset="11748316">It's been established that these two alternatives are equally available and both there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.278" offset="11767333">Now, retroactive interpretation of Section 641 (b)(2) would take away that second alternative, the one that the estates here took, yet because the estates chose that second avenue, they can no longer invoke the jurisdiction of the Tax Court, yet there are individuals out there in the Tax Court still litigating the issue of the taxability of project notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.504" offset="11868165">The due process clause prohibits just that type of procedural trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.467" offset="11884048">Finally, the District Court found that Section 641(b)(2) retroactively applied violates the equal protection clause and that's accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.955" offset="11925948">Section 641 sets up a classification that distinguishes between executors who listed project notes as taxable on a return and those who did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.889" offset="11961684">This classification bears no rationale relationship to any legitimate government purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.534" offset="11984358">It taxes the estates here that conservatively paid their taxes and reported project notes as taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.077" offset="12010480">It exonerates other similarly-situated executors whose decedents died the same days as the decedents here, whose executors filed tax returns on the same day, and yet who, for some reason, didn't report project notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.788" offset="12065338">Perhaps taking an aggressive position, perhaps just forgetting to do so, acting negligently, and Section 641(b)(2) would tax the estates here, but would not tax the common evader who decedent died the same day as Dr. Stein, but who failed to file a return at all for the purpose of evading other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.012" offset="12150183">The only real justification that the Government offers for the classification of Section 641(b)(2) is that it gives its expectations as to the decedents' belief as to taxability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.863" offset="12213609">It gives effect to those expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.475" offset="12220087">In other words, the Government says that reporting position on a return is equivalent to the taxpayer's expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.181" offset="12250911">That's flawed for two reasons, and it doesn't set forth the rationale classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.323" offset="12271496">First, it incorrectly focuses on the executor's expectation and it's the decedent who was the individual charged with planning the estate and who relied on the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.692" offset="12320920">And, second, in our tax system, traditionally reporting hasn't been a gauge of a taxpayer's expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.788" offset="12349341">It's not a rationale gauge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.588" offset="12356551">It's been given in the tax system that a taxpayer may either choose to sue in the District Court and pay the tax, as we did, or to pay in Tax Court, and there are many reasons unrelated to a taxpayer's expectation as to taxability as to why the taxpayer would go ahead and pay the tax and sue in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.405" offset="12455816">One, just in general, is that a taxpayer may want to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court or the Court of Claims rather than the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.462" offset="12487999">Secondly, there may be a case farther along in the system, and rather than risk interest payments, penalty payments, the taxpayer may just file a return, pay the tax, and await the outcome of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.972" offset="12554036">Here, especially where you have an estate, as we do here, it may be prudent for an executor to pay the tax and file a claim for refund in order to ward off the possibility of interest and penalties in prudent exercise of the executor's fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.825" offset="12621432">That's especially true in a case like this where the Internal Revenue Service has taken a position that project notes were taxable, contrary to what the law is, and even after Haffner, so aggressive was the Internal Revenue Service's position that they indicated they were going to continue to litigate the matter, notwithstanding the Haffner opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.077" offset="12706487">On the other side of the coin, the decision not to report is not a rationale indicator of a taxpayer's expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.624" offset="12736685">The most obvious example is the taxpayer whom, to avoid taxes, fails to file a return at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.691" offset="12768972">Presumably, the failure to file a return, the failure to report any items is because the taxpayer believes the items to be taxable, yet doesn't want to be subject to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.679" offset="12816933">So, there's a failure to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.161" offset="12822784">There is simply no rationale basis for the classifications set forth in 641(b)(2) if applied retroactively, and the equal protection problem stems, we believe, from the hasty enactment and the lack of consideration given to Section 641(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.757" offset="12925184">It was the fertile environment for passing a law that sets forth in a rationale classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.380" offset="12947649">In the time I have left, I'll briefly summarize why the District Court's judgment should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.715" offset="12973040">First, project notes are exempt from federal estate taxation under the United States Housing Act of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.100" offset="13006582">This follows both from the statutory structure and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.024" offset="13022255">Second, DEFRA Section 641(b)(2) based on the precedence of the Court need not be interpreted retroactively but can be interpreted prospectively only to avoid the constitutional questions yet affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.002" offset="13078157">If interpreted retroactively, Section 641(b)(2) violates the due process clause, both because it's a harsh, oppressive and arbitrary retroactive tax, and because it deprives the estates here to the right of judicial review on the Haffner claim by virtue of the Government's invocation of Section 641(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.475" offset="13160077">And, finally, Section 641(b)(2) retroactively applied violates the equal protection component by setting forth an arbitrary and irrational classification between reporting taxpayers and non-reporting taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.715" offset="13213053">Therefore, treating the Appellees' estates less favorably than a common tax evader.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.189" offset="13230921">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.264" offset="13255267">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.593" offset="13260596">Mr. Rotstein has devoted most of his argument to the issues which we have urged that the Court need not reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.637" offset="13292675">I will comment briefly with respect to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.381" offset="13315662">In both cases, the claim for a refund was not filed until after the District Court's decision in Haffner came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.769" offset="13357249">In the Wells Fargo case, this was two and a half years after the filing of the estate tax return, in the other case, more than one year after the filing of the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.959" offset="13410017">Presumably, a fiduciary who filed the return believing that he has over-paid the taxes would act promptly so as to secure the funds and pass them along to the beneficiaries of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.259" offset="13471248">It's quite apparent that they acted not in reliance upon their thoughts at the time of filing the returns, but in reliance upon the Haffner decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.608" offset="13520567">Now, there's nothing wrong with that, but no matter how Congress acted, unless it was going to go into a case-by-case determination, it could not satisfy everybody's expectations with respect to the Haffner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.202" offset="13590993">Even if the new statute had been completely prospective, not every taxpayer who, after Haffner came down, might have transferred his assets into project notes in reliance on Haffner, would have had the foresight to die before June 19th, 1984, and, therefore, those taxpayers' expectations would have been thwarted notwithstanding their reliance on the Haffner decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.405" offset="13727770">And as this Court's leading modern case on the retroactivity of tax legislation, United States v. Darismont in 449 US, explains in detail most tax legislation has some retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.794" offset="13793390">Here, Congress surely could have within the rule of Darismont made the entire repealer retroactive and treated all taxpayers the way they had all been acting for the previous forty years and the way the future ones would have to act, namely paying tax on the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.450" offset="13880012">Instead, Congress chose to mitigate this slightly by selecting a very restricted class of persons that would be confined to those in the same situation as the Haffner taxpayers who had done something in reliance on this, but did make it retroactively applicable to the great bulk of taxpayers, most of whom would be just applying for an unexpected windfall if they happened to fall within the dates properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.083" offset="14022536">I believe we're ready to submit the case, unless there are further questions.</text>
