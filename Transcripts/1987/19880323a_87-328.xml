            <label>Mr. Lacy H. Thornburg</label>
            <text syncTime="13.714" offset="191113">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the honorable Court, North Carolina is here today because of the lower courts' interpretations of your decisions in the Munson and Schaumburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.817" offset="243567">The lower courts' interpretations effectively eliminate the state's police power to regulate the for profit commercial operator who solicits funds for charities.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.875" offset="295811">Now, Schaumberg and Munson held that a state's limitations on the amount a charity could spend for fundraising activities violated the charity's First Amendment rights to free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.074" offset="348579">North Carolina has placed no limitation on the amount a charity may spend to get its message out.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.461" offset="378149">In fact, North Carolina's policy is to promote and to protect the charities because of the fundraising efforts of the charity, and this is the historic parens patriae relationship between a state and a charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.705" offset="439171">The North Carolina approach regulates two troublesome economic practices of the commercial fundraiser dealing with reasonableness of fees and also point of solicitation disclosure, and eliminates a privilege that was previously given to the commercial fundraiser to operate before being fully licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.321" offset="521614">Now, the lower court overlooked the distinction between the publicly supported charity and the commercial fundraiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.880" offset="551811">North Carolina in this statutory scheme seeks only to regulate the professional fundraiser under its police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.548" offset="586502">Now, by way of factual background, for a number of years in the state of North Caroline we have mirrored the national practice and problems with the commercial fundraiser as shown by the uncontested record in the case, the difficulties, and the most frequent complaints that were experienced in North Carolina with the fundraisers related to high fees and costs which caused low returns to the charities, a lack of disclosure of fees at the time of solicitation, and frequently the unauthorized use of the charities names at the time solicitations were being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.423" offset="745953">Now, to assess the factual basis for these fee concerns, I had my staff do an analysis of the reports of five of the largest fundraising groups in North Carolina for the period from 1980 to 1984, and this showed, this analysis showed that charities were receiving on the average less than 20 percent of the total funds that were collected from this source, in other words, 80 percent was regularly going another direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.128" offset="884820">The other complaints that I mentioned were verified through Better Business Bureaus and Chambers of Commerce and charities and individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.109" offset="916794">Now, an examination of the law revealed that for the State of North Carolina there was no definition of fundraising fees on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.448" offset="966113">There was no requirement that the commercial fundraiser charge reasonable fees, and there was no requirement for point of disclosure of factual fee data at the time of solicitation, and further it was discovered in the law that the commercial operator was allowed the privilege of beginning the solicitation process without being fully licensed to do so or before the license was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.827" offset="1079589">Now, when these deficiencies were brought to the attention of the North Carolina General Assembly, the legislature enacted the statutes that are before you today in this case, and we contend that the purpose of the statutes is set out in the statute, to protect the general public and to protect the charities, and also is in keeping with what Professor Karsch in his Harvard Law Review looks to as saying that we should conserve and use the greatest portion of the wealth donated to further the public charitable purpose, and also adds that waste should be minimized and the diversion of funds for private gain is intolerable.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.590" offset="1266626">General Thornburg, if that is your objective, to make sure that as much money that is collected goes to the charitable purposes, it seems to me that a much more efficient way than requiring the fundraiser agent to say what percentage of his collected funds went to the charity, not in this campaign but in prior campaigns, a much more effective way would be to require the charity itself, whether it operates directly or through an agent, to tell the prospective donor how much of the donor's money is going to go directly to the intended recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.854" offset="1431720">For example, requiring the Red Cross to say that X percent of the money you give us is expended on salaries of our officers and employees, and X percent goes to the donees whom you think are going to be getting this money.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lacy H. Thornburg</label>
            <text syncTime="691.969" offset="2904190">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.579" offset="2910669">By way of further reference to the disclosure aspects, North Carolina's history had been that we have had no trouble with the charities and the difficulty, the problem had come from the fundraiser, and that is what triggered the enactment of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.056" offset="2988513">What the legislation did was define what a fundraising fee was, prohibited unreasonable fees, established a procedure to allow inquiry into these fees that were being charged, authorize the regulator to set a reasonable fee after a full hearing if the fee charged was found to be unreasonable mandated the factual point of disclosure or point of solicitation disclosure, and prohibited commercial operations until the licensure was complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.012" offset="3108363">Now, the definition was added to the statute as to what a fundraising fee was, and unreasonable fundraising fees were made unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.007" offset="3148383">Now, percentage guidelines were added to assist the factfinder in determination of the reasonableness of a particular fee at issue, and to meet the concern about First Amendment rights of charities when they opt to speak through the commercial fundraiser the legislature established specific rules to require a finding of reasonableness when the high fee charged was caused by the speech or advocacy requirements of the charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.230" offset="3273248">Now, the statute does not place a percentage limitation on the fundraiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.244" offset="3293310">It merely sets up levels that shift the burden of producing evidence from one party to the other at specified levels above 20 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.098" offset="3332703">Now, factual mandatory disclosure has minimal First Amendment implications in the commercial context, which is what we are attempting to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.109" offset="3372722">The pharmacy cases and the lawyer cases recognize that disclosure operates to inform the potential user of the service, and it is uncontested that the entity required to disclose here is a commercial operator, and what must be disclosed is factual information about past fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.788" offset="3475436">And we contend this Court has held that a state may require this type of disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.050" offset="3496543">Now, arguments that the heightened free speech rights of the charities should carry over to a commercial operator, thereby eliminating the state's authority to regulate the activities of the for profit commercial operator we contend should be rejected because the speech rights of the charity are not impacted by the disclosure requirement placed on a hired fundraiser.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="867.071" offset="3604585">General Thornburg, suppose... you say this is just commercial and has nothing to do with free speech rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.741" offset="3631230">Suppose political candidates hire Hollywood personalities to further their political cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.204" offset="3669160">Do you think... and these personalities do it for pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.453" offset="3686087">Do you think the state could impose a requirement that before the famous actor makes a pitch for a particular candidate he would have to say at the beginning, I want you to know that I am doing this for pay, and my usual fee is thus and such?</text>
            <text syncTime="905.650" offset="3758917">That is just... do you think you could do that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lacy H. Thornburg</label>
            <text syncTime="908.086" offset="3768634">I think we could do that if it's strictly commercial aspects, Your Honor, and that's what we are trying to say, is, if you use... if you are paying somebody to do that, then you have to reveal at the point of... at the point of solicitation a disclosure as to what your practice has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.968" offset="3832164">Now, you will note the information that has to be disclosed, all it says is just two or three things there that have to be told.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.809" offset="3867586">It doesn't say how they are being told or how you qualified or what they tell in addition to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.918" offset="3887962">It is not a censorship matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.432" offset="3897993">It's a matter of just requiring disclosure of minimum information.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.822" offset="3915547">And we contend that fee disclosure by a separate entity used by a charity on an occasional basis neither requires the charity to speak nor prohibits it from speaking, any message that it wants, and public policy requires this.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.594" offset="3994646">Otherwise, any commercial operator could limit the state's regulation by using the name of a charity to apply to its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.731" offset="4027247">Now, why the difference between disclosure as to a commercial operator and not the charity?</text>
            <text syncTime="981.104" offset="4060683">Our position is that the commercial operator is and has been the source of the problem in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.835" offset="4087642">The views and the conducts, the fundraising operation as a business is involved and usually works on a percentage of gross receipts and the incentive is to obtain as many donations as quickly as possible, which indicates or suggests that you give very little information or it is almost an open invitation if you do give information to give some, misrepresentations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.731" offset="4195266">Now, usually, one of the problems is, they are usually transitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.432" offset="4209999">Set up a phone bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.916" offset="4215955">Hire a few employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.822" offset="4223583">Conduct the solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.524" offset="4230375">Collect the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.571" offset="4234554">And within a short period of time the fundraiser is gone, and clearly the public's expectation is that the lion's share of these proceeds are going to the charity, and actually, in reality, in North Carolina, as indicated in our joint appendix, where it is set out in full, usually less than 20 percent is going to the charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.701" offset="4327132">Now, we say that such a discrepancy and a disparity is ultimately going to cripple the charitable fundraising throughout the state because once the people are finally told or they get the message that this much of the money is going into some place other than the charity, then it is going to make it more and more difficult to raise money in this or any other fashion, because the amount of money there is limited, of course, while the number of charities and the number of requests continues to grow.</text>

            <text syncTime="1771.485" offset="7222231">The Court has ruled twice in this decade that charitable solicitation is entitled to full First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.810" offset="7247518">It is a matter of constitutional indifference whether the activity is carried out by the charity directly or through a professional representative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.674" offset="7362979">Those who speak for the charitable community would answer by noting that if it is the aim of the charity to help, it has missed by a wide margin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.967" offset="7404148">What the state in fact has done is to create a statutory scheme based upon the subjective test of reasonableness which creates a very real and present danger of censorship.</text>
