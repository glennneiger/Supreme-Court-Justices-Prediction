            <text syncTime="302.339" offset="1346314">Do you think that the Eighth Circuit saw this case as kind of an estoppel case where the school board had in effect told the students you are going to have complete First Amendment rights, or do you think that they saw it as a case that it did not make any difference what the school board said, that once you some students over loose on a newspaper that they have got those First Amendment rights whether the school board wants to have it or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="344.677" offset="1515692">And therefore, having opened the Hazelwood East Spectrum to articles of diverse opinion, the board of education and the principal would then have been estopped--</text>

            <text syncTime="358.935" offset="1572744">And we submit that the record that we developed in the trial court and that the trial court found in its 21 findings of fact did not support that, nor did the Eighth Circuit when they found that find anything clearly erroneous in the findings of fact of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.728" offset="1651947">So what we have here, again if I may respectfully continue, is a newspaper which is generated in the second semester by students who have been taught certain values in journalism such as responsible journalism, journalistic ethics, copying, writing, story development, ideas and that sort of thing, and then these students are brought into Journalism II to practice that art under the supervision of that teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.629" offset="1775558">And in the practice of that art the teacher, as the evidence in the trial court was adduced, the teacher then gave these students story lines to be developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.845" offset="1816414">The students developed those story lines, and those story lines were then submitted back and forth to the teacher for as many as four or five revisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.681" offset="1855702">Evidence in the trial court indicated by the Respondent's own witnesses that a story, for example, in this newspaper on diabetes was not printed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.937" offset="1896767">So the student had gone through the process of developing a story on diabetes, but it just was not printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.812" offset="1916202">Students were given grades whether they printed a story in this publication or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.576" offset="1947340">So they were graded not only on whether there was ultimate publication or whether their article or their effort was not published.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.581" offset="1979314">Some students did not participate particularly in the writing of articles, but their major job was in the layout, editing, and other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.538" offset="2011183">In fact, the three Plaintiffs in this case are not the authors of the story in question, but rather were active in the production of the newspaper as layout editor, and one of the Plaintiffs I think assisted in the design of a graph that was used in the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.678" offset="2079728">In the May 13th issue of the Spectrum, it was proposed to be a six page newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.697" offset="2127794">One additional fact which I think is important in this case is that the teacher who had taught these students in the fall and was teaching these students in the spring semester on April 29th was granted permission by the board of education to leave education and go get a job, had a better offer in private industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.669" offset="2207728">The board of education through the administration appointed an administrative level journalism teacher as a substitute teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.296" offset="2246181">The trial court found that this substitute teacher was a highly qualified teacher, and as a matter of fact was the administrative person to supervise journalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.400" offset="2278572">And the reason that they appointed such a qualified person to do that is that it was at the end of the year, and two responsibilities remained of the Journalism II class.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.876" offset="2312532">One was the production of the final two newspapers, one of which was the May 13th edition, and the other one was the class legacy paper which came out later, both of which according to the testimony were about 90 percent complete when teacher number one left and teacher number two came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.166" offset="2381704">And the other was the production of the yearbook, a highly complex project on the part of the students, which needed to be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.274" offset="2414096">So the administration sent in a very qualified teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.806" offset="2432277">When that teacher received the articles from the students and reviewed them, he attempted to contact, as the evidence in trial court showed, he attempted to contact the principal about these stories as he had an objection to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.544" offset="2487134">He was unable to do that, so he went and put them into proof and sent the proof to the principal, and asked the principal his opinion about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.199" offset="2517750">And the principal said that those stories because they involved the subject matter that was in them, the story of the three young pregnant ladies who told how they got pregnant, whether they used birth control, the reaction of the father of the child, the reaction of their parents to the pregnancy, and other items, and the article on divorce where a freshman gave a story of why or the recounting of why she believed her parents got divorced and her name was involved, the principal said to Mr. Emerson, who was then the substitute teacher, what can be done about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.328" offset="2686292">Now you recall that I stated that it was a six page newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.169" offset="2701652">The principal thought at this time and the trial court found, and no one has set aside this fact, the trial court found that the principal believed that Mr. Emerson, the substitute teacher, was at the printers and he needed a yes or no answer at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.359" offset="2762465">If he said yes, it would be printed; if he said no, something had to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.183" offset="2777720">The principal said what could be done, and Mr. Emerson said we can delete page four and five, and make page six into page four, and we have got a four page paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.710" offset="2815859">The principal said go ahead and do that, and that is what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.212" offset="2837802">So the articles that the principal had an objection to were the articles involving the recounting of the tales of the pregnancy of three school girls and the recounting of the tale of why the parents of one of the freshman, in fact several parents of students, but particularly one named freshman's parents got a divorce, were deleted and the paper was then printed and distributed to the class.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.349" offset="3434438">It said while that there was nothing in there was really that outstandingly bad, but they reckoned that the principal could understand the school audience as well as anyone else in that some of the information in those articles might make it appear that because it was produced in a classroom exercise that the school in effect had condoned the activities of these children, of these young ladies who had gotten pregnant, for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="877.934" offset="3648747">This was not written and carried about in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.267" offset="3662122">I think that in looking at the story and the way that it was presented in the trial court and not found to be erroneous by the Court of Appeals was the fact that the lead in these three pregnancy stories, the names have been changed to grant these young ladies anonymity.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.652" offset="3755640">And the trial court found that the principal by reading the article felt that he knew who the children were, who the young ladies were.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.668" offset="3791689">And if that was the case, he felt that others would know who they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.340" offset="3806318">And if the purpose espoused on the article was to grant them anonymity, the article failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.104" offset="3829410">Now again we have to take this in the context of the fact that the trial court felt that when the principal had the question placed to him by the substitute teacher that he had to make a decision, you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.375" offset="3890536">And he looked at the article and he said I know who these girls are.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.665" offset="3903702">He looked at the article about the divorce, and he said he know who this girl is and I know who her parents are.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.481" offset="3926899">I do not think that the parents have had an opportunity to respond, the issue of fairness and balance is missing in that article.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.716" offset="3959918">The trial court specifically commented on his finding of the credibility of the principal in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.079" offset="3989279">So when you take into consideration the fact that the trial court found that there was a protectable interest even espoused by the article, and that is the girls should remain anonymous and the article did not protect that, we feel that the court found that it was not a public forum, that it was adopted on a curriculum basis, and that as a curricula writing that it was subject to the control of the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.671" offset="4119683">The Eighth Circuit really said well, the school can only do that when the issue would subject the school to tort liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.820" offset="4172241">And in this case, the Eighth Circuit felt that the only liability was for the invasion of privacy of the girls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.267" offset="4210066">And since the girls had given their consent, obviously their privacy could not be invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.150" offset="4237652">We differ with that somewhat, since also the article mentioned the parents of the girl, the husband of the girl, the decision of whether or not to use birth control, and how the sexual activities occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.078" offset="4285299">So there were other people who were interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.199" offset="4293763">But we do not think that tort liability is really an appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.413" offset="4314661">That here the interests that a school has in the well-being of the students far exceeds whether or not the coffers of the district are going to be damaged by the onslaught of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.214" offset="4381847">Although Judge Wolman in his dissent said that the majority's decision in the Eighth Circuit put the school district between the Scylla of suit by the students and the Charybdis of suit by somebody else who was offended by what the students wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.344" offset="4438376">But still and all, we feel that the true test is whether or not, as expressed in Fraser and similar cases, whether or not the school district has an interest in the well-being and the nurturing of the students who were there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.753" offset="4680061">In this case, whether or not involving students in a public telling of their life and putting it in a semi-official publication of the school district, I think that is not a hard decision for the principal to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.909" offset="4772639">And certainly discussing the family life, the private lives of the family members who make up the patrons of the district, is not appropriate fare for the school newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.435" offset="4818719">It would give an opinion to the students that there was some bridge or bar between the school and the community that really does not exist.</text>
