            <text syncTime="17.213" offset="203288">This case presents an important question of statutory interpretation involving the Department of Energy's Uranium Enrichment Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.879" offset="234008">Section 161(v) of the Atomic Energy Act authorizes the Atomic Energy Commission, now the Department of Energy, to provide enrichment services for utilities, both domestic and foreign, that operate nuclear power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.901" offset="306106">That section goes on to provide that DOE shall restrict its enrichment of foreign uranium for use in domestic power plants to the extent necessary to assure the maintenance of a viable domestic uranium industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.142" offset="367024">The Court of Appeals in this case construed this language to mean that when the domestic uranium industry is not viable, DOE must automatically stop all enrichment of foreign uranium, even if this would not make the domestic industry viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.332" offset="431807">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.335" offset="439853">In our view, the Statute instructs DOE to restrict enrichment of foreign uranium only to the extent that such restrictions will in fact make the domestic industry viable and does not instruct that DOE must impose enrichment restrictions when it would not have the effect of making the domestic industry viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.045" offset="514668">This case was decided below on Respondent's Motion for Summary Judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.207" offset="535357">The key fact under the Court of Appeals theory is that the status of the domestic uranium industry whether or not it is currently viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.123" offset="570988">As to that fact, there is no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.976" offset="582377">The Secretary of Energy has found in a series of annual viability determinations that the domestic uranium mining and milling industry is not currently viable.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.942" offset="674224">The meaning of viability is spelled out in some detail, first of all, by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.806" offset="705675">Congress passed a statute in 1982, Section 170(b) of the Atomic Energy Act, which sets forth eight criteria the Department of Energy is to look at in making a viability determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.694" offset="753218">The Secretary has in turn issued regulations under that Statute which further spells out the method that will be followed in determining viability.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.521" offset="792611">Does the Congressional statute require that viability be determined by ability to meet national needs, rather than profitability?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Merrill</label>

            <text syncTime="180.390" offset="856036">Although the criteria are complex that the gist of the statutory criteria and of the Secretary's regulations are to focus on the capability of the domestic industry in satisfying the needs of the nuclear power industry in the event of certain future contingencies such as an interruption of imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.573" offset="928761">Neither the statutory criteria nor the regulations focus merely on the profitability of the domestic industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.928" offset="958227">So for example if you had one or two domestic uranium plants that were very profitable but nevertheless did not have the capacity to satisfy the needs of the domestic industry, that would not be a viable industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.568" offset="1016741">A viable industry is one which has the resources, both in terms of reserves production capacity and financial strength to satisfy the needs of the domestic power industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.347" offset="1075883">Well, whether it's a strange use or not, Congress clearly set forth the criteria in 1982 which were to be used, and the criteria focused on things like the production capacity of the industry and its financial resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.106" offset="1198867">It was raised in Count V of the Respondents' Complaint and there was some pleadings in the District Court on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.632" offset="1233035">But the District Court never reached the issue and the Respondents then dismissed that count from their complaint without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.046" offset="1258635">So there's been no focus exactly on what the meaning of viability is.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.050" offset="1350691">The Department's theory throughout this case has been that the statute, contrary to the lower court's, does not require restrictions be imposed whenever the domestic industry is not viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.719" offset="1397398">The statute requires an inquiry into the effects that restrictions would have on the viability of the domestic industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.393" offset="1424043">So in our view, what the statute requires is that the Secretary look at the condition of the domestic industry and consider the effect of restricting enrichment of foreign uranium on that condition and act accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.502" offset="1480467">If the domestic industry is viable and does not need any restriction on foreign imports, no restrictions are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.388" offset="1512023">On the other hand, if the industry is not viable and restrictions on imports would not do anything to make it viable, the statute also does not require restrictions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="1151.786" offset="4741594">We think that really it had virtually nothing to do with the removal of restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.989" offset="4754446">In the early 1980s, restrictions were still in effect but were being phased out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.645" offset="4785061">There were some imports at that time but they were well below ten percent of the total energy requirements of the domestic industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.518" offset="4812542">And the industry collapsed at a point in time when imports were really a relatively minor aspect of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.632" offset="4845038">Now, since then imports have increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.005" offset="4858518">In the last three years imports have been running at around the range of 35 to 45 percent of domestic energy needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.331" offset="4887775">But the Secretary's position is that because Section 161(v) applies only to enrichment of raw uranium and does not restrict imports of enriched uranium and because there are now two European consortia that actually compete with DOE to provide enriched uranium that the imposition of restrictions on unenriched uranium would simply induce domestic utilities in large numbers to flee overseas to these other competitors of DOE and purchase enriched uranium for direct import into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.043" offset="5018701">So for that reason at this point in time, even though imports are a fairly large aspect of the picture, the particular mechanism that Section 161(v) establishes would not provide any relief to the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.779" offset="5069587">Another aspect of the industry which has emerged is there's now an active secondary market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.393" offset="5092052">Because the demand projections that were made in the 1970s about the increased demand for uranium in the future led to a tremendous production exploration activity and created a huge imbalance between supplies and demand, there is now a large stockpile of surplus enriched uranium that many utilities own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.069" offset="5190795">And there's an active secondary market trading in this enriched uranium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.154" offset="5207096">And that's another source the utilities could turn to if in fact restrictions were imposed on the enrichment of foreign uranium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.157" offset="5235099">So those are the reasons which the Secretary has given in the 1986 rulemaking for not at this point in time reimposing restrictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.751" offset="6053463">They were concerned about the possible weakness of the domestic industry in the transitional period from a totally controlled market where the Government was the sole purchaser to an open market where private property rights existed in uranium and there was free buying and selling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.566" offset="6872767">It is correct as my brother says that we are confronted with a question of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.331" offset="6899830">But I think in light of the questions, it's important to understand very briefly the procedural history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.896" offset="6926057">This view of the Department which I think Justice Scalia correctly characterized is a new view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.273" offset="6971615">When in 1974, the Atomic Energy Commission proposed to phase out the one hundred percent restriction, it told Congress that we will watch over the industry and if there should be any doubt as to its continuing viability, that is, it's ability to meet the nation's civilian and military needs, we will step in and restrict enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.102" offset="7090942">We litigated in the District Court and the Judge had granted a summary judgment imposing an injunction and requiring a rulemaking for the Department to explain why it should not impose restriction in light of its concession as to non-viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.398" offset="7176101">And it was only, Justice White, after Judge Carrigan issued the injunction that the Department published its rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1791.476" offset="7300340">The rule was not complete as of the time the summary judgment was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.552" offset="7328656">And the Court can look in vain in the Joint Appendix for the findings that have been mentioned by my brother.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.642" offset="7513081">In 1981, the Department explained that restrictions would impact its enrichment enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.918" offset="7550175">When Congress enacted Section 161(v), the Atomic Energy Commission had a monopoly on enrichment, and therefore Congress knew that imposing restrictions would have an impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.527" offset="7608585">In 1974, the Department then had some competition, and when the Congress asked the Atomic Energy Commission, how do you intend to assure that the industry meets our national security needs, the Atomic Energy Commission said, we have 161(v) which we will use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.641" offset="7693012">We also have the power over import licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.234" offset="7707432">The practice had been, Justice White, to impose one hundred percent restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.457" offset="7728330">It was phased out between 1974 and 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.079" offset="7746825">When the industry in 1981 said to the Department, we need your help now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.213" offset="7771380">We are non-viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.675" offset="7777231">The Department said, you are viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.197" offset="7787262">We then had the Congress pass in 1982, amendments that required an annual determination of viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.013" offset="7830521">And for the first determination made by the Department in 1984, the Department said in 1983, the industry, although flat on its back, is viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.282" offset="7875661">I think very much along the lines of Justice Scalia's remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.103" offset="7890916">Finally, in 1986, and in 1985, and in 1987, the Department conceded, yes, the industry now is not viable and the Department in effect stands here before the Court today and says, by reason of the fact that we have abandoned the industry, we no longer can do anything for the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.780" offset="7989554">This interpretation of the Department has never been put before the Congress of the United States before July of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.925" offset="8030201">And what happened when it put this interpretation before the Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.038" offset="8042635">The Congress said in Public Law 99-500, that the Court should pay no attention, should give no weight to this interpretation of the Department of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.618" offset="8096970">I submit, Justice White, that one can look at the legislative history and the administrative practice from 1964 on and one will not see any suggestion of this Departmental interpretation that says in effect that we have the discretion to decide that if we don't believe that 80 or 100 percent of the needs of this country can be met by imposing restrictions, we can simply throw up our hands and do nothing.</text>
