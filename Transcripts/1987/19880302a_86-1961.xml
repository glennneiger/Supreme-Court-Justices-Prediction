            <text syncTime="28.139" offset="246346">The nature of the case to be presented in this argument involves a challenge to the constitutionality of certain Oklahoma statutes providing for notice by publication to creditors in a probate proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.690" offset="428471">Upon review of the facts in this case and an application of the Oklahoma statutory scheme, it will be clear that current Oklahoma law does not provide a meaningful notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.389" offset="483328">It is our position that an analysis of the relevant decisions of this Court will require due process to be extended to known or reasonably ascertainable creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.238" offset="1270659">Again, I think that the difficulty is in this case, just as in this Court's decision in Mennonite Board of Missions v. Adams in 1983, and although that was a closely-divided decision in that case, the Court determined that the notice of the delinquency of taxes was not the same thing as the notice that the property was going to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.936" offset="1381523">In Oklahoma, in the Mennonite case, for example, there is a time period, there was a time period within which that tax sale would take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.342" offset="1419139">In Oklahoma, because of the nature of the statutes that we have to work with and as provided in Section 22 of Title 58, that notice period, the time within which to present your claim, can begin to run any time from the date of death of the decedent until forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.837" offset="1505134">Now, there is some statutory construction of this particular statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.094" offset="1646091">You have to keep track of every debtor in every legal publication, every newspaper that's defined as a legal publication in Oklahoma, in every county in Oklahoma, and you have to read every notice that's published, every day, in order to keep track of a specific debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.681" offset="1744520">And, again, because of the nature of the statutory scheme in Oklahoma, you have to do that for five or ten or fifteen or twenty years.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.808" offset="1780987">I think the interesting thing about Section 22 is that it says that the general statute of limitations, the longest one that is available in Oklahoma of five years, that general set of statutes of limitations from one to five years for different causes of action, that statute of limitations does not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.495" offset="6799737">Immediately, I would like to address several statements made by Appellant Hospital, both in their jurisdictional statement in their briefs as well as in the oral argument just concluded that are no where to be found in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.309" offset="6870999">The most blatant of which is that the personal representative had actual knowledge of the claim of the hospital at the time her husband died as well as at the time that notice to creditors was published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.781" offset="6928886">For the first six years after the death of the decedent, the Appellant Hospital relied exclusively on the Oklahoma statute that set out certain preferences and priorities of payment under Section 594 of our Probate Code, and no court thus far has decided that that relieved them of the burden of filing a notice to creditors, that not until the case had been tried on that issue in the original probate court, had been heard by the Oklahoma Court of Appeals, and upon petition for rehearing to the Oklahoma Court of Appeals, approximately August of 1985, did the Appellant Hospital raise the issue of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.285" offset="7146852">Now, up until that point, the exclusive question before the court was the question of priority of payment of debts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.239" offset="12718666">The whole nature of the case in New York that you're referring to has to do with getting the bankrupt debtor a fresh start in that case, a reorganization under another company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.387" offset="12767358">That debtor in the New York case knew of New York City's existing interest in the real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.275" offset="12806855">Not only that, but in that particular case, the judge, according to the findings, failed to properly follow the statute in requiring all creditors to be given mailed notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.814" offset="12865056">Another distinction is that the notice that was given to the creditors in that New York bankruptcy case had to do of a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.543" offset="12907897">It was not the running of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.735" offset="12920749">It was the court order that they were supposed to have given notice to New York City about that they failed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.670" offset="12944468">So, I think from that standpoint, there are several distinguishing factors between a bankruptcy in which all creditors were known or the debtor wouldn't be in the bankruptcy court to begin with because he knows who's putting the pressure on him from the credit standpoint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.738" offset="13844752">Justice Stevens, I believe, was asking a question about how quickly can that time period pass within which to file your claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.756" offset="13884772">In Oklahoma, the representative is required to publish the notice within thirty days of his appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.560" offset="13907968">The wording in the statute is: must be revoked, but then follows by: unless good cause is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.503" offset="13939733">The practice is and what is preferred by the Court is to publish a notice within thirty days and then you end up with a ninety-day time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.250" offset="13978708">I believe you had that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.271" offset="13986858">Justice Scalia, I believe, was asking a question about the difficulty in the unscrupulous personal representative hiding behind the log to use the Appellee's terminology.</text>
