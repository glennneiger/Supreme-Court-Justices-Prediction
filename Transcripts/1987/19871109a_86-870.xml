            <text syncTime="15.241" offset="182218">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="27.639" offset="231850">This is an equal-footing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.642" offset="247837">It arises out of the fact that Mississippi became a member of the Union in 1817 on an equal footing with the original 13 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.104" offset="317636">The "equal footing" doctrine in this context means that each new state that enters the Union, like Mississippi, acquires sovereign title from the United States to certain underwater lands to be held in trust for the benefit of all the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.284" offset="446368">Now, in this situation, and in an unbroken line of decisions of this Court, dating back 145 years, to the case of Martin v. Waddell, this Court has uniformly stated that the sovereign title that attaches to a subsequently-admitted state, relates only to lands beneath navigable waters that are usable by the public for commercial purposes of navigation or other commercial activities, such as fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.355" offset="694636">This has been the unbroken line of authority in this Court, that state sovereignty equals title to lands under commercially navigable streams, rivers and lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.550" offset="787422">And by "navigable", this Court has always meant "navigable in fact".</text>
            <text syncTime="174.086" offset="817620">Now, it is our position that the decision below by the Mississippi supreme court is diametrically opposed to this long line of authority in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.964" offset="881150">For example, on page 10A in the Opinion below, as it appears in the Appendix to the Petition, the supreme court of Mississippi says that the top of the page that,</text>
            <text syncTime="208.157" offset="953875">"It is our view that as a matter of federal law, the United States granted to this State in 1817 all lands subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and up to the then-mean high water liable without regard to navigability. "</text>
            <text syncTime="226.218" offset="1026077">Now that is incorrect; it is inconsistent; it is in conflict with every decision that this Court has ever rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.648" offset="1083860">He cites, for example, the court cites Illinois Central Rail Road Company v. Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.203" offset="1110087">One turns to that reference, that citation to the Illinois Central case and we find the Court announcing that</text>
            <text syncTime="258.652" offset="1155853">"ownership by the crown... and therefore, by any sovereign State, of title to lands under waters, is founded not upon the existence of tide over the lands, but upon the fact that the waters are navigable. "</text>

            <text syncTime="523.424" offset="2214962">At the same time, you see, this was part of the confusion that grew out of the English experience where all navigable rivers, due to the geography of England, were the same as tidally-influenced waters: the tide ebbed and flowed to the ends of most of the navigable rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.953" offset="2329065">And so it became... a synonymous expression of the royal ownership of the navigable of the tidally-influenced waters of England.</text>

            <text syncTime="1629.955" offset="6641045">The case, as Mr. Gressman stated, is one of the "equal footing" doctrine and the limits of each state's public trust, the question can be answered when we review these two doctrines together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.763" offset="6688275">Each new state upon entering the Union did so on an equal footing with the original 13 states and received all lands that were subject to the ebb and flow of tide regardless of the navigability of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.681" offset="6743968">Each new state could define the nature of her boundaries and the physical extent of the public trust lands, as the original 13 states did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.128" offset="6789734">Each of the original 13 recognized a public trust interest to shorelands that were subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and then defined the extent of the public trust shorelands either judicially or legislatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.608" offset="6847726">The State of Mississippi's main concern is to preserve the ownership of the lands in question for the use and benefit of the public and this, by necessity, included the development of mineral resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.566" offset="6903524">The ownership of the properties in question remained unchallenged until these leases were issued on these state waters for ail and gas purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.204" offset="6946051">At that time, the individuals who owned the lands adjacent to these tidelands sought to take these tidelands from Mississippi's public trust lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.831" offset="6984608">The State then proceeded to defend its title in these lands, and this case is significant not only to Mississippi, but to all states which have a coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.067" offset="7033509">This case can potentially impact thousands of acres nationwide where states have relied upon their theories of what they owned in their public trust lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.652" offset="12703857">He also further stated in his testimony that there were wells and other ponds on the land itself for the cattle to graze.</text>

            <text syncTime="3162.044" offset="12769476">Thank you, Ms. Sones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.445" offset="12771044">Mr. Gressman, you have three minutes remaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.765" offset="12784314">I would just say immediately that neither the Jordan River nor these little tributaries are primarily salt-water in content.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.505" offset="12835305">There is a very low salinity rate, and they are basically carrying fresh water either from the uplands or further back up the Jordan River area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.393" offset="12890789">But in any event, I would certainly state in further confirmation of Justice O'Connor's query about the impact of an affirmance of this decision upon the many landowners who have for generations thought that they had title to the little streams and rivers that run through their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.277" offset="13042404">And by the way, Lord Hale, who Ms. Sones quoted, also said, among other things, that</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.044" offset="13081378">"there are little rivers which are private forming no part of the King's Highways. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.499" offset="13107292">Again, I reiterate, that the king's highways... the public highways today, are devoted... are there for the purpose of carrying on the commercial activities of the public, be it navigation, or fishing or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.832" offset="13188585">And when Ms. Sones refers to the fact that there was an occasional fisherman engaging in fishing operations, he was not doing that as a commercial operation; and in any event, our problem is not what some lonely fisherman may do today, it is what was the purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.128" offset="13285760">Was there a commercial navigability purpose to these lands in 1817?</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.103" offset="13313659">Because that is where the federal question begins and ends, and we are concerned only with whether these lands, underwater lands, were commercially navigable in 1817 at the time of Statehood?</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.995" offset="13377189">And what has happened thereafter is of no consequence in determining that federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.668" offset="13403938">Now, with respect to the impact of this: there are untold numbers of landowners in Mississippi whose title to non-navigable, little streams running through their property will be put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.443" offset="13499024">More than that, there are before this court in the form of amicus curiae all twenty-two coastal states.</text>
