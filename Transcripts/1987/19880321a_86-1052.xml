            <label>Mr. Herbert Rubin</label>
            <text syncTime="0.416" offset="140658">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.926" offset="198755">This case arises by certiorari to the Appellate Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.263" offset="224041">It presents, we believe, the gravest issue regarding the continued viability of a highly successful, a real success story among treaties, the Hague Convention on Service of Process, which to date has been recognized and acknowledged to be a simple, effective device to end and remove what was a minefield for litigants, Americans abroad as well as foreign litigants in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.635" offset="353609">What has happened here by the decision in this, in the court below, is that there is a suggestion which has been created, a somewhat cynical suggestion, that service on a foreign involuntary agent has been ruled out, but service on an involuntary agent in the United States is perfectly all right and not within the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.510" offset="505119">Respectfully, we believe that this is a somewhat parochial and provincial approach which is inappropriate in the area of contract law which involves the world community.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="108.019" offset="571156">Counsel, suppose that the CEO of Volkswagen Germany were in Illinois for a business meeting for a day and he were served, what result?</text>
            <text syncTime="119.577" offset="617341">Would you have to comply with the treaty?</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert Rubin</label>
            <text syncTime="121.695" offset="625804">I think, Your Honor, that you would have to comply with the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.933" offset="646807">I don't believe that the treaty contemplates that... and I don't believe that the intention of the contracting parties was that there should be a kind of a hit-or-miss situation with respect to the service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.693" offset="709814">Service of process is, I think, the quintessential element in the commencement, in the conduct, of a lawsuit which cries out for formality, for a sense of very definite precise kinds of procedures so that a party who is being hailed into court is informed that this is the start of a lawsuit, that this is the time when you have to begin to respond, and that any kind of actions that have to be taken are being taken, and that the idea that the president is running through an airport and some papers pushed on him should trigger that.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.375" offset="912524">We respectfully submit that that was not within the contemplation of the contracting parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.629" offset="941573">What is the language in the treaty that you rely on in order to support your conclusion that the documents would necessarily have to be transmitted abroad as a practical matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="211.670" offset="985667">Because they don't have to be transmitted as a legal matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.472" offset="996952">We respectfully submit that in presenting the proposition to the Senate, Mr. Carney, who was the representative of the State Department who presented it, indicated in the broadest terms how this treaty was to be administered and what it's purpose was.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.320" offset="1092351">He said that for the purpose, for the service of judicial documents abroad, that is, in cases where an action is commenced by a Plaintiff in one country against a Defendant who is in another country; now the juxtaposition is very clear: you have a case where you have a Plaintiff in one country and a Defendant who is in another country.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.238" offset="1199976">The treaty says where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial documents for service abroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.862" offset="1238533">It says in all cases where there is an occasion to transmit a document for service abroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.918" offset="3438670">This is a world contract in which the United States made representations to the other contracting parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.774" offset="3474092">The suggestion is made here that the United States, perhaps, got even the better of the bargain because it was giving up very little and getting very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="932.334" offset="3868332">That judicial assistance is not going to be significantly changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.472" offset="3884946">We had in place already, by that time, I think in 1963, the new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="945.661" offset="3921726">We had correspondingly the Public Law 88-619, I believe it was, which became part of the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.184" offset="3959760">And that spelled out a scheme, a mechanics, for the system of judicial assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.094" offset="4119421">And there's... all that has to be done is that if Plaintiff takes his summons and complaint, if required by the foreign country, as it does in Germany... it's translated, there are standardized forms which have to be prepared which are transmitted, it's sent by ordinary mail to the central authority... and from that point on, free of charge, without worry, without care, the central authority takes it and puts it in whatever channels are necessary and affects the service, and you get this certificate--</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.473" offset="6460933">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.845" offset="6502415">It is the Respondent's position that the Hague Convention for service abroad does not render invalid service in a foreign corporation within the United States when such service complies with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.672" offset="6561765">The heart of the issue before this Court is the interpretation of the Hague Convention on service abroad, regarding service in a foreign corporation doing business in Illinois, which it owned and so closely controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.316" offset="6628325">It is, therefore, necessary to look first at the convention which is clear with regard to its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.006" offset="6663016">Article 1 of the convention states: the present convention, and I quote, shall apply in all cases, in civil or commercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.320" offset="6744309">If the drafters of this convention had intended the convention to be an exclusive method for service upon foreign nationals, regardless of their presence and their shores, then I believe Article 1 would have simply read: the present convention shall apply in all cases, in civil or commercial matters, involving foreign nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.685" offset="6837827">Clearly, if the framers would not have intended this treaty to apply to all foreign nationals, they would never have used the clause: where there is occasion to transmit a judicial document for service abroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.702" offset="12529804">In fact, it appears that some of the foreign governments' positions are somewhat inconsistent with their own law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.771" offset="12554151">For instance, in Illinois, under the Illinois Companies Act of 1985, Section 695 does provide for service upon an unregistered foreign corporation at its place of business in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.513" offset="12601067">That, under Petitioner's position, would be inconsistent with the convention but, nevertheless, is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.448" offset="12620815">Likewise, the French's new Code of Civil Procedure, of Section 690, also provides for service at a place of business or upon any qualified member of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.606" offset="12665432">Now, we don't know how the French or the English courts might ultimately interpret the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.308" offset="12684240">We're not aware of any decisions from those courts that have interpreted the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.943" offset="12698764">However, we believe, that given, in particular, with France, the language of Article 1 the most likely interpretation would be the interpretation that we, in fact, advance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.568" offset="12741292">Now, I would like to return to the notification au parquet again to clarify another matter of confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.054" offset="12763235">The convention does not eliminate or remove the notification au parquet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.339" offset="12780371">That method of service still exists in the French Civil Code, of Section 684 through 686.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.843" offset="12802418">What it does do is regulate that method of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.445" offset="12816838">In particular, it regulates it under Article 15 of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.849" offset="12838467">Now that also explains why there might be some confusion about this question of where there is occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.503" offset="12861037">If you look at Article 15, it says: where a writ of summons, or an equivalent document--</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.763" offset="12922059">In other words, they go on to say that judgement shall not be given unless certain conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.749" offset="12945987">Now, Article 15 does seem to cover notification au parquet, here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.451" offset="12964795">But, again, it depends on whether or not a document had to be transmitted abroad for the purpose of service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.650" offset="13053612">We note, further, that there are no substantial policy reasons for rewriting the Hague Convention to protect Volkswagen from the service method employed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.006" offset="13091019">It is certainly not unfair to serve Volkswagen through instate delivery of a summons to wholly-owned and closely controlled subsidiary that conducts Volkswagen's affairs in the foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.111" offset="13131457">First, Volkswagen is subject to the Illinois court's jurisdiction, precisely because it does business in Illinois through that subsidiary and, in fact, the Illinois Appellate Court's decision reflects this in Pages 8 through Page 18 of the Petition Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.990" offset="13194987">Second, Volkswagen has complete control over that subsidiary and, therefore, can, and we believe, has, taken the necessary steps to assure that it will receive prompt notice of suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.613" offset="13233543">Third, this service method does not discriminate against foreign corporations because it subjects them to precisely the same requirements as any domestic out-of-state corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.035" offset="13271160">And, fourth, Volkswagen receives all the protections associated with the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.772" offset="13290177">This is as much, or more, protection than U.S. corporations receive when they do business overseas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.238" offset="13391950">Effectively, that is what Volkswagen has said here, with respect to its wholly-owned subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.625" offset="13405533">Our position is that a state is in a position to identify that agent as an agent for service of process, and that is a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.647" offset="13445658">Some states do allow that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.265" offset="13452136">Others don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.799" offset="13454226">I think that one thing that is clear, however, is that the requirements to become an agent for that purpose are, in fact, very strict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.836" offset="13482333">Here, the Illinois court went on at some length to identify all the factors that indicate the substantial identity between Volkswagen of Germany and Volkswagen of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.959" offset="13518905">I'd like to address a few other points that have arisen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.577" offset="13537295">Petitioners have pointed out the importance of formality of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.946" offset="13550774">However, I think it's important to note that a German court's jurisdiction does not depend on service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.683" offset="13569791">Those formalities are primarily common law formalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.635" offset="13581599">This point is made in Kaplan and Von Merin, in 71 Harvard Law Review, at 1203 through 1204.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.539" offset="13605213">Professor Smith's book on international service of process also indicates this at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.692" offset="13625798">I've already mentioned that, with respect to Justice Scalia's office of the state hypothetical, that that situation is covered under the English law, and apparently under the French law as well.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert Rubin</label>
            <text syncTime="3391.519" offset="13705106">If Your Honor, please:</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.804" offset="13718271">The question was raised as to what is simpler?</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.089" offset="13731437">Where is the simplification?</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.689" offset="13737811">That really is a question which has been answered by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.010" offset="13763098">He concedes that it is simpler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.195" offset="13771770">We have shown that it is inexpensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.413" offset="13784727">There's a reference to the cost of translation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.265" offset="13796116">I think that Your Honors will have a better idea as to what the opportunities are for translation, even in Chicago, and what costs could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.256" offset="13840107">The fact is that the Solicitor General has conceded that in 1986 alone, there were 5,000 occasions where service was made on American companies under the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.250" offset="13896009">And in 1986 alone, there were approximately, or up to, 700 cases where service as made from the United States to Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.640" offset="13941566">So that this is a treaty which is working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.440" offset="13952851">It operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.492" offset="13957031">In terms, now, of trying to weigh why now... what disadvantage, what real disadvantage is there to changing the system which is stated by these five major powers... major commercial, contracting countries... as the system which should be working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.291" offset="14056191">You have, apart from anything else, you have the considerations of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.397" offset="14084613">This Court in Aerospatiale made the point about providing for a smoothly operating legal regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.086" offset="14119408">You have here a smoothly operating legal regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.971" offset="14138947">The reference has been made to the jurisdictional basis for the action in illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.696" offset="14177818">That jurisdictional action was not based on doing business and the court didn't find any doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.081" offset="14199342">It was based on the long arm statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.850" offset="14210418">It was a long arm type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.402" offset="14224629">But, again, we respectfully submit that's not relevant to the issue of service of process which is conceded by the Solicitor General to be a question of federal law in terms of interpretation.</text>
