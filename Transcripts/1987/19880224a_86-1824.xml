            <text syncTime="626.644" offset="2638578">The Ninth Circuit in holding that a pursuit is not a seizure stated that flight is an act of autonomy whose purpose is to avoid restraint, and I believe these two circuits teach that a seizure is a seizure and an attempted seizure is not a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.779" offset="2719140">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia did recently conclude that a person is seized when a pursuit begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.787" offset="2759159">The Court concluded that the person pursued assumes that the object of the chase is a capture.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.742" offset="2786954">Thus when the chase commences the stop begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.984" offset="2803986">This rationale tracks the rationale employed by the Michigan courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.428" offset="2821749">However, I believe it runs afoul of the teachings of INS versus Delgado.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.793" offset="2843169">In Delgado there was a factory survey wherein Immigration officers were clearly identifiable, armed, and stationed at the doors of the private factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.700" offset="2886846">This Court stated, though a person may have been questioned if they had attempted to leave this did not create a reasonable apprehension of a detention, and further, that if the person may have been detained if they attempted to leave, in fact in that case the people did not attempt to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.053" offset="2968244">The seizure question was simply thus not litigable on that ground as it had not occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.508" offset="2994053">This Court stated that one may only litigate that which actually occurred to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.181" offset="3016727">Similarly in the instant case the fact that the respondent may have been questioned had he chosen to remain does not create a reasonable apprehension of enforceable detention nor the possibility that had he attempted to leave he would have been detained means that he was detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.474" offset="3089870">In fact, he was free to go about his way and he did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.696" offset="3102826">He was not detained by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.199" offset="3112857">There is nothing in the record to support an objective finding that a detention was contemplated or attempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.283" offset="3141174">Again, there was no sirens, verbal commands, or lights that were employed by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.972" offset="3183910">The trial court admitted that he didn't know what would have happened, and the police officer stated he simply pursued the respondent to see where he was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.558" offset="3214213">Therefore, it was the defendant... the respondent's flight from the mere presence of the police officer which prevented any kind of encounter, consensual or otherwise, from occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.436" offset="3269801">It is also important to note that the police officers did not immediately approach the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.879" offset="4827535">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the parameters of Fourth Amendment protection where an individual's invocation of the right to go on his way is met by a police chase by four officers in a marked police cruiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.779" offset="4959192">My argument will be divided into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.102" offset="4968387">First of all, we contend that this chase would have led a reasonable person to believe that he was not free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.225" offset="4988972">That is the seizure question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.326" offset="4993360">Secondly, that this intrusion was not justified by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.030" offset="5016139">And thirdly, this was an unreasonable seizure in terms of its method and scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.872" offset="5035470">Briefly as to the facts relevant to the show of authority seizure question, these officers were driving in a black marked Detroit police cruiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.506" offset="5066085">It had markings on the side door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.868" offset="5071519">According to the officer, "Everybody knows what it is".</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.301" offset="5085207">Counsel has suggested that all four officers were in plain clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.504" offset="5106000">I believe the record only indicates the dress of the officer who testified, and he was in plain clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.130" offset="5132541">In terms of whether or not the officers activated their lights or sirens, the officer was never asked whether or not he activated his sirens, nor was he asked whether or not his vehicle had that type of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.285" offset="5177158">When Mr. Chesternut ran from the corner, these officers pursued him around the corner, chased him down the street--</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.845" offset="5319368">They chased him down the street and they overtook him, and instead of simply continuing on down the block, these officers had to slow down the cruiser in order to run it parallel with Mr. Chesternut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.383" offset="5361582">In that position, Mr. Chesternut was alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.057" offset="5376211">He was isolated from assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.957" offset="5383839">He was pitted between the apartment structure and a police cruiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.392" offset="5405573">In that spot he could certainly see that there were four police officers here, and this in fact was a police cruiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.726" offset="5426888">His next actions occurred almost simultaneously He dropped the packets, and within five feet, one running stride, he stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.142" offset="5464609">In terms of whether or not the officers all got out or all stayed in the car, the record only reflects what officer Peltier did, and after the dropping of the packets and stopping, Officer Peltier then got out and opened up the packets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.964" offset="5523855">We submit that under these circumstances a reasonable person would feel that he was not free to leave, and that the objective characteristics of this police case meet the standards that this Court has set forth to define a seizure by show of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.540" offset="5574219">This police chase was a seizure because at the very least it indicated to Mr. Chesternut that these officers were going to detain him immediately.</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.116" offset="5724475">We contend that this police chase was a seizure because it implicated every basic interest under the Fourth Amendment, his right to be secure in his person, his right to privacy, his right to be left alone by government, and his right to go on his way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.960" offset="8839839">He could either remain and cooperate with the police officer, or he could go on his way, and it is that choice that separates a first tier questioning encounter from a second tier Terry type seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.198" offset="8888844">It is that choice which is the sole reason for excusing a police officer from a requirement of reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.583" offset="8914340">In this case, the Court has asked for the for the first time to enforce the right it defined in Mendenhall and to reaffirm that the individual still has two viable choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.029" offset="8956136">Michael Chesternut asserted his right to choose, and he chose to go on his way, and unless this Court protects his right to make that choice, the central premise which justified the first tier questioning encounter in the first place would be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.567" offset="9014337">Petitioner is asking this Court to exclude all but a literal detention from the parameters of the Fourth Amendment, and by literal detention they define either a forceable physical restraint or in essence a surrender to a show of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.016" offset="9064074">That approach would exclude a huge category of police-citizen confrontations from this Court's scrutiny, and that approach presumes that this Court's scrutiny is not necessary because police officers will not overreach and will not abuse their discretion when they confront individuals on the street, and in fact petitioner considers that possibility as, and I quote, "beyond serious consideration".</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.650" offset="9150591">For 20 years since Terry versus Ohio this Court has disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.984" offset="9172012">Since Terry, this Court has recognized that while a police officer needs a flexible response on the street, there must be some limits on his actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.317" offset="11841308">--Well, Your Honor, I think that it was enough of a chase to convey to Mr. Chesternut that these officers were going to detain him immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.594" offset="11874431">I think that we are not relying on a prolonged confrontation in support of our seizure argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.637" offset="11898568">What we are relying on here are other factors, the factor that this was an aggressive and confrontational situation, a four on one, a police cruiser, chase of a pedestrian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.105" offset="11932423">I think that by doing that these officers conveyed to him that he was not going to be allowed to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.867" offset="11951545">These officers failed to explain why they proceeded in this case and they have failed to choose a measured response.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.965" offset="11991878">By chasing they deprived Michael Chesternut in a very real way of his right to feel secure and of his right to go on his way, and for those reasons we would ask that this Court affirm the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals.</text>
