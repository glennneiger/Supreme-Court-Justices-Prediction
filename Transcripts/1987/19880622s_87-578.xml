            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">The next case, the Bank of Nova Scotia versus United States, 87-578.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.263" offset="24973">These cases come to us on writs of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.761" offset="42945">They present the issue whether a District Court may invoke its supervisory power to dismiss an indictment for prosecutorial misconduct in a grand jury investigation where the misconduct does not prejudice the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.834" offset="91324">In the cases before us, the petitioners were charged with tax fraud and conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.393" offset="109505">The District Court, however, dismissed the indictment on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.861" offset="123402">It held 10 days of hearings and identified various incidents which it found to be prosecutorial misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.679" offset="154645">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, and the circumstances of this case, the District Court had no authority to dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.384" offset="189440">We now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.849" offset="195396">The standard of prejudice the Court should apply in determining whether to dismiss an indictment for error or irregularity in the course of grand jury proceedings at least where dismissal is sought for non-constitutional error, is the standard articulated by Justice O'Connor and her concurring opinion in United States versus Mechanik.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.902" offset="259553">Under this standard dismissal of the indictment is appropriate only if it is established that the violation substantially influenced the grand jury's decision to indict or if there is grave doubt that the decision to indict was free from the substantial influence of such violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.881" offset="319425">Applying the standard to the facts of this case, we find that the record will not support the conclusion that petitioners were prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.562" offset="342204">The District Court erred in dismissing the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.186" offset="356728">Justice Scalia joins the opinion of the Court and has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.425" offset="373656">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
