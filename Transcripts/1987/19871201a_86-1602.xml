            <text syncTime="188.017" offset="892235">But at this time, particularly in Texas, but I suspect elsewhere across the country, the practice in this sort of case was to focus very early on in the case on the question of whether the secured creditor's interest in property was adequately protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.327" offset="953466">That was the typical practice, and therefore, this motion was filed focusing on that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.240" offset="1361081">This is a single asset case in which to some extent the issues are blended together, but the same issue arises in multiple asset cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.085" offset="1388562">You might have a Continental Airlines in which a secured creditor holding a lien on one airplane comes in and says the stay ought to be terminated, and if there is no protection for the interest of that secured creditor in the sense of the time value of money, it is very difficult for that creditor to come in and argue that the proceedings have dragged on too long.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.039" offset="1472362">In terms of a very complex case, the proceedings might last justifiably a very long period of time, but that should not take the place of the need to protect the individual secured creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.878" offset="1575703">Yes, in that the Bankruptcy Court has discretion at some point to take action under some other provisions, but no, in the sense that there is no principal basis for measuring the damage done to the secured creditor and imposing some kind of protection as time goes on other than adequate protection under 362(d)(1) and 361.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.041" offset="1660340">Yes, at some point the Court may conclude that this case has dragged on too long, but even if that is six months past what might be a reasonable limit, the secured creditor has incurred very serious costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.079" offset="1708509">The seriousness of those costs I think is well illustrated by the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.684" offset="1726900">The Bankruptcy Court found that but for the automatic stay, United Savings could have foreclosed on the property and liquidated its collateral within six months of the filing of the case, that United could have earned $4.25 million by selling the property, and could have reinvested that money at 12 percent interest per annum.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.865" offset="2643589">There is one case on record where a court has attempted to reconcile the sections, and I don't think there is any problem in the context of a plan of reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court saying to the undersecured creditor who has gotten perhaps more interest than he would have under the contract that we are going to rebate or count some payments against you to make up for that difference because the creditor is now going to reinstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.880" offset="2739719">Also, I might add, this is an issue that almost never comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.363" offset="2757587">I can't see it really ever coming up.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.225" offset="2765110">Here, it's 12 percent interest but it is calculated on what in this case higher, in fact, in this case it's lower than the contract amount because contract interest was 14 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.201" offset="2805025">But if you take as a hypothetical you're getting 12 percent interest when 10 percent was the contracted rate, you are typically getting it, if you are an undersecured creditor on a principal balance that is much less, so that the total you are getting is still less than you would be getting if you got your payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.973" offset="2872108">And that stands to reason because the debtor always has the option of making the regular payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.959" offset="2896036">I don't think there is any court that wouldn't allow a debtor to make the regular payments of interest called for and retain the property while the case is proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.994" offset="2932189">I think this case involves a situation where a creditor has suffered a very real loss.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.491" offset="3358090">The Court can say to the debtor, okay, even though you couldn't have kept this property before, we will let you keep the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="912.887" offset="3791722">And I might say as an aside that there has been a lot of argument in the lower courts and many articles written on this subject that spends a lot of time on what adequate protection means, what indubitable equivalent means, various terms that may have some meaning in other contexts but aren't really defined in the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.280" offset="3865283">And I think in getting mixed into that argument they sometimes miss the two really clear things that are stated in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.357" offset="3897571">One is that Congress chose, consciously chose, not to define the meaning of value, and therefore I think it is unfair to latch onto examples in the legislative history or little bits and pieces or words.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.055" offset="3952428">Congress, in both the House and Senate reports, in more than one place, made very clear that this was a matter to be left to judicial development.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.260" offset="3977192">But on the other hand, and this is the second thing that is very important, Congress made very clear that it sought to protect the full value of the creditor's interest in property.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.688" offset="4018883">In both the House and Senate reports, there is language that the full benefit of the creditor's bargain should be protected, and an interesting aside to that is that the House and Senate reports also say that this means something more than what the Constitution requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.503" offset="4090145">The Constitution generally has been interpreted to require that the value of the collateral at least be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.155" offset="4116790">And the House and Senate Report said that adequate protection means more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.918" offset="4131837">It means that even though the creditor may not be allowed to foreclose exactly on default or exactly at the time when he might under state law, even though he might not get in kind what he is entitled to under state law, that nevertheless he would be entitled to the value of what he gets under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.691" offset="4198919">I think that if you begin with this thing, that Congress wanted to protect the value of the creditor's interest in property, in this case the value of a mortgage, it necessarily follows that the costs of delay must be protected, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.940" offset="4259941">First of all, that is the essence of the secured creditor's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.242" offset="4277182">The secured creditor has a right under his mortgage to foreclose on default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.875" offset="4295677">The secured creditor, with all due respect to this apartment project, doesn't want the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.878" offset="4319709">United Savings doesn't want to own this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.103" offset="4328591">United Savings wants to use the property as a means to recover its loan, and it does that by having it sold at foreclosure sale as soon as it is entitled to under the mortgage, taking that money, putting it out at interest, and the quicker it can do that and the more interest it can earn, the quicker it can recover its debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.276" offset="4397241">Moreover, and I think this is another very, very crucial thing that as overlooked by the Court below, this value, this time value of money, is something that is protected under non-bankruptcy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.223" offset="4449068">No one would doubt that a fee simple interest in property is worth more than a future interest in property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.149" offset="4476758">I don't think anybody would doubt that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.640" offset="4486684">Surely it follows that a temporary deprivation of an interest in property decreases its value, and in fact, in another context, this Court held recently, in First English Evangelical Lutheran Church, that an owner's interest in property was decreased when, for a period of time, he was temporarily deprived of that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.447" offset="4569962">And I don't think there is any reason for treating security interests any differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.377" offset="4585636">If the secured creditor is deprived of his property for a period of time, the value of that security interest is less.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.391" offset="6677731">This is clearly a statutory construction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.684" offset="6690896">This Court has had many occasions to construe Congressional enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.076" offset="6708451">We have reviewed many of the cases that have talked about the procedure that the Court follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.462" offset="6738021">Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, Touche Ross v. Reddington, and many others, including the Midlantic Bank v. New Jersey, both the majority and the dissenting Opinions, very well-written Opinions on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.625" offset="6806671">What we glean, although this is not an area that is very clear, what we glean from all of these cases is that the Court goes through the following analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.432" offset="6837913">First, it looks to the actual words of the statute to see if the intent of Congress is clear from the face of the statute... that is, the plain meaning rule... and, whether such interpretation is harmonious with the entire statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.603" offset="6894547">Second, the analysis goes through the Congressional policy of the underlying statute to see if the proper interpretation is consistent with the Congressional policy underlying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.771" offset="6943239">Third, if, only if the intent of Congress cannot be gleaned from the first two elements, then the Court will go into the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.898" offset="6979811">And as this Court has been divided at times on the types of legislative history used or whether legislative history is appropriate to use, beginning in 1950 with a stream of cases, from that point, this Court has been more willing to look at legislative history because of the availability of the legislative history to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.171" offset="7064865">Prior to 1950, the big argument was, it is not available and it wasn't very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.576" offset="7086495">Today, I am going to emphasize the first two elements of the analysis because it is my belief that nothing substantial can be added to Judge Randall's scholarly treatment and analysis of the legislative history behind the Bankruptcy Code contained in the Timbers Panel Opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.449" offset="7166011">Also, I would like to commend to the Court, for the arguments which I do not have time today to make, the well written briefs of amici Global Marine and National Association of Credit Managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.350" offset="7229541">There are two phrases and one word which has been used to attempt to import into Section 361 this time value analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.428" offset="7281891">They are "indubitable equivalent", "interest in property", and "value".</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.524" offset="7306237">Petitioner argues that the phrase 361(3) imports a time value analysis into Section 361.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.293" offset="7377394">Petitioner cites for authority Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Company, 308 U.S. at 115 where the Court stated that where words are employed in an Act which had at the time a well-known meaning in the law, they are used in that sense unless the context requires otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.799" offset="7459314">And I would ask the Court to focus on that last phrase, "unless the context requires" to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.773" offset="7483242">The arguments against importing the time value analysis into 361 through this term or phrase "indubitable equivalent" are fivefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.980" offset="7524098">First, the words are used in a different context in Section 361.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.735" offset="7543115">"Indubitable equivalent" was used prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code in the confirmation context, if in fact they were terms of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.211" offset="7581045">Secondly, the phrase 1978 in the Bankruptcy Code, become a term of art with a well-defined meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.361" offset="7625662">Congress took the phrase from In re Murel Holding Corporation, 75 Fed. 2d 941, a Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in 1935, where Judge Hand specifically used it in the confirmation context, and in 43 years between the date of Morel and the enactment of the Code, the term or phrase "indubitable equivalent" was only used nine times.</text>

            <text syncTime="1943.451" offset="7913949">In re Murel, time value was referred to in In re Murel by Judge Hand as quote "completely compensatory".</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.467" offset="7949998">"Completely compensatory".</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.530" offset="7958253">That was the phrase that Judge Hand used in In re Murel to talk about the time value of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.126" offset="7980718">What "indubitable equivalent" was referring to in that case, if the Court will review that case very carefully, it is a very well-written case, a very knowledgeable man wrote that case, because he understood bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.523" offset="8034217">He understood it very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.384" offset="8041740">What he was talking about was the fact that there was no principal repayment until the end of the ten-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.748" offset="8067131">The plan specifically provided for the time value of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.093" offset="8100568">It provided for market interest rate on the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.746" offset="8115197">And the Judge said it is completely compensatory, it has to be completely compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.412" offset="8137766">And then he went on to say that interest is the equalizing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.675" offset="8158873">What he was really referring to, I think, was feasibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.958" offset="8179980">With "indubitable equivalent", what he was really referring to was the repayment of the principal and the fact that there was no principal repayment during the ten years of the plan, and that it was an interest-only obligation, and that there was big balloon payment ten years down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.787" offset="8239331">Nobody knew whether the property was going to have sufficient value to pay that balloon payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.141" offset="8256780">There was no amortization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.753" offset="8263154">Yet another possibility, he was referring to the fairness of forcing a creditor to wait for ten years to receive any interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.109" offset="8304637">But very, very clear, and this is a point which one needs to really review that case very carefully to understand, the time value of money was equated to the term "completely compensatory".</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.978" offset="8356046">"Indubitable equivalent" referred to something completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.871" offset="8371615">The importation of the time value analysis into Section 361 through "indubitable equivalent" is yet defended again by Judge Hand's Opinion in which he stated that no doubt less would be required during the interim until a plan could be filed and confirmed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.167" offset="8472865">It very clearly distinguished that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.487" offset="8482165">And finally, and perhaps most importantly, Sections 361, 1129(b)(2)(A) are similar in that each have two specific examples filed by general description, all in the disjunctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.526" offset="8534305">One of the two examples in 1129(b)(2)(A) specifically provides for a time value element, in other words, the confirmation cram-down standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.172" offset="8568891">There is a specific time value element in that statute, in that part of the statute that is not tied to "indubitable equivalent".</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.348" offset="8597522">Neither of the two examples in 361 specifically provide for a time value element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.342" offset="8621554">Each section of the Bankruptcy Code containing a specific time value element does so without utilizing the words "indubitable equivalent".</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.938" offset="8651961">Section 1129(a)(7)(A)(ii), Section 1129(a)(9)(B), Section 1129(b)(2)(A), Section 1225(A)(4), Section 1225(b)(1)(A) and Section 1325(b)(1)(A) are the sections in the Bankruptcy Code that utilize a time value element, and none of them used the words "indubitable equivalent".</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.143" offset="8744748">Thus, when Congress utilized a time value concept, it did so explicitly and it did so without utilizing the phrase "indubitable equivalent".</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.009" offset="8780170">Justice Blackmun, speaking for the Court, in Roussileau v. United States, 464 United States at 23, quoted with approval the following elements of statutory construction from the 1972 Fifth Circuit Opinion in United States v. Won Kim Bo, and I quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.490" offset="8842132">"Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion and exclusion. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.129" offset="8892705">Thus, if the phrase is not a term of art, and does not have a unique time value element, what is its meaning?</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.484" offset="8922067">And what is the meaning of "indubitable equivalent"?</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.098" offset="8932516">The answer is that the phrase must mean, quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.471" offset="8946100">"without a doubt, an acceptable or equal substitute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.802" offset="8963340">That's what the phrase means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.893" offset="8971700">And so now let's apply it in Section 361(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.006" offset="8988209">It would mean, other adequate protection that would be, without a doubt, an acceptable or equal substitute for the examples of adequate protection described in Sections 361(1) and 361(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.645" offset="9042753">And in Section 1129(b)(2)(A)(iii), the phrase would mean, other fair and equitable treatment that would be, without a doubt, an acceptable or equal substitute for the examples of fair and equitable treatment described in Sections 1129(b)(2)(A)(i) and 1129(b)(2)(A)(ii).</text>

            <text syncTime="2446.384" offset="9925691">That is what, in the en banc decision, Judge Randall said that the Bankruptcy Court should do, and it is incredible, but that is exactly what they are doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.509" offset="10122237">The phrase "interest in property".</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.850" offset="10139582">The phrase 361, when read in the context of Sections 362 through 364, clearly refers to the various types of ownership interest or lien interest for which a party may require adequate protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.541" offset="10202380">For example, an entity may have an ownership interest as a tenant-in-common, a joint tenant or a tenant by the entireties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.436" offset="10229966">An entity may be, along with a debtor, a beneficiary in a trust or the holder of a deed of trust covering real or personal property to secure a jointly held note receivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.743" offset="10267164">An entity may be the holder of a pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.136" offset="10276673">And the list goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.396" offset="10281793">While Congress used "interest in property" to describe many different property rights, the phrase refers neither to enforcement powers or remedies to realize the benefit of the "interest in property", nor to creditors' rights for remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.526" offset="10334246">Congress' use of the general and broad term "interest in property" therefore should not be read to require protection of state law contractual remedies that are not property rights, such as the ability to foreclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.755" offset="10379177">I would like to make one point at this juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.039" offset="10388372">That is, Justice Scalia, you were absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.981" offset="10412091">Oversecured creditors would be entitled to not only receive their lost opportunity costs but also to receive their interest in addition to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.479" offset="10454096">Furthermore, it is true that if taken to its logical conclusion, that if the market rate is higher than the contract rate, then they would be getting a benefit over an oversecured creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.626" offset="10498713">Under Section 506(b) it is very clearly inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.810" offset="10515432">But what is even worse than that is that there is absolutely no reason why undersecured creditors would not be entitled to lost opportunity costs, for, were it not for the imposition of the automatic stay, they would have been entitled to go to judgment, they would have had a judgment lien on their property, and they would have had a right-in-property, a foreclosure right, that would have had measurable value.</text>

            <text syncTime="3031.388" offset="12265740">Finally, I would like to point out two things out of the legislative history that are amusing, if not interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.804" offset="12355393">There were two Amicus Briefs filed in this case, one by the National Commercial Finance Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.818" offset="12387471">In the legislative proceedings that preceded the enactment of the Code, the party speaking for National Commercial Finance Conference, during those Committee hearings, stated that the secured creditor should receive periodic payments during the pendency of the stay to cover depreciation of property or wear and tear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.135" offset="12484751">It is very interesting that they are now adopting a different approach, when in the Committee hearings they clearly adopted the approach that has been adopted by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.770" offset="12519233">Secondly, the other amicus that has filed in this case, American Bankers Association, also stated that the automatic stay should remain in effect if it is clear that the value of the secured creditor's claim against the collateral will be preserved, and further said that the suggested standards set forth in the Commission's notes should be included in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.756" offset="12615154">And the Commission's notes basically said that conditions which may be imposed by the Court when appropriate include, one, requiring other security of an equivalent or two, if there is no equity, or the equity is marginal, requiring additional security to the extent of the anticipated decrease in the value of collateral as a result of its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.699" offset="12702926">I find that very interesting, that they are now jumping on the bandwagon and taking the position that this is what the law was at the time that the Code was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.537" offset="12738348">I would also point out to the Court that there was only one comment in all of the legislative history that ended up with the Bankruptcy Code, that even talked about this issue, and it was a part of a law journal article from Mr. Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.818" offset="12811491">The law journal article was 63 California Law Review 1483, and the cite was, if the interim--</text>

            <text syncTime="3180.196" offset="12860914">I would like to begin by responding to Justice Stevens' question and just make clear what our position is on the Briggs issue, also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.837" offset="12923504">First of all, United's position is that a secured creditor, as well as others with interest in property of the estate... that may be a co-owner, or a spouse with interest in community property, anyone with interest in property of the estate... is entitled to protection for the costs of delay imposed by the automatic stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.948" offset="12991944">That does not necessarily require and it is not our position that that would necessarily require periodic post-petition payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.391" offset="13021724">Adequate protection may take the form of an equity cushion in the property, it may take the form of an alternative lien, it may take the form of a reorganization proposal or rehabilitation that is going to increase the value of the property such as the completion of goods in process where a lender has a security interest in manufacturing goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.045" offset="13100300">So that is going to depend on the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.439" offset="13109913">Our position is that some protection ought to be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.290" offset="13121303">Secondly, we agree with the Respondent that Briggs is not a very good response to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.083" offset="13148470">I think what Briggs does is tell each individual Bankruptcy Court to answer a legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.398" offset="13177727">That legal question being whether the time value of the secured creditor's rights are entitled to protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.453" offset="13201969">I think that is a legal question and it ought to be answered by the Appellate Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.375" offset="13717626">Under the Bankruptcy Code you have an ability to condition the stay and that raises the whole issue of what periodic payments or what other protection should be fashioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.101" offset="13752526">Under the Bankruptcy Act, protection for the cost of delay was provided in a different way by simply terminating the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.947" offset="13775931">I would like to return finally to the language of the statute, to again make clear our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.580" offset="13794531">The Petitioner does not rely so heavily on the phrases "adequate protection" and "indubitable equivalent" as the Respondent suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.884" offset="13823683">I do think that an analysis of those words supports our position and those arguments are set forth in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.838" offset="13847507">But I think a better argument and one that perhaps goes more to the heart of the issue is found by looking at the wording of Sections 361(1) and (2) which describe the objects of adequate protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.725" offset="13895050">Those sections are directed to decreases in the value of an interest in property... in this case a mortgage... so they are directed to decreases in the value of the mortgage that result from the automatic stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.046" offset="13948340">I think there is no serious question in this case that the automatic stay and the delay that is caused by the automatic stay, does result in a decrease in the value of a mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.673" offset="13994838">The Bankruptcy Court made specific findings as to what that damage was and how that value was decreased.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.607" offset="14018557">Those findings have never been questioned by the Respondent and were not questioned by the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.689" offset="14038932">It is clear that the value of that mortgage decreased as a result of the automatic stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.834" offset="14059517">It is also clear that that value is protected under state law under analogous causes of actions that might be filed under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.957" offset="14088042">Now, if Congress sought to protect the full value of creditors' interest in property, to protect the benefit of their bargain, how could it be that this important element of value that is recognized by state courts is somehow omitted?</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.118" offset="14148646">That is not suggested in the legislative history and I think it is clear that that element of value should be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.313" offset="14169440">Otherwise, we're left in a very odd position, which is that a Congress, which has directed in the legislative history that the full value of rights and property should be protected, will somehow have enacted a statute that leaves secured creditors worse off than they were under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3579.390" offset="14457727">And I think it is clear, as the Bankruptcy Court found, that if the automatic stay keeps the creditor from foreclosing for a period of time, then the value of that mortgage is decreased.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.988" offset="14496075">And that is what ought to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.680" offset="14502867">If the Court has no further questions, I will conclude.</text>
