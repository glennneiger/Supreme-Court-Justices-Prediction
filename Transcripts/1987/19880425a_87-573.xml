            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="19.825" offset="208303">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.288" offset="234217">The question presented in this case is whether a district court may properly dismiss an indictment with prejudice when it finds a minor violation of the time limits contained in the Speedy Trial Act of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.059" offset="285312">The Speedy Trial Act provides, in general, that a federal criminal prosecution, the trial in such a prosecution must commence within 70 days of the returning and making public of the indictment or information, or within 70 days of the defendant's first appearance of a judicial officer of the district, whichever occurs later.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.913" offset="368695">The act, of course, contains certain exclusions from the running of the 70-day time period, some of which were applied in this case for such things as other proceedings relating to the defendant, delay attributable to the removal or transportation of a defendant from another district, and continuances of the trial for situations in which the court finds that the ends of justice would warrant such a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.125" offset="457511">Now, if the defendant is not brought to trial within 70 days, taking account of any exclusions, the statute provides that the indictment or information shall be dismissed, but the act does not provide that such an indictment must be with prejudice, thereby forever closing the government from prosecuting the defendant for the conduct underlying the indictment or information.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.352" offset="554478">Congress considered such a proposal and also a proposal that would have created at least a presumption in favor of a prohibition against reprosecution, but Congress rejected that and instead adopted what is now in Section 3162(a)(2) of Title 18 dealing with the dismissal sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.007" offset="633054">There Congress provides that a balancing test must be applied in determining whether the indictment should be dismissed with our without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.150" offset="669626">And Congress specifically provided that the district court, in making that determination, shall consider, among other things, each of three separate factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.327" offset="710377">The first is the seriousness of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.488" offset="719049">The second is the facts and circumstances of the case that led to the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.162" offset="737649">And the third is the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of the Speedy Trial Act and on the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.057" offset="769309">In this case, the Court of Appeals affirming the district court found a violation of the Speedy Trial Act, a total of 14 days by which the 70-day time limit was exceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.546" offset="819255">The Court of Appeals then affirmed the district court's decision dismissing that indictment with prejudice despite the existence of what, in our view, are a host of factors, all of which weigh decidedly against that severe sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.514" offset="875053">For example--</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="193.109" offset="901489">That is the standard the courts have applied, and we don't dispute that as the legal test.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.106" offset="933462">But it is important to bear in mind several things along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.258" offset="950076">This is not a situation in which the district court's discretion is entirely unfettered.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.982" offset="968989">Congress prescribed the statutory standards that are to be applied, the ones that I just recited.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.126" offset="993544">So it is essential for the Court of Appeals to evaluate the district court's decision to see whether those factors were in fact taken into account; whether all the subsidiary considerations, for example, bearing on the administration of justice were considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.895" offset="1056656">And then in addition, whether the district court made a clear error in weighing the various considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.378" offset="1078599">In this case, we believe that in fact the district court erred in both respects by not giving full consideration to the relevant factors and by committing a clear error in the balancing to the extent it did consider them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="267.099" offset="1197404">We did argue that in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.790" offset="1204196">In fact, we do not dispute that there was a violation of the Speedy Trial Act here.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.743" offset="1231990">That conclusion is not free from doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.956" offset="1244842">For example, the way in which the continuance, the end of justice continuances were calculated in this case led to the scheduling of the trial on what the district court found to be the 69th day of the 70-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.705" offset="1295833">As we point out in a footnote in our brief, however, the premise of that was erroneous, and we disagree with the court's failure to exclude six days of the time limit that we explained at Pages 23 to 25 in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.514" offset="1351108">But as we present the case here, we assume that there was a violation, as we counted it, of eight days.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.476" offset="1374932">And so we are presenting the case on the question of remedy, not on whether there was a violation, although I do think that certainly the length of the delay and the question of whether it was a close question as to whether the act was even violated would properly bear on the question of whether the indictment should be dismissed with or without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.759" offset="1456120">So to that extent, the various arguments in which the... whether the clock should be restarted would be relevant on the question of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.047" offset="1493214">The various factors that we believe in this case weight heaving against dismissing the indictment with prejudice were, first, that the... as both courts below conceded, and as Respondent does not contest, the offenses in this case, narcotic offenses, both conspiracy and a possession count were serious, carrying potential for imprisonment up to--</text>

            <text syncTime="437.511" offset="1879095">But it gives to the district court a weighty responsibility to decide whether the dismissal should be with or without prejudice, because after all, a dismissal with prejudice results in the freeing of a defendant without an adjudication of his guilt or innocence, and it's generally regarded to be in the public interest for criminal charges to be adjudicated on the merits, and not dismissed for no reason... not no reason at all, but unless there are substantial reasons for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.088" offset="1989436">And also, Congress specifically charged the courts under the Speedy Trial Act with trying to draw the line between the serious and less serious violations of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.430" offset="4210785">That means I can correct one mistake, but leave the other mistake there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.067" offset="5337289">Well, during that period the marshall service was under no responsibility to take Respondent back to Washington because the state charges were still pending, and in fact he was being held in a state jail in San Francisco.</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.820" offset="6892307">In this case there was a series of delays in handling a person who had initially escaped from custody and was brought back into the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.760" offset="6948104">Now that particular situation was brought to the attention of Congress at the time that the Speedy Trial Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.004" offset="6977048">And it was actually brought to their attention that in that situation the way the Congress had orchestrated the act, it was going to require that people in this situation, post-indictment fugitives who are caught subsequent to their flight, were going to have to be given priority because they were not going to restart the clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.262" offset="7086135">They were going to only give them, in terms of the Speedy Trial Act, as much time as was remaining on that speedy trial clock at the time that they failed to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.561" offset="7135245">This was something that was considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.270" offset="7142142">This was a duty, an affirmative duty that the court, the trial court found that the United States Attorney failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.007" offset="7173071">She felt that with this duty it was his obligation to show prosecutorial initiative, make sure the marshals did it correctly, make sure the marshals were aware that there was a short amount of time left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.336" offset="7226360">Now there is no reason why the Speedy Trial Act should be violated because a person does what Mr. Taylor did in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.315" offset="8558292">And I think it's shown by the fact that they moved them down in four days when they wanted him back down here for a trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2157.676" offset="8759748">I think that what this court did was remove that burden by taking the total conduct of the Defendant, both his flight and what could be attributed to the drug case, assuming he was guilty; figured that she could cover all of that conduct with a five-year sentence, based on the fact that the co-defendant got three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.162" offset="8845743">But she felt it was important to send a message to the marshall, send a message to the United States Attorney that just because a guy runs away does not mean that he loses all of his speedy trial rights, and that the system itself needed to be shaken a little bit to make sure that they were going to fulfill their responsibilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2245.824" offset="9112297">I mean he got out about two weeks ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.486" offset="9118984">I mean he served a substantial amount of time, because they took into account in terms of the parole the fact... they assumed the underlying offense was there, and that he was guilty of it, and so his guidelines were adjusted upward, and he served a substantial amount of the time that he was sentenced to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.468" offset="9202889">I think he served three and a half to four years, which would be much more than a normal person would on a five-year sentence, with no essential criminal history.</text>

            <text syncTime="2294.637" offset="9307588">Well, I mean they didn't even honor the state court's order that he be returned to the state... to the court where that state proceeding was occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.202" offset="9345831">That judge on the 20th of February said, and sent them an order, I demand the presence of this man in my court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.259" offset="9386060">It was a petty theft case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.658" offset="9391702">The marshals ignored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.391" offset="9398599">They never produced him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.111" offset="9405495">Yet, later on they argued that he was in state custody for the purposes of the act and it shouldn't be excludable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.355" offset="9430468">I mean they can't really have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.246" offset="9437991">He was... I mean he spent maybe a month in custody before they got him in front of the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.453" offset="9474876">I would say five or six of those days he was about 300 feet from the magistrate's office in the holding cell upstairs in the federal building in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.631" offset="9515523">Yet, he never made it over to be arraigned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2352.324" offset="9538302">And, you know, that was the kind of conduct that the court felt she couldn't countenance, and it was not... it was a hollow remedy or a hollow sanction to say that you took too long, you didn't fulfill your responsibilities under the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.064" offset="9721263">She is the one who has to live with the way the Speedy Trial Act is going to be administered in her district, what the attitude of the prosecutors are in these various kinds of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.125" offset="9777583">She can evaluate all the competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.468" offset="9786883">She has all of the kinds of nuances in a case that a trial court knows about that don't really filter up: what she is going to give the guy later on, what the co-defendant got, what was the attitude as expressed by the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.858" offset="9852502">I mean this United States Attorney was recalcitrant, just absolutely was not willing to accept any responsibility to actively assure that this man was brought back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.995" offset="9893044">He knew there was only one day left of the speedy trial time, and yet he did nothing to make the system work a little faster, and that was a concept that was discussed in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.255" offset="9950096">It was brought to the attention of Congress by Mr. Snead from the U.S. Attorney's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.807" offset="9968277">And he says, we're going to have to give these guys priority if you don't restart the clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.781" offset="9992205">Now, I will agree that maybe Congress ought to change that, and restart the clock and give it a little extra time, but they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.338" offset="10022403">The statutory scheme is as it is, and the duty was... the duty was on the prosecutor to make sure that the system responded quickly and gave this guy a chance to get back up before the Speedy Trial Act was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.178" offset="10093769">And then in terms of the remedy, she did exactly what the statute told her to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.492" offset="10123027">She said, look, it's a serious offense, but, too, I believe it was the government's conduct that led to the dismissal and that requires a stern response.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.788" offset="10160225">And that if I'm going to administer the act and justice in this court and in this district, I have to respond sternly; otherwise the Speedy Trial Act is just a hollow guarantee and it doesn't really mean anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.247" offset="10210067">She had enough time to make it... I mean this is not a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.332" offset="10242354">This man got five years in a situation where had it just been the bail jump, I don't think she would have even considered giving him that much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.058" offset="10277253">It was the co-defendant, who they argued was of equal culpability, the same record, got three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.492" offset="10303062">She had enough time to work with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.775" offset="10312153">She balanced all of the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.036" offset="10321244">She was the one charged with the responsibility to evaluate all of these considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.010" offset="10345067">And I thought she came up with the perfect result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.642" offset="10363667">It saved the government the expense of retrying him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.674" offset="10375787">It saved the government the expense of going back before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.096" offset="10389476">It gave him an opportunity to get out of his pre-trial situation and start serving his time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.540" offset="10411209">And yet it took into account and was responsive to what justice demanded in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.504" offset="10443079">He shouldn't be rewarded for running away, and he wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.357" offset="10458439">He didn't get one extra day that counted towards the speedy trial time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.322" offset="10474321">And he was punished severely for what he did, and that was the scheme that Congress intended when they passed the Speedy Trial Act and noted that when a person runs away it doesn't restart the clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.848" offset="10528447">His flight didn't lead to the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.241" offset="10542031">The culpable conduct of the government, the lackadaisical attitude, the recalcitrant attitude, that's what led to the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.206" offset="10569825">And I think to put into the hands of the trial courts the discretion to deal with these complicated situations and competing interests is the best thing that this Court could do.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="2627.628" offset="10639520">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.929" offset="10648715">There are several points I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.329" offset="10654357">First, Respondent is wrong that his flight did not contribute, or was not one of the facts and circumstances leading to the dismissal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.785" offset="10692182">As the record makes completely clear, trial was scheduled on November 19, 1984, and if Respondent had shown up like he was supposed to, the trial would have been held within the Speedy Trial Act 70-day period and there would have been no occasion for a violation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.156" offset="10753622">And secondly, Respondent contributed by virtue of the fact that the delays found by the district court here were all involved in returning Respondent from the place to which he had fled back to the place in which he was supposed to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.156" offset="10805658">So Respondent cannot avoid all culpability for the Speedy Trial Act violation simply by saying he was separately prosecuted for the failure to show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.402" offset="10850693">His flight directly ties in to one of the statutory purposes on the remedy, and that is the effect of a reprosecution on the administration of the Speedy Trial Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.400" offset="10898654">Respondent undermined the purposes of the Speedy Trial Act and a reprosecution of Respondent would demonstrate that a defendant who deliberately flouts that act will not get away with it, and will be... and the charges that he sought to to avoid will in fact be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.710" offset="10963856">The second point I would like to say is that counsel says that the marshall service ignored an order of February 20th requiring the marshall to return Respondent to state custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.259" offset="11018086">In fact, that order, which appears at the excerpt of record on page 20, is directed to the sheriff of San Francisco County, not to the marshall service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.354" offset="11050478">And there was no doubt that if the San Mateo Court had wanted Respondent for an appearance, it could have gotten him from the sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.751" offset="11080049">There is no indication in fact that the marshall service was aware of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.900" offset="11092692">The third point is that as the record shows the Assistant U.S. Attorney in fact believed the clock restarted when Respondent was brought back to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.180" offset="11137727">And far from being recalcitrant, he was operating on a misunderstanding of what the act requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.913" offset="11168656">And the fourth point I wanted to make is that although the district court--</text>

            <text syncTime="2774.033" offset="11225185">The last point I wanted to make is that although the district court recited the second and third facts, the facts and circumstances and the effect on the administration of the act and justice, she only focused on the marshall service conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.222" offset="11277952">She didn't focus on the other facts and circumstances and the effect on the administration of justice that weigh strongly against dismissal of the indictment with prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.342" offset="11470422">Here it happened to be related, but we don't think that that has any bearing on the court's requirement to focus on the seriousness of the charges carrying 15 years offenses, narcotics offenses, and the fact that the Defendant's flight undermined the purposes of the act.</text>
