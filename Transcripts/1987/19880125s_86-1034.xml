            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.443" offset="37721">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.547" offset="62171">The United States District Court in Virginia and affirmed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, declared unconstitutionally following Virginia statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.651" offset="122567">“It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly display for commercial purposes in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse visual or written material that depicts sexually explicit nudity, sexual conduct or sadomasochistic abuse and which is harmful to juveniles."</text>
            <text syncTime="54.030" offset="216085">The unique factual and procedural setting of this case leads us to conclude that an authoritative construction of this, this Virginia statute by the Virginia Supreme Court, would substantially aid our review of this constitutional holding and might well determine the case entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.683" offset="302707">Accordingly, we have concluded that we should not attempt to review the holding at this time but should certify first two questions to the Virginia Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.671" offset="350668">That court has a certification procedure embodied in its Rule 5:42 that authorizes our submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.770" offset="395076">And pursuant to the rule, we respectfully certify to the Virginia Supreme Court the following questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.460" offset="425796">First, does the phrase, "harmful to juveniles" is used and the Virginia Code properly construed encompass any of the books introduced as plaintiffs' exhibits below and what general standard should be used to determine the statute's reach in light of juveniles' differing ages and levels of maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.884" offset="519523">And a second question, what meaning is to be given to the provision of the Virginia Code making it unlawful and, “to knowingly display for commercial purposes in a manner whereby juveniles may examine or peruse certain materials?”</text>
            <text syncTime="148.430" offset="593711">Specifically, is the provision complied with by a plaintiff bookseller who has a policy of not permitting juveniles to examine and peruse materials covered by the statute and who prohibits such conduct when observed, but otherwise, takes no action regarding the display of restricted materials?</text>
            <text syncTime="168.392" offset="673541">If not, would the statute be complied with if the store's policy were announced or otherwise manifested to the public?</text>
            <text syncTime="178.264" offset="713038">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
