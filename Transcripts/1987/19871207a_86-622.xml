            <label>Mr. Keith A. Teel</label>
            <text syncTime="56.420" offset="364316">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.372" offset="376124">These cases today raise two issues for your consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.074" offset="394932">The primary issue is not, as the Government suggests in its brief, the medical question of whether alcoholism is a disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.346" offset="428055">That issue has been decided by the Congress, which has determined that alcoholism is a handicap and that it is an illness, a finding that is conclusively supported by the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the National Council on Alcoholism, all of whom have filed briefs in support of petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.093" offset="515095">Instead, the question here is whether the Veterans' Administration can ignore Congress' determination and enforce a regulation that defines alcoholism to be willful misconduct, which regulation is applied to bar alcoholic veterans from obtaining extensions of the time in which to use their VA educational benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.340" offset="592000">We contend that the VA cannot use such a regulation because it is impermissibly discriminatory under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.279" offset="631810">Before reaching that issue, however, there is a threshold question of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts even to consider the legality of the willful misconduct regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.052" offset="670890">Section 211(a) of the Veterans Benefits Statutes precludes review of certain VA decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.907" offset="698266">The Government argues for a sweeping interpretation of section 211(a), one that would bar review of all VA action except constitutional challenges to VA statutes, and challenges by persons not themselves in a position to receive Veterans' Administration benefits by who are affected by VA action.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.321" offset="787918">Petitioners argue that Section 211(a) should be read slightly more narrowly and that at a minimum review of VA regulations to determine whether they comply with non-VA statutes is permitted.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="175.830" offset="841939">Is that because of the text, Mr. Teel, that you say that review of Regs to see if they comply with non-VA statutes?</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Teel</label>
            <text syncTime="185.102" offset="879033">It is because of the text and because of the legislative history and the statutory scheme for review that we believe Congress created here, which I will explain in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.409" offset="928352">The petitioners here are both honorably discharged veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.944" offset="946429">They each have a family history of alcoholism, and each of them began drinking while they were children; Mr. Traynor at age 8, Mr. McKelvey at age 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.567" offset="984986">After they left the Service, they were both disabled by alcoholism for a period of six to eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.572" offset="1012989">Before 1977, veterans were required to use their educational benefits within a period of ten years following their separation from the Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.928" offset="1054367">In 1977, the Educational Benefits statute was amended by the Congress to allow extensions of the limiting date, the ten-year period, to veterans who had been unable to use those benefits within the ten year period because of a disability that was not the result of their own willful misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.223" offset="1127614">Both petitioners here applied for an extension of the time in which to use their benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.841" offset="1150080">Both were denied that extension in decisions of the Board of Veterans Appeals, in which the Board of Veterans Appeals stated explicitly the extension were being denied on the basis of the Willful Misconduct Regulation at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.302" offset="1211833">Thereafter, both petitioners brought suit; both prevailed on summary judgment in the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.623" offset="1237120">In the Courts of Appeals, Mr. Traynor lost on the jurisdictional issue in the Second Circuit; Mr. McKelvey lost on the merits question in the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.729" offset="1277557">We believe that both Courts were in error on the issues in which they ruled against petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.300" offset="1299918">I'd like to begin with the jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.835" offset="1321965">It is difficult to imagine a less attractive circumstance for a Federal Agency to argue that review is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.541" offset="1348819">In this case, the Veterans Administration refused to decide the issue here; whether this regulation violated the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.278" offset="1379748">Even though it would not decide the question, it contends that the Courts cannot decide the question either.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.415" offset="1404303">Finally, at the same time it is making these arguments to the Courts, it has repeatedly during this decade told the Congress in response to questions, and in testimony, that review of VA regulations is in fact permitted under Section 211(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="332.643" offset="1469192">As with any case involving the question of bars to judicial review, we begin here with a strong presumption that there is judicial review which can be overcome by a clear and convincing showing that Congress did not intend such review.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.419" offset="1536379">In Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, in 1984, this Court enunciated a number of factors that should be considered in deciding whether review is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.210" offset="1575562">The first of these is the language of the Statute; others are the structure of the statutory scheme and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.197" offset="1607432">Let me address those three elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.482" offset="1620597">First, with respect to the language of Section 211(a), is not as sweeping as the Government suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.386" offset="1648183">The specific language at issue here is whether decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact, under any law administered by the VA providing benefits to veterans is barred from review.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.228" offset="1707533">Now, certainly the Congress could have drafted a statute far more clearly had they intended to entirely preclude review of everything affecting the VA.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.834" offset="1749956">They simply could have said, nothing the VA does can be challenged in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.405" offset="1764271">That's not what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.205" offset="1771481">We have a statute here with a number of specific clauses that must be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.823" offset="1789975">First, there's a requirement in the Statute that a decision be on a question of law or fact arising under any statute administered by the Veterans' Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.381" offset="1832189">Judge Kearse noted in her dissent in Traynor in the Second Circuit that not only was the Rehabilitation Act not administered by the VA, there's a distinction there between administering and complying with a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.724" offset="1889554">Presumably all Federal agencies comply with Federal statutes of broad scope that affect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.211" offset="1915467">Administering a statute, we believe, indicates some expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.698" offset="1941485">Here, the President, by Executive Order, has delegated the administration of Section 504 to the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.637" offset="1977221">This Court recognized in its decision in 1986 in Bowen v. American Hospital Association that a number of agencies have issued regulations under Section 504 and that those agencies do not have any particular expertise so there is no reason to give deference to those agencies' views with respect to Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.182" offset="2051409">The reason we believe that is relevant is that is some indication that those agencies do not administer the statute; they merely comply with a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.538" offset="2084845">Secondly, there is a requirement that the Statute provide benefits to veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.858" offset="2106057">Again, the Rehabilitation Act does not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.227" offset="2119536">What we have with the Rehabilitation Act is a limitation on the power of Federal agencies to discriminate against handicapped persons on the basis of their handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.499" offset="2156630">Now, the structure and the legislative history are essential to understanding the scope of Section 211(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="510.487" offset="2180663">It is our position that the Congress crafted a rational scheme for review of VA actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.607" offset="2217130">Certain actions are subject to review in the Board of Veterans' Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.079" offset="2247014">Section 4004(a) of the Veterans Statutes establishes the jurisdiction of the Board of Veterans' Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.118" offset="2279092">It makes clear in Section 4004(c) that the Board of Veterans Appeals does not have authority to review regulations of the Veterans' Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.160" offset="2323291">It is bound by those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.076" offset="2331023">That, as petitioners discovered here in their administrative hearings in this case, is a restriction taken quite seriously by the Board of Veterans' Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.968" offset="2374491">The Board of Veterans' Appeals in both cases here stated that it was powerless to review regulations of the Veterans' Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.573" offset="2408973">It was bound by those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.073" offset="2414929">With this view, this Court basically is left with two alternatives; one is to make a decision that nevertheless despite the view of the Board of Veterans' Appeals, there is no review available here.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.201" offset="2483474">The effect of that is that the Veterans' Administration could pick and choose among those Federal Statutes that it wanted to pay attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.343" offset="2528091">It could decide not to bother with the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.461" offset="2544496">It could decide not to bother with the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.829" offset="2557975">And presumably under the Government's interpretation of Section 211(a), the Veterans' Administration could do so with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.583" offset="2589009">We believe that that is not supported by the language of the Statute, and that the more rational interpretation of Section 211(a) is that while decisions of the Veterans' Administration within the specific facts of a veteran's case under Veterans' laws as to whether a particular veteran is entitled to benefits is consigned to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, but that challenges to regulations under non-Veterans' Administration statutes may be reviewed in the Federal Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.271" offset="3047719">It's only in this case they seem to be arguing something differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.140" offset="3063183">They have repeatedly expressed the view to the Congress that review in these circumstances is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.478" offset="3088574">In 1952, they explained to the Congress that they believed that Section 211(a) barred review of determinations arising in the facts of particular veterans' cases under particular Veterans' law, and they gave as an example, rating decisions, degrees of disability, that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.588" offset="3153045">No mention of regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.805" offset="3157851">More recently, the Veterans' Administration has been questioned repeatedly since 1980 on this issue by the Congress and has stated that in their view, regulations of the Veterans' Administration are subject to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.533" offset="3220754">Indeed, what is particularly striking is they most recently said that in response to a letter from Senator Ganston in 1986, which was after the decisions of these courts on the Courts of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.729" offset="4357603">And it significantly does not make any distinction on the basis of wilful misconduct in treating those patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.299" offset="4379859">Despite that, it continues to enforce a regulation that we believe is based on nothing more than the history of the Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.620" offset="4409116">The regulation comes from the era of prohibition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.327" offset="4563970">This Court recognized in Arline that alcoholics are covered by the language of the Rehabilitation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.998" offset="4598661">Again, the facts in this case indicate that the answer must be, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.606" offset="4865110">There may be other points about it but what characterizes the illness in its active phase is drinking behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.528" offset="4892800">We believe the two must be taken part and parcel, at least with respect to this kind of regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.931" offset="6966400">Congress has spoken plainly and directly on the two questions that are at issue in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.967" offset="6990537">One jurisdictional, the other substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.252" offset="6999627">First, did Congress intend to preclude judicial review in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.538" offset="7016868">The answer is, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.454" offset="7020525">And second, did Congress intend for the GI bill to be administered just as the VA has administered it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.942" offset="7046439">And the answer, again, is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.894" offset="7054276">The common theme in both issues is ultimately the principle that Congressional intent must govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.798" offset="7081861">The Statute barring judicial review, Section 211(a) precludes review of decisions of the Administrator on any question of fact or law under any law administered by the VA providing benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2850.503" offset="11540650">Let me address the question briefly as to whether review extends only to regulations or turn that around, whether the preclusion of review extends only to adjudications in individual cases, or it applies to regulations as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.179" offset="11603343">The petitioners have argued that there has been very little litigation on this subject, very few cases brought, even though a number of circuits have permitted judicial review of VA decisions in particular instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.141" offset="11667187">The question really isn't whether we can predict whether flood gates will open and the waters will rush in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.449" offset="11716506">It's more important to look at what Congress was saying when it was writing the statute and whether it was concerned about flood gates, and the answer to that is, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.321" offset="11756003">In 1970, when 211 was amended to its present form as this Court discussed in its decision in Johnson v. Robison, it was done as a reaction to decisions by the D.C. Circuit that had permitted review in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.532" offset="11828832">And the legislative history which is discussed in Johnson v. Robison, and is also discussed in then Judge Scalia's opinion in the case of Gott v. Walters, indicates that there was concern that there were 353 cases pending in the D.C. Circuit alone, and that there was concern that future cases would be brought based on individual benefits determinations and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.667" offset="11933322">And that was part of Congress' concern and that is part of the basis upon which Congress amended the Statute to read the way it does today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.827" offset="12101969">And Congress came in and said, no, we want no review; we don't want to involve the courts in the day to day workings of the VA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.218" offset="12143556">Now, would a decision that you could challenge regulations, even the validity of regulations under other statutes interfere with the day to day workings of the VA?</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.692" offset="12189427">And the answer to that is, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.326" offset="12196010">Just one example is that the VA has a regulation on the ratings for disability of malaria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.730" offset="12221610">It's got four categories that rate the disability from 100 percent to 50 percent to 30 percent to 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.336" offset="12255987">The gradations depend on such things as whether there have been three relapses in a six month period or two relapses in a six month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.923" offset="12290364">I suppose that someone could claim that current medical evidence makes that distinction inappropriate, that two serious relapses is more important than three not so serious relapses, and that he shouldn't be discriminated against because he happened to have two rather than three relapses of malaria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.021" offset="12374792">Well, under petitioners' theory, he would get into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.889" offset="12390256">That's just one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.925" offset="12398406">Asthma is another condition with four categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.377" offset="12412199">High blood pressure has four categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.277" offset="12419827">Ulcers have five.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.495" offset="12424633">Epilepsy has six.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.745" offset="12429649">And blindness has more than 100 different ratings categories in the regulations that depend upon the degree of impairment division.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.851" offset="12470086">A suggestion that reviewing regulations would not inject the courts into the day to day workings of the VA has no basis in fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.473" offset="12932558">Let me say something about a case, considering the subject matter of this case it is quite astonishing that the case has not been mentioned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.983" offset="12990654">This is not the first time that this Court has been asked to consider the legal ramifications of alcoholism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.487" offset="13016568">In Powell v. Texas, the Court refused to accept the blanket rule that alcoholics may not be asked to bear some degree of responsibility for their conduct, criminal responsibility in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.843" offset="13062021">And the Court recognized that alcoholism is not merely status, it involves conduct, drinking, for which there may be an element of volition, at least at some point in the progression leading toward chronic alcoholism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.186" offset="13131402">Now, the Powell case is discussed in our brief in several places, but it's not mentioned in Petitioners brief or reply brief, or in any of the amicus submissions and hasn't been mentioned today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.612" offset="13181139">I've tried to explain that the VA policy is not a blanket disqualification of alcoholics from benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.468" offset="13224503">They get rehabilitation and treatment and medical services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.622" offset="13241116">They also get educational benefits if they apply within the ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.990" offset="13262641">So there's some reasonable access to the package of benefits that we're talking about in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.362" offset="13296078">With respect to the language of willful misconduct, that is language that petitioners try to paint as deriving from prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.557" offset="13360862">What's more important about that language is that it derives from the statutes that deal with veterans benefits for disability compensation and pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.628" offset="13389179">And no one can seriously claim that a disability compensation which amounts to $1355 a month for a total disability and that's not an income-sensitive amount, that that should be paid to someone whose sole disability is alcohol abuse or drug abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.141" offset="13471203">And I should mention that the VA has a regulation that treats drug abuse, for the purposes of these programs, in a similar way to the way it treats alcoholism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.330" offset="13507983">Because to take that position would be tantamount to paying that person for life to continue drinking or taking drugs, and would discourage treatment or rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.555" offset="13556885">And it is certainly an appropriate response for Congress to take to say that funds would be better spent on rehabilitation and treatment than on simply providing pensions and disability compensations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.897" offset="13610279">And I should add also that a claim along those lines has already been made, a claim for alcoholism disability has been made in the pension area and is pending in the Third Circuit and is mentioned in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.772" offset="13661792">Now, in 1977, Congress incorporated the willful misconduct language into the educational benefit program to assess who was entitled to this extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.330" offset="13711947">And it took a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.151" offset="13727307">It didn't make up some language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.184" offset="13735458">It took a term of art that had a particular meaning that had evolved in VA pension determinations over the course of years, a position that was first addressed in 1931, was reviewed again in 1964, and was reviewed again in 1972 when the present regulation was promulgated and sent out for notice and comment, and there was only one comment on this regulation when it was proposed in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.134" offset="13839216">So the VA's position is not as it's been suggested woodenly fixed in the early days of the century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.490" offset="13868682">It has evolved in response to changing conditions as to the facts as they were presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.651" offset="14041299">And the VA went up there and said, well, you may say that now, but in your Committee Report in 1977 you said that by using the term, willful misconduct, we intend for the VA to apply that term as it's applied it in the other contexts, and specifically referenced this regulation--</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Teel</label>
            <text syncTime="3575.315" offset="14439928">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.849" offset="14446093">What it said was, the Court there I think was concerned about extending the principle of you can't do something to somebody just because of their status to regulating conduct that went along with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.157" offset="14499278">The express concern in that case I think was along the lines of criminal statutes in the states, for instance, regulating drunk driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.263" offset="14527699">The Court wanted to make clear it did not reach those kinds of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.882" offset="14542223">But with respect to regulation based solely on somebody's status as an alcoholic, which is what we think this regulation does, we think Robinson is still controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.690" offset="14585482">Well, that was in a criminal context, constitutional context, to the extent that it has any relevance at all or that Powell does, we contend we're Robinson and we're not Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.663" offset="14633339">The Rehabilitation Act, as this Court noted in Arline, requires an individualized determination of each handicapped person's situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.603" offset="14673045">That is at essence the problem with a regulation like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.555" offset="14688927">This Regulation is discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.423" offset="14696346">We believe it cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.125" offset="14707213">However, we contend that a decision our way here, the probable result of that decision would be to send these cases back to the Veteran's Administration with a directive that you've got the law wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.985" offset="14766563">The law is, alcoholism is a handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.436" offset="14780460">You can't discriminate solely on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.705" offset="14793521">Now, you have a Statute in 1977 that says the VA does have a right to decide whether a particular petitioner, particular veteran engaged in willful misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.030" offset="14838765">The effective of a decision for petitioners here is to send these cases back to the Veterans' Administration for that willful misconduct determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.619" offset="14873143">The delimiting date extension statute would still have force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.004" offset="14890697">The VA just would be unable on the basis of these petitioners' condition as alcoholics to say that alone means you don't get your benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.944" offset="14926432">That is in essence what our case is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.080" offset="14938971">The VA is ignoring the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.615" offset="14953182">They will continue to do so as long as this regulation stands, and therefore, we believe this regulation should be invalidated by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.353" offset="14980036">If there are no further questions.</text>
