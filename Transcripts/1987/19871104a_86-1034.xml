            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142310">We will hear argument first this morning in No. 86-1034, Virginia v. American Booksellers Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.606" offset="180658">Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Bain Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="12.558" offset="192465">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court, we are here this morning on a case involving a 1985 amendment to a Virginia statute shielding the exposure of juveniles to certain sexually explicit material by regulating the manner of its display, and despite outward appearances, frankly, from reading both sides' briefs, I would suggest to this Court that the issue in this case is really very simple, because we really have one issue, and the issue turns on the type of material that this amendment affects.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.353" offset="379711">Now, from the start of this litigation, from literally the first page of the transcript, the plaintiffs in this case have painted a picture of a statute with a very broad range effect, a range of material involving material with great beauty and great literary value, a range of material that they include James Joyce's Ulysses, William Faulkner's Sanctuary, and even the Penguine Book of Love Poetry, which is an anthology of all the great poems of the English language from Robert Browning to Alfred Lord Tennyson.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.366" offset="547730">If that range is correct, if they are correct that this amendment involves that material, then we lose the case, and I submit to the Court that we should lose the case, because the Commonwealth of Virginia does not desire to restrict in any way, directly or indirectly, that type of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.147" offset="646891">But by the same token, if the material affected is not this broad range, then I would submit to the Court that the plaintiffs cannot prevail, because every burden that they speculate about, every terrible effect that they speculate about, all of their evidence in the District Court, everything in their brief, and I am sure everything that Mr. Bator is going to say this morning turns on that concept of this broad range material, and I would say--</text>

            <text syncTime="163.439" offset="795998">I would submit to the Court that the statute they are attacking, the statute involving this broad range of material is a hypothetical statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.395" offset="839884">It does not exist in Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.988" offset="898189">Justice O'Connor, I am sure today that the day that I die my tombstone is going to say</text>
            <text syncTime="193.708" offset="917102">"Richard B. Smith said Hollywood Wives was obscene. "</text>
            <text syncTime="196.660" offset="928909">I have said it over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.279" offset="939358">What we said was, one of their witnesses said, of all the exhibits that they put in, of all their exhibits, that was the only one that she said she thought children should not see.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.068" offset="978542">And so in the Court of Appeals and the brief, I think it was in a footnote, I said, of all the exhibits, that was the only one that might be involved based on what she had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.526" offset="1020338">I have since gone back... I came up, I looked through all the exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.911" offset="1033921">Not one exhibit they have submitted falls within this statute, including Hollywood Wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.215" offset="1059103">Now, what we suggest to the Court this statute involves is not this broad range of conceded beauty, conceded literary value, of very narrow range.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.606" offset="1112707">This statute deals with borderline obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.843" offset="1125663">It deals with exactly the same thing that Ginsburg v. New York dealt with, borderline obscenity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="252.997" stopTime="256.616">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="252.997" offset="1154294">Well, what is your point, that the appellees had no standing below?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_bain_smith" startTime="256.616" stopTime="330.163">
            <label>Mr. Richard Bain Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="256.616" offset="1168713">Justice O'Connor, I would submit that... I agree with what Mr. Bator said in his brief, that really the standing question and the merits question here turn on the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.174" offset="1210927">If the material they are talking about is this broad range, then they have standing, because concededly that is the type of material that they are displaying and have been selling to juveniles, and we concede that, what they are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.147" offset="1262859">But the point is that the burden that they have suggested exists here is that because of this broad range it is impossible for them to be able to comply with the statute both financially and otherwise without putting themselves out of business, or at least severely restricting their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.513" offset="1352302">And because of that, they... both their First Amendment rights and the First Amendment rights of adults will be overly restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.885" offset="1389814">And that, I think, is the importance of this broad range effect, because if we are talking about this narrow range of borderline obscenity, for one thing, there is nothing in the record to indicate that there is any burden whatsoever placed on them by that type of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.961" offset="1450104">And secondly, I would suggest to the Court that that is--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="330.163" offset="1462957">Well, how are we supposed to decide that, by looking at the words of the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_bain_smith" startTime="335.115" stopTime="387.464">
            <label>Mr. Richard Bain Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="335.115" offset="1482705">--I would suggest to the Court two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.483" offset="1492214">First, the amendment and the definitional statute, because that is something that the plaintiffs have purposely ignored in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.005" offset="1530248">It is something that their witnesses below were never shown, was the definitions of the material involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.243" offset="1559192">And I would submit that both from the face of the statute and their evidence supports that there is this narrow range, and I say that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.182" offset="1595032">The definitions involved here are the same ones that the statute in Ginsburg versus New York used.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.753" offset="1625229">It is not just any sex, any sexual content that is in a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.989" offset="1646232">And that is where they have made their big mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.874" offset="1661801">They have assumed all the way through that if there is any sexual content whatsoever, then this material falls within our amendment.</text>
