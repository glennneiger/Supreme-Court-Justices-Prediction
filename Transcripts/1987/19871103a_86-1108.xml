            <label>Ms. Susan R. Harritt</label>
            <text syncTime="60.055" offset="377194">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.005" offset="381060">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.906" offset="392658">This cause is before this Court on a writ of certiorari from a decision of the Vermont Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.477" offset="418885">That Court erroneously held that this Respondent's Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination was violated by the state's pre-sentence investigative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.951" offset="468831">At the pre-sentence investigation interview, where the Respondent was given the choice of participation or not, the Respondent made statements that the Judge considered at the later sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.343" offset="518359">The Vermont Supreme Court also committed error beyond the compulsion decision when it mistakenly relied on Estelle v. Smith and held that the Respondent's sentence had been enhanced despite the fact that Respondent's exposure to his criminal responsibility remained the same as his exposure following his nolo contendere pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.874" offset="608534">The state's court's decision improperly extended the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination on these facts and created an unwarranted obstacle to the individualized sentencing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.134" offset="669556">Turning briefly to the facts, the record reveals that the Respondent entered three pleas of nolo contendere at a change of plea hearing, at which time the Court ordered a presentence investigation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.393" offset="726607">This order was made in the presence of counsel and Respondent, pursuant to Vermont practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.213" offset="753879">Ms. Harritt, does the record indicate whether either the Court or the probation officer told the Respondent the purpose of the interview?</text>

            <text syncTime="165.938" offset="800795">No, the record doesn't indicate whether or not the Respondent was told by the Court or the probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.675" offset="827754">However, the purpose of the interview is clearly spelled cut in both criminal rules as well as the statutes in addition to Vermont practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.198" offset="865788">The pre-sentence investigation report, in fact, follows a prescribed format that is known to all practicing... persons... pardon me... practicing criminal law and certainly since the attorney for Respondent was a public defender, the format was not a surprise to her.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="201.611" offset="943424">Well, does the record indicate whether the public defender had notice of the time that interview would be given?</text>

            <text syncTime="210.467" offset="978846">No, the record doesn't reveal notice as to the precise time when the interview would take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.288" offset="1006222">However, it's clear from the practice in Vermont that the interview did not take place immediately after the change of plea hearing, and, so, it was, therefore, incumbent on defense counsel to prepare her client knowing the purpose of the report and the fact that the admissions of the Defendant, had he chose to submit to the interview, should be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.670" offset="5103685">The difference, we believe, is this: the restraints that a person has on him in custody imposed the background environment in which he must live, but those restraints are not of the type that would necessarily in every case lead a person to believe that he had no alternative but to confess when he is confronted with someone who is asking him questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.001" offset="5189053">That is the situation that Miranda faced and that is the situation to which Miranda addressed its warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.356" offset="5214444">A person who is questioned about an unsolved crime in the basement of a police station house not only has a restriction on his freedom of movement, but he also has a dislocation that accompanies the change in the environment from which he was into the one he is in now, and there is also the insinuation by the inquisitor that the questioning will not cease until a confession is obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.139" offset="5313605">Those factors are not necessarily present in every type of prison questioning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.043" offset="7353246">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.114" offset="7377487">The decision of the Vermont Supreme Court in this case is correct on at least two separate grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.768" offset="7404132">First, the Court's finding of a Fifth Amendment violation, that is, improper compulsion to give up the right to remain silent, correctly decides that Mr. Cox was required by the probation officer unnecessarily to give up a right recognized by the Vermont Supreme Court that he had to make the important decision about participating in the pre-sentence investigation interview whether to participate, whether to not participate, or to what extent to participate, only after consultation with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.291" offset="7542163">Because Mr. Cox was told by the probation officer that he could not make a counsel but only an uncounselled decision about participation in the interview, a choice which wasn't even a correct statement, much less a legitimate statement of his options under state law, his disclosure--</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.652" offset="7615620">Wasn't a correct statement of his options under state law... why didn't the Supreme Court of Vermont go on that ground rather than raising a federal constitutional question?</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.508" offset="7651042">--I think they felt that depriving, Mr. Chief Justice, depriving him of a state law benefit, if it be only a state law benefit to have the right to counsel before being required to participate in the pre-sentence investigation interview, was a valuable state benefit, and as this Court has held in its Fifth Amendment penalty cases, when you seek to retain a valuable, albeit state-created benefit, and the Government says you're going to lose that benefit, if you claim the Fifth Amendment, then the Court has found that that is compulsion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.200" offset="7905788">No, no, Your Honor, the Court didn't decide the case on any basis, any federal basis, other than the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.271" offset="7930134">The fact that the State of Vermont uses the presentence investigation process at all, I think we can concede, is a decision that they would have to undertake as a matter of federal constitutional law or possibly as a matter of federal constitutional law, they wouldn't have to say that in order to be given a valid opportunity, you have to be able to give the counsel an opportunity to participate in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.860" offset="8072449">But even if these rights are only guaranteed by state law, that doesn't lessen the impropriety of conditioning the right, the federal right to remain silent on giving up these state benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.585" offset="8119365">In the Court's other cases, holding that states may not condition exercise of Fifth Amendment rights on forfeiture of a benefit, the benefit is typically state-created, the right to employment as a police man or sanitation worker, the right to bid on and to get government contracts, or the right to hold political office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.249" offset="8205987">The Solicitor General and the State of Vermont seem to argue that this right isn't very important, that it's minimized as a right that isn't important or isn't that important, so that to lose that right amounts to compulsion to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.614" offset="8303476">Well, the ABA Standards in the Vermont Court's own decision, I think, as well as its rules and its practice indicate that most people think that for a defendant who has been convicted, there is nothing more important than a presentence investigation report and possibly there is nothing more important about that report than what the defendant does in response to his opportunity to offer a statement or decline a statement to that report.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.535" offset="12179212">The reason why I think independent of the Fifth Amendment argument, which I think I've presented on the assumption that there is no necessary federal right to counsel at this stage, is that there's a state right to counsel and that was burdened by the choices offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.986" offset="12284955">But I also think independent of that, this Court should decide that where there's a guilty pleading or nolo pleading defendant or in any case where there's a conviction and there's no sentence that for the pre-sentence investigation process should be subject to the Sixth Amendment only in this respect, and that is in the respect that when the defendant is interviewed, that defendant, just like in post-indictment lineup, he's confronted with agents of the state who can do things, just like in a post-indictment interrogation, he's confronted with agents of the state in which he needs to make those fine distinctions about what may or may not incriminate him, in the same way that what happens at a line-up or what happens at a post-indictment and pre-trial interrogation can seal the fate of the defendant making the trial a formality, the sentencing hearing in the same way can become a walk-through, if the defendant has essentially operated without counsel during his interview with the probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.297" offset="12562167">I think the Court could very well find and given the analogy, I think, to the other processes by which the Court has determined that critical confrontations outside of court between a defendant and the government are... those kinds of things which Sixth Amendment protects, was designed to protect, I think the Court can support the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court strictly on the basis of the Sixth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.925" offset="13556700">We have an individual who had had the opportunity to consult with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.960" offset="13572896">It's clear that he made a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.476" offset="13582927">He thought that he could score some points and possibly persuade the probation officer that he had a particular personality or mitigating circumstances that he thought should be conveyed in the pre-sentence investigation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.803" offset="13640188">This Court should not prohibit him from exercising his own judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.421" offset="13658683">Rightly or wrongly, we don't think he scored any points, but he thought that he did and he should not be precluded from having that opportunity to make that judgment and present what he thought was in his best interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.079" offset="13705389">Thank you.</text>
