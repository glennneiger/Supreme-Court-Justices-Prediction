            <text syncTime="180.490" offset="855569">It is adopted as legislation as it appears in this book, line by line, in a majority of the states of the United States, and in a majority of the large municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.499" offset="919621">It is adopted by most of the other states with relatively modest amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.886" offset="953162">This controversy began when Carlon, as it has been called, a subsidiary of the respondent, and we have referred to Carlon throughout the case rather than Indian Head, Carlon undertook to have a new Article 331 added to this Code which would have included as suitable equipment electric nonmetallic tubing made of polyvinyl chloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.202" offset="1078446">That tubing is a kind of raceway for carrying wires through the walls and floors of buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.276" offset="1106658">And the objective of Carlon was to have that product included in this Code because, as we all agree, without such inclusion it couldn't sell it in most of the places throughout the United States where that Code is law.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.472" offset="1191504">There has been evidence throughout this case that there is, was at all times that are material scientific evidence that this tubing made of polyvinyl chloride is unsafe, that it was hazardous to human life in the event of fire, which is what that Code is, of course, ultimately concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.367" offset="1291082">I might mention that since a footnote in our friend's brief suggests that that statement is misleading, I should say that at Page 4A of the petitioner's appendix you will find the circuit reflecting the concurrent findings of both lower courts that there was scientific evidence of the hazardousness of this product at the material times in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.575" offset="1399856">Now, the way you get something into this Code is by a multistep process that the circuit described.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.806" offset="1432771">First, the proposed article goes before a so-called Code-making panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.414" offset="1455236">Whatever happens there is reviewable at a second step, a membership meeting of the members of the NFPA, the Fire Protection Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.580" offset="1507899">If there is a result which the party adversely affected wishes to complain there is an appeal to a Standards Council and to the Board of Directors, and then if there has been a rejection of a proposed article, there is a procedure for seeking a tentative interim amendment which would put the proposed article into the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.366" offset="1611030">Now, this whole case centers on the second step, the membership vote, which took place in this case on May 20, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.986" offset="1657528">The Code-making panel had at first rejected ENMT, their product, then changed its decision and approved it subject to the membership meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.012" offset="1709669">At that next step, all members of the NFPA, and there were at the time 31,500 members, all members who had held membership for 30 days or more are eligible to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.788" offset="1772780">Now, the members are explicitly and as everyone understands interest group representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.956" offset="1809456">Quoting from the NFPA's description of itself, interested members, and most members are interested, as part of the process that the NFPA describes and extols, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="434.293" offset="1870792">"have the privilege of designating their representatives and instructing them how to vote. "</text>
            <text syncTime="440.509" offset="1895660">Now, Allied within that rule as part of the effort of itself and other companies in competition with this polyvinyl product collected 155 members for that May 20 meeting, and those members included executives of the company, employees, sales agents, and even the wife of a sales director.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.746" offset="2012585">Other steel companies also gathered whatever members they could, so that among them these alleged conspirators had 230 votes at that meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.898" offset="2061172">The final vote went 394 to 390 against Carlon.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.317" offset="2086877">As I have said, however, and as the jury found, this was by no means the last step.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.376" offset="2115089">The jury said in its finding,</text>
            <text syncTime="498.172" offset="2126269">"This vote did not effectively determine that ENMT would not be in the Code. "</text>
            <text syncTime="504.779" offset="2152705">It said that vote was a substantial factor, but that Carlon had, and I am quoting another finding,</text>
            <text syncTime="511.916" offset="2181231">"a full and effective appeal from the vote of the membership and that the vote and Allied's, the petitioner's behavior had not, had not deprived Carlon of full and effective access to the NFPA. "</text>

            <text syncTime="544.278" offset="2310694">Carlon took its appeal to the Standards Council and to the Board of Directors, where it was defeated on those appeals and the record shows there is plenary authority to consider whatever the appellant wishes to present, including even new evidence, and then Carlon sought as the last step in this process a tentative interim amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.438" offset="2427305">It was defeated at every stage, and the most interesting in some respects was the last stage, because in the denial of the tentative interim amendment, the TIA, the directors made clear that one of the serious considerations leading to that denial at that time was their still unresolved doubts about safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.428" offset="2539318">Thereafter, as the briefs show, and nobody disagrees on this, in 1984 Carlon's product was allowed into the Code but with a limitation to three-story buildings, again reflecting three years later the still lingering concerns about safety in the event of fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.104" offset="2649972">However, going back to October, 1981, Carlon, as a result of that rejection of its article, brought this lawsuit against Allied and the NFPA, later dropped the NFPA, pursued the case against Carlon.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.190" offset="2730325">The gist of the lawsuit as we think is perfectly clear is stated in the language of the complaint quoted at Pages 13 and 14 of the joint appendix that this suit was brought, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="665.637" offset="2796153">"because of the adoption and application of the NEC by states and municipalities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="674.415" offset="2831262">and I end the quote there, without their Article 331 by all these states and municipalities, they lost a tremendous lot of sales, which is not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.532" offset="2911719">Our client asserted the Noerr, Pennington doctrine as a defense, and I will try to abbreviate.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.701" offset="2940349">The judge, the trial judge reserved on that, let the case go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.028" offset="2961665">There was a verdict for Carlon including the quaint finding by the jury that Allied, our client, had subverted the NFPA process.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.085" offset="3013910">After that verdict and then a second portion of the trial... I should have said it was a bifurcated trial, liability first, then damages... there was a verdict for $3.8 million, trebled plus, of course, attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.124" offset="3090083">The trial judge set that verdict aside, holding that the Noerr, Pennington defense was after all a valid defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.244" offset="3130625">On Carlon's appeal the circuit unanimously reversed and held that Noerr, Pennington does not apply, and that is what brings us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.365" offset="3183079">We think that the Court of Appeals by the time it got to this legal aspect of the case lost sight of the facts it had so carefully stated and utterly, with all deference, utterly misconceived what Noerr, Pennington... what the Noerr decision itself was about, what its facts were, and what it held.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.885" offset="3289136">The Court will recall that the Noerr decision, which had its 27th anniversary last Saturday, related to what the Court, all three courts describe as a vicious, corrupt, and fraudulent publicity campaign addressed to the general public by a railroad association in an effort to poison public opinion against the trucking industry and thereby as the hoped for next step to achieve legislation hostile to truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.276" offset="3442736">The Court said that the campaign by the railroads included conduct that Justice Black described for a unanimous bench as reprehensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.598" offset="3503967">The so-called third party technique of representing opinions and expressions coming actually from the railroads were the emanations of citizens and civic associations.</text>

            <text syncTime="907.087" offset="3761953">--Well, I would say, to try my best to report Justicue Black's opinion accurately, that after saying that this is not Sherman Act conduct, he went on to say in that many words that if we were to rule otherwise, we would run into serious concerns under the First Amendment because we would be cutting into or we might be cutting into the right of association and the right through association to petition the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.589" offset="3887967">But I think scholars have agreed, and I think it is fair to say that it was only two cases later in the California Trucking Case that this Court came down and explicitly said that one leg of the Noerr, Pennington doctrine is indeed the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.300" offset="3970828">I have concentrated on the Court's principle as I understand them initially on the Sherman Act, because I think Noerr did concentrate that way, and what Justice Black said is, whatever else you say about this conduct, which, by the way, is illegal conduct, as the Third Circuit had held, whatever else you say about it, this isn't what the Sherman Act was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.166" offset="4066227">It is not a case of people giving up their trade freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.852" offset="4080960">It is not a case of price fixing or boycotts or market divisions or any other kind of market behavior about which Senator Sherman and his friends were thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.784" offset="4124741">It is an attempt to influence public opinion with the goal of getting legislation, and that is not Sherman Act conduct even before you reach the First Amendment, and then, of course, the Justice and this Court unanimously did reach the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.869" offset="4205094">Now, in the opinion for the Second Circuit of Judge Lumbar, they ran a series of distinctions of Noerr, and again with great respect it is our submission that every one of them is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.582" offset="4275938">They say, first, that Noerr's holding, in the language of the circuit, depended upon the unique nature of petitions directed to the government in our political system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.077" offset="4333930">Well, that is a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.731" offset="4340513">There were no petitions directed to the government at all in the Noerr case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.682" offset="4364336">The Noerr case, as Justice Black wrote over and over again, was about this campaign of publicity addressed to the general public with the hope or anticipation that the public in turn would have an impact on the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.299" offset="4446779">Now, that was indirect.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fredric W. Yerman</label>
            <text syncTime="1711.168" offset="6978253">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, let me begin by turning directly to Noerr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.804" offset="7032797">As we have all heard, Justice Black focused in that case on what he described as the right of the people to inform their representatives in government of their desires with respect to the passage or enforcement of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.191" offset="7086400">With that in mind, the Court held that the railroad publicity campaign in that case, despite being deceiptful and underhanded, did not violate the antitrust laws because, in the words of Noerr, a publicity campaign to influence governmental action falls clearly within the category of political activity to which the Sherman Act does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.384" offset="7171141">Congress, the Court concluded, had not intended the Sherman Act for application in the political arena, and those are the key words, "the political arena", because none of that has anything to do with the conspiracy hatched by Allied within the confines of the National Fire Protection Assoication, a totally private body, a private standard-making group accountable to no one, and in the words of this Court a group rife with opportunities for anticompetitive behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.980" offset="7301545">What happened here was nothing like what happened in Noerr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.323" offset="7314919">There the railroad's publicity campaign was aimed at getting at legislation to injure the truckers, and it was obviously a public campaign in the political arena aimed at the body politic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.162" offset="7362253">And if all Allied and its cohorts had done in this case was to engage in a publicity campaign against Carlon and its product, none of us would be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.548" offset="7403840">But Allied did much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.282" offset="7414707">First, they conspired with their competitors to exclude Carlon's product from the National Electrical Code, a private industry code that is a conceded fact, that conspiracy to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.214" offset="7466429">And as the Court below found, that conspiracy caused independent marketplace injury to Carlon wholly independent of any injury caused by being excluded by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.379" offset="7535079">In other words, in all of those jurisdictions where Carlon could otherwise have sold its product notwithstanding any state action, Carlon suffered independent marketplace injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.015" offset="7577607">The record is abundantly clear that the trial court charged the jury that that was what the evidence was limited to, and if we want, a little bit later I will get to that specific evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.307" offset="7614805">Now, Allied argues that what it did so long as its actions were ultimately in pursuit of legislation is somehow sheltered by Noerr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.834" offset="7660885">In effect, Allied seeks to duck under the Noerr umbrella by claiming that its conduct, an anti-trust violation committed within the National Fire Protection Association which standing alone caused injury to Carlon was ultimately aimed at getting some states to enact this Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.576" offset="7903928">Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.449" offset="7911347">Allied's argument cannot hold water because violations of the anti-trust laws cannot fall by the wayside merely because conspirators claim that their violations were in pursuit of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.367" offset="7967040">Even if that claim were true, for example, the conspirators in the Fashion Originators case would not have been exonerated if they had proven that they engaged in their group boycott in order to spur legislation banning the sale of pirated dress designs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.188" offset="8030361">Such a violation stands alone, was a violation, and that was a violation of the anti-trust laws, notwithstanding that maybe they did it in order to inspire Congress to pass the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.542" offset="8075814">There have been District Court cases in the same area, as Your Honors may recall, the Pennylvania Service Station Dealers who all boycotted the sale of gasoline for a period of time in order to spur the government to increase price support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.349" offset="8130985">That was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.661" offset="8136209">Not every antecedent, anti-trust violation on the weight of the legislature is sheltered ny Noerr, and it never has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.190" offset="8166407">Put simply, a private restraint does not come under Noerr merely because there is some hope or expectation of governmental endorsement, not as here in particular where we have an antecedent, completed anti-trust violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.401" offset="8231190">Conspiracy, injury, damage all caused outside the political arena having nothing to do with the state action, but because we were excluded from a private industry Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.615" offset="8276016">Allied may have hoped that by excluding us from the NEC it might in fact bar us from states that would adopt that into law, but that doesn't excuse them from the damage we suffered in all those other places where the law was never passed, and we are talking, incidentally, about roughly half the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.202" offset="8350413">It is really kind of ironic when you think about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.514" offset="8367654">In Hydrolevel there was a misinterpretation of a Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.949" offset="8389388">Not a word was mentioned of Noerr.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.884" offset="8397120">In Hydrolevel the Code, according to this Court, was adopted in whole by 46 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.632" offset="8420108">In fact, this Court made a point of saying the thing that made that anti-trust violation in Hydrolevel so terrible, so pernicious was because of the governmental adoption, the importance and influence of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.673" offset="8476323">What this all comes down to is that the hold that Noerr applies here would be to conclude that the Congress that enacted the Sherman Act, because I agree with Mr. Frankel that in fact Noerr itself... Justice Black was initially grounding it on a matter of statutory interpretation of the Sherman Act, would be to conclude that when Senator Sherman introduced the Sherman Act he intended to insulate from all anti-trust scrutiny all concerted activity in a private standard-making context in effect to license the blatant anticompetitive conspiracy found in this case, and I submit that that simply defies logic and reason, especially in light of the legion of anti-trust cases which have held over the years that private standard-making conspiracies are in fact subject to the rule of reason at least.</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.239" offset="9690599">Sure it has some rules, but there was a loophole and they drove a truck through the loophole and thereby subverted the procedures and produced a result that otherwise would not have been producible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.265" offset="9730619">Now, they came in and they argued, just like they are talking here, this was everyday stuff, it goes on all the time, there was a history of this at the NPFA and nobody considered it wrong, nobody thought there was anything improper about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.386" offset="9779102">They argued all of that to the jury, and the judge told the jury to consider all that, in a rule of reason context consider whether this was all correct or proper, and the jury rejected it out of hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.143" offset="10170207">What happened here was, there was a rule of reason analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.406" offset="10187239">You start out with the fundamentals of private standard-making.</text>

            <text syncTime="2519.810" offset="10212839">They are a bunch of competitors who sit around deciding which of their competitor's products will be allowed in and which are going to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.730" offset="10236558">The law over the years has evolved under the rule of reason to permit private standard-making because the dissemination of information, in a nutshell, the dissemination of information, the promulgation of meritorious standards is thought to be pro-competitive, and it is that pro-competitive benefit that outweighs the anti-competitive side of having some products excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.348" offset="10315030">This is all rather run of the mill.</text>

            <text syncTime="2614.460" offset="10591406">As Justice Stevens described it, that type of philosophy would be a frontal assault on the Sherman Act, and that is totally rejected, whether they thought it was safe or unsafe does not license them to subvert the standard and come up with a non-meritorious standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.479" offset="11479465">When the plaintiff argued below that the verdicts were inconsistent, something not before you today, the judge held that it is not inconsistent, the fact that there was a finding of subversion even though there was a finding that the rules weren't violated or there wasn't effective appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.580" offset="11551876">He said, that is not consistent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.126" offset="11562116">You argued to the jury there was no violation of the rules and the jury found that, but I told the jury they were entitled to consider on a rule of reason analysis whether or not even though you technically complied with the rules whether you subverted the spirit of the rules as well as their letter, so that finding is totally not consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.745" offset="11628571">Indeed, that is precisely the answer we contemplated when we put it to the jury, and he goes on that way, to point out that he found there was nothing inconsistent, and I would point out, of course, that at this level it is hardly the time to start looking into inconsistencies, especially where the rule is very clear that if the verdicts can be read in any way to be consistent, then the verdict is to be sustained, and I think the trial court and the court of appeals both have reviewed that issue, and both have found the jury's verdicts were consistent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3337.666" offset="13484310">Don't I have a right to know that when I make an argument, when I make a debate, when I give information, that when the vote comes in people are going to vote on the merits and the vote will reflect the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.223" offset="13530495">In this case, my Noerr rights disappear because everything I said didn't matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3360.110" offset="13574067">If for any reason, and I of course respectfully argue that it ought not to be, you were inclined to apply Noerr in this situation, then I would urge you to look closely at the sham ruling in the Sessions decision, which is also before you on a cert petition now in the Ninth Circuit on similar facts, although different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.040" offset="13649718">Sessions, all the people that were voters were government officials, and there was no injury other than injury from the state, and both of those are very important distinctions from us in Sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.582" offset="13687961">I am not rearguing Sessions, but what the Sessions court said was, we think, and they analyzed this out to say Noerr should apply, but they said, nevertheless, looking at the Second Circuit, we disagree with their Noerr reasoning, but clearly what happened in the Second Circuit would be a sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.717" offset="13748460">And I would say to you, this, too, should be a sham even if Noerr applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.560" offset="13763820">What greater sham is there than after you have had all the Noerr protected speech, to in effect block us, take us out of the whole tribunal, take us out of this legislature, bring in 220 new legislators, and let them vote us down?</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.271" offset="13830694">If you are going to analogize this situation to a legislative situation, the NFPA is somehow thought of like a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.050" offset="13857757">You can say anything, you can give information, you can give wrong information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.204" offset="13874371">Maybe even you can lie, but what you can't do when all is said and done when that is finished is truck in 220 new legislators who are on your payroll and get them to vote it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.435" offset="13911360">Where does that leave the Noerr protected speech?</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.153" offset="13922227">What is the sense of having Noerr if the speech doesn't matter?</text>
