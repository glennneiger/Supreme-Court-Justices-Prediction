            <text syncTime="26.115" offset="236639">The issue before the Court in this case is the proper scope of application of the per se exclusionary rule of Edwards v. Arizona, namely, that the police may not initiate further interrogation of an arrestee who has stated a desire to speak with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.093" offset="308528">More specifically, should, as has been done in some Arizona State cases, the scope of application of Edwards be extended to reach beyond its facts to situations where there is more than one investigation going on, or kept basically as the facts of Edwards were with a single investigation where there were renewed attempts to interrogate on that same investigation, or possibly should Edwards itself be reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.166" offset="440917">Now, the facts which bring this case before the Court at this time are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.385" offset="461710">On April 6, 1985, Rona Roberson was arrested in the course of a burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.106" offset="484594">The arresting officer, Perez, gave him his Miranda warnings, and said that he wanted a lawyer before answering any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.930" offset="531927">However, moments later when Roberson was approached by another officer who was unaware of this indication of rights, who asked whether he'd be willing to make a statement he indicated that he would, and as a result of this, he was thereafter questioned several different times by a number of different officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.646" offset="4042785">Since, as was indicated in Moran v. Burbine admissions are in fact favored by the law, it says there that they are more than merely desirable but essential to society's compelling interest in finding convicting and punishing those who violate the law, then there needs to be a weight against that interest what exactly is going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.310" offset="4129407">To exclude a properly warned totally voluntary statement which comes out of the separate investigation simply is not a reasonable drawing or weighing of those competing interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.454" offset="4398050">It's not uncommon for a suspect to be implicated in two or more crimes that are being separately investigated by different law enforcement officers or even entirely different law enforcement agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.410" offset="4441831">And I'd therefore like to use an example to help illustrate our position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.964" offset="4460012">The Tucson, Arizona police arrest a suspect for the hold-up of a package store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.551" offset="4486448">At the same time, the FBI may have reason to believe that this person has been involved in an unrelated armed bank robbery, a crime occurring at a different time and in a different location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.175" offset="4532946">If the suspect invokes his right to silence, then under Mosley, the FBI would be able to approach the suspect to see if he is willing to talk with them about the bank robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.566" offset="4578504">If the suspect invokes his right to counsel, but later released, then the FBI can approach the suspect about the armed bank robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.672" offset="4614866">Now, it's our position that the FBI should not be forbidden from approaching the suspect to ask him if he wants to talk about the bank robberies simply because the suspect has invoked his right to counsel, and even though the suspect has not yet been released from police custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.133" offset="4684770">That submission, to believe, is consistent with the Edwards case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.852" offset="4703578">Edwards was concerned with the potential for badgering when the police are allowed repeatedly to interrogate a suspect who has asked for a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.410" offset="4745792">When there are truly independent investigations that are underway, that risk we believe is far less likely to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.599" offset="4778602">That's true whether you look at the problem from the suspect's point of view or from the police point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.903" offset="4803784">First, when the officers approach the suspect, if they make clear at the outset either before or after giving Miranda warnings, that they are interested in an entirely different matter, the suspect is not likely to believe that his request for counsel has been fictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.947" offset="4875986">He's likely to believe instead that he can control what is out of bounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.249" offset="6633191">independent of is the episode that led to the suspect's arrest crime he's being questioned about the second time is a in those circumstances that it decides what it would be appropriate is to see whether or not the police knew at the time they made the first arrest that he had committed several different crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.338" offset="6777596">That's a more difficult case than will happen in most.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.790" offset="6795359">We think in most cases, it will be fairly easy to tell that the second investigation concerns a matter that's entirely separate from the first, I mean, that for example occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.563" offset="6830468">The two burglaries occurred on different days and at different locations in the City of Tucson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.816" offset="6855441">It's clear that these investigations were entirely separate even though there was one officer common to both.</text>

            <text syncTime="1709.153" offset="6968812">He was arrested at the scene of a crime, and he was given his Miranda rights and it's important to focus on the rights that he was read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.841" offset="7003607">He was told that he had the right to consult with an attorney before answering any questions, and he was also told that he had the right to have the attorney present when he was asked any further questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.982" offset="7056166">He replied, the record reflects, I understand and I want a lawyer before I answer any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.922" offset="7083856">Moments later, still at the scene of the crime, he was questioned again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.224" offset="7105067">At that point, he waived his rights in crime one and made inculpatory statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.944" offset="7127950">Clearly, that was in violation of his Miranda rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.490" offset="7302135">One mistake, certainly that would be negligence, but he was questioned again and again, and I've certainly argued that we are going to put a premium on ignorance if we adopt the rule as set for at least in part in the petitioner's brief, and in this case, I think we have seen that all the police officers basically stayed ignorant, and in spite of the clear law that suggests that they should have told each other that this man only wanted to speak through counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2421.064" offset="9816473">We have all State police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.332" offset="9825563">Unlike the Michigan Mosley case where the original Mirandas had to do with robberies that occurred and that the subsequent investigation was about murder in Michigan v.

            <text syncTime="2445.462" offset="9914066">He was continually questioned about a series of robberies or of burglaries that took place over a short period of time, often times by common actors in the two separate investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.887" offset="9963699">I don't think he perceived enough separateness to make this case the distinguishing case that the Solicitor General has argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.360" offset="10005599">This Court in Michigan v. Mosley found that Miranda needed some explaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.764" offset="10031304">The reason for that is that it found that the language about silence could be interpreted too broadly, could be interpreted to mean that if a defendant says he wants to be silent, he could be silent forever through the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.489" offset="10078115">That's bad, the Court said in Michigan v. Mosley for two reasons; it deprives the defendant himself of the right to inquire to find out facts about his own case; and it thwarts police investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.432" offset="10141958">If we can't talk to the person at all because he's requested his right to remain silent, we have no way of finding further information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.604" offset="10170589">Neither of these principles apply when you request the right for an attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="2660.331" offset="10773495">I think the Edwards rule is, one has to speculate and think very hard to come up with a situation where a defendant is denied his right to counsel before answering any questions, and there was not actual coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.941" offset="10835980">If this Court allows the Edwards rule to be limited as set forth by the State, then they are going to allow the defendant to be not implicitly lied to perhaps that's too strong of a word, but basically given a falsehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.152" offset="10896793">We are going to allow the defendant to be told that he has a right to a lawyer before answering any questions, and in spite of that warning, we are going to allow him to be continued to be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.192" offset="10940992">This tells the defendant that whatever that rule was, whatever that right was, it's not a very valuable one in my position of sitting here in the jail cell without any input from anybody waiting for that lawyer, the only thing I can find out is that there's more trouble with me, that leads to coercion I think in almost every instance, that this is not a rule that is widely around the Fifth Amendment but a prophylactic rule that is very tightly concealed to just the protection that is needed for the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.652" offset="12562778">He was talking about his drug contacts, about people who were involved in other burglaries and robberies, and that is the sole reason that the other officers were going back on these other occasions to question him, was to find out about material that he was volunteering, not to badger him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.930" offset="12631950">He could not have invoked his rights to a crime which even the police effectively did not know was under investigation at that stage.</text>
