            <text syncTime="1555.534" offset="6353363">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether Federal law permits petitioners to rely on unrecorded oral understanding to defeat their straightforward written obligation to repay to the FDIC more than $450,000 in borrowed money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.434" offset="6457017">That question has two parts because there are two sources of Federal law, Section 1823(e) and Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.021" offset="6487319">Our primary position is that Section 1823(e) requires petitioners to live up to their written obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.277" offset="6520338">Our secondary position is that Federal common law requires the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.515" offset="6537369">There are two central reasons for both of our positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.717" offset="6554088">First, it is necessary to the successful functioning of the Federal Deposit Insurance system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.887" offset="6578852">Thus longstanding Federal policy and the basic functioning of that system as Congress intended require that the FDIC be entitled to rely on the bank's written documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.778" offset="6626395">Second, it is fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.713" offset="6634127">With regard to who should bear the burden of the $450,000 at issue here, this case presents a choice between petitioners on the one hand who borrowed the money, the FDIC insurance fund, and possibly other creditors on the other hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2558.416" offset="10364935">There may be some situations, for example, where a failed bank has played the lead role, and a loan participation has been arranged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.223" offset="10408194">In many situations the participating bank has some kind of informal understanding that if the borrower defaults, then the loan participation comes to an end and the lead bank has to take it back.</text>

            <text syncTime="2602.964" offset="10543090">We think that that, too, would be a situation that would be covered by D'Oench, because the bank, the participant bank would have lent themselves to a transaction that was likely to mislead bank examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.104" offset="10595649">But on the whole, in our view Section 1823(e) as to the FDIC in its corporate capacity does in fact cover what D'Oench covers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.079" offset="10639534">Now, the role that this statute plays if read as entitling the FDIC to rely on bank records as a holder in due course would, comes into play first of all in... with respect to the FDIC's role with open banks, and that role is chiefly to ensure that those banking institutions don't in the end threaten the solvency of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.348" offset="10760638">Congress has given the FDIC extensive powers to examine banks, and what is critical is that in those examinations the FDIC examiners be able to rely on the books and records of the banks as they appear and not have to be interviewing people outside the bank, investigating the particular law, of Louisiana in this case, and making its own assessment not about the practical collectibility of particular assets, but about their legal enforceability if on their face they appear to be fully valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.521" offset="10901386">The second place in the system that this ability to rely on bank records is critical is when a bank fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.977" offset="10939211">When a bank, an insured institution, fails, the FDIC has several options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.381" offset="10960736">It has long been recognized that the preferred option is not to close the bank and pay off depositors, but to try to keep the bank open, and that is done through a purchase and assumption transaction, whereby another bank, usually in the community, takes over the failed institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.759" offset="11038267">That is preferable for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.028" offset="11047358">For one, all depositors are fully paid, not simply up to the $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.181" offset="11067942">It keeps the bank open and avoids disruption of the banking services in the community, and it preserves the going concern value of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.787" offset="11102424">An assuming bank is typically willing to pay some substantial amount of money to get new branches.</text>

            <text syncTime="2753.243" offset="11144220">Even recently, this summer, since the briefing in this case was completed, Congress added yet a new method by which the FDIC can keep a bank open, create the possibility of a temporary bridge bank in Title 5 of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.656" offset="11221856">What is critical is that although that option is preferred under the statute, it may be exercised only if it is less costly than the principal alternative, simply closing the bank and liquidating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.899" offset="11278803">And the ability to rely on the written assets of the bank is critical in three respects at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.069" offset="11311508">First of all, of course, it increases the value of those assets and makes the preferred option more likely to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.557" offset="11337526">Second of all, the determination of which option may be taken, that is, the assessment of which option is more or less costly, must be made very quickly, and that means that simply as a matter of ensuring the accuracy of the determination the FDIC should be able to rely on the bank's records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.386" offset="11416834">And finally, when the bank fails, the question is not whether a loss is going to be avoided entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.226" offset="11448181">The question is who will bear the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.594" offset="11457585">Now, it is possible that in this case Mr. Caughfield or the other bank official involved can successfully be sued, and petitioners will not have to bear this loss, but as between petitioners and the FDIC, it seems to us quite clear who should bear that loss, because petitioners had an opportunity to protect themselves by insisting that these terms be placed in writing, and the FDIC, of course, did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.363" offset="11576703">The FDIC came in after the transaction was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.149" offset="11587884">Here, in addition, it should be noted that unlike in the D'Oench case, all we are talking about is whether petitioners must repay money that wasn't theirs to begin with, that was borrowed from the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.957" offset="11639084">In the D'Oench case this Court precluded a defense by the maker of an accommodation note and required that person to pay money that was his to begin with, that he had not borrowed, so we think fairness considerations as well as requirements of the FDIC system require the same results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.024" offset="11743365">Let me say a word finally about the common law issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.361" offset="11772726">As I have mentioned--</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.649" offset="11901876">The only requirement for deciding that the notemaker as opposed to the FDIC fund should bear the loss is that the notemaker lent themselves to a transaction that would tend to deceive bank examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.492" offset="11965196">If those are enough, then an actual knowledge requirement is simply irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.447" offset="11993095">Briefly, on the common law issue, our first point, as we suggested in our brief, is that 1823(e) cannot be read as a preemption of common law, of common law making power of the federal courts in these kinds of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.630" offset="12089748">Well, I think some of this Court's cases have spoken about it as preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.665" offset="12109915">It is not preemption in the same sense as federal preemption of state law, but what we have here is a general jurisdictional grant by Congress and Section 1819 4th says that any case involving the FDIC arises under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.197" offset="12200089">There is no suggestion in the legislative history, we think, or in the statute itself that what Congress was doing here was like what it was doing in the principal cases relied on by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.005" offset="12251289">Congress did not, as I have suggested, survey the entire realm of possible defenses and make a considered judgment that these and only these defenses were to be precluded, and all other defenses available under state law were to be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.050" offset="12315446">And we think that once the issue of preemption is out of the way and that it is acknowledged that if 1823(e) does not itself cover the facts here, that the common law making powers of this Court should lead the Court to reach the same result that the Fifth Circuit reached on statutory grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.034" offset="12423384">Under the Kimbell Foods analysis, all three factors, we think, lead to the result, first, there is a need for uniformity in the federal rule because there is a single nationwide deposit insurance fund that is threatened every time there is a half a million dollar loss threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.710" offset="12490049">Second, federal policies, as I have tried to explain them and as they are reflected in 1823(e), would be frustrated by disabling the FDIC from relying on bank records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.969" offset="12543129">And finally, we don't think that there would be a serious interference with private practices based on state law, and the principal reason for that is that when an individual deals with a bank the norm is that obligations, promises and representations be placed in writing.</text>
