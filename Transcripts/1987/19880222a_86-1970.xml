            <text syncTime="10.358" offset="175582">Michael C. Moore, Et Al.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.079" offset="182478">Mr. Lee, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="13.841" offset="189479">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.772" offset="205257">The sole issue in this case was squarely decided two terms ago by this Court's unanimous holding in Nantahala v. Thornburgh that the Federal Power Act requires state and local regulators, when they set retail electric rates, to include within those rates wholesale power supply costs which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has determined to be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.753" offset="321136">The Court left open the possibility of one narrow exception which was inapplicable in Nantahala and, for reasons that I will explain in just a moment, is clearly inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.461" offset="363977">At the center of the dispute is a nuclear power plant, Grand Gulf I, which is owned by an integrated electric system, Middle South Utilities, whose four wholly-owned public utilities serve parts of four separate states.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.700" offset="428970">FERC found that the Grand Gulf plant was constructed to meet the needs of the system as a whole, including the diversification of its fuel sources, which, until the mid-1970s, were limited to oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.413" offset="495843">Because of circumstances unforeseen at the time Grand Gulf was originally planned, its fixed costs, and therefore its total costs, were among the highest on the Middle South system, even though its operating expenses are the lowest.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.512" offset="556238">For this reason, this case presents a circumstance that is very common throughout the country today and indeed, is inevitable in any integrated interstate electric system.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.721" offset="601064">In an effort to diversify its fuel sources and to provide for the long-range needs of its customers, any integrated system is going to end up with several different generation sources and the costs of some are going to be substantially higher than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.784" offset="673267">Moreover, the source that is the most expensive today will not necessarily be the most expensive a few years from now, depending on such variables as the world price of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.731" offset="717048">Each of the states served by such a system would, of course, like to have for itself and its customers as much of the system's low-cost power and as little of its high-cost power as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.180" offset="782877">Someone has to decide who gets how much of each.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.025" offset="802207">Fortunately, the Federal Power Act entitles the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to allocate these widely differing costs among the companies and the states involved; and FERC's authority to make those allegations is not at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.388" offset="875664">For the purpose of this case, it is a given.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.232" offset="923102">As I understand it, the Federal Power Act does not grant FERC any jurisdiction over generating facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.959" offset="1138037">Does that mean that then the State of Mississippi has to accept and allow that quantity of power to be sold in the state at those FERC-approved rates?</text>

            <text syncTime="269.280" offset="1211285">The division of authority is between the initial authorization to construct the plant, as you have correctly stated, and the authorization to set the wholesale rates for the power that comes from that plant once it is constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.471" offset="1271993">And Mississippi can say no, and that means that it won't be built in Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.478" offset="1484108">It is somewhat persuasive that FERC itself believes that it decided the prudence issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.072" offset="1502393">But the more important point is that, regardless of whether it was done or not, the only entity that has the authority under the Federal Power Act to deal with those contracts affecting wholesale rates is FERC itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.083" offset="1566446">So that if prudence is going to be decided, it must be decided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and not on a state to state basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.026" offset="1646276">The one is, that is exactly what happened in Nantahala.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.827" offset="1661427">You had there not an integrated system of the type that we have here, but you did have two wholly-owned subsidiaries of a single company... Alcoa... and they had two different sources... one lower cost and one higher cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.348" offset="1723494">And the question was whether FERC's allocation of, in that case the lower cost power, was binding on the North Carolina Utilities Commission at the time that it set the retail rates for that commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.506" offset="1780127">And this Court held that the power to set retail rates necessarily meant the power to make these allocations.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="418.992" offset="1810116">It isn't the allocation that is the source of the controversy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.895" offset="1829760">As I understand it, the state was willing to accept that if this was a prudent investment, we are stuck with 33 percent of it, or whatever the figure is.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.112" offset="1870615">You can acknowledge the FERC is entitled to allocate without acknowledging that FERC is entitled to decide whether the investment was prudent to begin with, can't you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="445.389" stopTime="544.567">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="445.389" offset="1915755">That brings us to the core legal question that is raised by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.083" offset="1934459">And that is whether there prudency determinations can be made by the states on a case-to-case basis in the wake of a determination of an allocation by FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.982" offset="1982106">We submit, number one, that that issue was determined by Nantahala, which did involve an allocation case, and number two, that any other scheme permitting these allocations to be redone by the states in the wake of an allocation that has already been done by FERC would simply nullify the FERC allocations that have already been made and make a shambles of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's function.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.291" offset="2103314">And that is particularly true in an integrated system such as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.776" offset="2129228">The prudence issue is relevant only in those instances where a utility has a choice to make, and then chooses the more expensive alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.496" offset="2180114">But it is irrelevant to FERC allocations of system capacity among the operating subsidiaries of a public utility holding company, for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.149" offset="2218775">Mississippi Power &amp; Light really has no alternative to Grand Gulf power, because Mississippi Power &amp; Light is part of the Middle South system which planned and built Grand Gulf to meet system needs as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.251" offset="2283141">The question is how that system's capacity, including Grand Gulf, is to be allocated among the operating companies.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="544.567" offset="2312398">The thing that is so basically troublesome, though, is that under your view, admittedly the Federal Power Act does not let FERC decide in the first instance to review generating facilities if a new one is going to be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.027" offset="2378227">FERC doesn't review that.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.376" offset="2383660">It is left to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.698" offset="2388989">And yet, even if the states refuse to permit it to be built, you say that a subsequent FERC determination about rates precludes any review by the state as to the prudence of a new facility when FERC itself doesn't review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.341" offset="2463491">That just means nobody does.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.352" offset="2471536">It doesn't mean nobody does.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.185" offset="2478851">It means that if it is to be done, then the procedures which are provided by the Federal Power Act which permit anyone, including states, to participate and indeed to initiate those proceedings, must do so before FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.905" offset="2541753">Take the steps, Justice O'Connor, one at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.127" offset="2554710">The first is the authorization of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.799" offset="2565368">And that one is vested in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.651" offset="2576757">The second step, then, is the determination of just and reasonable wholesale rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.833" offset="2601522">And Nantahala clearly held that the allocation of sources among wholly-owned subsidiaries is included within the setting of retail rates... excuse me, of wholesale rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.614" offset="2656588">Now, once that allocation has been made, if the individual states can then come along in the wake of that determination and make their own allocation, then each state will necessarily favor its own parochial interests and the careful plan of the Federal Power Act to vest those wholesale rate determinations in one disinterested tribunal, the only tribunal that does not have a constituency to serve will have been frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.246" offset="2791171">And indeed, the very argument that Mississippi makes in this case shows why it is that prudence determinations, that the prudence issue simply is not an issue at all for anyone, either state or Federal, in a case like this which involves an integrated interstate system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.487" offset="6120111">Talking about a decision in 19551 to create this system, a decision which I believe Mississippi would have had to approve the participation of its utility in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.217" offset="6179043">But its utility joined in a petition to the SEC to form a holding company system and that system was approved by the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.604" offset="6220526">In 1951 it filed a first system agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.478" offset="6240065">The plants that are run by all four of the utilities on the system have been physically interconnected ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.245" offset="6283115">All of the sources of electrical capacity and power available to MP&amp;L have been subject, with the result of systemwide planning, and have been subject to systemwide contracts, setting forth the terms on which their capacity and their energy are available to the four utilities ever since 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.530" offset="6372245">FERC had all of the present versions of those arrangements before it for review in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.965" offset="6405995">FERC had express power under Section 206 to determine, as it did, that the agreements were unjust and to set just and reasonable terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.902" offset="6445806">Mississippi did what it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.782" offset="6453329">It argued to FERC that Grand Gulf should be treated as added to the existing sources of power in such a way that each company would first get credit for its older, cheaper sources of power, and the companies that are then short, the companies that say we don't need this power because we've got plenty, should pay for Grand Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.329" offset="6551445">FERC explicitly concluded that that would be unjust and instead that the way that the system operated, the fact that the nuclear capacity supplies the baseload and was invested in on that basis, made it appropriate for the four companies first to share the nuclear capacity in proportions specified by FERC and that the companies that are then long after they have bought their share of the nuclear power, should sell the older, cheaper power to the other companies in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.727" offset="6713091">As I've said, all of the parties to this case, the Mississippi parties participated in those proceedings before FERC, they also participated in the review by the D.C. Circuit in which that Court squarely upheld the power of FERC to impose a third of the costs of Grand Gulf I on Mississippi... or 33 percent... on Mississippi Power and Light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.336" offset="6835448">We think that the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision is trying to subject MP&amp;L to a state prudence review of costs that FERC has properly ordered it to bear, and that under Nantahala, the Mississippi Public Service Commission was required to do just what it did, which is to accept that FERC-imposed cost as reasonable and to give it effect in setting retail rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.210" offset="8106984">This is based on the fact that when MP&amp;L decided to construct this unit, it made representations to the Mississippi Public Service Commission in order to get its license, and it did so, in acknowledging the jurisdiction of Mississippi to grant or reject that license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.155" offset="8202802">It said, for example, that the cost of this two-unit plant was going to be $1.4 billion when completed, and the first unit would be completed in 1979 and the second in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.292" offset="8243344">It also represented that the specific methodology that would be used to allocate both the costs and the electricity to the customers was that which was going to be put in place before the FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.154" offset="8310740">It also made representations that the retail rate payers at that time in Mississippi really had no need for the electricity to be produced by Grand Gulf but it would be valuable in the future and it would accrue to the benefit of the rate payers of Mississippi to support the construction of this plant, but they wouldn't have to pay for it until they needed it and they wouldn't have to take the power until they needed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.342" offset="8423484">MP&amp;L continued to serve as construction manager, supervising all phases of the design and construction of the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.556" offset="8456398">We now know that the cost of that facility skyrocketed to some 400 percent of the original estimations so that the completion of Unit I alone was some $3.6 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.567" offset="8512405">The demand for electricity began to decline during this period shortly after construction began, and the cost escalated, so that MP&amp;L and its sister subsidiaries came together and arrived at a different methodology.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.413" offset="8727758">In 1983, it reviewed that situation and found that the representations had been made and entered an order making a finding that the changes had taken place without any permission being given by the Mississippi Public Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.255" offset="8795154">But it did not take any action at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.317" offset="8807380">The President of MP&amp;L represented to the Commission in 1981 that irrespective of the changes that had been made by the operating companies with regard to this agreement and the allocation of the cost and electricity from Grand Gulf, that the Public Service Commission of Mississippi still had the authority, it had the ultimate authority, when MP&amp;L decided to put these rates into the retail rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.108" offset="8926602">Of course, we've heard how the ultimate '82 agreement and the allocation agreement were submitted to the FERC for approval and after being modified Mississippi ended up with 33 percent instead of the 31.63 percent that MP&amp;L had agreed to do in this agreement subsequent to the certification of the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.163" offset="9022837">MP&amp;L then, of course, came to the Mississippi Public Commission to obtain the rates at retail to pay them for the 33 percent allocation of Grand Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.353" offset="9075605">Prudence of MP&amp;L's actions with regard to its acquisition of such a large percentage of Grand Gulf was acknowledged as an issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.321" offset="9119386">But the MPSC unilaterally carved that out and it was not addressed by the Public Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.166" offset="9150837">Matters of excess capacity, Grand Gulf, and an acquisition of some coal-generated capacity from Independence were carved out of the proceedings considering the Grand Gulf rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.117" offset="9210606">The MPSC issued its decision then, which allowed the entire 33 percent, or 100 percent of the FERC allocation, to go into effect as retail rates through a tiered phase-in plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.756" offset="9269224">When that was appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court, the issue of prudence and whether or not the state had fulfilled its regulatory responsibilities under state law, was the principal issue before the Mississippi Supreme Court, and of course, it reversed and said you just comply with state law in order to be able to adopt rates and pass them on to the customer to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.503" offset="9376117">And what the Mississippi Supreme Court did is, it sent it back to the Public Service Commission to carry forward its duties and responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.270" offset="9415197">Now, we talk about prudence, and we chase the term around, and it is a bit elusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.494" offset="9436095">But in this context, we would submit that a fair definition would be what was the quality of the managerial judgment exercised by MP&amp;L as the company with the exclusive right to provide adequate electrical service to its retail customers at a price both fair and reasonable to those customers and to give it the opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.730" offset="9533061">Prudence takes on several characterizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.023" offset="9546227">It can be the prudence of construction, which has been referred to earlier in the arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.757" offset="9565140">Whether MP&amp;L, for example, looked at the cost overruns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.128" offset="9578619">Did it examine the projections of costs during construction?</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.327" offset="13431471">We consider that the Federal Power Act was adopted to provide the regulation of interstate wholesale sales of electricity and expressly created the dual regulatory system which this Court, in a similar fashion recognized, in the recent case of Federal Communications Commission v. Louisiana Public Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.892" offset="13517675">To those that argue that this interferes with the efficiency of broad regulation, which we heard this morning, this Court has admonished that the courts should not assume a role which our system has assigned to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.511" offset="13576189">Now, MP&amp;L seeks to move these lines drawn by the Court and adopted as law by Congress under the guise of furthering the national policy of economy and efficiency in the delivery of electric service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.910" offset="13625822">But that in fact is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.701" offset="13637002">That would defeat the efficiency that now exists in the electric utility rate making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.188" offset="13666886">For example, the states would be less than interested in granting a license to a large nuclear power plant or any kind of power generating plant today if it knew tomorrow that it is not going to be able to protect its citizens and constituents which it has elected or appointed to serve, because the FERC might well come along and later change that and then send those rates right back to them as retail rate payers that they would not be able to regulate or even investigate under the Appellant's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.662" offset="13812754">This is not an isolated case which compels this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.334" offset="13831458">In fact, we've counted some 22 states that would be directly affected because they have utilities that are involved in a multi-state pooling arrangement or an integrated system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.727" offset="13897077">This is a case which will have an impact on all investor-owned utilities which engage in any such interstate pooling or joint ventures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.181" offset="13930828">The Appellant raises these questions of widespread and harmful potential on a record that is far from complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.246" offset="13963115">This Court should have the benefit of thorough development in these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.850" offset="13981505">This case should be returned to Mississippi where that can take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.005" offset="13998224">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3467.123" offset="14002612">Thank you, Mr. Maxey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.805" offset="14013375">Mr. Lee, you have two minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="3471.688" offset="14020898">First, I would like to just clarify that every single one of these prudence issues could be raised before FERC, and also, that FERC can and does reject increases in the wholesale rate base on the basis that the costs are imprudently acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.200" offset="14094981">Footnote 15 of our reply brief discusses the cases in which that happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.365" offset="14115566">FERC did not consider these issues, or said they did not consider them... we think they did... but in any event, the ALJ said that he wasn't going to consider anything that was not raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.203" offset="14166975">The crucial point is that these matters can and must be raised before FERC if they are to be raised at all, and the reason lies right at the heart of why the Federal Power Act was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.890" offset="14213682">It was enacted in order to preclude violations of the Commerce Clause that would otherwise occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.046" offset="14242312">It is very apparent that the alternatives to the use of Grand Gulf Power to which the Mississippi Attorney General refers is the use of otherwise, of the other sources within the Middle South System, oil and gas, which are cheaper, which are located right within Mississippi and which, if Grand Gulf has not used, will then be sent out of state to other parts of the Middle South system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.693" offset="14348891">That is the NEPCO case, and NEPCO squarely declares that this would be a violation of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.727" offset="14373028">And that is why we have a Federal Power Act, because we are one Nation and we need one entity that can prevent these violations of the Commerce Clause that would otherwise occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.585" offset="14416496">The fact of the matter is that FERC has made a determination that it is just and reasonable for Mississippi to bear 33 percent of the costs of Grand Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.113" offset="14458606">And what we have here is nothing less than an attempt to have the states test the prudence of the costs that FERC has ordered that Mississippi bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.683" offset="14508865">Thank you.</text>
