            <text syncTime="9.396" offset="37512">This is a capital case that comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.660" offset="70635">A petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death largely that in the sentencing hearing great emphasis was placed on the fact that he had previously been convicted of a felony in New York and that substantiated one of the aggravating circumstances to justify the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.306" offset="141166">However, after he had been sentenced, the New York conviction was reversed by the New York Court of Appeals and the question then arose as to whether the death sentence could stand when it was impart based on a factual conviction that was no longer valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.037" offset="208144">And in the unanimous judgment today, we reverse the holding of the Mississippi Supreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.327" offset="245238">Justice Brennan has filed a statement joined by Justice Marshall, concurring and Justice White has filed a statement -- a concurring statement joined by the Chief Justice, and Justice O'Connor has joined in the judgment but not in the opinion of the Court.</text>
