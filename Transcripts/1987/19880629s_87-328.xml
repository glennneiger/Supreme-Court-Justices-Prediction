            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">The second case I have to announce also comes here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.474" offset="37825">It's Riley versus the National Federation of the Blind of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.899" offset="59559">The question for decision in the case is the constitutionality of the North Carolina Charitable Solicitations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.717" offset="90802">That Act regulates professional fund raising and defines the prima facie reasonable fee that a professional fundraiser may charge according to a three-tiered schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.559" offset="154227">A fee up to 20% of receipts collected is deemed reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.607" offset="174393">A fee between 20% and 35% is deemed unreasonable upon a showing that the solicitation at issue did not involve the dissemination of information, discussion, or advocacy relating to public issues as directed by the charitable organization which is to benefit from the solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.986" offset="251925">A fee exceeding 35% is presumed unreasonable, but the fundraiser may rebut the presumption by showing that the fee was necessary either because the solicitation involved dissemination of information or advocacy on public issues directed by the charity, or because otherwise the charity's ability to raise money or communicate would be significantly diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.711" offset="342831">The Act also provides that a professional fundraiser must disclose to potential donors the average percentage of gross receipts actually turned over to charities by the fundraiser for all charitable solicitations conducted in the State within the previous 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.828" offset="415242">And finally, the Act provides that professional fundraisers may not solicit without an approved license, whereas volunteer fundraisers may solicit immediately upon submitting a licensed application.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.293" offset="469159">And appellees, a coalition of professional fundraisers, charitable organizations, and potential donors, brought the suit against the appellant government officials charged with enforcement of the Act seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.725" offset="530808">The District Court ruled that the challenged provisions on their face unconstitutionally infringed upon freedom of speech and enjoined their enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.206" offset="568738">The Court of Appeals affirmed and we in turn affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.238" offset="592875">We hold that North Carolina's three-tiered definition of reasonable fees unconstitutionally infringes upon freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.571" offset="626207">The solicitation of charitable contributions is protected speech, and using percentages to decide the legality of the fundraiser's fee is not we think narrowly tailored to the State's interest in preventing fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.815" offset="683259">And North Carolina's requirement to professional fundraisers disclose to potential donors, before an appeal for funds, percentage of charitable contributions collected during the previous 12 months that were actually turned over to charity is also unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.597" offset="754312">This provision of the Act is a content-based regulation because mandating speech that a speaker would not otherwise make necessarily alters the speech's content.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.914" offset="799556">Even assuming that the mandated speech, in the abstract, is merely commercial, it does not retain its commercial character when it is inextricably intertwined with the otherwise fully protected speech involved in charitable solicitations, and thus the mandated speech is subject to the test for fully protected expression, not the more deferential commercial speech principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.276" offset="909061">Finally, North Carolina's licensing requirement as to professional fundraisers is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.064" offset="936229">Speaker's rights are not lost merely because compensation is received, and the State's asserted power or licensed professional fundraisers carries with it, unless properly constrained the power directly and substantially to affect the speech they utter.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.932" offset="999654">Consequently, the statute is subject to First Amendment scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.651" offset="1014596">Generally, speakers need not obtain a license to speak even assuming that the State's interest in regulating those who solicit money justifies requiring fundraisers to obtain a license before soliciting.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.953" offset="1067781">Such a regulation must provide that the licensor will, within a specified brief period, either issue a license or go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.619" offset="1102472">That requirement is not met here, for the North Carolina Act permits a delay without limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.754" offset="1130998">Justice Stevens joins only parts one two and three of the Court's opinion and Justice Scalia joins all of the opinion but not Footnote 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.350" offset="1181362">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.946" offset="1199752">Justice Stevens filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.510" offset="1218038">The Chief Justice filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice O'Connor joined.</text>
