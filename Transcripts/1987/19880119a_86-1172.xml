            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="133134">We'll hear argument next in No. 86-1172, Goodyear Atomic Corporation versus Esto Miller and the Industrial Commission of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.539" offset="179214">Mr. Tait, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_tait" startTime="73.512" stopTime="188.654">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Tait</label>
            <text syncTime="73.512" offset="427168">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.500" offset="451096">From appellant's perspective, the single issue involved in this case is whether the State of Ohio may be permitted to impose its safety regulations on a nuclear production facility which is exclusively owned and controlled by the United States of America, and essential to the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.366" offset="534584">Very briefly at the time this action arose, the Goodyear Atomic Corporation, the appellant herein, operated a nuclear production and utilization facility located near Portsmouth, Ohio, under contract with the United States Department of Energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.708" offset="599890">This facility is one of only two of its type in the United States, and is the only facility in America capable of enriching uranium to the assays needed to power our nuclear ships and submarines.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.801" offset="656314">Because of the critical importance of this particular operation, Congress has mandated that the Department of Energy be the exclusive owner of all land, buildings and equipment associated with this operation, and significantly that DOE establish radiological and non-radiological safety regulations with which its contractor operators must comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.618" offset="759550">Now, as noted in the record, the operating contract under which Goodyear operated the facility in question contained a specific provision implementing that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.324" offset="802391">This particular case arises out of a simple Workers' Compensation claim involving a former Goodyear employee, the appellee, Esto Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.699" offset="843874">In 1980, Miller fell from a scaffolding and fractured his ankle.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.520" offset="867175">He was paid normal workers' compensation benefits and subsequently returned to work.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="188.654" offset="887655">I take it there's no doubt here, Mr. Tait, that the regular incidence of Ohio Unemployment Compensation law apply to the Goodyear Atomic plant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_tait" startTime="199.612" stopTime="256.365">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Tait</label>
            <text syncTime="199.612" offset="931541">There is no question, Your Honor, that in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 290, the Workers Compensation benefits, normal Workers Compensation benefits do apply to the operations of this plant and to Goodyear employees, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.872" offset="988592">And there has never been any question, nor has there ever been any dispute as far as I'm aware with respect to those type of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.193" offset="1013878">The dispute arose in this case, however, because in addition to his normal workers' compensation benefits, Miller sought to hold Goodyear liable for an additional award, allegedly based upon their violation of a specific safety requirement promulgated by the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.837" offset="1088380">Now, when he filed this application, the administrative body charged with enforcing these requirements, the Industrial Commission of Ohio, dismissed the application, recognizing their belief that it was preempted by Federal law, by the Atomic Energy Act, and by principles of Federal immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.199" offset="1157865">,--</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="256.365" stopTime="258.349">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="256.365" offset="1158492">Not a great deal involved, was there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_tait" startTime="258.349" stopTime="327.478">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Tait</label>
            <text syncTime="258.349" offset="1166434">--No, there was not a great deal involved, and in fact there has never been a great deal involved with respect to this particular claim as a monetary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.820" offset="1196318">However, through a mandamus action that was initiated on behalf of Mr. Miller both the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court reversed the administrative determination because of what they perceived to be somehow a significant distinction between radiological and non-radiological hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.818" offset="1280327">Now, what is clear from those decisions is that neither of the Ohio courts understood the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.574" offset="1311361">They first and foremost refer to this operation as a power plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.609" offset="1331527">It is not a power plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.561" offset="1339364">They completely failed to recognize the fundamental distinction between an NRC operated power plant and a DOE-owned and controlled Federal nuclear production facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.487" offset="1402998">Thirdly and most importantly, the Ohio Supreme Court in particular failed to recognize the significance of the Federal ownership of this particular facility.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="327.478" stopTime="335.115">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="327.478" offset="1443018">Well, does it make any difference that the Federal facility is being operated by a private contractor?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_tait" startTime="335.115" stopTime="377.026">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Tait</label>
            <text syncTime="335.115" offset="1473529">Your Honor, we submit that it makes no difference whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.501" offset="1487113">And we submit that this Court's decision in the case of Hancock v. Train should be dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.923" offset="1516788">Coincidentally, the Hancock decision involved the sister operation to the Portsmouth facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.993" offset="1541030">That involved Paducah, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.612" offset="1547508">Now, despite the fact that the Paducah operation does not have the same national defense and security considerations as this facility does, nevertheless, this Court in the Hancock decision reiterated the basic Constitutional doctrine that absent express Congressional authorization, such facilities are free from State regulation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="377.026" stopTime="384.132">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="377.026" offset="1641235">Was there any discussion in Hancock of how to reconcile that with Penn Dairies?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_tait" startTime="384.132" stopTime="444.254">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Tait</label>
            <text syncTime="384.132" offset="1669656">Well, Your Honor, the Penn Dairies line of cases which are raised by the appellant as a way to try to evade the Hancock immunity in this case, seems to me to involve three different areas of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.123" offset="1725558">First of all, the majority of those cases involved contractors that were providing goods and services to the Federal Government as opposed to actually involved with the day to day operation of a Federal facility, in effect, surrogate Government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.699" offset="1779893">Secondly, with the exception of the New Mexico tax cases, I'm not aware that any of those matters involved a nuclear facility or facilities that had any national defense input.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.757" offset="1824092">Thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, however, the Penn Dairies line of cases it seems to me creates a distinction between an impact upon the expense or cost of the Federal operation of the facility as opposed to the day to day conduct of that facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.719" offset="1899952">And I think that's an important distinction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="444.254" stopTime="458.013">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="444.254" offset="1910087">What if this were a third party tort action under State law not involving an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.324" offset="1938404">Is that somehow preempted in your view also?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_tait" startTime="458.013" stopTime="486.964">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Tait</label>
            <text syncTime="458.013" offset="1965154">Well, it would seem to me that the question would become the extent of the effect of the action on the operation of the facility itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.417" offset="1998799">I suppose if you have an action where an employee, for instance, is in the parking lot of the facility and somehow gets run over by a forklift operated by a Goodyear employee, then there is perhaps a question of whether or not the immunity that was established by this Court in Hancock can apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.914" offset="2072778">However, in this particular instance--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="486.963" offset="2080928">What's your answer?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_tait" startTime="488.199" stopTime="502.939">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Tait</label>
            <text syncTime="488.199" offset="2085839">--I suppose my answer, Your Honor, is that it depends on the particular circumstance how far the Federal immunity applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.119" offset="2113529">It is dependent upon the affect on the operation, on the affect of the Federal function.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.821" offset="2136412">If in fact the State law--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="502.939" stopTime="518.984">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="502.939" offset="2144876">Well, the effective of a State tort action is generally in a sense regulatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.777" offset="2168177">If the contractor has been operating negligently, the State tort action will cause the behavior to change.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_tait" startTime="518.984" stopTime="566.362">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Tait</label>
            <text syncTime="518.984" offset="2209033">--If in fact the basis behind the State tort action is contractor operation that is basically in compliance with how the Federal Government has instructed him to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.208" offset="2257934">And therefore would provide some sort of chilling effect on how he operates the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.177" offset="2277787">And I guess our position would be that the immunity would apply to that contract because it would go to the very heart of the Federal function.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.247" offset="2306104">In this particular case, however, we don't have that difficult a situation as far as we're concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.401" offset="2330659">What you have are literally thousands of pages of safety requirements promulgated by the State of Ohio, enforced by an Agency of the State of Ohio in which they are requiring a Government contractor to comply.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.362" offset="2398577">Mr. Tait, to add on to Justice O'Connor's question, what if there was a Federal Statute that said State tort law shall apply, notwithstanding otherwise applicable Federal immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.206" offset="2461898">Then would you still have to say it depends on the circumstances?</text>

            <text syncTime="586.626" offset="2479557">Well, if I interpret the Hancock decision correctly, Your Honor, if in fact there is specific Congressional authorization of the type of State activity that is attempted to be imposed on the facility, then that expresses the Federal Government's Congressional intent to allow that type of application.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.528" offset="3999152">I would emphasize however that at some point, you have to draw the line in determining what a workmen's compensation law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.884" offset="4040634">The relevant language of Section 290 simply authorizes States' workmen's compensation laws to apply on Federal property and facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.359" offset="4078564">The appellees in this case have conceded that a new provision in the Ohio Statute added in 1986 that allows the Ohio Industrial Commission to issue mandatory orders to employers requiring that they comply with specific safety regulations could not be applied to the Portsmouth Fuel Production Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.022" offset="4161216">That by itself suggests that the mere fact that the State has labeled something a workmen's compensation law or has instructed its Industrial Commission to enforce the law is not enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.827" offset="4296425">And in many cases, the existing legal landscape or the state of the law in effect at the time that the Congress passes a statute is a relevant consideration to look to in deciding what Congress must have meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.634" offset="4343655">But we would submit that there are several aspects in the background of the language and the legislative history of Section 290, which strongly suggest that Congress did not have any but the narrowest purposes in mind when they enacted that particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.763" offset="4412096">First, let me address a more general issue which is raised by the appellee's reliance on another Federal Statute and which I think is also relevant in understanding Section 290, and which has not been adequately brought out in this case because the issue really only arose when the appellees filed their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.324" offset="4486388">The appellees referred to a statute 16 U.S.C. 457 as being relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.330" offset="4518362">That statute authorizes the application of state wrongful death and personal liability law on property which is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.138" offset="4565591">This particular statute is irrelevant, utterly irrelevant to this particular case because it only applies in Federal enclaves, areas that are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.363" offset="4610522">The Portsmouth Gasification Plant is not a Federal enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.148" offset="4625673">When the Atomic Energy Commission purchased the site in 1952, it did not take the necessary steps to insure that the property would be subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction, and so by its terms, Section 457 does not apply to the Portsmouth Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.692" offset="4695890">More fundamentally, Section 457 does not go to the question of Federal immunities, the question which is at issue in this case and presented by the Hancock decision, 457 concerns the question of the scope of state territorial jurisdiction over Federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.321" offset="4766316">And Section 457 simply says that any objection to the territorial application of State wrongful death and tort law is waived, but it does not waive any Federal immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.859" offset="4812501">For example, in this Court's recent decision in Westfall v. Irving arose out of a tort allegedly committed at an Army depot which was a Federal enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.150" offset="4857640">The only reason State tort law applied in Westfall at all was because of Section 457, but no one in that case contended that Section 457 constituted a waiver of any immunity that the Federal employees had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.208" offset="4901944">And in fact, this Court recognized that if the employees were conducting a discretionary function, they would be immune from any such tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.231" offset="4941963">So there's a distinction between territorial jurisdiction and immunities, and Section 457 only addresses the former claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.012" offset="5157108">Well, Justice Rehnquist, we think it's a more difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.833" offset="5176438">It would present a much more difficult question to what extent the application of ordinary tort principles or State negligence law represents a regulation of a Federal facility, as opposed to simply a regulation of a private dispute between two parties or a regulation of a contractor's relationships to its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.794" offset="5248223">In some situations, we think that it would be in effect a regulation of the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.179" offset="5265777">For example, if the predicate for the action was the fact that the defendant had allegedly violated a specific State safety regulation and that was constituted per se negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.051" offset="5305274">We think that would really be no different from the application of a specific safety regulation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.837" offset="5324396">But those difficulties in line drawing with respect to tort actions aren't really presented in this case, because here you have a specific State safety regulation which is clearly regulatory in its effect, and its application, we think, triggers the Federal facilities immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.916" offset="5396703">Let me turn then to Section 290, and the reasons why we in particular think that Section 290 should not be read as authorizing the application of the State safety regulations in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.808" offset="5452292">First of all, the problem that gave rise to the enactment of 290 was real a problem very much like that addressed by Section 457.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.814" offset="5484370">That is, it was a question of territorial jurisdiction, and specifically, the Golden Gate Bridge was being constructed in California, and both ends of the bridge, private contractors had to perform work on Federal enclaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.073" offset="5545392">And this Court had recently held in a case called Murray v. Gerrick, Section 457 was not broad enough to authorize the application of State workmen's compensation laws on Federal enclaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.381" offset="5590636">And because of that decision, a number of insurance carriers were resisting the payment of workmen's compensation claims for people injured in the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.337" offset="5626476">So the immediate problem that gave rise to the enactment of Section 290 was a territorial jurisdiction problem, it was not a Federal immunities question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.842" offset="5656465">To be sure, Section 2 is drafted more broadly than Section 457.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.210" offset="5673914">It does not simply apply to enclaves, it applies to all Federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.131" offset="5693558">But given that there's no suggestion in the history that Congress was thinking beyond the question of territorial jurisdiction, we think that the Court should be reluctant to construe that statute as in effect a waiver of a Federal facility immunity, such as the type recognized in the Hancock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.891" offset="5760641">Second, there is a specific legislative history in the enactment of Section 2980 that addresses the question of State safety regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.616" offset="5799511">The version of Section 20 that initially passed the House provided that no only State workmen's compensation laws but also State safety and insurance laws would apply to Federal buildings and projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.239" offset="5846009">The Senate amended the bill by deleting this particular reference to State safety and insurance laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.393" offset="5870669">And the Senate report specifically observed that the reason for the deletion was that these provisions were objected to by procurement agencies of the Government inasmuch as such provisions would not only produce conflicts of authority between State and Federal officers, but would also mark a wide departure from the well established principle that Federal officers should have complete charge of any regulations pertaining to Federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.426" offset="5966799">The House then acceded to the Senate's amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.460" offset="5978920">And that history, we suggest, is strongly probative of the fact that Congress had no intention when it enacted 290 of waiving any immunity objection to the application of State safety regulations to Federal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.137" offset="6041614">Finally, as if to underscore the narrowness of 290, Congress added a proviso to the Statute expressly reaffirming,</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.176" offset="6077767">"by the passage of this section, the United States of America in no wise relinquishes its jurisdiction for any purpose over the property named, with the exception of extending to the several States within whose exterior boundaries such place may be, only the powers above enumerated relating to the enforcement of their State workmen's compensation laws.

            <text syncTime="1504.221" offset="6149970">Now, again, this does not define what State workmen's compensation laws means, but it does strongly suggest, we think, that Congress did not intend Section 290 to be used as a vehicle for enhancing State regulatory control over Federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.631" offset="6207648">Putting together the background of Section 290, the text and the legislative history, we think that as a matter or ordinary statutory construction the correct conclusion to draw would be that that statute does not authorize the application of anything more than traditional State workmen's compensation laws to Federal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.545" offset="6283299">However, this Court's decision in Hancock requires even more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.330" offset="6302421">As stated in the companion case of EPA v. Water Resources Board, Federal facilities are subject to State regulation only when and to the extent that Congressional authorization is clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.637" offset="6351635">And whatever can be said about Section 290 as a matter of ordinary Statutory construction, we think it's plain that it can't pass this more exacting standard.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stewart W. Jaffy</label>
            <text syncTime="1571.682" offset="6419763">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.038" offset="6457274">As an employee in the State of Ohio, I'm covered by the Ohio Workers Compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.595" offset="6495413">I'm covered as an attorney during my work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.881" offset="6508579">I would be covered if I worked in a factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.249" offset="6522058">I would be covered if I worked for the Goodyear Company, which is an Ohio Corporation, and I would be covered if I worked for Goodyear Atomic, which is a subsidiary of the Goodyear Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.640" offset="6571691">And in fact, the appellant and the Solicitor General concede that Mr. Miller, the person who was injured in the industrial accident, is covered under the Ohio Workers Compensation Law, and covered pursuant to 40 U.S.C. Section 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.053" offset="6653297">No argument on that part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.003" offset="6661134">What the appellant would like to do is to carve out part of that Ohio Workers Compensation law, persuade you that in fact it is not really workers' compensation, and tell you for that reason it does not enjoy the protection of 40 U.S.C. Section 290.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.019" offset="6753190">I'm going to discuss with you today a little bit of the facts of the case, some of the history that will explain to you how it is that this provision for additional compensation was placed into the Ohio Constitution and provides this additional compensation to injured workers in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.403" offset="6854649">In addition to that, I will discuss some statutory interpretation with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.705" offset="6875861">As is probably clear to you, Mr. Miller, while working for Goodyear Atomic, was engaged in maintenance work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.429" offset="6918806">he was not doing radiological work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.732" offset="6936047">He was standing on top of a manually propelled scaffold or high horse ladder, as it's called.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.652" offset="6967707">The ladder is such that it may be lowered to the ground, it may be raised to a height of sixteen feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.390" offset="6994665">It has a platform on the top of it, and there's a guard rail so that a person does not unwittingly fall off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.062" offset="7025281">What really happened was that Mr. Miller needed to lower he ladder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.900" offset="7052657">In order to do that, he first had to lower the guard rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.285" offset="7070212">Now, there he is in a squatting position on the ladder starting to lower the guard rail, and what happened was that a projection from the rail, a bolt that protruded, caught the glove that he was wearing, pulled him off balance, he fell to the ground, fractured his ankle, injured his heel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.669" offset="7171776">Now, no argument that it happened, no argument that it's covered under Ohio Workers Compensation Law, no argument that in fact Goodyear Atomic is a complying employer under the Ohio law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.760" offset="7228096">Goodyear pays premiums to the State of Ohio for workers compensation coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.131" offset="7249621">And in fact when this accident happened, Goodyear certified the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.450" offset="7274907">They said to the State of Ohio, yes this happened, yes this man is covered, yes he should be paid the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.056" offset="7301343">And Mr. Miller was paid worker's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.675" offset="7319733">He received because he was off work 29 weeks, the sum of $258 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.829" offset="7348363">After he returned to work, he was awarded another type of Ohio's worker compensation and that is called a disability award because he still had some residual disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.653" offset="7399668">And so he received another 16 weeks of worker's compensation at the rate of I think it was $83 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.925" offset="7432791">And then he applied for this award that's the subject of the case here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.312" offset="7454316">An award that is called an additional award where there is a safety violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.216" offset="7477931">The additional award is provided under the Ohio Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.518" offset="7495172">I'll discuss the history of it with you in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.954" offset="7504889">But so that you understand, our Constitution says, if the industrial Commission determines there is a safety violation and that it caused the accident, the Industrial Commission may award no less than 15 percent of what had been paid to this man by way of workers compensation, no more than 50 percent of what has been paid to this man by way of workers compensation, so that the additional award is I think tied into the whole worker's compensation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.912" offset="7652742">What you have in front of you today is a case that involves as a minimum to this claimant, something like an award for additional compensation of $1328.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.368" offset="7694538">The record in this case that was filed in this Court cost more than the minimum award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.605" offset="7719511">,--</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.855" offset="7720452">The maximum award that this individual may receive is $4439.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.675" offset="7747828">And that's what we're involved with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.794" offset="7760262">Now, how do we get to the additional award, how did the State of Ohio provide for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.797" offset="7784295">If I were that employee working in Ohio in 1900 and I got hurt in 1900, I would have sued Goodyear Atomic for my injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.724" offset="7843958">I had a common law suit is what it amounted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.592" offset="7859423">By 1921 Ohio changed the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.146" offset="7877709">And Ohio wasn't the only state that changed that procedure, and I may say a few of these things about worker's compensation because I assume that you're not familiar, and there's no reason for you to be familiar with worker's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.886" offset="7932670">They're State matters traditionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.488" offset="7939044">But in 1912, Ohio provided by its constitution, vote of the people, for a worker's compensation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.111" offset="7981572">They were much like many other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.527" offset="7987214">All states were going through this process of adopting workers compensation programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.829" offset="8004350">So that there was created a State Industrial Board and the purpose of it was to pay compensation where a person was injured because everybody recognized the old system didn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.018" offset="8049176">We had become some type of an industrialized society by then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.237" offset="8062029">But there was in that Ohio Constitution in 1912, a provision which retained the right to sue at common law, the right to sue that employer where in fact the injury occurred because the requirements dealing with the preservation of life or safety had not been met by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.287" offset="8162234">So here I am in 1912.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.239" offset="8170071">I, the employee, have a right at common law to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.976" offset="8197030">And it stayed that way in Ohio from 1912 until 1923 because people figured out by 1923 that it was not a good idea to permit the suit, that it really didn't serve the purpose intended by workers' compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.437" offset="8270799">And in 1923, our Constitution was amended, and it is that amended that we're considering here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.341" offset="8294414">Because in 1923, the right of the worker to sue was taken away, and it was replaced by this additional award which is in front of me today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.691" offset="8611854">Ohio, in fact, is saying, you, Mr. Miller, have been hurt as a result of overlooking this particular requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.713" offset="8643932">If in fact that's so, you're going to be paid additional compensation because we look to this situation as being a situation of some culpability on the part of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.371" offset="8694610">Now, Goodyear Atomic in that situation, same assumption, conflict of provisions, Goodyear Atomic is entitled to do what I think Goodyear Atomic was entitled to do anyway, which is to totally disregard if it so chooses, what it is that the State of Ohio has provided by way of a safety requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.685" offset="8771828">What triggers anything in Ohio is the fact that there has been an injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.610" offset="8835567">I have no problem in light of Section 290 of applying the workmen's compensation law by its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.597" offset="8867436">The trouble is that the Ohio Workmen's Compensation law does not apply and does not provide the added amount unless the employer is within the terms of the compensation law, in violation of a safety rule of the Industrial Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.178" offset="8941833">So to find that this employer is within that provision of the Compensation law, I also have to find that the employer was violating a safety rule of Ohio, which means, it seems to me, I have to find that he was subject to the safety rule of Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="2303.459" offset="9346940">I don't think it raises a separate question, because all that Ohio does, if it determines that the injury is due to the safety requirement not having been followed, all that happens is that compensation is paid to Mr. Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.908" offset="9440667">Goodyear might choose to do absolutely nothing, other than pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2430.287" offset="9854238">And as I say, I look at this case and say, I think, it's really a question of did Congress permit this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.210" offset="9885898">It seems to me the Statute is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.161" offset="9897705">And I have to disagree with some of the comments made by the Solicitor General as to the history of that particular statute and as to its significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.235" offset="9950055">And I think it all goes back to 16 U.S.C. 457 when Congress passed 457, it remitted a tort action, and there were courts, as you probably understand, who felt that 16 U.S.C. 457 applied to Workers' Compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.685" offset="10047857">Until this Court decided Murray v. Gerrick &amp; Co., and kind of threw up in the air the question of, was workers' compensation covered, there had been decisions that said workers' compensation was covered under 457.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.796" offset="10120269">So that had we without even getting to 290, had we had just 16 U.S.C. 457 which applied to workers' compensation, Mr. Miller would have had his claim covered, as permitted by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.532" offset="10655256">By the time the case got to the Industrial Commission, the Department of Energy had come in, they raised a pre-emption argument, and it may very well have been the first time that kind of an argument has ever been raised to the Ohio Industrial Commission, and they backed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.410" offset="10722757">Both of our Courts, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court, were in favor of granting a mandamus or that the Industrial Commission go forward and make a determination in this matter, and from there, your Court noted probable jurisdiction, and we're here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.466" offset="11270910">It's much different, Justice Scalia, then let's say we brought a suit, and we argued that this was negligence per se that had occurred here, because there is a State statute that says this is a particular requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.976" offset="11336948">That's exactly the same situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.226" offset="11346038">The State has tried to protect the work place safety of people, and they have tried to do it in this fashion, and all that happens is, with this particular section we're talking about or this particular safety section, it has provided that the exposed surfaces are not supposed to have any sharp edges, burrs or protruding parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.095" offset="11461500">Which is virtually the same as the OSHA standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.197" offset="11473830">And in fact, it had a protruding part and the man got hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.784" offset="11496190">And when the union representative made his safety inspection some six or seven months later, the protruding part was still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.290" offset="11526283">It had not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.890" offset="11532657">Goodyear had not done anything with it, and they didn't have to do anything with and no one from the State of Ohio came in to make them do anything with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.395" offset="11566616">The only thing the State said was, okay, if in fact, this violating is here, there's going to be some money paid to this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.268" offset="11606114">One of the things the Solicitor General talks about in his brief is that the State may provide for compensation but they can't just go throwing it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.992" offset="11653030">We're not going to enrich this person, we can't give him more than full compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.630" offset="11675599">And I don't really know what full compensation is, but if you look to what Ohio does, Ohio basically gears its compensation on a person's salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.687" offset="11715828">It has a limit which is 66 2/3rds percent of the individual's salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.591" offset="11739443">It also has a limit which is a statewide maximum so regardless of how much you make, you cannot receive more than whatever is the statewide maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.113" offset="11777581">If in terms of 66 2/3rds percent, it's based on wages, there is no provision for pain and suffering that the individual may have had, there is no provision for loss of consortium, strictly limited to wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.390" offset="11838603">Now, if you add in the additional compensation which is this award, and I've tried to say to you, this is all one package of workers' compensation, let's say you add in the maximum of 50 percent of what has been paid in workers' compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.982" offset="11905059">If you take the 66, and you take 50 percent of that, the State is going to award another 33 percent, bringing you up to roughly 100 percent of the person's wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.557" offset="11955318">That the State of Ohio has considered full compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.944" offset="11972873">It seems to me that this is not just throwing money away to a claimant has been hurt, it is a legitimate effort of the State to pay a little more where there is culpability on the part of the employer, it is something that the employees of the State have given up by way of their giving up the right to go into Court and sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.738" offset="12048001">And that was the trade off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.690" offset="12059808">They gave up the right to go into Court and sue in return for having the Industrial Commission make the particular awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.594" offset="12083423">The appellant here, and the Solicitor General, would agree that the basic compensation may appropriately be paid under 290, but they want to carve out the additional compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.687" offset="12147789">Nevertheless, they still want to retain the right of not being sued by the employee, which is what that 1923 amendment provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.546" offset="12943270">And there is no provision under OSHA for any kind of a remedy to the person who is hurt, no Federal remedy, in other words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.703" offset="12995932">And I guess what I'm saying is that there is a presumption that where the Federal Government has not provided for a remedy to the person who is injured that the State remedies would apply.</text>

I assume the Government would... if the Ohio provision read that this surcharge is applicable if someone violates a specific safety rule of the Industrial Commission or of any other Governmental entity which may have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.978" offset="13145039">Presumably, Ohio could do that, and if it read that way, I guess the Government would agree with you that the surcharge is chargeable, which means Ohio would look to see whether there had been a violation of OSHA or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.732" offset="13368021">And I assume Ohio could write it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.399" offset="13378678">It could say, if you violate our standards or the standards of any other governmental entity that's applicable, we're going to hit you with a 15 percent or whatever surcharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.569" offset="13411384">I think if the State of Ohio were to adopt the OSHA regulations as part of their safety requirements, what you're saying is 100 percent correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.711" offset="13451926">Ohio has not done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.411" offset="13458718">I might say unfortunately, they haven't done it, but they haven't, and that's the status of where we are today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.447" offset="13482855">The Industrial Fabricators case which is in the Appendix which was a Federal District Court case coming out of our Southern District of Ohio, involved an argument which in some ways parallels this because the employer there was arguing that the additional safety award should not be paid because it conflicted with OSHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.784" offset="13592256">The Federal District Court didn't agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.752" offset="13608138">The Federal District Court indicated, I thought very clearly, that our additional compensation is a compensation matter, primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.674" offset="13647740">While it may have some incidental effects in terms of causing an employer, if you will, to clean up his act, that's not the primary purpose of our Ohio law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.434" offset="13702806">And I think that case, and the Ohio Supreme Court cases that have been cited, indicate this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.071" offset="13837389">At the same time indicate that they have the authority to order an employer to pay compensation to an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.539" offset="13859227">Clearly, the primary basis behind the specific safety requirements promulgated by the State of Ohio are to promote safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.812" offset="13892350">No one questions that and the Attorney General on behalf of the Industrial Commission concedes that fact, that the primary basis of those requirements are to promote safety through regulation of employer conduct.</text>
