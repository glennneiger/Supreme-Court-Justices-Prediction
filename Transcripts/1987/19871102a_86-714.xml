            <text syncTime="70.488" offset="412172">Well, the source, I think, is the priority of protecting the ability of the Federal government to function and perform the duties and tasks that it has ultimately under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.107" offset="466612">I think one could ask the question, is it a matter of supremacy and are we invoking the supremacy clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="98.695" offset="525021">And I'll explain that by saying that technically in this case we are talking about an application of State law that has been made applicable in the context of exclusive jurisdiction Federal enclaves as a matter of Congressional action, a blanket enactment of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.264" offset="603284">But the concern remains very real.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.967" offset="614047">So that the "sort of" is explained by the fact that there is not a technical conflict that does not involve an act of Congress triggering the application of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.354" offset="659604">There is nonetheless the tension between the application of evolving State tort law concepts and the priority of the Federal government being able to perform its functions through its employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.154" offset="770781">Well, I think what we're talking about is maybe a sort of an assumption or a presumption that it is intended that the Federal government be able, intended in the Constitution, absent some action by Congress indicating otherwise, that it be able to go forward with its activities as authorized by Congress, and the disruption that would result by the regular interaction of State law principles interfering with the performance of those functions I think is what it's designed to protect.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.969" offset="1826128">And there's a couple of reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.297" offset="1835428">One is that, maybe the most practical, although I think not the most significant one, is that the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Discretionary Function exception of that Statute really doesn't provide us with much of a practical solution when one goes to it and tries to identify the precise level of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.601" offset="1904600">This Court's decisions in Varig do indeed suggest that a fairly low level of discretion should be the cut off under the Tort Claims Act at least where you're dealing with regulatory sorts of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.300" offset="1955382">But much beyond that there is, I think we have to say, some significant amount of confusion as to exactly where the line is drawn in various situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.508" offset="2064261">But I'd like to give the second reason, which is really the primary reason why it's not an appropriate thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.912" offset="2085890">And that is that the Tort Claims Act and personal immunity are really dealing with very different things, and have very different consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.987" offset="2122148">The principle that the government will be liable for its conduct and essentially that the burdens of harm resulting from its conduct in certain defined situations defined in the Statute, primarily defined to include sort of run of the mill negligence in the performance of duties is a principle that amounts to a reallocation of that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.866" offset="2209710">It is not an action that will necessarily at all have the impact of shaping the conduct of the Federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.099" offset="2238654">The Federal government has to engage in many activities that will unavoidably have some harmful affects, and the conclusion is drawn as to at least some of those that the government should nonetheless should pay for those things while going on doing them in many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.609" offset="2296646">With regard to personal liability, you're dealing with a very different animal which will have very different consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.294" offset="2323395">Imposing the liability on the individual will clearly have a direct effect in shaping his or her conduct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>

            <text syncTime="565.334" offset="2391523">There are a couple of answers to that, Chief Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.894" offset="2413779">One is that when there is an award under the Federal Tort Claims Act, you may not proceed further or proceed at all against an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.813" offset="2453485">And our understanding of that and our sense of what that meant was that Congress wanted to be very careful to create a clear line substituting liability once an action had been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.243" offset="2511163">We do not read that at all as indicating its understanding that individual employees would otherwise be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.303" offset="2539376">The law at the time the Tort Claims Act was enacted we are frank to say was less than completely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.534" offset="2568319">We think that when one reads Spaulding v. Vilas, one comes up with a principle of absolute immunity without regard to malice applicable at least at the level of a sub-cabinet officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.701" offset="2625057">Barr v. Matteo was taken by this Court and was decided on a vote of 4-1-4 with the one vote obviously going in favor of the immunity but for reasons that didn't join in the majority opinion because the law at that time was not a hundred percent clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.443" offset="2696006">In that state of unclarity of the law, it made perfect sense for Congress to enact the provision that it did, setting a bright line rule and a defense for an individual should the government actually be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.720" offset="2749087">Now, there's two other examples, two other sets of statutes that are also I think responsive to Your Honor's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.279" offset="2775314">One of those is known as the Drivers' Act, and the other I think is known as the Rodriguez Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.106" offset="2794644">In any event, the second one deals with the liability of doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.386" offset="2807706">Taking the second one first, in the early 1970s, there developed some case law including the District of Columbia Circuit's decision in Henderson v. Bluemink finding Federal doctors liable for their actions simply acting as doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.892" offset="2885759">And in response to that, in a rather direct response applicable to various categories of Federal doctors, Congress enacted legislation saying those doctors aren't liable, substituting in essence the United States as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.668" offset="2940930">They did not at that time take action with regard to other categories of Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.464" offset="2960052">We believe that they didn't do that because they were acting directly in response to a particular problem that had arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.897" offset="2989831">The problem had not arisen as to the other categories of employees at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.992" offset="6706220">The position of respondents here is simply that Barr and its progeny set out applicable rules, we feel, to apply immunity involving common law or State tort actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.363" offset="6763689">There is a distinct difference between an activity that is within the outer perimeters of a job of a government employee, and an activity that is discretionary within that outer perimeter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.965" offset="6818024">A question was put earlier as to whether or not that outer perimeter in and of itself would establish liability and were there any cases on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.320" offset="6863477">Doe v. McMillan speaks directly to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.350" offset="6879568">In that case, the printer of documents was sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.551" offset="6904437">The Court held without a doubt his activities were within the outer perimeters but that his job and doing what he was doing on this occasion was not discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.483" offset="6944143">Since it was not discretionary, he did not enjoy the Barr immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.514" offset="6964310">There were other questions involved which are constitutional in nature, but it was directed directly to the Barr case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.416" offset="6991895">There is a need to allow causes of action like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.757" offset="7013211">There is a need in Alabama and throughout the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.835" offset="7025541">In this particular instance... there's 22 States, as a matter of fact, that do allow some type of a co-employee case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.379" offset="7051768">In this particular case, the plaintiff, Erwin, did receive an injury as a consequence of being exposed to soda ash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.922" offset="7085936">He did receive worker's compensation under Federal Workers Compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.093" offset="7102550">However, that compensation statute is limited in its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.481" offset="7124179">He received an injury to his vocal cords.</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.621" offset="7140688">As a consequence of not being a scheduled member, this man received an injury for which there was no redress except in a direction action against a coemployee in this case.</text>
