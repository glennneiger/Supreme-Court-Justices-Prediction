            <text syncTime="9.189" offset="167433">Mr. Lee, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="11.639" offset="177255">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.591" offset="189062">This case presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.876" offset="202228">The first concerns the Article 3 standing of Defendants to defend against constitutional attack, a New Jersey statute which permits one minute of silence during the day, during which they may engage in introspection and contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.122" offset="291149">And the second issue concerns the constitutionality of that statute on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.693" offset="313510">Our basic position on standing is that we meet the core Article 3 requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.132" offset="343185">That requirement as has been stated by Baker v. Carr is such a personal stake in the outcome as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentations of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.059" offset="406924">It is important to analyze that against the background of this one central fact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.462" offset="436599">It was not Messrs. Karcher and Orechio that invoked the Federal judicial machinery in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.568" offset="468990">It is the Appellees, themselves, the very ones who are calling standing into question who are the Plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.091" offset="499084">But once the suit was brought and the Attorney General and the other executive officers refused to defend the statute, then it was proper for Messrs. Karcher and Orechio to defend the statute as intervenors in defense of their own reputation as legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.921" offset="582362">That is what they do for a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.806" offset="593960">They pass legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.991" offset="606708">Their job is to pass good legislation, to pass responsible legislation, to pass constitutional legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.478" offset="636592">And their reputational stake in life depends on their ability to pass such legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.824" offset="921954">Those officers... those rules apply, in our view, to executive officers who do have ongoing responsibilities and, therefore, the language of the rules substituting one for the other makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.834" offset="982035">It does not make sense in the context of legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.536" offset="996873">And, in any event, because of their interest as legislators, as the producers of this legislative product, they have standing, core representational standing, reputational standing because of their own interest in their own reputation for their ability to pass legislation and have it upheld as constitutional.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="266.469" offset="1196553">Well, I think there are... there comes points of diminishing returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.873" offset="1218182">When the nature of that interest... as they take new jobs, then they are no longer legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.192" offset="1247439">Then they do something else for a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.144" offset="1255276">But at the present time, that is what they do for a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.180" offset="1267397">And, certainly that is what they... they have standing in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.798" offset="1285892">You have to bear in mind, also, that there is a difference between, we submit, the standing... standing as a plaintiff to attack constitutionality in the first place and standing of defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.427" offset="1352452">The major standing cases that have raised the stringent requirements, Valley Forge, Worth v. Seldon, Flass v. Cohen and so forth, have all been plaintiff standing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.817" offset="1401980">And I submit that cases like Chathau, and United States v. Lovett, and Bob Jones v. the United States simply fit in a different category where in those cases, there is no question there was a case in controversy, whether Chathau was going to be deported depended on whether that statute was upheld as constitutional or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.421" offset="1516396">The only problem was that like here there was no party to take the adverse side.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.908" offset="1538339">Both sides took the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.692" offset="1549519">And, as a consequence, the House and Senate were permitted to intervene and take the same side.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.465" offset="1900605">Certainly, as concrete a stake as was the case in the Price Anderson case or as was in the Scrap case.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.510" offset="1968733">In the Bob Jones case, for example, there was nobody on opposite sides by the time the case got to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.283" offset="2007812">And this Court simply appointed a respected member of the Bar of this Court to represent one side.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.250" offset="2219717">But regardless, you still have, as long as they are legislators, their concrete interest that is just as great as the interest of some that have been sustained by this Court when you had plaintiff standing, not defendant standing, but plaintiff standing as sustaining the jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.568" offset="2324938">And we submit that that is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.704" offset="2333506">Now, we submit two final things for your consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.575" offset="4009000">And I would suggest as a possible consideration that you reconsider, if necessary, the motion to intervene filed by those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.317" offset="4056021">Turning to the merits, there is an interesting parallel in this case between one aspect of Wallace v. Jaffree, and the statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.607" offset="4109101">I think Justice Stevens particularly will remember because I remember with great discomfort the exchange that he had with Paul Battor over this particular statute that there was one statute, one of the three statutes that was concededly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.438" offset="4180468">Everyone in the case agreed it was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.640" offset="4197291">And, indeed, the fact that everyone agreed that it was constitutional became part of the reason... became a crucial fact in the decision in Wallace v. Jaffree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.144" offset="4227279">This statute that is at issue today is identical, identical to Alabama Code Section 20... 16.1.20 that everyone agreed was constitutional in Wallace v. Jaffree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.473" offset="4308573">That Alabama statute provides for, and I am quoting:</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.444" offset="4324455">"A period of silence not to exceed one minute in duration which shall be observed for meditation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.598" offset="4353085">Whereas, the present statute provides for a one-minute period of silence to be used so at the discretion of the individual student before the opening exercises of each day for quiet and private contemplation or introspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.678" offset="4437408">There is not a nickel's worth of difference between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.146" offset="4447335">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.846" offset="4450052">There is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.332" offset="4452037">There is one difference between them and that is that the Alabama statute is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.117" offset="4475129">The moment of meditation must be used for that purpose, whereas, in New Jersey the student has the option whether to use his or her 60 seconds for introspection or contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.412" offset="4544301">The three-part lemon test squarely vindicates the constitutionality of New Jersey's moment of silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.601" offset="4581082">In this case, there are two purposes and the major focus in this case, as in Wallace v. Jaffree is on purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.325" offset="4631968">The first of these purposes, the case for the first of these purposes can be very simply and powerfully stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.014" offset="4666764">And it is as follows: There is a legitimate secular pedological purpose for a moment of silence at the beginning of each day and, second, the statute itself says that that objective, legitimate pedological purpose is its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.296" offset="4763939">And that objective purpose is to provide for a moment of introspection and contemplation at the beginning of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.069" offset="4798943">Now, under Lynch v. Donnelly, that is the end of the inquiry because Lynch makes a couple of things... well, cases all the way from really Abington through Mueller make it quite clear, the first thing, that in deciding matters of purpose, a great deal of deference is given to the individual legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.290" offset="4927884">And, second, Lynch makes it clear that if there are several purposes and one of them is a non-sham, legitimate purpose, then you are over that hurdle and you go on to effect and entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.084" offset="4995070">It is probably best stated by Lynch where the Court said that even where the benefits to religion were substantial we saw a secular purpose and no conflict with the establishment of cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.142" offset="5051286">How, then, could the District Court possibly hold where you had an objective purpose stated on the face of the statute, no contrary purpose stated on the face of the statute hold that it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.258" offset="5143759">And he did so by saying that the secular purpose was a pretext and that it was really just a pretext for bringing prayer back to the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.886" offset="5214290">He did so by relying on the hearsay statements from five legislators who said that that was its real purpose, even though other legislators said that the statute means what it says.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.588" offset="5533088">And that if you have got something in the record, you ought to stick to what is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.409" offset="5556390">And what comes from the court's rule in this case is a mystery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.479" offset="5580631">Apparently, it would allow for a single legislator veto so that if I were one who disfavored the Moment of Silence Bill, I could simply say,</text>

            <text syncTime="1392.481" offset="5700586">Equally outrageous in my opinion was the District Court's consideration of expert opinion on both sides of the fundamental policy issue, whether the Moment of Silence really would make a contribution to school secular purposes, including the transition time from a pre-school mindset to a post-school mindset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.882" offset="5806225">It is no surprise that school people were willing to express an opinion on both sides of that issue as to whether you really would get a quieting down effect and a salutary effect from that kind of experience or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1439.379" offset="5888249">Public policy for the State of New Jersey, including school policy, is set by the Legislature of the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.853" offset="5942166">And if that legislature determines, in its wisdom, that the boundary between what happens during the school hours and what happens just before school hours may be marked or that school discipline may be improved by having a moment of silence at the beginning of the school day, then it doesn't matter all of the legislators... excuse me, all of the school experts in the State of New Jersey think about that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.442" offset="6080510">Their opinions on that issue should be addressed to the Legislature, itself, and not to a Federal District Court reviewing for a constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.132" offset="6115201">Neither Lemon v. Kurtzman nor any other case has ever held that a statute filed, the establishment clause... held a statute violate of the establishment clause because the court takes a different view from that of the legislature as to whether the secular objective can be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.844" offset="6182075">The second purpose that is established by this statute is that it provides an accommodation for those students who want to use the moment of silence of prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.305" offset="6259919">Now, as I read Wallace v. Jaffree, under Wallace v. Jaffree, if the statute provided only that you use it for prayer, it would be unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.051" offset="12862943">I don't understand what you mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.653" offset="12869317">The degree of impediment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.305" offset="12875900">I thought you were going to say that the degree of accommodation was greater.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.078" offset="12919054">--One of our theses is that an accommodation of a religious exercise is usually appropriate only when there is some kind of impediment to the religious practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.270" offset="12975792">If it is simply a facilitation of religious practice when there is no obstacle, then the message is that government is encouraging and endorsing a religious practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.078" offset="13026992">Therefore, the fact that one hour could not be accommodated within the school context makes it different from one minute which we claim could be accommodated without any special kind of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.488" offset="13084670">Indeed, the record shows that there were numerous opportunities for school children in New Jersey to have a minute of silence during the course of the ongoing school day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.212" offset="13127511">There was no need, therefore... there was no impediment existing which would warrant a pure accommodation measure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.322" offset="13191981">Why was there an accommodation needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.793" offset="13205879">Apparently, school children thought that it was burdensome to have to take the hour at some other time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.113" offset="13235136">It is certainly not burdensome to take the minute in some other context.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman L. Cantor</label>
            <text syncTime="3280.767" offset="13253735">The second difference is that in Zorach v. Clauson, there was no juxtaposition between public school classrooms and the religious exercise while here, in fact, we are talking about a religious exercise within the school building, within the classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.443" offset="13320504">Thirdly, the presence of extensive regulations on the part of the State Commissioner of Education and the City, Board of Education--</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.799" offset="13353941">That goes to entanglement, I presume, and not to religious motivation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.251" offset="13367733">--It goes to effects more than to purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.655" offset="13385288">But I think it is an important distinction because one of our contentions here is that the total absence of any kind of regulations, any kind of implementing guidelines meant that the practice would inevitably be abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.497" offset="13444742">And, finally, I would suggest that a meaningful secular alternative was provided to the religious exercise in Zorach v. Clauson while that is not the case in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.889" offset="13494270">The record says with regard to Zorach that those not released stay in the classrooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.709" offset="13517572">I give Justice Douglas the benefit of the doubt and I assume that they weren't simply warehoused in the classrooms and that there was, in fact, a secular educational activity going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.684" offset="13565428">One of our contentions here and one of the reasons why we conclude that even under an accommodation view of the statute as Judge Gibbons took in the Third Circuit, that it is still unconstitutional, that his conclusion was correct, because there were no secular alternatives provided and articulated for these school children, these impressionable school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.799" offset="13665947">They were told that we, the State of New Jersey, are preempting the normal educational program in order to permit students to pray.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.326" offset="13715998">That was the message.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.949" offset="13770541">And this measure was applicable from Kindergarten through 12th grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.187" offset="13787469">I suggest to you that on the face of the statute to tell Kindergarten through 3rd graders that they have an option of contemplation or introspection during the first minute of the school day is to tell them nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.328" offset="13836057">The only message that they understand is that that is the traditional format for school prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.517" offset="13868762">They don't understand what contemplation or introspection is unless there are guidelines articulating an alternative secular function.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="3447.491" offset="13920693">I also have that many comments, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.443" offset="13932501">First, with regard to the suggestion that the case for... the case of this being anything other than just a newspaper collection of clippings in support of the proposition that the Moment of Silence was in support of prayer, simply cannot withstand the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.950" offset="14070532">And I would simply invite the Court's attention in that respect to two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.270" offset="14091743">One is the opinion, itself, which it is very apparent that that is all that they did was just go through and quote statements from people who had been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.293" offset="14127897">The best statement in the whole record is the sentence that come from Judge Becker in which he says:</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.863" offset="14154124">"That the evidence as a whole is equivocal at best. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.232" offset="14167603">"The single unambiguous piece of evidence, the statute on its face, attests the secular motives. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.303" offset="14195919">And I submit that under this Court's cases, that is all that is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.957" offset="14218489">Now, second, with respect to accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.360" offset="14244194">The only way that can sustain the proposition that the difference between a minute and an hour cuts in Zorach's favor is exactly the basis that was just stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.988" offset="14314620">And that is if you say that the only possible accommodation... the only permissible accommodation doctrine turns on the removal of an impediment, but that simply... doctrine simply far outran that particular notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.819" offset="14398003">Cases like Alan, and Tilton and Epperson, I think have to be explained as accommodation cases and there was no impediment in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.947" offset="14462473">And, indeed, in Zorach, itself, you could say that there was an accommodation because the state was requiring attendance at school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.553" offset="14492879">But that really falls short, because those students could have attended their religious instruction, as many religious students do throughout the country today, at a time earlier than school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.111" offset="14547110">Zorach v. Clauson simply cannot be squared with an affirmance of the Third Circuit's decision in Karcher v. May.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.168" offset="14587338">And the two differences are: the one minute and the one hour and the difference between the extent to which you bring the forces of the school into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.226" offset="14643658">In this case, there are only 60 seconds of the school's attention time that were used, maybe not even school hour time, probably school hour time; whereas in Zorach v. Clauson, it was a full hour and the... in Zorach v. Clauson--</text>
