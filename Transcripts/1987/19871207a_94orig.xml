            <text syncTime="1018.841" offset="4180391">The National Governors' Association does not think it necessary to reach the tax immunity issue which Mr. Linton argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.659" offset="4207663">But rather, we submit that the question squarely presented in this case is whether Congress can enlist the State legislatures to its service in order to achieve a national goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.790" offset="4256146">That principle, the principle that -- that this -- that Congress may not so enlist the State legislature has survived through all the twists and turns of federalism jurisdiction -- jurist prudence in this Court and has been most recently reaffirmed in the case of FERC versus Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.493" offset="4335036">The principle is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.559" offset="4343291">Whatever else Congress may do pursuant to the delegated powers, it may not reach out into the circle of authority reserved to the States and conscript the State legislative machinery and put it to use to advance a national goal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.452" offset="4462827">The consequence of that was that each State had to adjust the agenda of its legislative and regulatory bodies in order to accommodate its laws to this new requirement and the record shows, for example, that in Kansas, 47 statutes had to be amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.007" offset="4537015">In Illinois, the question of adjustment of their statutes to the registration requirement had to be put on special agenda of the legislature, and then the legislature had to come back to make a further adjustment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.586" offset="5287356">In circumstances where the State has attached the condition to standing -- spending power as this Court has found, you have a realistic option not to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.163" offset="5321629">Here, if you accept the stipulation that this was a requirement, you also have the compulsion to pass laws and it is the nature of that intrusion, not its weight, not the economic effects but the nature of the requirement that that legislature in Illinois convened itself, adjust its agenda and pass these laws that gives rise to the constitutional infirmity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.239" offset="5413998">That is a very different question than using the constitution as a shield from a generally applicable regulation such as it was that issue in Garcia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.908" offset="5456629">There is all the world of difference between telling the State that it must pay a minimum wage to its employees, the same as general motors must do it, and telling the State that it must get its legislature in session and create its own labor standards board modeled after the federal design to perform that regulatory function that Congress prescribed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.984" offset="5784936">Again, I would suggest quite different from the command to the State to use its resources in service of the -- of federal goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.175" offset="5821717">This maybe a small kind of intrusion, but in nature, it goes to the heart of what troubles the States about the protection that forwarded their federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.451" offset="5866856">The Congress may from time to time narrow the circle of authority reserved to the States, but it is quite another matter as Justice Blackmun recognized in the -- in the beginning of his opinion in FERC versus Mississippi to reach into the remaining circle and enlist the state apparatus in the service of the federal cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.734" offset="5955986">That goes to the heart of the power of choice of the ability to set a political agenda that is so crucial to state autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.288" offset="5994229">We know that state autonomy won't be eliminated in one large swoop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.662" offset="6015650">The Court has not had to confront the case where Congress tells the state legislature to have only 50 members or meet every December or choose its -- the members of its Supreme Court according to federal design.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.823" offset="6068313">But what the congress does with increasing frequency is achieve its regulatory goals by reaching over and having the State do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.745" offset="6099973">That was the issue, for example, in EPA versus Brown where the Federal Government set environmental standards, but until they retreated and the case was mooted in 1977, the device of enforcing those regulatory objectives was through the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.483" offset="6162980">And that's what caused the lower -- the Circuit Courts to consider that to find an invasion of the Tenth Amendment autonomy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.897" offset="6196626">And similarly in FERC, ultimately the Court narrowly divided on whether the intrusion was too much, but there, it wasn't the legislative apparatus that was being commandeered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.456" offset="6242811">It was a quasi-adjudicative body, just being ask to consider the federal standards, giving the option of getting out of the field of regulating those utility rates entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.336" offset="6298399">And here, many people have had the reaction, well, why are the governors and the mayors and the counties and the state legislatures bringing this particular case before this Court occupying this Master for two or three years, when it seems so inconsequential, but the fact is, as I indicated, never is the Court's sanction a compulsion to the State to pass laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.150" offset="6685638">Congress if it had in mind curving tax evasion by creating a record of ownership of municipal bonds could ever require that those bonds be sold or bought through brokers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.430" offset="6774768">They could have told the holders of those bonds in the secondary market that when you seek to buy or sell those bonds, go to a broker and the broker will file an information return with the Federal Government and indeed, that would have been a more effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.538" offset="6839134">We're not arguing that the method adopted was ineffective, but that would've been more effective than the device of requiring registration because, in fact as you know, transfer agents don't file those information returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.993" offset="6893051">You can negotiate a registered bond transferring beneficial ownership without going through a transfer agent, and so the registration system doesn't really worked very well to curve tax compliance, but that's not the just of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.770" offset="6952087">Given that alternative means of protecting the tax compliance interest which certainly the governors and the mayor share with the National Government to do it in a way that commandeer the legislative apparatus of the States was unnecessary and contrary to something that is very deeply held in the structure of federalism established under the constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2244.737" offset="9083993">On the contrary, Congress was demonstrating a perhaps over nice delicacy about not using the heaviest weapons in its arsenal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.558" offset="9131222">Its concerns were that bearer bonds of all issuers, federal issuers, corporate and municipal issuers have served as a kind of interest bearing large denomination currency for tax evaders and other with sources of wealth do not bear looking into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.128" offset="9217531">And they are much more attractive than cashing the mattress or gold bullion in the safe deposit box.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.640" offset="9251594">And municipals are particularly unattractive -- particularly attractive to those who are up to no good because once you get your cash into the safe harbor, there is no longer any legal obligation to pay tax on the interest or even to report it in some circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.606" offset="9331424">Congress might simply here forbidden the transferring or holding of bearer bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.320" offset="9362353">Instead, they chose what they thought was a less intrusive measure for corporate and municipals with the thought that this way, they would force these holdings out into the open, create a paper record, making them far less attractive for nefarious practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="2731.921" offset="11032727">Corporations also issued their bonds in bearer form and being somewhat more -- more flexible long before TEFRA, they have moved virtually, universally to registered form, and the Master found, I think quite reasonably, that this is a change which the municipal market would have gone to of its own in any event except for the slight problem of the very great facility that bearer municipals gave to people were up to no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.925" offset="11192701">Now, turning to the regulatory burden, I find that a puzzling argument, I think back to the FERC case and the FERC case was troublesome because there what happened is Congress was dealing with what in terms of politics and policy were surely a hot potato, how consumer electric rates will be calculated and how they're going to be allocated, a very difficult political question, and Congress sought to involve, if not to enlist, at least sought to involve the state regulatory mechanism there, and that was said to be all right although not everybody on this Court so believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.745" offset="11400009">In this case by contrast, what you have is a purely technical requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.309" offset="11430311">There is no political or policy hot potato being thrown to the States to somehow deal within their own political boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.436" offset="11474824">This is -- this is no more of a regulatory burden, then if the Congress had said that all checks issued in the United States including those issued by States must have a certain format and being coded in a particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.133" offset="11537518">And indeed, Congress long ago required the States to issue W4s, W2s and 1099s in terms of reporting to the IRS when there was a state tax refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.301" offset="11614213">These, as far as regulatory burdens, though they may have had technical difficulties from a policy and a political point of view, was simply trivial and that is why I think we are dealing at a level of triviality which makes it dangerous for this Court, dangerous to allow itself to be drawn into what our really serious questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.854" offset="11736466">The question that trouble you Justice O'Connor are serious questions and I am disturbed that this Court should be precipitated into a confrontation with those difficult questions where frankly nothing is at stake.</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.327" offset="12282321">The question imposed by Justice Scalia about the tax on bonds proceeds, according to this Court in Rockford, that's a tax on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.186" offset="12317743">In reversed situation, it's a tax on the State here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.201" offset="12329864">And in response to Justice Blackmun's question about Pollock, you cannot apply the rule of New York versus United States or Massachusetts versus United States and sustain the action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.725" offset="12375944">In each of those cases, the Court was mindful of the proposition that you cannot tax the power to borrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.786" offset="12408127">That's what this Court also said in 1962 in Free versus Bland when the State had what makes him a trivial interest to assert on the form of the savings bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.903" offset="12448669">In this Court said unanimously in the seventh to zero opinion that that interferes with the ability of the Federal Treasury officials to determine the form of the instrument.</text>
