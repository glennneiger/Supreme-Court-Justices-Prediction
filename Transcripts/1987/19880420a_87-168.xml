            <text syncTime="13.042" offset="188282">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.713" offset="202911">This case is an appeal from a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.115" offset="236557">This judgment was adopted by an equally divided court from a vote of five to five.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.066" offset="264351">The effect of the judgment was to affirm the order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.217" offset="304998">That order contained an injunction that enjoined the enforcement of an ordinance of the Town of Brookfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.526" offset="350242">That ordinance provided for the prohibition of picketing before and about any residence or dwelling in the Town of Brookfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.082" offset="408442">After that ordinance was adopted, the Appellees commenced this legal action seeking declaratory relief and an injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.311" offset="473331">They immediately asked for a preliminary injunction, and that was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.479" offset="497990">In the request for the preliminary injunction, it was argued that there was a violation of the equal protection clause as well as the First Amendment, and that particular part of the argument of the Appelles was not ruled upon favorably by the District Court, and there was no cross appeal from that particular part of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.559" offset="634349">An appeal from the order as a whole was taken by the Appellants, that is by the Town of Brookfield, and proceeded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.051" offset="712299">Before all of this occurred, I should point out that the initial ordinance adopted by the Town of Brookfield provided an exception to the prohibition against picketing, namely an exception in favor of labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.497" offset="794114">When the town attorney became aware of the fact that that ordinance had been adopted, he advised the chief of police not to enforce it until he had an opportunity to study its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.210" offset="852942">After he had reread the case of Carey v. Brown, he advised the town board to repeal that ordinance in deference to this Court's decision in Carey v. Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.533" offset="902261">The town board did precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.595" offset="914486">Subsequently, they adopted the current ordinance, which has a uniform prohibition against residential picketing without any exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.652" offset="958686">And this also was in recognition of footnote number two of this Court's decision Carey v. Brown in which this Court stated that it was reserving judgment on the question of whether or not an ordinance that uniformly prohibited picketing without exception--</text>

            <text syncTime="239.404" offset="1093686">--Well, footnote two reads as follows,</text>
            <text syncTime="242.434" offset="1105807">"Because the Court of Appeals concluded that the labor dispute exception was not severable from the remainder of the statute, it invalidated the enactment in its entirety. "</text>
            <text syncTime="257.443" offset="1165889">"The Court therefore found it unnecessary to consider the constitutionality under the First Amendment of the statute that prohibited all residential picketing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="268.361" offset="1209566">"Because find the present statute defective on equal protection principles, we likewise do not consider whether a statute barring all residential picketing regardless of its subject matter would violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. "</text>
            <text syncTime="286.416" offset="1281768">And so that situation then is now a situation that is squarely before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.741" offset="1307055">Because we do have an ordinance that prohibits all residential picketing without the labor exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.519" offset="1346134">The fact situation that gave rise to the adoption of these two ordinances was a period of picketing of approximately three weeks that had been conducted by the Appellees and their associates before the home of one Dr. Benjamin Victoria, a resident of the Town of Brookfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.775" offset="1447175">The purpose of the picketing was to denounce him as an abortionist and as a killer of babies.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.989" offset="1472044">The town board had no desire to get involved in this debate.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.857" offset="1871509">Mr. Fuhrman, we are reviewing, I guess, the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.305" offset="1913304">So is our standard of review whether the lower court abused its discretion in the issuance of the injunction?</text>

            <text syncTime="456.378" offset="1961579">And I would like to point out perhaps at this point that although the order of the District Court is in form a preliminary injunction, actually however, it has finally decided the constitutional issue involved, at least from the standpoint of the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.213" offset="2052903">Let me explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.633" offset="2066591">The preliminary injunction so-called said that it would become final in the event that there were no requests for a trial, number one, by any party; and number two, that an appeal would be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.327" offset="2149347">So to protect the interests of the Town of Brookfield, we did appeal and we did file a request for a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.885" offset="2191665">But it is clear from a reading of the order that the Court had already determined that it would be unnecessary to have an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.070" offset="2236387">And there were two reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.600" offset="2250493">Number one, it was stipulated by both parties that an evidentiary hearing was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.987" offset="2275989">And number two, the way in which this ordinance was attacked by the Plaintiffs was not in a factual context at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.075" offset="2336384">They attacked it facially before it ever had an opportunity to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.603" offset="2358535">Shortly after the ordinance was adopted, there was a request for the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.632" offset="2390614">And so this particular ordinance has yet to be enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1923.629" offset="7830562">Before this Court today is an attempted appeal from an order affirming a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.534" offset="7858251">There is no finality, no ultimate determination on the merits of the constitutional issue, and therefore no appeal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.982" offset="7892002">In light of the preliminary nature of the case, this case may well be more appropriately handled by way of summary affirmance rather than a comprehensive review of the town's claims, claims which we contend lack support in either the record nor the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.632" offset="7962637">The town's case rests fundamentally upon a challenge of two basic premises of First Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.551" offset="7990326">That streets are quintessential public fora; and that picketing, a legitimate peaceful forum of First Amendment expression is to be permitted in such public fora areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.591" offset="8050408">The District Court, we contend and we believe, did not abuse its discretion in determining that the picketers were likely to prevail on the merits of their First Amendment claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1999.864" offset="8135567">The District Court's opinion indicated that based upon the facts that are currently in the record that there were sufficient facts to grant the preliminary injunction and in fact to grant a final injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.561" offset="8190320">We believe that this is in fact an appropriate determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.279" offset="8209233">Because based upon the normal assumptions that are normally made about streets, that they are normally public fora, and also based upon the normal conclusion that picketing is a legitimate form of expression, just based upon the facts as developed there, that there would be a sufficient record to make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.693" offset="8278823">However, if other facts are sought to be introduced, such as for example, the question of whether one must move or remain stationary to constitute picketing in the Town of Brookfield, perhaps it may be necessary to go back for a further determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.337" offset="8393448">And if that be the case, then it would seem that this Court may well wish to go ahead with a final decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.303" offset="8421347">However, we would point out that there are a number of facts that the town has asserted in its brief, such as the lack of past use of the streets of the Town of Brookfield for picketing, which are not currently in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.407" offset="8481742">So if this Court wishes to rely on such facts, it may be necessary for a further determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.811" offset="8503371">But based upon the facts now in the record, there is in fact evidence sufficient to support a preliminary injunction in favor of the picketers in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3644.466" offset="14713931">What is involved here and what is critical to remember is that this ordinance would prohibit picketing activity where it were friendly or unfriendly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.149" offset="14756668">For example, one under this ordinance could go back and forth in front of Dr. Victoria's house indicating that Dr. Victoria adhered to the finest standards of the medical profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.972" offset="14804002">If one were to do that, under this ordinance, it would be prohibited, under the definition that the town has utilized.</text>

            <text syncTime="3696.523" offset="14922180">The key point here though is that the ordinance sweeps so broadly that it prohibits all of these types of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.097" offset="14956452">And furthermore, the presence of the interest is residential privacy is an interest which must be considered without respect to the content of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.437" offset="14997830">If the town's real interest is in prevention of embarrassment to Dr. Victoria, then such an interest should be appropriately dealt with in other fashions.</text>
