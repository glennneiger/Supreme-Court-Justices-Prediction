            <text syncTime="941.605" offset="3899242">It all came about because of Mississippi case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.641" offset="3911467">The Phillips case in Mississippi, Phillips v. State holds, and I think holds clearly that there is only one option for a defendant in Mississippi against whom the state wishes to use in one fashion or another an out-of-state conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.555" offset="4111043">And so we went to New York, which is where in effect Mississippi law sent us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.709" offset="4135702">And in an adversary proceeding in New York, in which we were opposed at every step of the way by the New York Attorney General's office, except on the issue, the fact issue of whether Mr. Johnson had been advised of his right to appeal in 1963 as to which the Attorney General's Office, doing its job and adhering to ethical principles of the bar, checked it out and found out that he had not, and so advised the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.745" offset="4255865">They opposed any other relief that we sought save resentencing of Mr. Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.232" offset="4281779">Now there is a suggestion in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Mississippi in this case that the Phillips case does not apply in a capital murder case because it arose in the context of habitual offender sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.658" offset="4339457">That is surely not apparent on the face of the Phillips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.978" offset="4364744">And if it ever was even arguable, it is now no longer arguable because in the recent Nixon case we cite in our brief, a November 1987 case in the Mississippi Supreme Court, they make very clear that they do apply it in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.238" offset="4425766">It is not applied in Sam Johnson's case, but it is applied in the case of Mr. Nixon, who was another person on death row in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.778" offset="4459934">Now we urge upon you that that is simply not a permissible way for a state to behave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.682" offset="4487624">The Phillips case was a case we were entitled to rely upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.284" offset="4502043">It told us what to do, and we went and did it, and we went to New York, and we got the very reversal that as it were the Phillips case told us, demanded that we get in New York, and we went back to Mississippi and we urged, as a part of post-conviction relief that we were seeking in Mississippi, that based on full faith and credit principles, that the New York decision should be given effect, and that resentencing should occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.101" offset="4609250">And the Mississippi Supreme Court responded by saying, among other things, that they would not give effect to it because of the "extremely likelihood" that if they were so dependent on out-of-state highest courts to make decisions impacting on their sentencing procedures, that they could have sureness in the sentencing policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.001" offset="4704858">With all respect, they cannot have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.036" offset="4716979">They cannot send us to New York, and then when we obtain the holy grail in New York and bring it back and present it to the Mississippi Supreme Court tell us that that's not enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.644" offset="5695421">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.946" offset="5704616">There were two reasons relied upon primarily by the Mississippi Supreme Court in its opinion denying post-conviction relief; one procedural, one substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.135" offset="5745367">I will advert briefly to each.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.837" offset="5756234">Procedurally, the thrust of the Mississippi opinion was that the issues considered here and argued by me today were not raised before the Mississippi Supreme Court on direct appeal in the action, but only on post-conviction... only at the post-conviction stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.947" offset="5824675">There are answers in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.632" offset="5835333">I would rest at this point in this oral argument on the Phillips case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.618" offset="5851320">We had nothing to say on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.218" offset="5857694">We had been told by the Phillips case that what we were to do was to go to New York, if a New York conviction it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.474" offset="5886742">That was what we did, and it was proper to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.426" offset="5898549">We abided by the procedural rules in effect at the time in Mississippi in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.680" offset="5923627">Substantively, I have been thinking about my not too persuasive answer to you, Mr. Chief Justice, in terms of citing cases from this Court involving Full Faith and Credit which are wholly applicable to the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.488" offset="5978798">Most of the cases that we rely upon in our brief which are close are state cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.308" offset="6002099">The reason for that is that states have, in our view, abided by their obligations under Full Faith and Credit, and have therefore written the basic opinions dealing with the scope of the clause in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.699" offset="6047656">We cited the New York case, the Fairland Dairies case, a California case, Oklahoma case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.203" offset="6073674">We think those cases are correct in their interpretation of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.257" offset="6089870">The closest cases from this Court are close only because they set down general principles about Full Faith and Credit: Millikan v. Meyer, Wisconsin v. Pelican, old cases, Pelican in particular, in terms of the theory of Full Faith and Credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.100" offset="6149220">There is nothing contrary to those state cases that we cite in terms of its articulation of Full Faith and Credit law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.268" offset="6677939">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.322" offset="6702180">I think the case that we are presented for resolution here today is similar to that found in Smith v. Murray that was decided in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.928" offset="6740528">We have to be considered here questions of procedural bar and the questions of what must occur, if anything, when one of several aggravating circumstances is found used in support of a death penalty is later held invalid, and then we have this twist of the Full Faith and Credit argument also added to that particular part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.774" offset="6827986">In Smith, of course, the procedural bar was relied on there, and the Court expressly declined to address the question of what the invalidation of one aggravating circumstance of several would affect... how that would affect the outcome of a sentencing decision there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.873" offset="6920355">We think, though, that the Smith rationale is applicable here, both on the issue of procedural bar as well as the ultimate outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.145" offset="6957449">And just to step to the Full Faith and Credit question a minute in this particular case, what we have is a situation where the Mississippi Supreme Court looked at what New York did and said that it did not, in effect, affect the judgment of the sentence of death in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.011" offset="7048878">The Petitioner amici here would have the Court adopt a rule that it would require an automatic reversal or vacation of a death sentence where an aggravating circumstance is later found invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.520" offset="7110945">This has not occurred in the past from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.507" offset="7130902">The lower courts have held in various cases that this does not result in an automatic reversal; that the court can consider this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.767" offset="7187954">And even without a harmless error analysis on this type thing, the Fifth Circuit in Williams v. Maggio, and Knighton v. Maggio, they only review... in Louisiana, only review one of several if there are several found; they only review one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.385" offset="13138438">I mean the court is not substituting its views for that, or affirming the views of the jury in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.289" offset="13166024">It is addressing a much narrower issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.408" offset="13178458">In Mississippi v. Caldwell, the sort of language used in Justice O'Connor's opinion, for example, was was it so arbitrary that it was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.049" offset="13225060">I mean that's the role of the jury in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.268" offset="13237913">For the state Supreme Court then to engage in the first instance in a weighing process where it has not heard any of the evidence and cannot assess the in-court evidence, I would argue to you, if that was before you, is barred by the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.962" offset="13304682">But I would urge upon you that that question is not before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.681" offset="13319624">There was no reweighing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.449" offset="13326625">The proportionality review, for example, was at the time of the direct appeal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Floyd Abrams</label>
            <text syncTime="3304.620" offset="13351284">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.453" offset="13354628">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.753" offset="13355882">And I would just urge upon you that it is my reading, at least, that they did not engage in that and could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.459" offset="13382736">So in the end then, we would urge upon you that this situation is the question reserved by the court in Zant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.565" offset="13419098">It is not Zant, or Barclay, or Lowenfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.867" offset="13432368">If this were Lowenfield and this sort of information had come before the jury, we might well make the same argument to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.037" offset="13460998">I mean if this were the Lowenfield case itself and the jury in that case had heard evidence pressed by counsel of a reversed conviction, we would be urging upon you that in that type of situation you should reverse, and that's what we urge upon you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.565" offset="13527140">Thank you.</text>
