            <text syncTime="9.799" offset="39184">This case, Coy versus Iowa that comes to us on appeal from the Supreme Court of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.965" offset="63843">The appellant was convicted after a jury trial of two counts of lascivious acts with a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.107" offset="88398">At trial, the State made a motion pursuant to an Iowa statute to place a screen in the courtroom during the testimony of the two complaining witnesses, both of whom were 13-year-old girls.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.013" offset="140016">The trial court allowed the use of the screen, which was positioned between the appellant and the two witnesses, so as to permit appellant to see the witnesses but blocked him from their view.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.688" offset="190694">Appellant argued that the screen violated the Sixth Amendment's guaranty of a face to face confrontation and violated due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.441" offset="221727">The Iowa Supreme Court rejected these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.635" offset="234475">We reversed on Confrontation Clause grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.428" offset="249626">The right to face-to-face confrontation has ancient roots although our opinions have discussed it less frequently than other more complicated aspects of the Confrontation Clause, such as the admissibility of out-of-courts statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.571" offset="306260">But both ancient and modern sources suggest that a face-to-face encounter as the words of the clause suggest is an important element of a fair trial which serves the goal of assuring the integrity of the fact finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.616" offset="366446">Today, we reaffirmed the core meaning of the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.623" offset="390478">It is difficult to imagine a more obvious or damaging violation of the confrontation right than the screen in this case, which was specifically designed to prevent the witnesses from seeing the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.084" offset="432274">We do not decide whether exceptions to the right exist since any exception would require more than the legislatively imposed presumption of trauma that was the sole justification for use of the screen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.247" offset="480967">There was no individualized finding that these witnesses needed special protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.915" offset="499566">We believe that violations of the confrontation right may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and rather than decide whether the error here was harmless, we leave that issue for the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.366" offset="545437">Justice O'Connor, who joins the opinion, has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice White has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.478" offset="565812">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissent in which Chief Justice Rehnquist has joined. Justice Kennedy took no part.</text>
