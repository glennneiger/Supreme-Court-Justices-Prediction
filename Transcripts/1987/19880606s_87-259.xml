            <text syncTime="14.996" offset="59977">In the first case, Lingle against Norge, which comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the petitioner was an employee who was discharged allegedly because she had filed a false workers' compensation claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.240" offset="132911">She had two remedies, one, under her collective-bargaining agreement for recovery for a discharge that violated the agreement and secondly, under the Illinois law that provides a remedy in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.712" offset="194769">The Illinois' suit was removed to the federal court where it was dismissed on the ground that the Illinois claim had been preempted by the existence of the collective-bargaining agreement, which is enforceable pursuant to a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.258" offset="252970">The Court of Appeals affirmed, and for reasons stated in an opinion announced, we reverse and hold that the state-law cause of action is not preempted by the federal remedy she had because it is not necessary to construe the collective-bargaining agreement in order to determine the merits of her state-law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.041" offset="344085">The second case, Meyer against Colorado, comes to us from the United States and our opinion is unanimous in that case.</text>
