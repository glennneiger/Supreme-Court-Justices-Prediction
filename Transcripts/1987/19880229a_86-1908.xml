            <text syncTime="13.083" offset="182435">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.024" offset="198213">The issue in this case is whether State law or Federal law governs the enforceability of a forum selection clause in a contract between two private parties in a suit brought in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.613" offset="260593">A brief history of this case is as follows: Petitioner sued respondents in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.482" offset="300090">Petitioners asserted the State law claims of breach of contract, breach of warranty, fraud and deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.828" offset="329452">Petitioners also asserted a claim against respondents for a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.064" offset="358396">In response to the Complaint, respondents filed a motion to dismiss or transfer based on a forum selection clause contained in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.809" offset="401341">The District Court held that Alabama law, rather than Federal law, governed the enforceability of the forum selection clause and that Alabama refuses to enforce such contractual provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.639" offset="460691">The District Court also expressly held that an Alabama forum was as convenient as a New York forum if not more convenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.436" offset="503846">The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals accepted an interlocutory appeal over the forum selection clause issue pursuant to Section 1292(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="104.552" offset="548358">The Court ultimately sitting en banc fashioned a wholly judge made rule in favor of contractual forum selection clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.811" offset="589423">There were five dissenters in the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.692" offset="600917">It is undisputed in this case that the contractual provision before the Court today is absolutely unenforceable in an Alabama State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.900" offset="649713">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.352" offset="659535">The question in this case is whether a Federal District Court sitting in Alabama should enforce that very same contractual provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.149" offset="702690">That issue and this case can be resolved based solely on the plain language of the Rules of Decision Act and the clear command of the Rules of Decision Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.726" offset="753054">Under the Rules of Decision Act, the Federal Courts are directed to first look to State law for applicable rules of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.963" offset="789939">If there is no Federal law governing the issue before the Court, the Federal Court must use rules drawn from State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.729" offset="833093">On the other hand, if there is a Federal law that addresses the question before the Court, the Federal Court can apply the Federal law, assuming it's constitutional, regardless of the displacement of State law which results.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.429" offset="891816">The plain language of the Act is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.410" offset="903728">Except where a Federal law otherwise provides or requires, the Federal Courts are required to apply State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.866" offset="933612">In this case, there is no Federal law addressing the enforceability of contractual forum selection clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.453" offset="971960">Nor has Congress expressed a policy either way on the enforceability of forum selection clauses.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.020" offset="1646232">Well, I don't think it's a question of whether the State law is concerned with what the Federal courts do.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.644" offset="1672668">My answer to your question is that when a Federal court is faced with an issue that is not governed by Federal law, the Federal court should decide the case the same way that a State court sitting in the same State would decide the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.235" offset="1747065">I think that is the plan of the Rules of Decision Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.048" offset="1762321">Alabama's policy against forum selection clauses is an adoption of the common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.265" offset="1799206">Under the common law, the parties to an agreement or contract could not prevent a Court from hearing their dispute, and the common law approach also recognized the interest of the State in providing a local and convenient forum for its residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.637" offset="1880708">As I mentioned, Alabama is the common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.760" offset="1893142">It has no Federal origin, and that being the case, a Federal District Court in Alabama should decide the issue the same way that the State Court would which is it's unenforceable.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.858" offset="1989586">And I don't know that you fully responded to Justice Steven's point that this is just a question whether a Federal District Judge in Alabama will try the case or a Federal District Judge in New York will try it.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.268" offset="2051235">But under this Court's decisions in Murphree and Neirbo, language such as the Redwing Carriers case, the Alabama Supreme Court that the parties cannot oust the jurisdiction of a State Court, the Court has considered that language in other cases and has come to the conclusion that when no Federal law otherwise governs, like there was in Hanna, there was a Federal law that governed over the State law, that the District Court should decide the issue the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.030" offset="2182265">Now, obviously, Chief Justice Rehnquist, there are cases in which a Federal law controls over the State law and Hanna v. Plumer is an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.729" offset="2225106">But this case does not involve simply venue, or which court is appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.382" offset="2279650">This case doesn't involve which court is suitable; it involves whether State law or Federal law governs the enforceability of a party's choice between two suitable courts in a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.953" offset="2533978">First, to give effect to a forum selection clause under 1404(a) would mean that you're allowing Federal law to control after you've determined that the Rules of Decision Act says that under State law, the clause is not enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.398" offset="2615689">On the other hand, should the Court believe that the contractual provision should be considered by the Court, it should not be given conclusive effect like respondents ask the Court to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.874" offset="2665635">This Court has repeatedly emphasized that the District Court must retain flexibility in ruling on Section 1404(a) motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.091" offset="2706490">This individualized case by case consideration of convenience and fairness militates against a per se rule such as the one that respondents offer in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.214" offset="6598944">And then I would look, much like the court did in another Alabama case that came to the Court, Burlington Norther v.

            <text syncTime="2066.447" offset="8395960">And the petitioners argue that the Alabama Supreme Court, in the Redwing Carriers case addressed this issue and forecloses it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.475" offset="8444025">And there's no question but in Redwing Carriers, Alabama Supreme Court considered a forum selection clause and elected not to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.681" offset="8480910">But a forum selection clause, when put to a State Court, is a very different question than when that same clause is put to a Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.928" offset="8525841">Put to a State court, it inherently raises questions of jurisdiction because the State doesn't have a power, a method, a 1404(a) to transfer a case any place else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.810" offset="8589370">When the clause is put to a Federal court, it is solely a question of venue which among several places where venue is proper under 1391, should this case be heard in the interest of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.699" offset="8648930">And the Alabama Supreme Court recognized that distinction in the Redwing Carriers opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.362" offset="8671604">Because they held that they would not enforce agreements that served to oust the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.478" offset="8704100">Now, the analysis on this seems to me to be much like the analysis that this Court went through in Byrd v. Blue Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.646" offset="8752688">In Byrd, the question came from South Carolina of whether or not the South Carolina practice of submitting the issue of the plaintiff's employment by the defendant to the Judge, rather than a jury, would be binding in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.989" offset="8822069">And rather than just blindly following the South Carolina practice of submitting that issue to the Judge, this Court analyzed the reasons for the South Carolina policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.751" offset="8881106">And the South Carolina policy was related directly to the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.925" offset="8913811">And the fact that that issue typically was a jurisdictional issue connected with reviewing the judgments of the South Carolina Industrial Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.842" offset="8957488">Finding that that State interest simply missed the mark in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.677" offset="8984864">Had no place in a Federal court analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.541" offset="9000329">This Court applied a Federal Rule, or allowed the Federal court to submit the question to the jury, rather than a judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.767" offset="10493174">The difference in this case and that is it's not like the statute of limitations in York, or it's not like res judicata principles that the Court considered in Angel v. Bullington.</text>

            <text syncTime="2987.651" offset="12080792">But the venue selection clause ought to be given a presumption of correctness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.885" offset="12105661">In another case, Justice Blackmun's going to point out we left out of our brief, Mitsubishi Motors v. Solar Chrysler Plymouth, the citation of which I have that one written down, is 473 U.S. 614.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.908" offset="12177759">And the reason I thought he'd call that to my attention is because he wrote the opinion, the Court indicated that the Bremen and Scherk established a strong presumption in favor of enforcement of freely negotiated contractual choice of forum provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.969" offset="12254037">And that's the presumption I'm talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.509" offset="12264172">There could be a set of circumstances, there could be a set of facts where it's unreasonable under the circumstances to enforce the provision, but that would be within the discretion of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.018" offset="12366259">Under the Bremen and Scherk and other cases like that, the essential test has been put that the burden is on the party trying to avoid the freely negotiated bargain to prove that they would be affectively deprived of their day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.090" offset="12446507">The burden is on the side trying to get out of the contract, get out of their deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.363" offset="12467614">And that burden simply has not been met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.866" offset="12489557">The district court's finding that I alluded to earlier that the Alabama forum is no less convenient than a New York forum in fact tends to prove the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.225" offset="12531039">But specifically, what the Court had to consider in this case was the nature of the Stewart organization, the plaintiff below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.471" offset="12568028">The Stewart organization is controlled principally by two individuals, Walter Stewart, who is a professional accountant, Jim Snow who is a professional accountant, both of whom are senior partners in a Birmingham based accounting firm, both who have had a run a number of businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.822" offset="12645455">Mr. Stewart has had great success in taking businesses that were not doing well and turning them around, and making them do better, which led to the panel in the Eleventh Circuit referring to him as the man with the midas touch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.531" offset="12704283">There simply is no showing that Mr. Stewart has been taken advantage of by Ricoh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.988" offset="12734063">In fact, what he says to justify avoiding his bargain is, I didn't read the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.713" offset="12764992">They put it to me and they told me I had to sign it, they weren't going to change it, and I didn't read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.699" offset="12792890">But that's no excuse for a person who is in that position who is dealing in that kind of businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.665" offset="12828835">Compare it to the Szukhents in the Szukhent v. National Equipment Rental case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.171" offset="12858823">The Szukhents were farmers in Michigan who needed a piece of farm equipment to do their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.627" offset="12892678">And they entered into a contract to rent that equipment from a New York company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.279" offset="12911277">That contract appointed a lady by the name Florence Weinberg as their agent to receive service process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.594" offset="12940534">They'd never met her.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.505" offset="12944192">They didn't know that that provision was in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.029" offset="12954223">They had no dealings with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.849" offset="12961537">They were as surprised as anybody when they received the summons and complaint in the mail from Ms. Weinberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.373" offset="12983584">But the Court held the Szukhents to that bargain, and there certainly is no basis in this record to excuse the Stewart organization from their bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.240" offset="13031127">There is nothing about the Court's holding in Erie v. Tompkins that prevents the enforcement of the parties agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.607" offset="13064564">And we ask that the Eleventh Circuit opinion be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.339" offset="13195490">It's been settled since April 25, 1938, that the mere vesting of jurisdiction in Federal Courts does not give rise to authority to fashion Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.266" offset="13239166">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.629" offset="13252646">If it's controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.850" offset="13257557">If the issue before the Federal Court is controlled by Federal law or policy, sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.375" offset="13275633">You fashion Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.375" offset="13283679">But when the issue before the Court is not governed by a Federal law or policy, the Federal court should decide that issue the same way that a State court sitting in the same State would decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.761" offset="13329132">The second point that respondents make is that the forum selection clause in this case is basically a question of venue and procedural and therefore Federal law governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.691" offset="13380854">They're wrong on that claim because of the reasons stated in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.675" offset="13404887">Justice Blackmun, with respect to the Burlington Northern Railroad case and with respect to the Byrd case, there was a direct conflict in Burlington Northern between Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and the Alabama Ten Percent Penalty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.578" offset="13484404">The Court held that Federal law governed, obviously correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.461" offset="13499973">When Federal law governs, it controls over state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.873" offset="13513661">In Byrd, the Court said three times in the opinion that Federal law decided whether a judge or jury would hear the case under the "influence" if not the command of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.032" offset="13570294">All of these cases that the Court has decided in this area can be analyzed under the Rules of Decision Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.546" offset="13600283">The question of whether a forum selection clause should be given effect under Section 1404(a) is really not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.106" offset="13646572">They did not appeal on the 1404(a) issue only on the forum selection clause issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.908" offset="13665798">And we submit that the Court need not reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.680" offset="13680845">Should the Court decide to so do, however, we think that it would be appropriate to remand that question to the District Court for further findings on the interest of justice analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.309" offset="13735388">Again, respondents want to have a per se rule in favor of forum selection clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.793" offset="13761302">There's a great disparity in bargaining power, and their arguments in the venue statute simply cannot bear the weight that they wish to place on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.671" offset="13804874">Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has any further questions, I don't have anything else to say.</text>
