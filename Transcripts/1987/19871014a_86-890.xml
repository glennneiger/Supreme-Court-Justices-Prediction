            <text syncTime="119.049" offset="614827">The petitioners executed a search warrant issued by Judge Lenox, an assignment judge in New Jersey who supervises the state grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.747" offset="657563">At the time of the execution of the search warrant there was a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.470" offset="680447">The plaintiffs claimed that the state was not leaving an adequate inventory to explain what had been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.006" offset="714615">And the plaintiffs accordingly telephoned Judge Lenox and obtained from Judge Lenox an order that all of the evidence that was being taken should be sealed in evidence boxes pending judicial resolution of the inventory problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.994" offset="770621">Also at the time of the execution the state issued three state grand jury subpoenas upon the plaintiffs, two of which the plaintiffs complied with, and a third of which and also a fourth subpoena which was issued later, the plaintiffs successfully moved to quash, again before Judge Lenox.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.850" offset="857975">At a later date in an attempt to resolve the inventory dispute the plaintiffs came to the division of Criminal Justice in Trenton, went through the evidence with a court reporter to take an inventory, and in the process of doing this came upon evidence which the plaintiffs claim was being retained illegally by the state in that their Fourth Amendment or attorney-client privileges or work product privileges were being violated, and accordingly, in view of their complaint, the state again resealed this evidence, not the entirety of it but just three boxes of it pending judicial resolution of this question which the state sought by an order to show cause again before Judge Lenox compelling the plaintiff to explain why this resealed evidence should not be unsealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.253" offset="1075627">At that proceeding the plaintiffs relied upon attorney client and work product privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.968" offset="1098510">The plaintiffs filed suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.939" offset="1110422">They did so after the motion to quash and after the first partial unsealing but before the show cause order.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.386" offset="1156189">The District Court in viewing these proceedings concluded that with respect to the equity portion of the lawsuit, that is, with respect to the plaintiff's claim for an injunction for the return of property, that these proceedings showed that the Younger abstention doctrine should apply, and accordingly the District Court dismissed the equity portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.894" offset="1258171">With respect to the damages portion, the court concluded that the pendency of the damages action would substantially impede the state's criminal investigation, and it also dismissed this portion of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.514" offset="1316685">The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.147" offset="1335180">The Third Circuit in viewing these proceedings concluded that the District Court erred, concluding that these proceedings were not adequate to invoke the Younger abstention doctrine, and remanded the matter to the District Court for a hearing on the merits of the plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.698" offset="1409367">With respect to the damages portion, the Third Circuit concluded that even if the Younger abstention were applicable, the District Court would have no discretion to dismiss and it would only be allowed to stay the damages claim pending the Younger absention proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.611" offset="1485018">We submit that the Third Circuit erred--</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.787" offset="5917789">If the stay is not mandatory, these plaintiffs will be continually coming back, asking for a lifting of the stay, which will involve the federal judge in looking into the grand jury process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.405" offset="13052247">He was the issuing magistrate or the issuing judge, but the chronology is important, Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.160" offset="13079206">This case was started before the state filed an ex parte order to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.605" offset="13105015">There was no proceeding pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.036" offset="13114732">There was no state proceeding pending when this complaint was filed, so if this Court were to look at where we were on December 27th, 1984, when this complaint was filed, there were no state proceedings pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.744" offset="13165619">The state proceeding came, and I wrote it down, but it is some time in February or March of 1985, by virtue of an order to show cause that the state brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.491" offset="13208564">They brought it, and then, of course, let that order to show cause sit there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.675" offset="13225283">We argue to you reason tells us that they did that so that they could have created a proceeding that they could go to the federal court and say, oh, look, there is a proceeding in New Jersey on some of these same matters, so you ought to throw these plaintiffs out of the Federal District Court because they, despite the urging of Judqe Lenox, for over a year they did absolutely nothing with the order to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.869" offset="13326115">Nothing occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.482" offset="13332594">It just sat there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.263" offset="13335624">And then when something happened we wrote to Judge Lenox, and Judge Lenox said this case is deemed withdrawn because of this hiatus and this inaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.890" offset="13386197">So that while they were bound and determined to get this order to show cause, certainly the state showed not so great diligence on following up on the order to show cause, although they obviously pointed to it at every stage in the federal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.589" offset="13436979">Finally, Justices, let me say that the Potomac case, the Potomac Electric Company case, juxtaposed to our case, I think amply demonstrates what the true differences are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.572" offset="13508868">In that case the plaintiff sought to have declared unconstitutional the underlying statutes with which they were threatened an indictment, and they sought to have... essentially affect the investigation by having the statute it was based on declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.989" offset="13602595">Not so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.147" offset="13607193">In our case we did not do that, and that is the difference, because if there was an... if you consider the grand jury to be an ongoing state proceeding, we would argue to the Court that it is not an ongoing state judicial proceeding, and that there is no certainty that Potomac Electric would have forgotten to argue its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.019" offset="13686709">Indeed, since there was no indictment, what we argue indeed came true in Potomac Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.114" offset="13711056">They never got to be able to argue the constitutionality of the ongoing statute because there was no indictment, but in our case that is not what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.853" offset="13754001">We are not challenging that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.083" offset="13762987">We are not challenging any statute, and therefore we are in a different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.387" offset="13784198">We are in a position where there is absolutely no adequate forum in the state court by virtue of an ongoing proceeding even if there is an indictment.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3441.857" offset="13906034">Thank you, Mr. Fitzpatrick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.469" offset="13924528">Mr. Etzweiler, you have four minutes remaining.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="larry_r_etzweiler" startTime="3449.351" stopTime="3703.908">
            <label>Mr. Larry R. Etzweiler</label>
            <text syncTime="3449.351" offset="13936022">With respect to the mootness question, and it is particularly with respect to the mootness of the question whether state grand jury proceedings are judicial proceedings for the purposes of the Younger abstention doctrine, this is certainly a case which is capable of repetition but evasive of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.167" offset="14027242">This Court has before it two cases, the PEPCO versus Sachs case out of the Fourth Circuit, it has this case out of the Third Circuit holding directly conflicting theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.035" offset="14078755">In the PEPCO case the grand jury chose not to return an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.018" offset="14094638">In this case the grand jury chose to return an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.879" offset="14110102">It is very likely every time this issue arises in the Third Circuit by the time it gets to this Court, even in a very complex case as of this nature in which the grand jury pleadings were extensive, one status or the other is going to arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.721" offset="14177498">Therefore, it would be a basis of review... evasive of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.772" offset="14193694">It is certainly capable of repetition in this case because there are grand jury proceedings outstanding with respect to the plaintiffs because these plaintiffs may again have a search warrant or other proceedings in the course of those grand jury proceedings because these plaintiffs have agreed to abandon their injunctive claim with respect to this indictment but they haven't agreed to abandon these claims with respect to any future criminal proceedings which may ensue and which currently are under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.574" offset="14308946">Also, what we are reviewing here is the propriety of the District Court opinion in which a dismissal was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.068" offset="14342905">That dismissal was premised in part upon the facts as existed at the time it entered its judgment, and it was premised in part upon its conclusion that Younger applied by virtue of the ongoing grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.698" offset="14401420">To review that judgment and to review whether that dismissal was proper requires an adjudication of the first question which we have raised, that is, whether the grand jury proceedings are state proceedings for purposes of the Younger abstention doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.017" offset="14458680">That is with respect to mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.979" offset="14470487">With respect to when the state proceedings were started and with respect to part of what my opponent here was saying in his argument, we submit that the proceedings, the state proceedings were started first of all with Mr. Fitzpatrick's telephone call to Judge Lenox seeking the sealing order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.164" offset="14559304">They may have been started earlier with the Judge's issuing of a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.776" offset="14577694">In our last brief filed in this matter we made some comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.070" offset="14598905">A search warrant is very much like an ex parte writ of attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.534" offset="14616773">State officials go to a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.835" offset="14625968">They submit an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.126" offset="14635163">They get an order which is called a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.007" offset="14642687">That allows them to go and take property, and to retain that property until such time as the plaintiffs come into Court in New Jersey under a Rule 357 motion explaining why the state should not retain that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.554" offset="14692842">That is very much like an ex parte writ of attachment which this Court, I think, in Trainor versus Hernandez found sufficient for a state ongoing proceeding, so we dispute the proceedings in this case started at the late date which my opponent says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.014" offset="14750625">We submit they started much earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.047" offset="14758775">Third, with respect to the question whether these plaintiffs are seeking to enjoin the grand jury, I want to point out, first of all, the Perez versus Ledesma case, which... the Third Circuit had no problem with this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.719" offset="14845501">They agreed taking documents away from a grand jury investigation which would substantially interfere with these proceedings, and they partially relied upon case law from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.948" offset="14894403">I think if you look at Perez versus Ledesma you will find, that was one of the companion cases to Younger, that in this case this Court held that the District Court's adjudication that Texas officials had to return property was a substantial interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.437" offset="14952394">Thank you.</text>
