            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">In the case of Kadrmas versus Dickinson Public Schools, it comes to us on appeal from the Supreme Court of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.378" offset="37512">Under the statutes of that State, some local school districts are required to provide free school bus service for their students.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.919" offset="67605">Other districts are given the option of providing transportation to school and they may impose a user fee on families who take advantage of the bus service if it is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.801" offset="111177">Appellants or a school child and her mother who live in a district that imposes a user fee covering part of the school bus service.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.298" offset="145136">This family whose resources put it at or near the official poverty level refused to pay the user fee and the child was denied access to the school bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.983" offset="187873">The family thereafter arranged for private transportation and the appellant sued the school district in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.952" offset="215771">This law suit which sought an injunction prevent the school district from collecting any fee for the bus service, raised two federal claims that are at issue in the -- in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.444" offset="257776">The appellants argued that the bus fee violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it discriminates against the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.041" offset="292153">Second, the appellants argue that the state statutes violate equal protection because they irrationally allow some school districts but not others to impose user fees for the bus service.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.901" offset="343562">The North Dakota courts dismissed the suit on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.187" offset="360699">In an opinion filed to day, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.035" offset="376059">We hold that the Equal Protection Clause does not require strict scrutiny in this case because poverty does not define a suspect class and education is not a fundamental right within the meaning of our prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.493" offset="433946">We therefore test the state laws by asking whether they have irrational relation to a legitimate government objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.565" offset="462158">For reasons explained in the opinion, we hold that the user fee is rationally related to a legitimate objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.118" offset="492460">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Brennan has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.002" offset="512000">Justice Stevens has also filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun has joined.</text>
