            <text syncTime="9.336" offset="37303">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and requires that we consider Section 455 of the Judicial Code, which deals with the disqualification of federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.148" offset="96549">Subsection (a) of that section requires that a judge disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.577" offset="134269">Applying this standard, we conclude today, as did the Court of Appeals, that a violation of 455(a) is established if a reasonable person, knowing the relevant facts would expect that the presiding judge knew of circumstances creating an appearance of partiality regardless of whether or not the judge was actually conscious of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.802" offset="223190">The relevant inquiry under subsection (a) is not whether or not the judge was actually biased but whether he or she appeared biased.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.274" offset="261016">We also agree with the Court of Appeals that on the facts of this case, it was appropriate to vacate the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.746" offset="290900">Accordingly, where reason spelled out in an opinion we filed with the clerk, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.288" offset="317127">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice White and Justice Scalia joined and Justice O'Connor has filed a separate dissenting opinion.</text>
