            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="9.377" offset="37407">Well, this case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.607" offset="58410">It concerns the Federal Speedy Trial Act of 1974, which requires that an indictment be dismissed if the defendant is not brought to trial within a 70-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.732" offset="114834">The dismissal is with or without prejudice depending on the trial court's consideration of certain statutory factors such as the seriousness of the offense, the circumstances that led to the dismissal, and the impact of reprosecution on the administration of the Act and of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.632" offset="198426">This respondent failed to appear for his trial on federal narcotics charges and the trial was scheduled to be held just one day prior to the expiration of the 70-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.883" offset="251507">Fifteen days not otherwise excludable, elapsed between his arrest in California and the issuance by a grand jury in Seattle of a superseding indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.989" offset="299886">Respondent's return to Seattle was delayed for various reasons including the Government's sole processing and arrangements for transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.533" offset="338129">The District Court dismissed with prejudice, finding that what it called the Government's “lackadaisical attitude” was inexcusable and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.356" offset="393404">In an opinion filed today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.498" offset="405943">The Act establishes a framework which guides a District Court's determination as to whether to dismiss with or without prejudice and Appellate Court review of such determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.639" offset="454531">And we conclude that on this record, the District Court abused its discretion in deciding to bar reprosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.159" offset="492565">It did not explain how it factored in the seriousness of the offense with which the respondent was charged and also seemingly ignored was respondent's own illicit contribution to -- or in his failure to appear for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.714" offset="558811">Justice White has joined the opinion but has filed a concurring statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.256" offset="576993">Justice Scalia has joined the opinion except its part 2(a) and has filed an opinion concurring in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.193" offset="612728">And Justice Stevens with whom Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall have joined have filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
