            <text syncTime="36.444" offset="268483">The Board has in certain cases including this one power to review the procedures followed by the employing agency in denying a clearance but there has been no challenge to the procedures followed by the Navy in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="79.484" offset="440578">The security investigation disclosed a history of incidents involving firearms, alcohol and violent behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.428" offset="472343">After giving respondent notice and an opportunity to respond, the Naval Systems Personnel Command in Washington, D.C. denied the clearance, and the Trident facility in the State of Washington removed respondent from the job for cause for failure to meet one of the job's requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.204" offset="559487">Respondent petitioned the Merit Systems Protection Board for a review.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.987" offset="654573">The Board reversed its presiding official and sustained the removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.772" offset="673799">It ruled that in an appeal from a removal for lack of a required security clearance, the agency must satisfy the Board that the position in question required a clearance, that the clearance was denied or revoked, and that the agency afforded the employee procedural due process in connection with the clearance determination, which it specifically found the agency had done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.546" offset="772856">But the Board said... and I'm quoting again...</text>
            <text syncTime="166.069" offset="786962">"it has no authority to review the agency's stated reasons for the clearance determination. "</text>
            <text syncTime="171.575" offset="809009">We think the Board got it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.607" offset="821130">Let me begin by disposing I hope of the argument that due process requires a hearing on the merits before the MSPB on the security clearance determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.344" offset="868046">I want to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.164" offset="875360">The first is that there simply is no due process question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.308" offset="899915">Respondent was given notice of the Navy's intent to deny his clearance, and a full statement of reasons and an opportunity to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.074" offset="934919">His response, with the assistance of his union, did not challenge any fact in the Navy's statement, he did not ask to confront or cross examine anyone or to be heard further by the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.943" offset="982462">When he sought review by the MSPB, he did not challenge the adequacy of the Navy's processes, and although the presiding official was willing to hear him on the merits of the clearance determination, he twice failed to respond to the Board's notice that a hearing would be convened at his request.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.146" offset="1059262">The only thing he has placed in issue in this case is the Navy's judgment, based on the results of the investigation, that a clearance should be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.796" offset="1105864">Second and more generally, it is the employing agency that must given an employee whatever process is due in connection with the denial of a clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.862" offset="1154139">Where the employee does contend that the employing agency has not given him an adequate opportunity to be heard, the MSPB's job, is it itself said, to rule on the adequacy of the agency's process.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.393" offset="1212235">The MSPB's decision is of course subject to review by the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.705" offset="1229476">But the Constitution does not require or authorize the MSPB to take upon itself the process of hearing and deciding the merits of the clearance question.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.453" offset="1276496">Nor, we think, does the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.567" offset="1300947">And I want to turn to the question whether 5 U.S.C. 7513 gives the MSPB power to review denial of Mr. Egan's clearance on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.557" offset="1348908">The first thing I want to say is that the Board's answer that it can review procedures but not substance, seems to us the most plausible reading of the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.514" offset="1400735">Everyone agrees that Mr. Egan had a right to be removed only for cause under section 7513, and the right to appeal his removal to the MSPB.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.905" offset="1462279">Everyone also agrees that the MSPB has no general jurisdiction to review the denial of a security clearance as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.414" offset="1512330">For example, an employee who loses a promotion or an employee who is simply transferred to a different job, or who doesn't get access to a particular part of the facility because he isn't given a security clearance has no MSPB review because there's nothing for the Board's jurisdiction to attach to.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.206" offset="1591533">The Board said in essence that if an agency fails to follow the proper procedures so that there has been no valid security clearance determination, then there is no cause for the removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.236" offset="1651615">But if the agency has followed proper procedures, and has reached a determination denying a clearance, then nothing in the statute gives the Board the right to reverse the clearance determination, or disregard it, just because the agency has not persuaded the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.918" offset="1730296">In addition to thinking that this is the most plausible reading of the statute, we have two--</text>

            <text syncTime="711.198" offset="2967455">The Civil Service Commission did not review security clearance determinations by employing agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.450" offset="2992428">The MSPB generally inherited the CSC's review powers, and there's simply no evidence that Congress intended to give the MSPB larger powers in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.277" offset="3031820">The other, which I think explains why the Civil Service Commission did not review clearance determinations is that outside review of the merits of clearance determinations by a defense agency is functionally inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.426" offset="3088349">The Navy should, after affording an employee an adequate chance to be heard, have the final say about whether it trusts him on board one of its submarines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.356" offset="4260098">The question in this case is not whether Mr. Egan has done something to deserve being barred from working at Bremerton, but whether there is an unacceptable risk that he would compromise sensitive information either deliberately or inadvertently or under compulsion for some reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.137" offset="4323210">That is a judgment that can only be made by people who are expert in the aspects of human behavior that render individuals vulnerable to espionage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1072.781" offset="4413802">To decide whether a particular individual should be cleared for access to work at a particular place, he may have to know something about the information to which that job would give him access.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.613" offset="4881081">We think it has little or no bearing on the present issue first because it's clear that an employee who does not obtain a security clearance that is a valid requirement of his job can be removed for cause, like an employee who fails to meet any other requirement without invoking 7532.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.827" offset="4965927">Essentially, everyone involved in this case agrees on that, although our papers note that the District of Columbia Circuit later disagreed in a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.193" offset="5003438">But the existence of 7532 has nothing to do, we think, with whether Congress has authorized MSBP review of the merits of security clearance determinations in cases where that emergency section is not invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.848" offset="5090060">7532 does expressly provide for some kind of a hearing by the employing agency, and in non-7532 cases where the adequacy of the agency process is put at issue, I suppose 7532 might have some bearing by way of analogy on that question of employing agency process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.643" offset="5181280">But it does not, it seems to me, suggest that the MSPB should in such a case take it on itself to review the merits of the agency's clearance organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.978" offset="6502553">In listening to the arguments presented by the Navy in this case, I've tried to come up with a way that I could possibly describe them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.006" offset="6542678">And I think that we start out with the same premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.539" offset="6556784">We start out with the premise that this is a case that involves statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.871" offset="6578204">It's at that point that the government seems to walk away from that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.336" offset="6604013">What they seem to do in my view is to start building a cloud around the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.272" offset="6627732">They start building this cloud and they call it national security, and as their argument progresses down through their argument in their brief, the cloud gets darker and darker and darker, so that by the time we get to the end, we can't see the statute anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.922" offset="6702338">What we see is this cloud called national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.377" offset="6720206">I am not here to argue that national security is not important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.829" offset="6741940">I am not here to take a position in this case that would limit agencies' ability to maintain and protect national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.847" offset="6782064">That's obviously something that they've been told to do by the President, and we want them to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.342" offset="6816023">But what I want to do is to look at this statute aside and apart from this cloud for just a moment, and see what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.459" offset="6856460">Not only what the particular statute says that talks about removal for cause... 7513... but also the statute that says you can remove somebody on the basis of national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.541" offset="6920826">I may even take a look at the statute that says that you can remove someone because of poor performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.655" offset="6945277">Because the Civil Service Reform Act created a lot of new things that the Civil Service Commission under the old system didn't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.553" offset="6984878">It created an independent board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, that was to hear these cases separate and apart from agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.029" offset="7022808">Now, when they did that, I believe that Congress was the proper body to take a look at this cloud that's there or take a look at this problem of national security, take a look at this situation where the President has told agencies to make sure you don't compromise security, and come up with a statutory scheme that would not only protect the interest of the employee, but also protect the interest of agencies in a situation such as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.932" offset="7162407">And I believe that they did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.535" offset="7172856">And I would like to talk about these particular statutes for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.287" offset="7191768">7513 is the statute that contains the language that we've heard for years: you can't remove an employee unless it's for cause that would promote the efficiency of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.449" offset="7248506">There is another statute, Chapter 43 of the Act... 4303, I believe, that says now under the new law that you can remove an employee for performance reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.046" offset="7302841">You don't have to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.941" offset="7314439">You just have to show that he hasn't performed up to the level that he's expected to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.202" offset="7339517">Now, taking those two statutes for a minute, the courts have held that an agency can terminate an employee on performance-based reasons under Chapter 7513, that is, for cause, because there might be situations where performance and cause kind of go together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.788" offset="7429796">But the cases have said that if you do that, you are bound by the procedures, you are bound by the burdens of proof, you are bound by all of the other rights that the employee has under 7513.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.518" offset="7492699">You're not bound under the precise procedural problems that are presented under performance based types of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.193" offset="7523419">Now, let me throw into the statutory scheme, 7532.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.668" offset="7549332">It wasn't created by the Civil Service Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.168" offset="7563334">It's been around for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.321" offset="7571902">And what that says is, and what that recognizes is is that under some circumstances, there may be situations when agencies ought to be able to terminate somebody and not have somebody else essentially looking over their shoulder and second guessing that move.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.494" offset="7708679">It allows that person to be taken out of the job and off of the payroll immediately without any prior procedures, and that can be the explanation of it, rather than what you suggest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.677" offset="10213404">Then it has Section 75 which has a different review standard for the MSPB.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.794" offset="10477868">What the Navy has done in this case is that they've really changed the standard under 7513.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.009" offset="10502736">They've changed the standard from one of being clearly consistent with the interest of national security to replace the standard that says you can't fire somebody unless it's for such cause as would promote the efficiency of the Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.338" offset="10564072">So by a two-step process, they have changed the standard under 7513.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.923" offset="10590403">Because that is precisely the same standard as you have in the revocation of the security clearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.602" offset="10705029">And you examined that whether or not a due process interest attached to a security clearance, and I believe... or a liberty interest attached to a security clearance... and the holding was that it did not attach when you didn't get the clearance because of some unspecified reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.627" offset="10793218">But in this case, Mr. Egan is having his clearance taken away for very specified reasons that have been set out and that appear to me to constitute misconduct, which then is bootstrapped, if you will, over into a removal action which this Court has consistently held an employee of his status has a property right in his job, under Arnett v. Kennedy and those other cases that talk about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.630" offset="10929159">So I believe that what the decision does in the MSPB is to convert that standard from 7532 and cause it to be enforced under 7513.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.971" offset="10990599">Clearly, Congress did not intend to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.793" offset="11001884">I think what they intended when they talked about as such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service, was to give the employee who was told that he was going to be fired and specific reasons for his termination, to give the employee the opportunity to cross examine the person or the witnesses that would testify against him, and possibly correct a situation that might be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.599" offset="11113061">He can't do that under the system that is advanced by the Navy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.624" offset="11133123">And I believe that that was what was found objectionable by the Federal Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.563" offset="11188921">And the analogy that comes to my mind is that when this Court was in the same position that the MSPB is in, that is to say, before the 1976 Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act were adopted, we were asked to review, among other things, one of the exemptions to the Act is whether the information was classified in the interests of national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.707" offset="11273453">And we decided that that was not an invitation for us to go into whether the classification was correct or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.302" offset="11299889">We just looked into whether it was classified or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.505" offset="11308666">Now, Congress didn't like that and they therefore provided that we would look into whether it was properly classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.731" offset="11341580">But without saying that, we just didn't go behind the determination that it was classified.</text>
