            <text syncTime="10.106" offset="161387">Mr. Kutcher, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Kutcher</label>
            <text syncTime="12.886" offset="172567">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.995" offset="185002">This case addresses squarely the question of whether in a purely Federal question case arising under the Commodities Act against foreign nationals a Federal Court is bound by the state long arm statute in which it sits in determining whether the foreign national is subject to personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.704" offset="267862">Ancillary to that issue is the question of whether in a private commodities claim there exists the same nationwide service standard as that found in other provisions of the Commodities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.198" offset="329825">The facts of the case are set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.041" offset="341214">They do not need to be repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.650" offset="347588">I do want to point out, however, to the Court that this is one of the so-called "Silver Straddle" cases which was argued in front of the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.536" offset="387190">The Silver Straddle cases involved over 1400 United States taxpayers who, through trading in silver straddles, were attempting to shelter over $100 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.922" offset="432643">The petitioners in this case were among those investors, Rudolf Wolff &amp; Company and James Gourlay were among the London brokers who effected some of the trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.933" offset="480708">Accordingly, there was a substantial participation by not only among these petitioners but about 1400 United States taxpayers, all involved in the same transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.240" offset="525952">The facts of the case present the Court with clear alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.754" offset="544029">Under the Louisiana long arm statute, we have conceded that there are insufficient contacts to maintain this commodities fraud suit against Rudolf Wolff &amp; Company and James Gourlay, one of whom is a British corporation, the other is a national of the United Kingdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.591" offset="611320">However, it has also been determined that if one aggregates their contacts not only with the State of Louisiana, but throughout the United States, then there are sufficient contacts to subject them to suit under the Commodities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.242" offset="665968">The question which is presented here is what standard should this Court apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.382" offset="686553">In essence, Your Honors, this case comes down to the application of Federal Rule Civil Procedure 4(e) and whether that procedural rule imposes a substantive standard on personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.219" offset="745903">We submit that it does not and, as Judge Wisdom pointed out in his dissent in the Fifth Circuit opinion, Rule 4 is nothing more than a procedural rule designed for efficient housekeeping of the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.995" offset="800969">It was never intended nor should it be construed to impose substantive standards of personal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.169" offset="925730">So, in a purely Federal question case, Rule 4(e) wouldn't apply at all if the question is the amenability of the defendant to service?</text>

            <text syncTime="272.016" offset="1209106">And, as you pointed out, the Fifth Amendment due process clause is the basis for personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.421" offset="1230736">So, yes, sir, I think you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.826" offset="1236274">The question is whether or not you can... the manner in which you physically effect that service I think, as Judge Wisdom said in his dissent, is something that can be fashioned on an ad hoc basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.571" offset="1283294">You do not need to have a specific provision in 4(e) to determine all methods of service of process, because Rule 82 and 83 permit the courts to fashion rules which are not inconsistent with the Federal Rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.594" offset="5563405">As the Fifth Circuit has held in several cases, the Federal Courts have never had to fashion a personal jurisdiction basis because your strict venue requirements dictate that you can either bring your action where the plaintiffs reside or the cause of action arose where the defendants reside, depending on whether or not you have got diversity of Federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.132" offset="5645534">And under those circumstances, I think the limitation, if you will, on the power of a Federal District Court stems from the venue provisions and not from the personal jurisdiction basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.970" offset="5692868">And that is the argument which we are asserting: that venue is what is going to limit the hailing of a foreign national, such as Rudolf Wolff &amp; Company, into a court where there wouldn't... where the court may have the personal jurisdiction and it may be constitutional and it may meet traditional notions of fair play, but it simply is not the proper venue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.127" offset="6005501">You look to the basis of the foreign nationals contacts with the entire United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.686" offset="6035699">And this Court has held in at least one case that in terms of foreign relations that this is one country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.261" offset="6070076">It is not 50 separate states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.230" offset="6077913">It is not 50 separate autonomous units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.619" offset="6087526">It is one country with regard to foreign nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.212" offset="6097870">I think that standard applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.977" offset="6104871">And I think it particularly applies in a case of this nature in an action which is a commodities fraud case which was initially filed as a securities fraud claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.380" offset="6146563">The irony is that this lawsuit when it was initially filed, was filed as a securities fraud claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.063" offset="6173207">No dispute that Section 27 permits nationwide service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.077" offset="6189299">Subsequently, the case is amended to include a commodities fraud claim, then it is determined that the commodities remedy is the exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.010" offset="6233080">And, now, all of a sudden, these Petitioners, who when the suit was filed had service of process against Rudolf Wolff &amp; Company and against James Gourlay, all find themselves relegated to the state remedy, the Louisiana state long arm statute to determine whether or not they have got jurisdiction over the foreign nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.048" offset="6317194">They went from no contest as to having it to being relegated to the state claim simply... and the facts, and the underlying facts of causes of action never changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.607" offset="6359408">And under those circumstances, we believe that insofar as this cause of action is concerned that a nationwide national contacts theory should apply and that Rudolf Wolff and James Gourlay have both been found to have national contacts with the United States, although not with the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.723" offset="6451882">And I will reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.320" offset="7794262">So, you were, for a brief period of time at least, subject to the jurisdiction of the Louisiana court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.788" offset="7812130">It's a kind of a puzzle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.662" offset="7823624">I don't know what... they haven't really argued this, but I have to confess I don't quite understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.472" offset="7838879">You don't really want to give that pendant jurisdiction necessarily applies to jurisdiction over the person as well as it applies to jurisdiction over subject matter?</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliot Paskoff</label>
            <text syncTime="1937.845" offset="7872421">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.718" offset="7875869">Part of the second prong of the Petitioners' request to this Court is to ask for an implication of nationwide service of process under the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.333" offset="7990285">Congress has had three separate opportunities within the last 12 years to speak on the subject of nationwide service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.874" offset="8048486">In 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act was enacted and it specifically conferred nationwide service of process under Section 13(a)(1) on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.819" offset="8120270">It similarly conferred nationwide service of process on the sister states' attorney generals under Section 13(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.580" offset="8167291">Nowhere was there a mention that there was a nationwide service of process for private litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.451" offset="8210758">This Court decided Merrill Lynch v. Curran in 1982, holding that a private right of action exists under the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.303" offset="8266243">In 1982, the Futures Trading Act amending the Commodity Exchange Act expressly provided for a private right of action by a private litigant aggrieved under the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.734" offset="8335937">That was the perfect place if Congress had so intended to assert a nationwide service of process clause for private litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.949" offset="8372822">That Act is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.995" offset="8384943">That provision does not provide for nationwide service of process in enforcing private claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.118" offset="8417439">Congressional history with respect to the enactment of Section 25 in 1982 indicates that Congress recognized... the Agricultural Committee of the House stated that Congress does not intend to rely upon private litigants as the policemen of the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.702" offset="8503852">More recently, Congress enacted the Futures Trading Act of 1986 which among other provisions granted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the power to serve extra-territorial subpoenas beyond the United States' territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.805" offset="8580234">In the conference committee report relating to that provision, the conference committee has instructed the Commissioners that prior to the issuance of a pre-complaint investigatory subpoena they must confer with the Department of State in order to meet with representatives of the receiving nation so as not to cause a perception of intrusion on the sovereignty of the receiving nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.073" offset="8717325">It is not surprising in light of the caution and sensitivity expressed by Congress in dealing with aliens under the Commodity Exchange Act that a restrictive scope of personal jurisdiction has been defined because Congress simply cannot restrain private litigants in their dealing with aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.439" offset="8806768">So, we are left with the statutes, the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.141" offset="8825576">It has in some sections grants of nationwide service of process with respect to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and in other sections relating to private action, there is no such language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.635" offset="8879493">This Court has observed in Russello v. United States as a matter of constitutional construction that where Congress includes particular language in one part of the statute but omits that language in another section of the statute, it will be presumed that that omission was intentional and deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.500" offset="8983043">The basic assumption is that Congress knows how to write its statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.277" offset="9006135">I think the likely inference that I draw is that Congress did not intend to grant extra-territorial jurisdiction as a weapon to private litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.429" offset="9054723">For that reason, I would urge this Court to reject the request by the Petitioners to imply a nationwide service of process clause under the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2245.128" offset="9101534">It seems to me that argument would also demonstrate that Congress didn't intend any cause of action to be implied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2250.001" offset="9120969">Your Honor, not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.718" offset="9135911">And the reason... I am quite familiar with your decision in Merrill Lynch v. Curran.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.965" offset="9156914">The Congressional intent relied upon by the majority seemed to want to preserve a private right of action which existed by case law prior to the enactment of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.504" offset="9243013">There was a private right of action by case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.299" offset="9262239">So all that decision does is preserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.250" offset="9281988">Congress did not intend, Congress did not specifically intend to eliminate that private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.654" offset="9303617">When a Federal statute is silent as to a provision for nationwide service of process, Rule 4(e) instructs us how to obtain impersonum jurisdiction over a non-resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.162" offset="9377701">1963, we had 4(e) amended to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.159" offset="9413645">It used the language,</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.626" offset="9423467">"Service of process may be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by the statute or rule of the state where the District Court is sitting. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.342" offset="9462337">The commentators including the reporter to the Advisory Committee in 1963 have indicated that it was the intent to incorporate by reference the state's standard of amenability to personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.020" offset="9541123">There is no other reason to include the language under the circumstances but for to include the state standard of personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.267" offset="9582083">Thus, if Respondents Wolff and Gourlay were amenable to the impersonum jurisdiction of the Louisiana long arm statute, then they would be amenable to the impersonum jurisdiction of the Federal District Court under 4(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.177" offset="9685736">Petitioners concede and this can be found at page 50 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.549" offset="9715203">Petitioners concede and Plaintiffs concede that there is no personal jurisdiction under the Louisiana long arm statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.077" offset="9753341">What concerns me is an implication of nationwide service of process under the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.183" offset="9793779">If that were to be granted today would, by analogy, be applicable to every single Federal question statute which is silent as to service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.787" offset="9836202">I do not believe that that is what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.989" offset="9852920">Mr. Chief Justice, if any Member of the Court has a question for me, I would respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.534" offset="9879147">Otherwise, I will sit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.892" offset="9884581">Thank you, Mr. Paskoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.875" offset="9900463">Mr. Kutcher, you have four minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Kutcher</label>
            <text syncTime="2447.921" offset="9912688">First, I will respond to Justice Stevens' inquiry regarding what happened in the District Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.369" offset="9962530">The District Court judge did find that there existed adequate national contacts based on... for Mr. Rudolf Wolff and Mr. James Gourlay, and held that he had personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.707" offset="10015820">Subsequently, the Fifth Circuit in DeMelo came out and said: You have to look to the state statute under 4(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.986" offset="10044972">And that was when they came back for motion for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.999" offset="10056989">And the District Court judge reversed himself based on the DeMelo decision, but there was no question that the judicial determination after discovery as to the contacts found that there weren't adequate national contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.292" offset="10110174">The national contacts theory in Federal question cases I think has application here and, as Judge Wisdom indicated in dissent, in the appellate court opinion, is something which the court should consider in Federal question cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.393" offset="10182585">Mr. Paskoff's argument that what is going to result are rampant lawsuits everywhere in all Federal question cases ignores what I alluded to in my argument in chief and that is the venue provisions of the United States Code which will limit where litigation can take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.259" offset="10270043">Before 1963, this Court in International Shoe and its successors determined that all that is required is traditional notions of fair play and justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.001" offset="10344963">The argument that a rule of procedure which has been described as a housekeeping rule should somehow control the rights of a Federal litigant in a Federal cause of action in a Federal court is something which places procedure over substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.711" offset="10439839">This is a commodities fraud claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.335" offset="10450393">The exclusive place to bring it is in the United States District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.177" offset="10465753">And the effect of the Fifth Circuit decision is to insulate the foreign aliens from any action in any District Court because they don't have adequate contacts with that particular district, although there is no question that they have contacts with the entire country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.295" offset="10534194">I thank Your Honors for your time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.404" offset="10542657">If you have got any questions, I will be happy to answer them.</text>
