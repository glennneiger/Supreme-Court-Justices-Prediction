            <text syncTime="14.141" offset="196438">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.010" offset="207932">Oklahoma has a statute that grants a defendant in a first degree murder case nine preemptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.048" offset="240010">The issue in this case is whether it's constitutional for a state to take away one of those preemptory challenges during a capital murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.154" offset="280448">The way that this issue came up was when the trial judge made what everybody now agrees was a very serious mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.327" offset="309182">During the jury selection in this case, the trial judge overruled a defense challenge for cause against a juror, Mr. Huling, who said that he would return only a death sentence upon conviction and that he would not consider any possible other penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.205" offset="376683">This juror was plainly unqualified under the Sixth Amendment and even the state now concedes that he was unqualified to sit on the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.275" offset="408970">But once the challenge for cause was overruled, there was only one thing to stop this juror from sitting on this case and that was if one party or the other removed him by a preemptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.250" offset="456827">The way that jury selection proceeded in this case was that the parties used their preemptory challenges in alternation.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.539" offset="485979">One side would use a challenge, they would bring on a replacement juror, and then the other side would use a challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.926" offset="515550">The first party to come up with a preemptory challenge to use, after Mr. Huling was seated, was the state, and what did the state do with its preemptory challenge after Mr. Huling was seated?</text>
            <text syncTime="104.150" offset="556405">They waived it.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.250" offset="560898">They didn't use it on anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.519" offset="565914">They were quite happy to see Mr. Huling sit as a juror in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.637" offset="586394">The state apparently was not interested in correcting with its own preemptory challenges what they now concede to be a rather flagrant error by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.493" offset="621816">They apparently felt it was the better use of the challenge to just waste it.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.230" offset="648774">I think they've conceded that it was wrong, but I thought that, if I recollect their brief correctly, they do make the argument that there was some ambiguity in that juror's responses, that some of his earlier responses were inconsistent with that statement that you quoted.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.268" offset="1204973">Of course, it's part of our argument that even if he had made such a statement, it wouldn't have proved anything because the mistake happened earlier in the jury selection and if the mistake hadn't happened, we could have ended up with a different panel of jurors facing him by the end of jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.945" offset="1263592">So that it just doesn't prove anything and, of course, we're relying on the Gray v. Mississippi case on that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.044" offset="1464004">It would depend on whether the state had a rule that required you to use a preemptory challenge in order to correct the judge's error.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.513" offset="1485947">If there was no such rule, there would be no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.515" offset="1493888">It would just be a tactical question about whether to remove a juror or not use a challenge and then argue on appeal that the juror shouldn't have been seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.804" offset="1523040">So, I think that the constitutional violation depends on the defendant being forced to use a preemptory challenge to remove somebody, be forced to give up a valuable right as a result of a mistake.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.441" offset="1653653">They say preemptory challenges are not to be used until people who are challengeable for cause are removed from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.345" offset="1685209">I think the most you can read into the Oklahoma court decisions is that they have prescribed some kind of procedure for bringing appeals on claims of error based on overruling challenges for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.771" offset="1742991">They haven't said that the right of preemptory challenge is extinguished if the judge happens to make an error in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.544" offset="1774025">In fact, in this case, they seem to say that the right of preemptory challenge... if the defendant had been able to point to somebody objectionable or in another case, they used the expression unacceptable, that was still on the jury, they would have a grant of relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.367" offset="2857375">It turned out really not to have been very effective at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.402" offset="2873467">There was a very real danger of prejudice in the community against my client in this case, and there was a corresponding need for the full complement of preemptory challenges, all nine, to remove prejudiced jurors from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.762" offset="2934907">The defense lawyer in this case unsuccessfully asked for extra preemptory challenges before trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.386" offset="2973359">Although he didn't specifically challenge any of the jurors that actually sat on the case for cause, he did say at the end of jury selection that he did not think that the jury was fair and impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.492" offset="3017871">That's exactly the situation in which preemptory challenges are most valuable.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.460" offset="3229672">It's clear that he didn't want the case tried there, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.662" offset="3238554">That was where it ended up, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.281" offset="3252973">Preemptory challenges are especially important on the question of punishment in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.851" offset="3271259">If even one juror becomes committed to a life sentence during the penalty trial in a death penalty case, the judge has to discharge the jury and return a life sentence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.075" offset="3316190">So, a change of even one juror brought about by a preemptory challenge can change the outcome of a penalty trial in Oklahoma from death to life and, of course, that one juror could lead the jury to a different outcome on the guilt phase of the trial as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.512" offset="3549933">While a change of even one juror could have been critical, it's important to note that one preemptory challenge could have made more difference than just one juror on the final jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.653" offset="3594446">When the judge made his mistake in this case, the parties between them had a total of eight preemptory challenges left and only eight of the actual trial jurors had been seated at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.746" offset="3650871">It's conceivable that if the judge had ruled differently on the challenge for cause, the parties could have been motivated to exercise their preemptories differently in response.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.168" offset="3688487">That's the teaching of Gray v. Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.204" offset="3696637">It's conceivable that the parties could have used their eight remaining challenges to remove the eight actual jurors from the jury and it could have resulted in a completely different jury panel by the end of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.345" offset="3741254">Under the circumstances of this case, the loss of a preemptory challenge was a serious loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.166" offset="3764556">It was one of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.485" offset="3793813">The right to preemptory challenge is, of course, a state-created right, but it's nonetheless an important one.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.845" offset="3855253">It's recognized in every single state and federal jurisdiction as an essential part of jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.516" offset="3885973">When a preemptory challenge is taken away, as here, it's a significant loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.170" offset="3908542">It's like the loss of another kind of state-created right that the Court considered in Evvits v. Lucey, rights to an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.592" offset="3938218">Even though it's created by the state, an appeal can't be taken away after it's given without denying due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.631" offset="3978342">The loss of a preemptory challenge is the same kind of grievous loss that brings the due process clause into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.887" offset="4015436">The decision of this Court that comes closest to the situation here is Hicks v. Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.557" offset="4042080">That case involved another state-created right, the right to jury sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.695" offset="4062665">The defendant in the Hicks case had a right under state law, not under the Constitution, to be sentenced by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.884" offset="4091400">Although there's no constitutional right to be sentenced by a jury, the Court still held the denial of the state-created right to jury sentencing denied due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.322" offset="4133196">The right to jury sentencing in Hicks was important because the jury could return a different sentence than a judge could return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.678" offset="4162557">The right to preemptory challenge is important because one jury can return a different verdict than another jury, and a preemptory challenge is the tool, is the instrument that brings about a change of one jury into a different jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.986" offset="4215847">The right to preemptory challenge should be treated in the same way as the right to jury sentencing in Hicks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.640" offset="4238417">If it's taken away by mistake, by a government official, then there has been a serious deprivation, a denial of due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1287.027" offset="5288017">There's been a loss of a very serious right in that situation, and there's no way to say it's harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.883" offset="5327409">The problem with the state's argument about the defendant really isn't entitled to nine preemptory challenges is unsupported by our statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.052" offset="5356040">The statutes just do not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.338" offset="5365235">They say the defendant is entitled to nine and they don't put any conditions on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.392" offset="5389476">The case law doesn't say that the right to preemptory challenge is extinguished by a trial judge's error either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.546" offset="5414031">In fact, in this case, they said that the defendant's... they certainly didn't say it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.581" offset="5430227">In fact, they seem to suggest if the defendant had followed a little different procedure, one that we say has no meaning under Gray v. Mississippi, they would have granted the reversal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.572" offset="5470142">So, the defense doesn't have to sacrifice its preemptory challenges in order to correct the trial judge's error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.642" offset="5494384">The state is wrong when it says that you're entitled to something less than nine preemptory challenges under Oklahoma law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.213" offset="5520716">The state's other argument is that even if the defendant is entitled to nine preemptory challenges, a trial with eight preemptory challenges doesn't deny what they call fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.703" offset="5574632">The state hasn't been too clear on what... how you judge what is or isn't fundamentally fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.626" offset="5602322">Certainly it doesn't seem fair for my client to be getting eight preemptory challenges in his case while other first degree murder defendants in Oklahoma are getting nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.582" offset="5642237">Presumably, the statutes of Oklahoma are some evidence of what the people of Oklahoma speaking through their legislature regard as fundamentally fair, and those statutes say that the fair number is nine, not eight.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.005" offset="5787896">But instead of focusing on fundamental fairness, a more appropriate inquiry, we submit, is whether the defendant received the process that he was due under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.463" offset="5837738">Since that's what the Fourteenth Amendment says, this Court has said that the law in due process of law includes state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.569" offset="5870129">Just like the law in this case, that require nine preemptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.988" offset="5891759">The defendant was due nine preemptory challenges under Oklahoma's law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.090" offset="5908268">He only received eight of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.376" offset="5917359">If he is imprisoned and executed as a result of a trial which he receives only nine... eight of his nine challenges, the state has deprived him of his life and his liberty without due process of law and that violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.623" offset="5994368">On the question of harmless error, Chapman v. California says that proving a constitutional error is harmless as the burden that's on the beneficiary there, which is the state in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.812" offset="6035119">It also says that the burden is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.863" offset="6051315">We don't have any burden of proof on this issue, but the record gives every indication that the error was, in fact, a harmful one and not a harmless one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.571" offset="6098126">To establish harmless error, there's no dispute that if the defendant had had another preemptory challenge, he could have used it to alter the membership of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.963" offset="6135742">To establish harmless error in this kind of situation, they would either have to show one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.581" offset="6158208">One, that a different jury would have decided the case in the same way, or, two, that even if the defendant had had the full use of all nine of his preemptory challenges, he wouldn't have used them in a way that would have changed the jury's membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.892" offset="6227380">It would be impossible for the state to establish either of those propositions in this case beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.398" offset="6257473">On the question of whether a different jury would have decided the case in the same way, this Court's harmless error decisions in jury selection cases going back a hundred years have never tried to go back and figure out what a different jury would have done in a case, but for a constitutional error in jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.312" offset="6337094">It would be unprecedented for the Court to start doing that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.781" offset="6354962">But even if it did, the evidence in this case was in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.882" offset="6371367">For example, on the question of intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.517" offset="6381920">A different jury could have reached a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.405" offset="6401460">On the question of whether additional preemptories would have been used, if it had been available by the defense attorney, the record shows that he asked for additional preemptories before trial and was denied them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.665" offset="6454541">He used up all the preemptories he had during trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.700" offset="6466662">In view of the fact he told the trial judge that he was dissatisfied with the twelve actually-impanelled juries, there was every reason to believe that if he had had the full use of his nine preemptory challenges, he would have used the one that had to be used on Mr. Huling against another juror and by doing that, he would have changed the jury's membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.411" offset="6541476">There were only two things that he didn't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.446" offset="6553597">He didn't ask for more preemptory challenges after the judge made his mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.648" offset="6570420">That would have been futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.767" offset="6574913">Under Oklahoma law, the judge couldn't increase the number of preemptory challenges for the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.754" offset="6598841">The other thing he didn't do was to say as a hypothetical question that he would have exercised a challenge if he had another one available against some juror that actually sat on the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.062" offset="6648056">But that's the same kind of statement by counsel that the Court considered in Gray v. Mississippi, and the Court said in that case that it had no probative value as to whether an error was harmful or harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.536" offset="6698002">The error in this case occurred in the sixth round.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.255" offset="6712840">That was when the judge made his mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.357" offset="6721303">If the judge had ruled differently in the sixth round, there could have been an entirely different panel by the time the ninth round came around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.879" offset="6755367">So, what counsel did or didn't say about the panel that was left after the ninth round doesn't prove one way or the other what would or wouldn't have happened if the judge hadn't made his mistake in the sixth round.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.604" offset="6806253">The state cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the constitutional error in this case was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.525" offset="6829973">We ask that the judgement of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma be reversed, and I would reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.284" offset="6885039">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.469" offset="6897682">There are three issues presented in this case, and I believe there are three that are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.623" offset="6918371">The first is whether the circumstances of the removal of potential Juror Huling from the panel by a preemptory challenge rather than by a challenge for cause deprived the Petitioner of his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.883" offset="6979393">The second issue that is presented is whether the circumstances of the removal of that potential juror deprived the Petitioner of life or liberty without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.440" offset="7025578">The third question as presented by the Petitioner is if there was a constitutional violation, is that violation harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.046" offset="7068000">The three issues that I think are not present in this case are that this is not a Witherspoon death-prone jury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.418" offset="7101542">This is not a Batson improper-racial exclusion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.187" offset="7116588">And this is not a case in which there is any demonstrable, articulatable bias or prejudice on the jury that actually sat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.210" offset="7148667">As I think is agreed here, trial counsel accepted for cause each and every juror who sat and made no objection to those jurors, but only complained that there were no blacks on the jury and that the Petitioner was, therefore, denied a fair trial by a jury of his peers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.437" offset="7225571">I'd like very briefly to summarize why I believe that the circumstances of this case present no constitutional error, and why this Court should affirm the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.829" offset="7271129">This Court has stated, and I think it appears conceded here, that preemptory challenges in this sort of case are creatures of state law rather than creatures of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.572" offset="7322120">Some members of this Court over the years have sought the complete abolition of preemptory challenges in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.559" offset="7350123">The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution requires a fair trial before an impartial and differently-chosen jury and there is no argument whatsoever that the Petitioner in this case did not receive such a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.918" offset="7407488">There is no allegation here that the judge's error with regard to Juror Huling or potential Juror Huling affected the impartiality of the jury that actually sat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.508" offset="7449911">We believe the Oklahoma statutes in this case do not create a substantial and legitimate expectation of influence, direct influence over the deprivation of life or liberty and, therefore, preemptory challenges as a state right are not constitutionalized by the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.873" offset="7535383">The longstanding Oklahoma law which requires the use of a preemptory challenge to correct a trial judge's error on a challenge for cause is a reasonable and legitimate state rule which benefits both the petitioner or the criminal defendant and the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.585" offset="7610198">The error in this case, as we see it, did not affect a specific constitutional right and, therefore, we are bound by the narrow due process formula of fundamental fairness and that there was nothing about the procedures in the trial court that was fundamentally unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.296" offset="7681042">The trial was fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.246" offset="7684804">Guilt was reliably established beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Petitioner had competent trial counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.966" offset="8531693">The Oklahoma law and the cases cited by the Petitioner and in the Farrell case, which was an Oklahoma case, relied upon by the Court of Criminal Appeals in this opinion, and I think in the Stock case, which I mentioned in the first argument, has long required the use of preemptory challenges to correct an error of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.046" offset="8624062">So, to say what the law in Oklahoma requires based on the statute and ignoring the case law doesn't fully characterize and fairly characterize what the law is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2138.008" offset="8691876">One of them he used to correct what I concede was an error, but that is consistent with the Oklahoma scheme of things and he didn't lose anything that had been granted him thereby nor was there a different rule really imposed in this case than there would be in any other criminal case in Oklahoma in which something similar happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.575" offset="8790201">The Court has said that nothing in the Constitution requires the grant of preemptories, but the trial by impartial jury is what is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.300" offset="8837013">So, I turn my emphasis to looking at whether or not the trial was impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.204" offset="8864702">In Lockhart, this Court said that the Constitution presupposes a jury selected from a fair cross section of the community is impartial, regardless of the mix of individual viewpoints on that jury, so long as the jurors can conscientiously and properly carry out their sworn duty under the law, and the facts of a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.319" offset="8961147">There is no argument whatsoever in this case that the jury that sat in Mr. Ross' trial did not meet that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.043" offset="9003987">There was a potential Witherspoon problem had Mr. Huling been seated, but the use of the preemptory challenge was a self-correcting mechanism that took care of that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.517" offset="9053933">There is no evidence in the record that the trial counsel wanted or needed additional preemptory challenges, and that's significant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.620" offset="9170335">That would have shown, whether he was successful or not, that would have shown the possibility of some problem with that jury, which simply is not there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.929" offset="11427524">In Hicks, this Court said that the Fourteenth Amendment protected the Oklahoma provisions for jury sentencing because the jury directly fixed the terms of the fundamental deprivation of liberty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2851.448" offset="11545597">The Petitioner, I think, in this case, had a substantial and a legitimate expectation to nine preemptories with the traditional caveat of Oklahoma law that if the judge erred on a challenge for cause, you had to use a preemptory to correct that in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.660" offset="11618531">He, of course, received his nine and used them in one case to remove Juror Huling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.497" offset="11645803">I think the use of preemptory challenges is too tangential to the final verdict and sentencing to give a substantial and legitimate expectation of influence over the verdict or deprivation of life or liberty because, of course, there's been no evidence taken, no argument made, no instruction by the Court, no deliberation by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.893" offset="11731380">It's one of the earliest things that happens in a trial, and one error in that case with the law of preemptory challenges, I think, is just too attenuating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.237" offset="11784774">The Petitioner in the brief also relies on the Logan v. Zimmerman Brush case and makes the argument, which has been advanced here, that there's an Oklahoma procedure that deprives him of his right to preemptories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.496" offset="11845796">I think that is based upon the false premise that preemptories have to be in Oklahoma completely free and clear of any interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.470" offset="11889787">As we discussed before, both sides have, there is a state procedure that requires their use to correct errors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.711" offset="11942658">I cited Stock, I think, in the first argument, but unlike the irrational state procedure which in Logan deprived the plaintiff of his right to a cause of action, this rule is a reasonable rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2969.172" offset="12016533">But, General Nance, isn't the reason for the rule... correct me if I'm wrong on this... is that the state wants to be sure that the defendant is not taking advantage of an objection that he really wasn't sincere about, that they really wanted to be sure that juror didn't sit, and, so, they insisted that if they want to rely on the error as a ground for reversal, that they actually have exercised a preemptory to make sure it wasn't just an objection that sort of pro forma to something they really didn't care about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.324" offset="12129173">It seems to me that would make a very sensible rule, and it wouldn't create any problem at all as long as there are plenty of preemptories to go around.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.526" offset="12449956">If, in fact, there is a biased juror or a biased potential juror, to make the defense take him off, and the equality of it is in the other case, as in Gray, I guess, if there was someone who just said adamantly they would never consider the death penalty, and there is a challenge for cause made and not sustained, then the prosecution has to take them off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.878" offset="12567403">The circumstances of that rule could go either way in individual cases, but the rule is the same either way, and the law, of course, benefits the state by making those trials which really ought to be socially significant events as error-free as possible and, therefore, our rule is not the irrational sort of rule the Court condemned in Logan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.362" offset="12669280">On the harmless error question, I think it is clear and I don't hear any argument to the contrary that the error in this case did not affect the truth-seeking function of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.872" offset="12731347">I don't hear any evidence... I hear hints, but I don't hear any serious argument that the error in this trial did not affect any of the non-truth-seeking constitutional values that the court would be interested in, like having racial bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.917" offset="12799475">In Batson, a racially-biased jury may or may not be fair to the defendant, but there are independent constitutional grounds in the Fourteenth Amendment, equal protection clause, that just say we're not going to permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.343" offset="12857258">Whether that jury is in any given case fair or not, we won't permit racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.080" offset="12884216">There's no argument in this case that there was any error in that sort of constitutional value, and unlike in Gray, there was no tribunal impanelled to return a verdict of death, and, so, I think the Petitioner's suggested rule that anything that would change the composition of the jury really doesn't apply because it kind of takes that part of Gray out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.814" offset="12995080">In Gray, there had been a Witherspoon violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.849" offset="13007305">Here, there has not been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.301" offset="13017022">There's been some suggestion now that there was evidence in dispute, particularly about the intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.157" offset="13052445">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.692" offset="13062580">The evidence in this case was that the Petitioner shot a police officer in the head with a 25 calibre pistol at close range three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.334" offset="13105212">I just cannot see any conceivable circumstances in the fact when a man who does that doesn't intend to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.772" offset="13142933">The evidence was that as he left the robbery of a motel, the police officer drove up, he shot the police officer, was arrested in a nearby town half an hour away, half an hour later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.330" offset="13189222">The murder weapon when he was patted down was found in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.949" offset="13203641">The officer's service revolver was found next to the seat where he was sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.334" offset="13217225">The booty from the robbery was in his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.519" offset="13229973">His foot print matched the foot print at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.805" offset="13243034">He was identified as one of the robbers, and after being Mirandized, he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.875" offset="13267380">There is simply no question about the evidence of this man's guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.446" offset="13285666">In the sentencing proceeding, the jury found five aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.734" offset="13322760">This Court has stated that when a person is tried to an impartial jury and has counsel, you can strongly presume that any other error is harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.824" offset="13363197">Counsel suggests that harmless error in jury selection just doesn't work and it would be unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.180" offset="13388588">I, of course, don't want you to find any constitutional error, but I can explain why I think harmless error would apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.369" offset="13425369">That is, because your usual jury selection error occurs because there is some sort of bias that has happened to that jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.142" offset="13460477">Whether it's racial bias or it's bias because of pre-trial publicity or there's bias because people in the jury know the defendant and think he's a rascal or whatever, there is some bias on that jury, and under the harmless error doctrine, you assume there's been an impartial decision-maker or the other kind of jury error is a non-fact-finding/non-biased prejudice-kind of error that's, for instance, based on a race, that the court just says and rightly so won't be tolerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.981" offset="13603733">This Court has previously stated that it should affirm where a finding of guilt is made beyond a reasonable doubt and that everyone is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.936" offset="13647618">The central purpose of the criminal trial is the factual determination of guilt, and it was determined beyond a reasonable doubt unquestionably in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.644" offset="13686384">The Court has stated that it shouldn't reverse for inconsequential errors because that encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and the public to ridicule it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.600" offset="13730270">That would be the precise result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.119" offset="13740301">If there were an initial preliminary error in the jury selection in an otherwise fair trial in which the defendant is clearly guilty, the public would be dumbfounded, I must submit, and would only be caused to disrespect the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.032" offset="13820027">Any error, if it was constitutional, and we think it was not, is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.369" offset="13841342">It didn't affect or abort the trial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.071" offset="13856180">Therefore, for those reasons, we respectfully ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.975" offset="13879795">If you have no further questions, that concludes my presentation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.581" offset="13918142">What the state says, in essence, is that the right to preemptory challenge in Oklahoma is conditioned by the state's right to arbitrarily take those challenges away as a result of mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.456" offset="13961715">Even if that were the rule, it wouldn't be consistent with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.324" offset="13981150">The state may not have to give these challenges in the first place, but once it does, it can't just take them away as a result of mistakes by government officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.299" offset="14021065">It depends upon what you regard the state as having given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.334" offset="14033186">I mean, why can't you regard the state as having said, look, it's often a close call whether a juror should be seated or not, and we don't want to ruin the trials with that, so we're going to give you many more preemptory challenges than we think you need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.879" offset="14111344">But the deal is you get nine but both sides, we're treating you equally, you both have to understand you have to use these when you think the judge has made a mistake in seating a juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.687" offset="14150632">Why is that unfair?</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.191" offset="14184591">It's like the right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.357" offset="14189293">You may not need it in eighty percent of the cases, but if they just take it away arbitrarily, as a mistake, it's still a serious loss.</text>
