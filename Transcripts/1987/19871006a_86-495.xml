            <text syncTime="62.573" offset="378938">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.572" offset="386879">As this Court explained quite clearly in Prestonettes and again in Champion Spark Plug, a trademark owner has the right to prevent other people from applying his mark to their goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.666" offset="451349">But he does not have any right, by virtue of the trademark, to restrict resales of his own goods after he has put them into commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.954" offset="492414">The Treasury Department has, we think, validly interpreted Section 526 of the Tariff Act in accordance with that basic distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.762" offset="539643">It is common ground between the parties that Section 526 protects a U.S. trademark owner against importation of goods bearing his trademark that were manufactured abroad by someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.874" offset="600143">Section 526 responded to the Second Circuit ruling in the Katzel case which had allowed the importation of such goods as non-infringing on the ground that they were genuine in the country they came from.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis R. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="138.102" offset="681018">No, Justice Blackmun, but there has been only a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.108" offset="709021">There is no injunction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.227" offset="721560">The Court of Appeals thought it would not be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.512" offset="734726">The question in this case is whether the statute also does something quite different: whether it gives an enterprise operating in more than one country a right, a continuing right by virtue of the trademark to stop its own goods at the U.S. border after it has sold them abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.144" offset="837230">Nothing in Katzel or the legislative history suggests, and I will argue that it is wholly implausible, that Congress intended any such fundamental change in the nature of a trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.970" offset="888535">And, so, Treasury has long interpreted the section as not barring importation where the U.S. owner itself placed the goods in foreign commerce or in certain functionally similar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.914" offset="956244">COPIAT, Respondents, argue that the plain words of the statute compel exclusion of the goods in those cases, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.739" offset="1007549">But it is altogether proper, we suggest to construe a statute as not encompassing every situation its words might literally reach when that would produce results Congress did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.166" offset="1073273">As the Court said a century ago, a statute making it a crime to hinder a mail carrier in the swift completion of his rounds is quite properly read as if it contained the words except when the mailman has just committed a felony or is about to deliver a bomb.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.386" offset="1202213">The Government's view is that the Court of Appeals was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.826" offset="1235963">Section 1581, if read literally, might confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Court of International Trade, but we think the Court of Appeals was correct in understanding that what Congress was getting at there was actions arising under trade statutes of which this is not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.005" offset="1324675">The Court has often construed statutes more narrowly than the words alone might literally suggest in order to results that Congress did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.332" offset="1386011">I think it is quite implausible that the 1922 Congress intended to change a trademark from an identifying mark only into a partial permanent leash on the goods themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.147" offset="2097273">Those requirements, which are not found elsewhere in trademark law, make sense on our view that Congress was assuming that the U.S. trademark owner and the foreign manufacturer would be two different people and was seeking to protect the trademark owner from the foreign manufacturer's goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.330" offset="2189955">They make, I suggest, no sense those limitations on COPIAT's view that Congress was seeking to change the characteristics of a trademark, to make it broader to bar the flow of all goods bearing its mark, including its own, into the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.290" offset="2565805">But, as far as the explicit language of the statute is concerned, it covers this situation as well as the narrow situation that was immediately before the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.396" offset="2602167">--I have in this case at least the general legal background of the trademark law as asserted by this Court I think in Katzel and the following year in Prestonettes which did not extend... which did not make one of the characteristics of a trademark a right to bar the sale of somebody else's goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.796" offset="2711777">The trademark law says that I can't make a car in my garage and sell it as a Chevrolet.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.127" offset="3017096">We think what 526 and this Court's decision in Katzel did was to say that the mere fact that goods are genuine abroad does not mean that they do not infringe here if there is somebody else in the United States who owns the trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.158" offset="3113227">I take it that COPIAT thinks that 526 means that the trademark owner in the United States has the right to say that goods to which it applied its own trademark in some foreign country are not trademarked in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.393" offset="3222210">I think that... let me say it a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.612" offset="3239033">I think that 526 means that if I own the U.S. trademark and somebody else owns the French trademark for some goods, his goods are infringing here even though they are genuine in France.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.960" offset="3328476">I think it does not mean that if I owned both the U.S. trademark and the French trademark I am entitled to be treated as two different people.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.066" offset="3372884">I think that the limitations in the statute to U.S. owners and to goods of foreign manufacture make no sense on COPIAT's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.527" offset="3434742">If they intended to give all trademark owners such a right to stop their own goods at the border, there would be no reason to require Nikon to form a shell U.S. subsidiary to hold the trademark and, conversely, there would be no reason to require Kodak to build an offshore factory in order to get the protection of Section 526.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.130" offset="3553129">Now, the other thing I will point to is one important episode in the brief legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.783" offset="3583745">It is the Senate discussion of the Pear's Soap hypothetical which suggests that everybody, whether for or against Section 526 was against giving foreign companies the right to restrict the flow of their own goods into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.864" offset="3660127">COPIAT is reduced to suggesting that the sponsors of 526 were wrong in claiming that 526 didn't do what COPIAT would like.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.803" offset="3699833">And the opponents were correct in fearing that it would do what neither they nor the sponsors wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.826" offset="3735986">There isn't any reason why a statute that can be read perfectly straight forwardly to do what everyone agrees Congress intended, must also be wrote so literally as to do something no one in congress wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.883" offset="3780185">This is also, it seems to us, an appropriate case for deference to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.137" offset="3805158">It is, I think, at the very least not clear from the text and the legislative history that Congress intended to permit a U.S. trademark owner to bar importation of its own goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.178" offset="3853328">COPIAT challenges Treasury's consistency, but the basic principle of the Treasury regulation that 526 doesn't give a trademark owner the right to bar its own goods sold abroad from being imported into the United States has been set forth in the regulations at all times since 1936 and very clearly and consistently since 1943.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.839" offset="4260003">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.517" offset="4310680">This Court has long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department's interpretation and construction of a statute when that department has been entrusted with the administration of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.680" offset="4395317">This is an especially strong case for the application of that doctrine for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.571" offset="4442964">First, the regulation in question has been in existence in one form or another since 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.795" offset="4491865">Second, the regulation has been brought before Congress repeatedly in that time period and has been endorsed not by Congressional silence but by actual Congressional language in regard to specific legislation presented to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.923" offset="4572323">And, third, and perhaps more important from the standpoint of my client, one of the intervenors in this case, during the 50 years that this statute has been interpreted by the Customs Service as it has been interpreted, a tremendous and substantial business has grown up in the United States among retailers based upon parallel imports, that everyone believes are lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.561" offset="4694889">And everyone in the industry, the retail industry, believes to be lawful and believed for many years to be lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.131" offset="4725191">My client is K Mart Corporation, a discount department store chain with 2,000 locations throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.273" offset="4769704">We are one of the intervenors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.725" offset="4775555">47th Street Photo is the other intervenor who appears as a petitioner in this matter also selling merchandise and parallel imports included at discount prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.633" offset="4831144">The issue is important to the K Marts and the 47th Street Photos because of the difficulties that discounters have in obtaining trademark merchandise from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.458" offset="4890494">They provide price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.696" offset="4903451">But more importantly than just the discount segment of the retail industry, the retailing industry generally handles some parallel imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.754" offset="4951621">Most retailers handle parallel imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.372" offset="4966145">They provide price competition with those imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.241" offset="4981609">They are a tool, an anti-monopoly tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.894" offset="5000208">And in this case, I must say that nothing in a brief filed in the Second Circuit was on the record to give notice to this industry that there had been a change in the views of any of the agencies in Washington, D.C. indeed, the language of the regulation in question has remained substantially the same during the time period with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.068" offset="5140956">In the 1950's, after the passage of the Lanham Act, the language was arguably broadened to permit more goods to be brought into the United States with a reference to the Lanham Act language for related companies dealing with affiliated companies and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.962" offset="5220473">Now, that language stayed in the regulation until 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.683" offset="5243356">It didn't narrow it, as the Respondents would contend it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.087" offset="5264985">It broadened it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.503" offset="5270628">It is not a real inconsistency in the sense that it supports the position which has been taken by the Respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.811" offset="5319843">During that same time period, this general understanding of the statute has been presented to Congress a number of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.452" offset="5370416">Now, as Mr. Cohen has pointed out, Section 526 was passed very clearly to remedy a perceived defect in a ruling under the 1902 trademark law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.782" offset="5443767">And that ruling arose in the case of Bourjois &amp; Co. v. Katzel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.068" offset="5464874">And that is what caused 526 to be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.638" offset="5483160">In 1936, Treasury interpreted the rule to provide and to allow for parallel imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.493" offset="5522657">But, more importantly, when the trademark act was amended with the Lanham Act in 1946, extensive reports were made to Congress before the passage of the Lanham Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.170" offset="5573335">And in passing the Lanham Act, Congress was told repeatedly that this regulation is on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.424" offset="5602278">And under the trademark law and under 526, it was not envisioned that when one company, a multi-national company is manufacturing overseas and has a U.S. subsidiary, it is not envisioned that that U.S. subsidiary will be able to keep those imports out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.670" offset="5691304">Congress was told that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.372" offset="5698096">They put nothing in the Lanham Act--</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.096" offset="6369025">The Lanham Act is one example and equally critical example and more up to date arises in 1984 when the Lanham Act was amended by the so-called Counterfeiting Act of 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.558" offset="6438824">That Counterfeiting Act when it came in originally covered a number of different subjects and was the subject of extensive consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.450" offset="6482396">And the Senate judiciary Committee when it referred out the legislation ultimately passed, it said the Act did not include within its coverage so-called gray market goods, i.e., authentic trademark goods that have been obtained from overseas markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.161" offset="6553240">The importation of such goods is legal under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.613" offset="6571108">For example, the Treasury Department has long interpreted Section 526 to permit the importation of such goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.902" offset="6608202">Now, at this point, before the Court, we have an interpretation which is clearly not Congressional silence sanctioning the Treasury Department, but express language from Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.085" offset="6813002">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.975" offset="6864515">At the risk of making an argument even more one-sided, I will say a word or two about the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.014" offset="6900669">The District Courts have jurisdiction of actions relating to trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.502" offset="6922612">And that is conferred by Section 1338 of Title 28 and by a provision of the Lanham Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.306" offset="6945808">The District Court here had and exercised that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.376" offset="6970154">It had the traditional District Court trademark jurisdiction because nothing, I submit, in Section 1581 of Title 28 which deals with the jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade, makes an exception to the traditional trademark jurisdiction of the District Courts for this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.040" offset="7056776">Certainly, nothing in Section 1581 says in terms that the Court of International Trade has jurisdiction over any trademark matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.812" offset="7095856">I have to acknowledge, however, that jurisdiction has been found to reside in the Court of International Trade by that court and it was affirmed in this respect by the Federal Circuit in the Vivitar case, which is a similar case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.303" offset="7149877">That finding was based, that finding was based on provisions of subsection (i) of Section 1581 and, in particular, paragraph 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.629" offset="7207137">That is at page 9A of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.997" offset="7216646">The paragraph gives the Court of International Trade jurisdiction of any civil action against the government, an agency, or government official, arising out of a Federal statute providing for and, now, I quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.274" offset="7281743">Embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the protection of public health or safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.399" offset="7330226">The argument is that Section 526 makes the importation of some goods bearing a United States trademark unlawful and, therefore, imposes an embargo on such goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.991" offset="7380590">Now, there are reasons set forth on the Court of Appeals opinions in our brief what that is not a tenable view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.228" offset="7405563">I want to focus on just one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.212" offset="7413505">What Section 526 really does is to enable the owner of a United States trademark to invoke governmental processes to bar those goods bearing his trademark that he wants to bar and conversely, if he gives consent, to allow those same goods that may be quite identical to enter the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.760" offset="7511725">The Customs Service is simply directed to enforce a private right to exclude some goods and admit others that may be quite indistinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.937" offset="7568358">And I submit that that sort of enforcement of private rights is not within the common understanding or, indeed, any reasonable understanding of an embargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.728" offset="7615588">That very point was made during the debate that preceded the re-enactment of Section 526 in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.285" offset="7661772">The Senate debated a proposal to delete from Section 526 the consent clause, the provision that allows the trademark owner to consent to the importation of goods bearing his trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.628" offset="7731154">Senator George was one of the opponents of that proposal and he said that if it were adopted, if it were adopted, that would change... that would change Section 526 into an embargo kind of statute, but it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.340" offset="7801998">It was not an embargo statute as it then stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.708" offset="7815477">There are plenty of embargo statutes on the books for this provision of Section 1581 to apply to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.398" offset="7850272">There are some statutes that directly bar imports of certain goods or certain goods from some countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.003" offset="7884649">More commonly, there are statutes like the Trading with the Enemy Act, the Trade Expansion Act, the International Economic Powers Act that empower the President to bar those--</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.542" offset="7930834">The response to that, Mr. Allen, I presume is that the Senate realized that and taking that into account didn't just say embargo.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.846" offset="8371989">And I want to inquire first whether, as has been argued here this afternoon, I think, whether Section 526 as it is in fact worded can be made to sustain a meaning that is consistent with the Customs Services regulations interpreting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.293" offset="8473763">If it cannot, if it can't, then I think my clients win.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.031" offset="8496750">In every case that I am aware of where, in the eyes of some, this Court has strained a statute, it has thought itself bound to justify what it has done by reference to the text, the statutory words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.612" offset="8583059">Church of the Holy Trinity and perhaps one or two other cases may be exceptions, but this is clearly not the case where statutory words taken at face value yields some sort of absurd result that has to be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.323" offset="8649932">You take any of the cases: Bob Jones, Guerrera, WMATA v. Johnson, the California Coastal Zone case, all of them... all of them, the interpretation of the statute however influenced by context, by secondary sources of illumination like legislative history was ultimately related to statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.170" offset="8737286">On the other hand, in not one of the District Court cases in which Section 526 has been held to have a limited meaning approximating that of the Customs Service regulations has a court engaged in any textual analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.269" offset="8829759">I suggest that this inability to swear statute and regulation textually, may be why the Circuit judges of the Federal Circuit in Vivitar, the Second Circuit in Olympus, as well as the judges of the court below, were unwilling to accept the regulations as correctly interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.587" offset="8926935">You cannot find, you certainly cannot find the exceptions that are expressed in the Customs regulations in the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.644" offset="8975209">They are not there explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.494" offset="8982628">The question is whether they lurk there or some justification for them lurks in the statutory words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.666" offset="9015333">One suggestion offered this morning... offered this afternoon refers to the term of the statute that requires that trademark be owned by a corporation created within the United States, a citizen or a corporation created within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.878" offset="9088163">The requirement was added in conference, apparently because of questions raised in the Senate debate, and the part of the Senate debate to which Mr. Cohen referred... and I commend that part of the debate to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.018" offset="9144692">The lesson I draw from it and the lesson that the court below drew from it is quite different from the lesson that Mr. Cohen would draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.176" offset="9185338">But, in any event, that owned provision of the statute was added in the conference committee, presumably in the light of that part of the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.782" offset="9227761">It has been suggested that a trademark is not owned by the United States subsidiary, that is the distributor for a foreign manufacturing parent, but is instead owned by the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.124" offset="9289096">At least I assume that is the... spell it out fully what is suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.445" offset="9306442">But the fact is, the fact is that the United States subsidiary distributor is recognized in law as the owner of the United States trademark.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.406" offset="9386272">A trademark can be registered only by the owner and these people, the subsidiary distributors have the registration certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.214" offset="9437472">They are the ones whom the Patent and Trademark Office recognize as the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.451" offset="9462445">There is no occasion in Federal law, as a general matter, for going into the corporate family tree of the apparent owner and registrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.758" offset="9507689">There was a simple way, there was a simple way for the conference committee to limit the class of corporate trademark owners that qualify for the protection of Section 526 if it had wanted to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.803" offset="9579892">That would have been to require both the corporation be created in the United States as is done by Section 526 and that some specified proportion of the voting stock and some proportion of directors be United States citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.400" offset="9666200">That is done in some other Federal statutes, which we referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.454" offset="9686471">But not in Section 526.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.089" offset="9700995">But in any event, if you attribute to Congress the meaning of the word, 526 that is unknown to trademark law, you don't solve the problem of shoe-horning the Customs Service regulations into the text of Section 526.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.855" offset="9796081">The regulations deny the benefits of the statute to American manufacturing companies that manufacture trademark goods overseas themselves or have affiliates or licensees that do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.281" offset="9853759">Examples of Duracell, the automobile manufacturers, Proctor &amp; Gamble, some of them which don't even import any of the goods they make overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.720" offset="9891480">All of which have described their gray market problems in amicus briefs in these courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.438" offset="9914363">If those companies are to be excluded from the protection of Section 526, it surely can't be on the ground that they don't own their United States trademarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.932" offset="9964309">And what has been belatedly suggested is that the case of these American manufacturing companies is covered by another term of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.970" offset="10004538">We have to go... that one didn't work, so, we turn to another provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.291" offset="10029825">The requirement that goods be of foreign manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.528" offset="10050723">Now, that, I submit, is just too far-fetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.713" offset="10067441">Congress is supposed to have intended by this argument quite ordinary words that on their face deal with where goods are manufactured in order to refer to something wholly different, i.e., who manufactures the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.412" offset="10154272">And if I can depart for a moment from the purely textual argument, the of foreign manufacture amendment was introduced in response to a question that had been marked by Senator Lenroot about a person who went over into Canada and bought there a sack of the fine American product, Wonder Flour, that had been imported into Canada and now was going to bring it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.812" offset="10271927">He said, he was going to have his flour confiscated just because he was patriotic and wanted to buy American flour instead of Canadian flour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.435" offset="10306409">He said, he said: buys that merchandise, suppose the American citizen purchased and brought back to this country a product of foreign manufacture with a foreign trademark and paid the duty on it in the regular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.582" offset="10378925">He distinguished the case of foreign manufacture from the case of American manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.402" offset="10406197">He was talking about where the Wonder Flour was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.770" offset="10423751">Furthermore, furthermore, the idea that of foreign manufacture means manufacture by a non-U.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.626" offset="10467114">S. company can't possibly, can't possibly be reconciled with the debate that preceded the re-enactment of the Section 526 as part of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.635" offset="10527196">The whole subject of that debate was goods manufactured abroad by American companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.407" offset="10558229">The Senate Finance Committee proposed deleting the clause at the end of Section 526 that permits such companies to consent to the importation of their goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.215" offset="10613505">The idea was then Ford Motor Company and these other companies that the Senators were complaining of weren't going to establish overseas plants and deprive Americans of jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.188" offset="10653420">Whatever else that debate implies for the meaning of Section 526 and Mr. Cohen and I have debated the issue in our briefs, I think it is on the whole, that the debate can't possibly be reconciled with the Customs Service regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.400" offset="10734190">But even leaving aside that debate in its whole breadth, surely, surely as to this matter, if even one Senator... if even one Senator had understood that the words, "of foreign manufacture", meant let us say manufactured by a foreign company that has no ownership or licensing ties to an American company, he would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.484" offset="10838576">He would have said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.003" offset="10844636">"Look here. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.703" offset="10847457">"We have to do something more than just delete this consent provision. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.905" offset="10868251">"Because that statute as we enacted doesn't have anything to do with this case we are talking about. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.809" offset="10887895">"If we just adopt the Finance Committee's amendment, we're going to wake up and find that we have accomplished nothing, nothing in the way of saving American jobs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.234" offset="10949544">Now, that brings me... that brings me to a second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.988" offset="10972636">I think my clients win on the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.792" offset="10991758">It can't... the text of Section 526 can't be made to fit the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.113" offset="11021119">But I don't lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.648" offset="11027180">I don't lose I don't think even if somebody finds some way of, by heroic efforts, of making the fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.438" offset="11066363">Because what we want to know finally is not what meaning the statute might be made to sustain, but what in fact Congress meant when it enacted the statute in 1922 and re-enacted it in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.965" offset="11132505">Now, a good index to what Congress meant is how what it said was immediately understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.719" offset="11159464">And I have already suggested that a particularly good index is the understanding that Senators in 1929 debating the re-enactment of Section 526 had, of what they had done back in 1922, absolutely nothing to suggest that any of them thought that it meant what the present Customs Service regulations say it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.184" offset="11265416">And a lot, a lot to indicate the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.821" offset="11283911">But that's not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.523" offset="11290703">Those who wrote the regulations for the old Customs Bureau on the heels of the enactment of the Tariff Act of 1922 had to be keenly attuned to what had just happened in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.033" offset="11356741">You would expect that if they had laid the emphasis on the debate in the Senate, the five or six columns of Congressional Record to record that debate that is now laid on it at this late date, they might have said something like this:</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.428" offset="11434376">"Section 526 is written in seemingly broad terms, but in fact Congress meant only to overrule a decision of a Court of Appeals on its narrowest facts. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3028.338" offset="12241978">And were not just acutely aware of it, but perhaps not very hospitable to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.747" offset="12711660">This Court held in 1923, after the Katzel decision that a section of the Trademark Act that forbids the importation of goods with a trademark that copies or simulates a United States' trademark applied to genuine goods with a trademark identical to a United States trademark.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.394" offset="13226167">It appears from what Congress was told when it was considering trademark legislation in 1944, it appears that the second sentence qualifying the general Aldredge rule was nothing more complicated than someone's conceptual difficulty with the idea that a person's own foreign trademark could be said to copy or simulate his identical United States trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.014" offset="13344659">It had nothing to do with any supposed policy of Section 526 or for that matter any policy of the Trademark Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3604.087" offset="14544933">Let me respond to some of the points that Mr. Allen has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.407" offset="14570220">With respect to the first version of the regulations, it is true that the first version of the regulations simply parroted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.097" offset="14605015">The 1922 Act was a massive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.799" offset="14615777">It constituted almost the whole of Title 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.583" offset="14635003">That Treasury did not see fit to do anything other than quote the statute in the regulations that were adopted immediately thereafter, doesn't seem to us to have much bearing one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.795" offset="14699787">The Clark Pease case, the Second Circuit case to which Mr. Allen was referring was not about the issue that is presently before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.734" offset="14743568">It was about whether the word, "merchandise", applies to goods brought in for personal use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.138" offset="14769168">It does not appear in the opinion of that case that the U.S. trademark owner and the foreign trademark were the same person or were in any way related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.497" offset="14826638">I will concede that the 1936 regulations, although they cite Section 526 and contain an explicit exception for the related company situation, don't do so as neatly as we might wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.692" offset="14899363">I think that the 1943 regulations leave no doubt whatever that the Treasury is treating the Lanham Act section, Section 27, which later became the Section 42 of the Lanham Act dealing with copies and Section 526 together and provided quite clearly as to both of them an exception that persists to this day for goods of the U.S. trademark owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3746.993" offset="15116597">And the Court said quite clearly in the 1940 American Truckinq Association case where it was holding that a statute given the ICC jurisdiction of the wages and hours of trucking company employees, the Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.388" offset="15190158">"It is said that a broader reading would not be absurd, but it doesn't have to be absurd. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3774.846" offset="15227983">And, therefore, it limited the words of that statute to the case of employees with safety-related jobs.</text>
