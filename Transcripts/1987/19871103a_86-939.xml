            <text syncTime="73.878" offset="440649">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="77.000" offset="453083">Section 9 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 approved the Pick-Sloan Plan, a comprehensive multiple purpose program, jointly administered by the Army and the Interior Department, for the development of the Missouri River Basin's water resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.142" offset="517658">The question here is whether the Secretary of the Interior may enter into a contract pursuant to the federal reclamation laws to supply a portion of the program's unneeded irrigation waters for ETSI Pipeline Project's state-approved industrial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.953" offset="588920">I would like to begin by briefly describing the Pick-Sloan Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.615" offset="607519">Pick-Sloan represents a comprehensive yet flexible response to the needs of a vast and varied river basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.881" offset="636672">It combines the flood control features of the Army's proposed Pick plan and the reclamation features of the Interior's proposed Sloan plan into a unified inter-agency program designed to provide maximum basin-wide benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.192" offset="697903">Under this plan, the arid upper basin states dedicated a great expanse of productive lands for construction of the massive main steam reservoirs that would protect the lower basin states from disastrous seasonal floods.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.160" offset="753701">In return, the upper basin states received assurances that water stored in these reservoirs located within their borders would be available for irrigation and other needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.108" offset="801557">The main stem reservoirs have now been completed, and the lower basin states are secured from the once devastating flood waters, but the upper basin states anticipated irrigation needs have not yet fully materialized and those states wish to put this water which presently inundates their territory to other beneficial applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.002" offset="885149">The dispute here centers on Lake Oahe, a main stem reservoir that was central to both the Pick and the Sloan plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.756" offset="916078">The Army originally proposed two small flood control reservoirs at this location.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.951" offset="936871">Interior, by contrast, recommended one large reservoir with much greater capacity to meet the upper basin states' reclamation needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.107" offset="973547">The Army and Interior ultimately agreed that Interior's proposal with its massive reclamation storage capacity would best serve the needs of the basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.483" offset="1015030">However, it became clear in the early 1970s that the upper basin states' irrigation needs were not developing as quickly as expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.708" offset="1047944">The Interior Department, with the cooperation of the Army, therefore agreed to market the resulting unneeded irrigation water at Lake Oahe and other reservoirs for state-approved applications.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.435" offset="1822840">The Army made a determination at that point that it probably could not market unutilized irrigation water in these circumstances because it would run through the hydro-powered turbines and would, therefore, serve a beneficial use.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.952" offset="1916881">The town requested a very small amount of water, 323 acre feet, for its municipal uses.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.766" offset="1956169">The Army's initial determination was that perhaps it could not supply this water because the water could be used to go through the turbine.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.981" offset="1985008">The Army has attempted to ameliorate that policy by, in fact, making this water... by concluding that when the water can be made available to a municipal application without interfering with other project purposes, that it then can supply the water.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.790" offset="4084208">We speak with one voice in this case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.132" offset="4093612">As I was saying, the water marketing program advanced three important objectives in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.569" offset="4143350">First, it permitted the upper basin states to apply some of their presently unneeded irrigation water to other beneficial uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.435" offset="4170830">Second, it allowed the Interior Department to recoup some of the costs incurred in providing irrigation storage, and, third, it secured water for alternative energy sources at the height of the Arab oil embargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.912" offset="4216701">Now, we submit that Section 9 of the Flood Control Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into the FC contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.159" offset="4253691">Our legal position is quite straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.749" offset="4264140">Section (a) of the Flood Control Act approves the Pick-Sloan Plan, which, in turn, designates the Secretary of the Interior as the appropriate authority to manage the reclamation aspects of the main stem reservoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.487" offset="4311056">Section 9(c) then identifies the body of law, namely federal reclamation law, that governs how the Secretary shall exercise that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.972" offset="4345015">The Secretary may, therefore, enter into contracts to supply unutilized irrigation water from a main stem reservoir, in this case, Lake Oahe, in accordance with the provisions of the Reclamation Project Act, a federal reclamation law that permits the Secretary of the Interior to provide unneeded irrigation water for miscellaneous purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.705" offset="4423905">There are two points here that bear special emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.977" offset="4436966">First, the Pick-Sloan Plan sets forth the basic policy for the systematic development of the river basin, and it expressly recognizes that the Secretary of the Interior shall have authority over irrigation storage at the main stem reservoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.566" offset="4495376">It naturally follows under this functional division of authority that the Secretary is authorized to administer the application of irrigation waters not presently needed for irrigation use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.864" offset="4540515">Second, when Section 9(c) instructs that the reclamation developments to be undertaken by the Secretary shall be governed by the reclamation laws, it is referring to the Secretary's reclamation activities and not merely the physical work constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.464" offset="4603000">Thus, Section 9(c) makes clear that the reclamation laws shall govern the Secretary's entire reclamation program beginning with his initial assessment of irrigation storage requirements, continuing through to final repayment of costs, and including in his determination what should be done with unneeded irrigation water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.847" offset="4676456">Respondents have only modest quarrels with our construction of Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.159" offset="4693697">They principally contend that two other provisions of the Flood Control Act, Section 6 and 8, override Section 9 in the functional division of authority set forth in the Pick-Sloan Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.846" offset="4732463">The reply briefs filed in this case explain in considerable detail why Respondents are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.478" offset="4755033">I will simply summarize our answer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.050" offset="4765273">First, Respondents observe that Section 6 gives the Army general authority to market surplus water from Army flood control projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.245" offset="4798083">They then surmise that the Army must have exclusive authority to market water from the Pick-Sloan Program to main stem reservoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.149" offset="4821697">Claiming Respondents' logic does not follow, Section 6 does not purport to give the Army exclusive water marketing authority, nor does it indicate how that authority should be exercised in hybrid facilities, which combine both flood control and reclamation features.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.609" offset="4875510">There is no basis for interpreting Section 6 to override the functional division of authority expressly set forth in the Pick-Sloan Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.324" offset="4910409">Second, Respondents suggest that Section 8, which specifies the general procedure for adding reclamation features to Army flood control projects, provides the only avenue by which Interior can exercise reclamation responsibilities at Army projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.554" offset="4967356">Respondents' Section 8 argument is also untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.525" offset="4979163">Section 8 deals with how to add reclamation features to flood control projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.428" offset="4998808">The section has no application here where Interior is attempting to assure that Lake Oahe's pre-eminent and existing reclamation feature, namely its massive irrigation storage capacity, is optimally applied to a permissible reclamation use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.659" offset="5059725">Respondents also contend that the Secretary's interpretation is not entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.713" offset="5079996">However, this is precisely the type of case where deference is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.293" offset="5094311">First and foremost, the Secretary's construction of Section 9 is certainly reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.433" offset="6526866">The question here is what law governs industrial use of water stored in Army reservoirs on the Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.147" offset="6549645">Respondents submit that the courts below very properly held that the Secretary of the Interior may not claim unilateral marketing authority over waters in Army reservoirs for industrial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.024" offset="6597188">Instead, Section 6 of the Act expressly provides the terms which govern industrial use of this Army reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.447" offset="6618922">Section 6 provides that the Secretary of the Army makes the decision whether water is available for industrial use and Section 6 also very specifically protects other uses of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.336" offset="6662494">It establishes the terms and conditions for industrial use of water at Army reservoirs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.446" offset="6914837">Say the President of the United States thinks we ought to sell this water and he calls in the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior and says, how can we do it, and they do all the paper work in the world on it, would you find any objection to their power to dispose of this water, if they all agreed they wanted to do it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.387" offset="6978680">We'd agree that they would have power to make the decision whether to dispose of the water, and the Army General Counsel's opinion indicates that Army does have authority to determine whether this water is available for industrial use and to determine that a certain portion of that water is surplus, even though it may reduce the power generated at the reservoir.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.232" offset="8842047">Congress placed the Missouri River reservoirs under the control of the Secretary of the Army because of their peculiarly-close relationship with flood control and navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.917" offset="8884783">That is, their dominant purpose was flood control and navigation and not irrigation, and the water is contained in multi-purpose storage where it is used for a variety of purposes, including navigation, flood control and hydro-powered generation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.430" offset="8942775">Because Army manages the reservoir and Army has control over all the waters in that reservoir, it is the logical entity to determine what water is surplus to the functions and the purposes of the reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.335" offset="8990422">Interior carries out no function at Oahe Reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.168" offset="9001812">It has no interest in protecting other uses of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.420" offset="9014768">Additionally, its Bureau of Reclamation, which is the entity of the Department of the Interior involved in this case, has limited geographic reach.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.579" offset="9075372">By contract, it is a national agency that represents all interests in the inter-state river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.603" offset="9099510">It is incongruous to take the position of the Secretary of the Interior that two agencies can market the same water for the same use, we're talking only about industrial use, on different terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.611" offset="9139529">It encourages form shopping for entities, such as ETSI, that seek to exempt themselves from the limitations Congress directly imposed in Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.858" offset="9176519">Now, when ETSI approved this contract in 1982, it was its first assertion of unilateral authority to market the water and it asserted that it would market a million acre feet of water annually for energy or industrial use without further consideration of other uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.007" offset="9249139">In so doing, it relied on the reclamation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.310" offset="9258334">It did not rely on Section 6 or Army authority because Army had terminated the memorandum of understanding by which they had jointly provided a temporary solution from 1975 to 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.450" offset="9314863">During that time period, Army made a number of statements, including one by the Secretary of the Army, that the memorandum of understanding was only a temporary solution, that there was concern about statutory authority, and that modifications would be brought back to Congress if desired, and at no time did the agencies obtain congressional approval, and Army terminated the memorandum of understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.158" offset="9425727">Army specifically did not approve the ETSI contract under Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.259" offset="9442132">The Court of Appeals asked for further information on that point and the federal defendants stated that Army did not approve the contract under Section 6.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.679" offset="9799800">And, so, their entire claim of authority is certain statements and legislative history that Interior would adopt regulations for the use of storage available for irrigation at Army reservoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.630" offset="9871585">However, Congress specifically rejected that approach when it rejected the language like that in the House bill and instead adopted present Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.756" offset="9912127">So, Section 8 is limited to irrigation purposes and irrigation works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.250" offset="9930099">Army, however, physically operates the reservoir and it not... so, it operates and has control over all the water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.465" offset="9970954">Surplus water is the water that can be made available for industrial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.070" offset="9989345">But Army has jurisdiction to determine what is surplus and, thus, the Army has taken the position, as is shown in the 1986 General Counsel's opinion, that it does have authority over the water which is stored in multi-purpose storage in the reservoir, even though that water would be available for irrigation, if needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.735" offset="10076071">It is not a separate block that reclamation law controls this block of storage in the reservoir and Army controls the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.050" offset="10109299">Instead, all the water is subject to Army control with Section 6 defining when the water can be made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.444" offset="10134899">And the Secretary of the Interior concedes that in both industrial use at this Army reservoir and the reservoir itself and that this water are within the scope of Section 6.</text>

            <text syncTime="2515.195" offset="10205848">The Army General Counsel's opinion shows that it's a reasoned construction, that they've abandoned the position of the dissent below, that all water would be locked up and could not be used for any purpose, or even that there would be no water available for industrial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.973" offset="10264989">The current position of the Secretary of the Army is clear that some water could be made available for industrial use at Oahe under Section 6.</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.908" offset="13840734">Notably, he entered into such a contract here with South Dakota's Oahe Conservancy District at the time he initiated the construction of the now-suspended Oahe irrigation works.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.478" offset="13915026">Furthermore, the Secretary is wrong in construing Section 9 to establish a functional division of authority of these reservoirs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3490.587" offset="14107496">Those steps were followed in this case at the time the project was authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.689" offset="14123901">Finally, there's some question whether Interior's reclamation activities in Pick-Sloan, in fact, Interior's quite active or has been quite active in participating in the determination of reclamation storage requirements here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.576" offset="14179385">It conducted extensive surveys of irrigation needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.410" offset="14190775">It entered into a reclamation contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.391" offset="14198716">It secured water rights for reclamation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.243" offset="14210105">It obtained... it continues to coordinate its main stem and tributary activities with the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.407" offset="14234765">So, it's simply not accurate to say that Interior is not active in the Oahe reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.941" offset="14256812">Finally, I would like to address the practical considerations that lie at the very heart of this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.412" offset="14274785">Congress approved the Pick-Sloan Plan to serve the needs of the entire Missouri River Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.857" offset="14292548">The congressionally-approved plan was carefully formulated and coordinated by the Corps and Bureau Engineers to provide a fair and efficient distribution of the Missouri River resources to all states within the Basin.</text>
