            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="123855">We'll hear argument this morning in No. 87-16, Richard D. Shapiro versus the Kentucky Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.356" offset="161262">Mr. Cox, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald L. Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="15.926" offset="187489">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.978" offset="199715">This is the third case in six years which has come to this Court from the various district courts and has involved absolute bans on various forms of written advertising by attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.471" offset="257706">In each of those cases, and they begin with R.M.J.; they go into the Zauderer case and now in the Shapiro case.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.708" offset="282679">And in each of those cases there is no record evidence below which would justify the absolute ban which the Bar Association has advanced, and in which the various state supreme courts sought to impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.033" offset="335969">We had thought that this Court had made it absolutely clear in the Zauderer decision when it said that an attorney may not be disciplined for giving out truthful and non-deceptive advice to specific clients about their legal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.744" offset="406813">We thought that that had settled the matter, but apparently it has not; and we are here once again on another issue where there has been imposed an absolute blanket ban on attorney advertising speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.070" offset="456133">The issue here today is something called targeted direct mail solicitation, which basically involves a situation where an attorney sends out a written letter to a person whom he has identified has having a specific legal problem; and that letter contains some generalized legal advice similar to the advice, perhaps, that was given in the Zauderer advertisements.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.067" offset="548084">The Kentucky court has upheld the actual ban, and that is why we are here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.173" offset="572534">I would like to first go over just briefly the situation in Kentucky, the specific, what I would call all-encompassing rules regulating attorney advertizing, and then go briefly into the facts, and then into the legal argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.516" offset="633870">Kentucky probably has as all-encompassing regulation of attorney advertising as any state in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.722" offset="674725">What Kentucky has done as gone through this Court's decisions, and has seen in those decisions where the Court has indicated various possible means of regulating attorney advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.696" offset="722582">Kentucky has, without exception, adopted all of those; and then it's come up with some twists of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.016" offset="747868">As this Court suggested in R.M.J. and Central Hudson, first off, Kentucky has a strict pre-submission process.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.003" offset="775767">Under that process, advertisements of the type we're talking about here, and almost all advertisements, except very limited routine advertisements, are required to be pre-submitted to an agency of the State Bar Association comprised of three lawyers that are appointed by the State Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.048" offset="847969">Those three lawyers review the advertisements; they're given the power under the state regulation to conduct investigations; to subpoena witnesses; and in addition, under those regulations, are given the power to, in effect, edit the advertisement by suggesting disclaimers; by suggesting changes in the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.711" offset="926650">And most importantly, I think from the standpoint of this case, under those regulations, an attorney has to wait at least 30 days before sending out any advertisement.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.119" offset="1176276">It was submitted to the state advertising commission, who in the first instance, reviews all advertisements.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.984" offset="2191708">Let me point out one additional thing: the Kentucky rules make it very clear that even if there is a problem, as Justice Blackmun suggested, maybe Mr. Shapiro should have said,</text>

            <text syncTime="780.872" offset="3247264">But there's a nugget... there's a real important nugget in the survey of the Florida Bar Association.</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.505" offset="10953804">This Court has held... and it's important to bear in mind that the Kentucky court did not reach its conclusion in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.491" offset="10985778">It made a number of findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.776" offset="10994869">It found in its opinion involving Shapiro, that dangers result from direct solicitation, whether in person or by mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.566" offset="11030082">It stated that it was not unmindful of the potential for serious abuse with direct solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.220" offset="11056727">It held that the submission of a blank form letter would not provide suitable protection for the public, and it stated that, under Kentucky rules, advertising was available to inform the public of the need for legal services, and the qualifications of those about to offer them without the risk that comes through impersonal solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.751" offset="11150768">We, this morning... some new lawyers were admitted as members of this Bar, and the Chief Justice welcomed them as Officers of this Court.</text>
