            <text syncTime="8.999" offset="116856">This case comes to us from the South Carolina Supreme Court that the petitioner and in accomplice robbed a country store in South Carolina in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.962" offset="164713">After the petitioner left the store, a fight occurred in which his the accomplice and the wife of the storekeeper were both killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.921" offset="196582">Petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death and the conviction sentence was affirmed by the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.502" offset="226884">At his trial, the petitioner testified that he did not intend to kill anyone or to harm anyone and of course he pointed out that the victim had not even been present when he was in the store, the jury was nevertheless instructed that malice could be presumed from the fact that he had a deadly weapon in his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.758" offset="311939">A few months after his conviction was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.431" offset="322597">In an unrelated case involving a man named Elmore, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the instruction similar the one given in petitioner's trial was improper and unconstitutional and the petitioner therefore, sought a relief based on that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.457" offset="382679">And while his petition is pending in the South Carolina Supreme Court, we decided a case called Francis against Franklin, which also held such an instruction unconstitutional and the petitioner then called that case to the attention of South Carolina Supreme Court as well as relying of an earlier case of arson the similar ban called Sandstrom against Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.889" offset="476406">The South Carolina Supreme Court denied relief without an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.803" offset="492079">The petitioner then sought relief from us and we granted certiorari and summarily vacated the judgment and requested the South Carolina Supreme Court to reconsider its action in the light of the Francis decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.669" offset="539518">When the case went back to the South Carolina Supreme Court they concluded that the instruction was inconsistent with Francis and also with Elmore but nevertheless denied relief because they did not think they should apply the Elmore case, which is a state case retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.566" offset="603152">So, the petitioner came back again and we granted certiorari, because we are concerned that the South Carolina Supreme Court might not have fully complied with our mandate, and we agreed of course with the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.638" offset="659368">The constitutional errer was committed but they did not consider whether the Francis case might be applied retroactively, so it was incumbent upon to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.507" offset="698865">We have nwo decided that there really is no retroactivity issue even presented because Francis against Franklin was merely an application of a principle decided in the earlier case and therefore we have reversed the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court with instructions to comply with what we say in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.568" offset="779113">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
