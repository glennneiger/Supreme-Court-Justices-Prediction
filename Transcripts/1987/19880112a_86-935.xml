            <text syncTime="764.924" offset="3190738">I do know that Congress was told by other Congressmen, by Congressmen who were instrumental in promoting the 1909 legislation, that it would in fact embody the Attorney General's Opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="842.102" offset="3499401">We receive money from the California Legislature which pays for the operation of the mail system.</text>

            <text syncTime="851.809" offset="3538271">It just offends common sense to say that mail which is ordered and paid for by the same entity is not compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.484" offset="3564916">PERB argues that the intent is the key here, that if the intent is to compete, the exception does not apply but if there is another intent, it may apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.512" offset="3605040">The problem is that the California intent here, the Legislature's intent, is clearly to withhold revenue from the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.134" offset="3631581">The purpose is to facilitate communication, but to facilitate it in just one way... by making it cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.637" offset="3653524">It is sophistry to say that the Legislature intends to save significant dollars for the Unions but doesn't intend to withhold significant dollars from the Postal Service when they are the very same dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.876" offset="3702529">Anyone setting up to compete with the Postal Service on more economical routes like these could claim to be facilitating communication by making it cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.151" offset="3735652">The problem is that there has been a national decision, there should be a national postal rate, there should be a Postal Service to accomplish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.407" offset="3764596">And to preserve that service, it is necessary to say you cannot compete with it unless you fall under one of the exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.564" offset="4837288">In turning to the letters of the carrier exception, this is a classic case of deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.341" offset="4880338">This is a long standing interpretation that was originally formulated contemporaneously with the relevant statutory amendment which was in 1909, and it has been consistently followed ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.888" offset="4930598">I would like to go through that briefly, the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.900" offset="4946585">First, let me note, the words of the statute are ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.654" offset="4965602">It could be construed the way the Postal Service has done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.857" offset="4978454">It could be construed the way the Court of Appeals has done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.087" offset="4991411">I would say that the issue here is whether letters to institutions can only be sent to their representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.745" offset="5025997">That is the way the Postal Service has construed it, and the issue is whether they have properly done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.837" offset="5050343">I would think that the language of the statute letters relating to the current business of the carrier would normally be sent to representatives, would not be sent to someone else in the case of an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.769" offset="5110111">It is true that you can define the business of something like a university very broadly and include almost everything, including the letters here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.904" offset="5150653">So I start with the proposition that the language is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.327" offset="5164341">But this is a case where the legislative history is very, very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.431" offset="5188792">In the 1896 Attorney General Opinion letter that was referred to, the Attorney General concluded, despite the lack of a basis in the language of the private express statutes at that time, that a railroad could carry its own letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.651" offset="5249605">He said that the right he identified was quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.692" offset="5265801">"to carry letters written and sent by the officers and agents of the railroad company which carries and delivers them, about its business, and these only. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.309" offset="5484289">Unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.290" offset="5308224">He added that:</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.821" offset="5314284">"companies could not carry letters that are neither written by that company nor addressed to it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.395" offset="5340616">IN 1909, when Congress added the language at issue here, the principal proponent of the amendment was Senator Bacon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.782" offset="5378128">And he wanted to revise the statute to express in exact language what the Attorney General says it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.544" offset="5405190">The Senator who actually proposed the language of the amendment was Senator Sutherland, and he said that that was its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.241" offset="5436015">And the Conference Report, which was printed in the Congressional Record at that time said that it put the statute quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.156" offset="5467675">"in exact conformity with the construction placed upon existing law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.190" offset="5487737">And then referred to Attorney General Harmon's 1896 Opinion letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.733" offset="5505919">Legislative history is rarely this clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.795" offset="5518248">But there can be no question that Congress intended to codify the 1986 Opinion which stated that railroads could carry letters sent to or by its officers and agents but not letters that are neither written by nor sent to the company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.417" offset="5912697">Its interpretation of the California statute that says that Unions can use... the California statute says that Unions can use... the means of communication of employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.618" offset="5973510">PERB has construed that to mean internal mail systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.740" offset="5985945">We have not quarreled with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.034" offset="5995140">That is entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.054" offset="6003186">But Congress gave the Postal Service, in Section 401, the authority to construe the private express statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.409" offset="6028681">It didn't give that authority to PERB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.850" offset="6038399">I would like to turn to the other exception that PERB says authorizes the deliver here, the private hands without compensation exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.856" offset="6082389">This is another long standing exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.199" offset="6099839">The precise language dates back to 1845, the private hands without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.414" offset="6124707">In 1846, a District Court stated that a deliverer of merchandise could not also deliver letters even though it did not make any separate charge for the delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.604" offset="6181445">And the Postal Service has followed that interpretation ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.715" offset="6197850">More recently, in the 1970s, a number of cases came up involving school districts who wanted to deliver Union letters, very similar cases to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.152" offset="6247587">In some of these cases, collective bargaining agreements spelled out a duty to carry the Union's letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.337" offset="6280397">IN those cases, I think it is clear beyond doubt, and I do not understand PERB to disagree, that compensation was involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1867.568" offset="7601252">The question here is whether California's strong State interest in efficient communication and effective communication between employees and their representatives as codified in HEERA can be harmonized with the private express statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.646" offset="7661648">The State has determined that the University of California has a statutory duty to allow employee organizations to carry this mail to employees in order to make the HEERA scheme of cooperative labor relations effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.320" offset="8228296">As I said, here is a cooperative labor relations scheme in which the employees are part of the decision making on something that is patently the business of the carrier... the terms and conditions of employment of the employees.</text>
