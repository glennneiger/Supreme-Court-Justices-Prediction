            <text syncTime="20.975" offset="209141">May it please the Court, this is a direct appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.223" offset="238189">The District Court held unconstitutional 12 U.S.C. 1818(g) and enjoined the FDIC from enforcing it against appellee Mallen.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.891" offset="268804">Under Section 1818(g), when an officer of a federally insured bank is indicted for a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust, the appropriate federal banking agency, in the case of this bank the FDIC, may suspend him from office and order him not to participate further in the conduct of the affairs of the bank pending the resolution of the criminal charges if it determines that his continued service would pose a threat to the interests of depositors or threaten to impair public confidence in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.412" offset="378937">If a conviction becomes final the suspension ends and the officer is then subject to permanent removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.535" offset="399417">Because of the risks posed to the bank and to public confidence by the presence there of an officer who has been indicated, the FDIC may under the statute impose a suspension immediately, as soon as the indictment is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.514" offset="451348">Once the suspension has been ordered, the statute gives the suspended officer the right to request an opportunity to be heard before the agency and to show that his return to the bank would not threaten the interests that the statute seeks to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.369" offset="502757">If he makes that request, his opportunity to appear must be given him within 30 days, and then once he has had the opportunity to be heard, the agency must decide within 60 days whether or not to terminate, modify, or continue the suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.065" offset="565556">When he makes his appearance before the agency, the officer may submit written material and oral argument, and in the discretion of the agency, oral evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.124" offset="601813">The District Court found that the suspension procedures that I have just outlined were unconstitutional and enjoined the FDIC from enforcing them because of the 90-day time period that is allowed for the agency's decision after the suspension is ordered and because the agency has discretion as to whether to accept oral testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.522" offset="683420">Neither ground of decision was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.866" offset="692720">Congress in fixing the time limits for the hearing and for the decision after the hearing had to accommodate the competing interests, here the suspended officer's interest in having a prompt disposition of his possible return to the bank and the public interest in making sure that the indicted officer is not returned to the bank until the &lt;FDIC&gt; [= FDIC] has had a chance to satisfy itself that it would be safe to do so because, of course, he has been indicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.640" offset="1999887">I mean, you say the statute doesn't require that his pay be cut off, but why in the world should a bank continue to pay somebody who is unable to perform?</text>

            <text syncTime="487.678" offset="2075956">Yes, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.178" offset="2082016">In addition to investigating the situation in the 30-day period, of course, the FDIC has to set up the hearing, it has to schedule its witnesses, usually bank examiners, whose schedules may be difficult to adjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.595" offset="2127678">It has to find an officer to conduct the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.406" offset="2138963">Once the hearing has been held, the FDIC has up to 60 days to make its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.622" offset="2163727">Now, some of that time will be consumed with administrative steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.512" offset="2175325">The hearing officer will prepare his proposed disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.978" offset="2189222">It will be reviewed in various parts of the FDIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.774" offset="2204373">But the primary justification for giving the FDIC as much as 60 days to make its decision as to whether to return the officer once he has been indicted to the bank is the danger of sending him back and the fact that in the most difficult case the FDIC may have a hard choice to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.532" offset="2279397">The FDIC and the system of banking regulation exists to protect the public, to protect depositors, the public in general, and in particular can continue because there is general public confidence in the banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.635" offset="2335822">That is what makes possible the banking system.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.338" offset="2342613">That is what makes possible the FDIC's deposit insurance system.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.805" offset="2360481">So it is extremely important that the FDIC be very sure that it is doing the right thing if it is going to let the officer go back to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.957" offset="2393082">On the other hand, the officer in the most difficult case may have made a strong showing that there are unique facts explaining why despite the indictment which normally would lead him to be suspended it would be safe in that particular case for him to go back to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.952" offset="2453059">Thus the FDIC in the case in which the statute has to be judged on a facial challenge will have to be making a decision that is hard to make, a difficult decision, and in which the down side risk is very serious of letting the officer go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.023" offset="2513350">Sixty days is, as this Court recognized in cases like Thirty-Seven Photographs, an expedited time period within which to make a decision anyway, and so it was, we think, quite unsound for the District Court to suggest that Congress acted unreasonably in saying that the FDIC could have as much as 60 days if it needed it, and of course, as has been suggested, we do not know how long it would have taken to make the decision as to Mallen.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.873" offset="2608749">Now, the District Court did not decide that 90 days was an unreasonable period of time because it thought that the balance between the competing interests shifted in favor of Mallen or because it just couldn't see a reason to need 90 days to have the hearing and then make the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.007" offset="2677294">Rather, it analogized the case, unsoundly, we think, to this Court's decision in Barry against Barchi.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.255" offset="2702267">In Barry, a horse trainer had been suspended for allegedly drugging a horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.721" offset="2728181">The suspension was a penal suspension imposed for 15 days, and it ended after 15 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.922" offset="2752945">The State Racing Commission had 30 days within which to hold its hearing on the suspended trainer to decide whether to... not to impose the suspension, and then there was no set time period for it to make its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.308" offset="2798502">So the way the system was set up in Barry against Barchi, it was possible that a penal suspension would end on its own, would terminate automatically before any hearing was held, but the analogy does not hold up.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.036" offset="2861405">What the District Court thought was that since the criminal process might make its decision and thus determine whether or not Mallen could go back to the bank before the FDIC had a chance to hold its hearing and make its decision under 1818(g), that somehow rendered the Section 1818(g) process meaningless, but the difference between the cases is that here Mallen receives review of the FDIC's decision to suspend through both the processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.835" offset="2992644">Either one can bring the suspension to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.974" offset="3005183">If he is acquitted, of course, the suspension terminates.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.239" offset="3014274">If the FDIC on the basis of his showing decides that, yes, this is an unusual case in which it would be safe to allow him to come back to the bank, the decision terminates, but review is not cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.344" offset="3054711">The situation is not at all like Barry against Barchi.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.311" offset="3066519">Also, of course, the District Court's empirical assumption that as a general rule the criminal process would terminate the suspension before the FDIC process did, which was based on the District Court's thinking that the suspension only ran until jury verdict rather than until the end of the criminal process was simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.320" offset="3146558">As we have seen, as we were discussing a moment ago, the criminal process is still going on now, and indeed it is possible if the United States prevails on its appeal that there will have to be another trial, and so the... I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.360" offset="3218760">If the United States prevails on its appeal the jury verdict will be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.608" offset="3231717">I apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.233" offset="3234225">That means that my earlier answer was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.404" offset="3242898">In any event, it has now been more than a year since Mallen was suspended, and the criminal process is still going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.197" offset="3282081">The District Court also held that the hearing that is provided under Section 1818(g) is not a meaningful process, is not meaningful review because the agency has discretion, and in this case the discretion is delegated to a hearing officer to decide whether to allow Mallen to introduce oral evidence, testimony in addition to the written materials and the oral argument that he has a statutory right to introduce.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.844" offset="3388661">Now, this Court has never held that as a general matter due process creates a right to testify, to put on evidence, to put on oral evidence as opposed to a right to be heard, and Mallen, of course, has a right fully to be heard to present the written statements of any individuals whose testimony he thinks would be relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.519" offset="3507361">It is the general practice of these hearings for oral testimony to be taken from both sides and for cross examination to be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.813" offset="3536514">The District Court issued its injunction the day before the hearing was going to be held, presumably the day before, therefore, the hearing officer would have decided whether or not he was going to admit oral testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.463" offset="3587191">At the very least it would have been appropriate if this is what concerned the District Court for the District Court to wait and see what had happened, to wait and see if there had been any deprivation of the kind of hearing that the Court thought was constitutionally required, or if that was not enough, at least to order the hearing, if the court thought it was necessary for some reason to decide the issue before it had seen what the agency was going to do, to order that oral evidence be accepted, but certainly not to decide the case the way the District Court did, which was simply to strike down the statute, to reach out to find it unconstitutional on the basis of something that might never have happened, but it didn't know whether it was going to happen, and that in any event could have been cured.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.271" offset="4270346">The issue before this Court is the application of these general principles to the specific statutory scheme of 12 U.S.C. 1818(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.750" offset="4312246">Appellee Mr. Mallen contends that the statute is deficient in both respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.325" offset="4342548">There is no statutory assurance of a hearing at a meaningful time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.449" offset="4367103">As a matter of fact, and I believe we have a fact question here, Mr. Mallen was not going to have a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.883" offset="4396778">In response to some questions asked by the Court, the notice to suspend Mr. Mallen was issued on January 20th, 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.564" offset="4447560">It was served upon him on January 26th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.438" offset="4459054">On January 30th, Mr. Mallen's attorney requested an immediate hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.594" offset="4479639">The statute says, the hearing will take place within 30 days, the decision will be rendered within an additional 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.871" offset="4512762">On January 30th Mr. Mallen's attorney requested an immediate hearing on February 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.197" offset="4538049">Mr. Mallen's criminal trial at this point was scheduled to commence on March 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.678" offset="4559991">In a series of correspondence between the agency and Mr. Mallen's attorney it was finally resolved by the agency that they would afford Mr. Mallen his hearing some time on February 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.782" offset="4624462">The agency refused to make any representations whatsoever as to how much of the additional 60 days the agency would take or require in order to render a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.932" offset="4673049">Sixty days from February 20th is April 20th, which is approximately a month after Mr. Mallen's criminal trial has ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.227" offset="4706173">When the Federal District Court declared the statute unconstitutional on February 17 of 1987, the FDIC asked the judge to reconsider the decision, and at that point said they would afford Mr. Mallen an expedited hearing and an expedited decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.125" offset="4785794">The dates presented by the FDIC to Judge O'Brien would have given Mr. Mallen a decision on his case on April 8th, which was approximately three weeks after his criminal trial ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.353" offset="4846711">The date of the criminal trial is important because the criminal trial, regardless of the way it is resolved, avoids the necessity of convening any hearing at all or if the hearing has been convened but a decision has not been rendered, it avoids the necessity of rendering a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.548" offset="4927482">Had Mr. Mallen been acquitted, the suspension would have dissolved of its own weight pursuant to the language of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.451" offset="10371087">First, the suspension that is imposed under Section 1818(g) is not a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.636" offset="10399822">It is a preventive measure to get an indicted officer out of the bank while the criminal process is under way to protect the shareholders and to protect public confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.553" offset="10455515">There are two ways in which the indicted officer can get back into the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.831" offset="10480592">He can be acquitted, or the FDIC through the FDIC process can decide that it is in fact safe for him to go back.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="2600.514" offset="10527299">Well, if he were acquitted he wouldn't necessarily be entitlted to return to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.261" offset="10550287">The FDIC might still remove him.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="2615.289" offset="10586440">Well, nevertheless, he wouldn't be automatically entitled to go back.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_c_harrison" startTime="2619.928" stopTime="2834.888">
            <label>Mr. John C. Harrison</label>
            <text syncTime="2619.928" offset="10605040">--That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.225" offset="10606189">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.646" offset="10607861">The suspension would be over, however, and there are two process processes that can end the suspension, but the suspension continues until one of them... quite reasonably continues until one of them decides that the suspension can come to an end, and the suggestion that it is necessary to have a hearing on all the possible issues, that every way in which the suspension could be brought to an end has to be decided for there to be meaningful process, is just not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.587" offset="10727606">What Mallen is suggesting is that it is very important for the FDIC's decision to be reconsidered rather than some other way of ending the suspension to take effect, and that is just not sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.331" offset="10786643">As Ms. Curtin explained in explaining why this case is not moot, Section 1818(g) has significant consequences that Section 1829 does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.874" offset="10836798">We agree that the Section 1829 bar attaches as soon as a judgment of conviction is entered in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.434" offset="10866996">That does not end the Section 1818(g) suspension and it does not make the Section 1818(g) suspension unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.617" offset="10899805">In particular under Section 1818(g), as Ms. Curtin explained, the indicted officer can't participate in the conduct of the affairs of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.176" offset="10933973">In Mallen's case that meant that he couldn't act as the controlling shareholder of the holding company that ran the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.844" offset="10968664">Obviously, it may be extremely important to get the dominant figure out of the bank pending the resolution to criminal charges, and it is just as important to get him out of his position of control from which he can direct what the bank does as it actually to stop him being an officer or director.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.774" offset="11044419">So, Section 1818(g) not only has a consequence that Section 1829 doesn't have that continues past conviction in the District Court, but a very important consequence, and one that in this case was very important until the bank was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.143" offset="11109830">Now, even after the bank has been closed, Section 1818(g) has collateral consequences, as we explain in Footnotes 10 and 12 of our main brief and Footnote 2 of our reply brief that keep the case alive and not moot, but not only... the bank is open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.370" offset="11178793">Not only is it not moot, it is really very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.416" offset="11190914">Also, the discussion that Ms. Curtin gave of the need for larger and more rapid post-suspension proceedings ignores the fact that the FDIC is proceeding into the suspension on the basis of the indictment, and acts as if when the indictment is entered that is just the trigger for the FDIC to inquire into whether it would be safe for the indicted officer to remain at the bank, but the premise of the statute is that the indictment creates a danger and that that's the mean reason that the FDIC imposes the suspension, and the suggestion that there is a lot to be asked about about what other grounds the FDIC may have had for thinking that the indictment creates a threat to the interests of depositors or a threat to public confidence is just not persuasive, and in this case Mallen obviously knew why he had been indicted, and in fact knew a great deal about the FDIC's reservations about his conduct at the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.248" offset="11450258">If there are no further questions.</text>
