            <text syncTime="87.789" offset="478261">Petitioner was convicted of three counts of first degree murder, and with the Court's permission I propose to begin with the facts and the legal argument relating to the first issue, which concerns coercive procedures threatening the impartiality of the jury during the sentencing phase and then move later to the facts and legal argument on the second point, which is premised on the absence of a meaningful finding of at least one valid statutory aggravating circumstance at the sentencing phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.195" offset="619949">During the sentencing phase on the second day of deliberations after about nine hours a note came from the jury indicating that the jurors were in great distress, there was a great unbalance in the voting, and that the jurors were unable to reach a decision at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.693" offset="693928">The Court then undertook a procedure whereby each juror was asked to put his name on a piece of paper indicating yes or no as to whether further deliberations would be helpful in obtaining a verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.831" offset="1554401">Now, in assessing whether or not the procedures used here had a coercive tendency, it is necessary to consider that the jury in a capital sentencing hearing is peculiarly sensitive to being swayed by pressures from the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.228" offset="1636008">Unlike a guilt determination, where a jury is determining, based on what it sees and hears, some objective fact in deciding whether to impose the death penalty the jurors are formulating a reasoned moral response and engaging in highly subjective, unique, individualized assessment of whether a particular person deserves to die, and here the reliability of this sensitive and unique procedure and inquiry was threatened by the pressure which was inevitably placed on those four minority jurors and later one lone juror who had to publicly identify themselves as being opposed to the continuation of deliberations.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.367" offset="2788635">In this case we certainly submit that there was a risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.520" offset="2809219">And the risk was especially serious in light of the finality of the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.907" offset="2834715">As the Court indicated in Booth against Maryland regarding victim impact statements, the Court must avoid the risk that a death sentence will be based on considerations that are constitutionally irrelevant or impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.767" offset="2898140">An analogy may be drawn to the Bruten case or the recent Cruz case this Court decided where the Court also talked about risks, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant that the practical and human limitations on the jury system cannot be ignored, so that if this one lone juror was opposed to the death sentence, and it is apparent that somebody was, because otherwise there would have been a unanimous verdict, so that would indicate that that juror was one who indicated that there should be a cessation, and therefore there should be a life sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.794" offset="3766346">--That's correct, Your Honor, but I think that compared, for example, to Brasfield, there the Court did not ascertain which side each one on the count was.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.751" offset="3814097">Here, we knew which jurors wanted to continue, which jurors didn't want to continue, and there were two polls, and it was followed by the admonition to come and reach a just verdict, and under those circumstances I would respectfully submit not that Allen charges should be banned in all cases, for example, in a guilt phase trial where the societal purpose to do so, avoiding retrials, but that in a sentencing phase of a capital punishment situation the Court should impose some limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.739" offset="3946068">Those limits are not intrusive, and do not... would not interfere with the effective conduct of sentencing phase proceedings, particularly where you have a statute, as you do in Louisiana, as you do in three other states, Florida and others we have cited in our brief, where Supreme Courts have held that giving an Allen charge in the face of such a statute has a tendency to coerce and have reversed death sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.671" offset="4041781">I would like, if I may, to turn to the second point, which is that at the end of the guilt or innocence phase trial the Court instructed the jury in accordance with the Louisiana code that in order to convict for first degree murder it must find that the defendant had a specific intent to kill or inflict bodily harm on more than one person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.719" offset="4134045">The trial judge also cautioned the jury at the guilt phase, and this is important because it shows that in making this finding the jury was not making the individualized assessment of whether or not the death sentence was reasonably justified during the guilt phase, the trial judge said, you are not to discuss in any way the possibility of any penalties whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.217" offset="4224011">It is only in the event the jury reaches a verdict of first degree murder that there is any subsequent hearing dealing with the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.388" offset="4252641">At the separate sentencing hearing, the prosecutor told the jury that one of the statutory aggravating circumstances on which the state was relying was that the offender knowingly created a risk of death or great bodily harm to more than one person, and then said, now you will notice that is also an element of first degree murder that you have already found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.604" offset="4353578">On two of the counts that was the only aggravating circumstance found, and on the other count a second circumstance was found and set aside by the Supreme Court of Lousiana so that the sole aggravating circumstance supporting the death sentence was the same as the element already found, as the prosecutor told the jury, in order to convict for first degree murder--</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.870" offset="4442604">Based on these facts, we contend that as applied to petitioner, the Louisiana capital punishment scheme failed to meet the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments requirement of providing a meaningful basis for distinguishing the cases in which the death penalty is imposed from those in which it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.248" offset="4516164">Following Furman, Louisiana enacted a mandatory scheme which was struck down in Roberts where the Court, the plurality opinion said that this procedure lacks standards to guide the jury in selecting among first degree murderers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.310" offset="4584396">And that standard is not met by the circumstances here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.579" offset="4601428">And the Court said as to the North Carolina scheme in Woodson,</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.415" offset="4616788">"There are no standards provided to guide the jury in the exercise of its power to select those first degree murderers who will receive the death sentence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.771" offset="4658166">Now, Louisiana sought to cure this deficiency by requiring at least one statutory aggravating circumstanace to be found at the sentencing stage, modeling its scheme after Gray, and as this Court stated in Zant, the approval in Gregg of Georgia's capital punishment scheme rested on the feature being that the jury was required to find at least one valid statutory aggravating circumstance and to identify it in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.190" offset="4775926">Not only was it essential to have aggravating circumstances, but a fundamental requirement was that each statutory aggravating circumstance satisfy a constitutional standard derived from the principles of Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.450" offset="4832873">The Court would not have been concerned with the standards for aggravating circumstance if that were not an essential element of a constitutional death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.073" offset="4871430">And as the Court said in Zant, the aggravating circumstance must genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.816" offset="4922421">Since, as this Court held, the aggravating circumstance must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on petitioner than others found guilty of first degree murder, that narrowing and channeling function cannot be fulfilled meaningfully where precisely the same circumstance is an element of the finding of guilt of first degree murder in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.316" offset="6580360">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address at this time the second phase of the two issues, the constitutionality of the Louisiana state statute on the death penalty, and go back to the first issue afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.313" offset="6656324">The allegations by petitioner make it clear that they feel that the Louisiana statute should fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.236" offset="6696031">Louisiana is one of those states that chose to narrow the threshold for those crimes that can be determined to be and carry with them the possibility of a death sentence in the definitive stage of their statute, and in doing so they... in this definitive stage Louisiana has said that capital murder, or in this case first degree murder, is defined as three circumstances or facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.523" offset="6821209">Those facts, of those three facts... correction, five circumstances or facts... this case deals with the third factor, that is, the intentional killing of a person with a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm to one or more persons... to more than one person, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.553" offset="6909294">I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.072" offset="6915459">The state statute by setting that out has in effect narrowed the threshold, the requirement of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, by saying that you can only have first degree murder when you find this particular small, narrow threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.534" offset="6993304">That is, you must find first the guilt of someone who commits this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.806" offset="7022352">We maintain that that, in the case of Zant and Jurek and Gregg, that the states were not required to have the aggravating circumstances per se in the death penalty phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.565" offset="7081389">Louisiana is a bifurcated state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.065" offset="7091420">That is to say, we have a statute of the criminal court... correction, of the criminal code which sets out in Article 905 those provisions which are required for a sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.146" offset="7167697">We maintain that the narrowing necessary to meet Eighth Amendment statute was done in the definitional stage of the crime, particularly in this particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.871" offset="7214613">After Jurek, Zant came, and we maintain that this narrowing is sufficient in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.226" offset="7252021">The Criminal Code of Procedure, which is a procedure act, sets out the policy and the rules for governing the sentencing phase of the Louisiana statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.050" offset="7303325">And in the Louisiana statute in the sentencing phase the Court goes further than just mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.223" offset="7340001">It adds, the law adds that the jury must consider, it must find at least one aggravating circumstance from a list of ten enumerated in the statute along with a consideration of all the mitigating circumstances that are enumerated plus any other that the defendant may present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.373" offset="7440625">We maintain that this narrowing, if you will, although it may be the same or similar to the definitional phase of the crime which is outlined in the definition of the crime, although it may be the same or similar, its use is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.458" offset="7544906">The jury is told that they must find in writing one, at least one aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.213" offset="7583985">The Louisiana sentencing procedure forces that jury to use as a threshold that particular aggravating circumstance to channel and focus its view of the individuality of the crime and the punishment of that particular defendant along with all of the mitigating circumstances that are enumerated and any that he may bring up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.798" offset="7690355">But it is not a requirement of the Eighth Amendment, a constitutional requirement, that the State of Louisiana must say that this additional narrowing, if you will, must fall because it is identical to, similar to the initial narrowing in the definitional phase of the statute, which in this case is the killing of two or more persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.550" offset="7809369">We maintain that the Louisiana statute, by having this additional narrowing in the penalty phase, goes beyond the requirement of what the Eighth Amendment maintains is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.477" offset="7869033">It goes beyond the mere killing of people arbitrarily or capriciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.415" offset="7900798">It narrows that class to only those death eligible persons who meet the elements of the crime as outlined in the definition of first degree murder, in this case Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.294" offset="7968298">The Louisiana Supreme Court has compared those two particular statutes to being used together in parallel with the guilt phase of the definition phase being used by the jury to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the state must prove each and every element of the crime, and in the definitional phase it is used for guilt for the narrowing of the class of persons who would be death eligible, and in the penalty phase it merely is a tool to assist the jury in its discretion in determining which defendant should die and which should live.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.327" offset="8172471">Both of these statutes, even though they are similar, do not in any way take away the narrowing effect of the definition of the crime of murder as set out in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.454" offset="8240912">The fact that the aggravating circumstance is the same does not in any way lessen the narrowness of the class, which is all that is required in the Eighth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2133.339" offset="8660439">As a matter of fact, the state has a legitimate reason, a valid reason to use a modified Allen charge even in a sentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.746" offset="8706101">After all, jurors have taken an oath, they have taken an oath of responsibility to reach a verdict, to attempt to reach a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.835" offset="8738493">In a capital case, that oath is even more severe because they are deciding life or death of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.906" offset="8766705">The jury as a representative of the people, maybe the conscience of the community, has in fact the life or death of an individual person in their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.047" offset="8807351">In Louisiana, the judge in this case was well within his discretion when for the first time this jury indicated that it had any problem at all, he called in... and that was done by virtue of the note that came in at 3:00 o'clock on the afternoon of the 16th of April, the judge then called the defense attorney and the prosecuting attorney to discuss how they would handle the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.746" offset="8910065">On Page 52 of the joint appendix you will see discussion about the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.685" offset="8937859">It was stipulated between counsel and the judge that this procedure of polling would be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.422" offset="8964817">It was stipulated that he would call the jurors in, that they would be asked whether or not any further deliberation would be useful, and it was further stipulated that the charge to be given if the Court determined that there would be more deliberation would be the last portion of the original charge, now referred to as the modified Allen charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.406" offset="9068785">It is important to understand that this was the first time this jury had indicated it was having any problem, and the charge, the so-called Allen charge was only given one time other than in the original charge to the jury when they went out to deliberate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.728" offset="9614013">The stipulation was agreed to by the counsel as well as the so-called Allen charge, and what is more important here, Your Honor, is that the jury did not know about it, and that the time sequence that we are talking about where they talk about the eight and four and the eleven and one, what took place in reality was, when the tally was made, the tally was made of the eight and four, they were talking to the judge in open court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.131" offset="9727697">The jury was in the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.347" offset="9736475">At that time the defense attorney asked the judge that he would like to reurge his motion for a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.237" offset="9768031">The judge then ordered the jury removed for the purpose of hearing the motion for the mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.426" offset="9796870">As the jury left, it was being removed for that purpose, almost immediately the second note came saying that some of the jurors misunderstood.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.102" offset="9855488">And that recount, the judge called them back, put them back in the box, gave them the same question, changed it slightly so that they would not misunderstand it, and the count was eleven to one to continue the deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.480" offset="9929049">That is when the judge, based on the stipulation of what he would do, gave the so-called Allen charge, which was really a portion of the original charge, and there was no objection by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.372" offset="9976592">The reason I bring up there was no objection by a defendant at that time was not so much that he couldn't object now but to show that there was no atmosphere of coercion, there was no atmosphere of this Court or this judge or anyone trying to pressure this jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.349" offset="10052556">If you look at the Allen charge that was given, the judge reiterates the fact that this jury is not required, if they are unable to reach a unanimous decision, that the Court would sentence the defendant to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.997" offset="10127162">Further on, in the bottom of the charge, the judge says, do not surrender your honest belief merely, in effect merely for the purpose of rendering a verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.939" offset="10194871">The thing that makes this important is that if we read it as an entire... in its entirety considering the circumstance, it is not anywhere near the objectionable items of so-called Allen charges in the past or in Braswell cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.068" offset="10371355">As a matter of fact, this particular case was the killing of five people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.189" offset="10391835">This jury had deliberated and determined that two of those homicides were not first degree, but would be manslaughter, and that three would be first degree murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="2579.699" offset="10445960">One lady got three shots, two in the chest and one in the head, while she was running, in the back of the head, one in the face, one in the side of the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.054" offset="10487338">These jurors were then instructed in the penalty phase that they must consider death or life imprisonment on all three of those separate counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.910" offset="10522760">We don't know what went on in that jury room, whether one juror said, well, I am not interested in this being a death penalty or this not being one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.468" offset="10564974">The question before the Court concerning coercion of this jury is similar to the one the Court used in, although it has nothing to do with polling or Allen charge, but that the Court used in Brown versus California, where the entire instruction and the entire structure that was given was looked at to see if a reasonable juror would have been affected by this type charge under these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.068" offset="11919371">But you are coming before us and the graveman of your complaint is that... what, that you were not allowed to tell the jury how cruel your client was, or that the prosecutor was not allowed to tell the jury how cruel your client was?</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.975" offset="11970989">Why do you have any standing to complain about the jury's... I would think you would delight in the fact that the jury cannot consider aggravating circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.814" offset="12002336">The basis for our claim, Your Honor, is that the jury did not meaningfully undertake to engage in a fresh finding of fact regarding this aggravating circumstance, and where you have a jury which deliberated for ten hours it certainly cannot be a foregone conclusion that if they had been directed to make a meaningful finding and hadn't been told by the prosecutor that they had already found that so they don't have to bother with it again, what that result might be, and where there is a legal element which is lacking in the procedure, particularly in a death sentence case, that does not seem to me to be the kind of thing, as the Court indicated, for example, in Gray against Mississippi, that should be... that is so basic that it should not be treated as a harmless error type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.291" offset="12276308">If I may just say a word about the Sumner case, which Your Honor asked me about earlier, the Court there in its analysis as well as its holding focused only on the discretionary aspect of the proceeding, that is, that mitigating circumstances regarding character and record of the offender and so forth were not allowed to be considered, and neither the Court's analysis nor the holding focused on whether, if there had been mitigating circumstances allowed, and you just have sitting out there a mandatory death sentence in a particular circumstance, and there it was extremely narrow, only where someone is serving a life sentence, and you had mitigating circumstances, whether or not the Court would nevertheless continue to hold, as it has emphasized in numerous cases since Furman, that there is a necessity for finding beyond a reasonable doubt a specified statutory aggravating circumstance in order to perform this narrowing and channeling function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.501" offset="12537115">In Nevada, there was an indication that the statute defined capital murder, and it is not clear whether the jury when it was considering whether to find the defendant guilty of capital murder from the decision, the court didn't focus on it, whether the jury was engaged in the individualized assessment and process of determining whether the death sentence was reasonably justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.051" offset="12635335">Indeed, it may well have done so, but in our case it is clear that the jury was told at the guilt phase that it is not to consider sentencing, and it is not to engage in that kind of process of deciding whether death was reasonably justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.513" offset="12705134">It is clear from, for example, Adams against Texas, from Zant, that the process of assessing or considering mitigating circumstances involves a wide range of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.106" offset="12763544">In the Furman case and all the cases since then have indicated that there must be some kind of procedure, some element, some keystone for channeling and narrowing on the basis of standards on a reasonable basis there is discretion, and that, we submit, was not done here.</text>
