            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="139704">Mr. Farr, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="13.641" stopTime="189.321">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="13.641" offset="194248">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="33.721" offset="274496">Our disagreement with the Fifth Circuit decision in this case rests upon two basic grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.743" offset="314620">First, we think that final judgments should not be set aside because of after the fact recusal motions, unless there is a showing of actual judicial impropriety.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.050" offset="359864">Second, we think that such relief is particularly inappropriate when at the time of judgment that the district judge did not even know of possible grounds for recusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.208" offset="412527">Because a judge without knowledge cannot possibly favor one side or the other, it is in fact is more unfair in this case to throw out the judgment than it is to give it effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.785" offset="470832">Now I would like to just spend a few minutes at the outset on the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.356" offset="497059">The findings made by a separate district judge showed that at the time that he rendered his judgment and at the relevant time that the case was before him, that Judge Collins had no recollection of and no knowledge of any discussions between Petitioner and Loyola University regarding the possible purchase of some Loyola land.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.375" offset="605102">The judge found that there were numerous individuals who had been discussing the possible purchase with Loyola, and that Judge Collins did not have any recollection that Petitioner was among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.683" offset="654421">Now the Court will recall that this case did not involve Loyola University in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.770" offset="682737">Loyola was not a party to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.954" offset="695485">Its land was never mentioned in the case, and its interest was never mentioned in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.708" offset="718473">There was some discussion of land in the opinion, but that is completely different land that has nothing to do with Loyola University.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.481" offset="757552">Judge Collins was said to have known at an earlier time, because he was present at some board meetings where the matter was discussed and after his judgment, but the specific finding is that at the time of his judgment that he did not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.176" offset="824321">Now I should take this opportunity to correct a statement that I did make at the first argument, which is that he did not have earlier knowledge either.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.198" offset="856400">The Court did find that he had had earlier knowledge, but said that at the time that the case was before him that he did not have any knowledge of these discussions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="189.321" stopTime="193.875">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="189.321" offset="896942">Was the finding that he did not know or that he did not remember?</text>

          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="193.875" stopTime="195.141">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="193.875" offset="915123">I am sorry.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="195.141" stopTime="198.177">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="195.141" offset="920243">Was the finding that he did not know or that he did not remember?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="198.177" stopTime="299.109">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="198.177" offset="932364">Well, I think both.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.279" offset="936752">I think that the specific finding actually is stated in terms of knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.481" offset="957546">But I think that it is implicit in that that he would not have remembered any earlier information that he might have had by virtue of having attended the board meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.187" offset="992445">Now the Fifth Circuit did not reverse its finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.673" offset="1018359">In fact, it reaffirmed that Judge Collins did not know at the time of his judgment about the discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.012" offset="1047720">What it held was simply that the judgment had to be set aside, because in effect he should have known.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.968" offset="1079485">Now in discussing this decision, I would like to begin with what I think is an obvious but important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.141" offset="1120236">That the question here is not simply one of getting another judge at the beginning of the case, which is what Section 455 is basically aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.781" offset="1178751">The question here is one of setting aside a final judgment based on a motion that was made after the judgment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.708" offset="1226502">Now usually, this Court has set a high threshold for claims raised for the first time after judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.045" offset="1255864">There are, of course, plain error rules on appeal and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.730" offset="1270597">And for Rule 60(b)(6), which is the rule under which this particular motion has been made, usually the Court has required a showing of exceptional circumstances before it would find a basis for a judgment being set aside.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="299.109" stopTime="308.231">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="299.109" offset="1336112">Mr. Farr, can I interrupt you.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.026" offset="1343740">If you draw the line at when the judgment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.078" offset="1355965">Can you refresh my recollection, what was the date on which this judgment was entered?</text>

            <text syncTime="308.231" offset="1372579">The judge signed the judgment on the 12th of March, and the judgment was entered formally on the 16th.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.307" offset="1428899">The date that the Court is using is the 24th of March, perhaps the 25th, but I think the 24th.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="328.461" stopTime="336.199">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="328.461" offset="1453454">And my question is what in your view was the Trial Judge's duty under the statute at that point in time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="336.199" stopTime="355.962">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="336.199" offset="1484488">I do not think that the judge in the case after the judgment essentially had been entered had any specific duty under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.555" offset="1517924">I think, frankly, that it would have been better practice, since it was so close to the time of judgment, if he had informed the parties, but it would not make any difference to our position in this case even if he had.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="366.118" offset="1604128">That it was too late?</text>

            <text syncTime="366.586" offset="1606009">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.070" offset="1607890">I mean what we are talking about here is essentially a situation where he enters a judgment and he decides a case, and he has no reason to favor one party or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.109" offset="1644044">And although, as I say, that I think that it would have been better practice had he made that clear eight days later, it would not have made any difference to the decision.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="386.482" stopTime="393.820">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="388.434" offset="1693363">I guess that there were just a couple of days before he got those letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.035" offset="1703812">And that would have been a critical difference too, I guess.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.105" offset="1724083">I guess that it depends whether we are talking a couple of days meaning before he had entered judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.991" offset="1743622">I think in that case, because the case would have still have been before him, that he would have not entered a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.997" offset="1771626">I think that at that point that he might well have had a duty to step aside and let another judge take over at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.638" offset="1826169">The only reason in fact that I used the phrase "might well" is that there is the unusual circumstance in this case that he did announce his ruling from the bench.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.463" offset="7153477">We submit to Your Honors that the single most important finding of fact by the Fifth Circuit was its finding that the public would not believe the Judge Collins forgot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.271" offset="7204782">If the public would not believe that Judge Collins forgot, it would therefore believe that his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.329" offset="7240935">And it would therefore believe that the judgment was tainted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.281" offset="7256817">And the requirements of 455(a) would then have been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.899" offset="7275208">And that was basically, I believe, the foundation of the Fifth Circuit's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.803" offset="7298822">The Fifth Circuit also said that the judge erred in failing to recuse himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.900" offset="8043208">In other words, it seems to me, Justice Scalia, that if a judge could just keep to himself some interest that would require his recusal under 455(a), if he could just keep it to himself under after the judgment is rendered, all is well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.448" offset="11313425">But again, I must stress the fact that we did not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.516" offset="11321680">When I say we, HSAC did not know of Loyola's connection with this proceeding until ten months after the Court of Appeals, the U.S. Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.741" offset="11366610">I would also like to point out one thing that I think also is very worthy of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.664" offset="11410287">And that is that 455 applies to criminal cases as well as applying to civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.519" offset="11437768">I think that if we were to give the interpretation that Petitioners wish to give to 455, then in U.S. v. Brown, the Defendant would still be in jail, or at least he would have served out his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.779" offset="11494819">Because despite the fact that there was a great impropriety in that case, the judgment had already been rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.266" offset="11520733">It was some time eight years later between the time that the man was tried and the time of the reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.920" offset="11547377">He would still be in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.872" offset="11555110">Because it was not a case of actual bias, he could not proceed that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.591" offset="11570052">It was a remark that the judge made that did not come to light until after the trial, four years I believe it was after the trial was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.179" offset="11604324">So if we give the construction to this statute that once judgment is rendered that that is it, or once an appeal is exhausted that that is it, then I submit to Your Honors that an injustice in the criminal field as well as the civil could well take place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.410" offset="11789271">This judge in effect acted as a judge in his own case, once simply by saying I do not remember or I forget is taken as the basis for saying that he would not be responsible under 455(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.394" offset="11897209">To the contrary, the Fifth Circuit finding that the public would not believe that he was impartial said that he because of constructive knowledge, things that he should have known, that he had a duty to inquire into, Justice O'Connor, under (c), requires that he be found to have had the requisite knowledge to indicate his impartiality under 455(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.414" offset="12013297">The record clearly establishes that Justice Collins attended board meetings on these three occasions that I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.189" offset="12076409">Again I wish to particularly stress the November 21, 1981 board meeting, twenty-nine days before he ruled on a preliminary matter in this case, which you will find on page one of the joint appendix, within twenty-nine days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.818" offset="12146940">We, and when I say we, the members of the public have to ask ourselves if we were on a board of trustees that was getting ready to sell a piece of property that had discussed at a number of meetings that we attended, that was one of the principal assets of this institution that we serve, and the surrounding land was going to be increased in value by $9 million, and we voted on the motion to renew the negotiations with these people, Liljeberg and St. Jude, would be twenty-nine days later remember that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.545" offset="12309840">I think that we would.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.378" offset="12317154">And I think that under that construction, that the court properly found that the public would not believe Judge Collins forgot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.852" offset="12363025">Thus, it is not a question really of whether he knew or he did not know, or whether he forgot or he did not forget.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.958" offset="12391446">It is a question of whether the public would find that based upon the relevant objective facts that it appeared that the judge was not impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.349" offset="12449020">From the beginning, this Court has said that justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.443" offset="12501474">And that the imprimatur must be placed on a sound judicial system that has the support of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.666" offset="12546300">And I believe that that was the purpose of 455(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.552" offset="12565840">455(a) is not to be applied in a speculative manner, not just any situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.974" offset="12595515">Not just something, Justice Scalia, that it seems to me involves something quite minor should be used to try to set aside a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.747" offset="12634594">I certainly do not think that that was the meaning that was ever intended to be given to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.418" offset="12653297">But in a situation of extreme facts, strong facts, compelling facts, as we have in this case, that is the only vehicle by which we can preserve our right to a fair trial, if you will, a fair trial in a fair tribunal, which after all is the purpose of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.787" offset="12778790">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.389" offset="12789239">Counsel talked briefly about Aetna Life Insurance v. Lavoie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.043" offset="12815779">And I think that the decision of this Court in that case points out what I think is a very important part of this case, which is that there is a difference between a judge who sits knowing of a possible interest and a judge who sits when he does not know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.885" offset="12871159">In Lavoie, the Court did hold that one of the Justices of the Alabama Supreme Court should be disqualified, because he sat knowing of an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.193" offset="12916403">The Court was also asked, however, to disqualify all of the other judges of the Court because they were class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.080" offset="12940017">And in discussing that claim, this Court pointed out that they were not even aware of any interest in the case when they sat on it up until the time of the rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.472" offset="12981500">And the Court assumed, and I think correctly, that they could not have had any reason to be biased, at least up to the time that they knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.375" offset="13013160">I think that what this case really is coming down to from the gist of Respondent's argument is the question as to whether you believe Judge Collins or not, and he says that reasonable people in this case will not believe him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.568" offset="13069898">And if in fact he did something wrong, certainly the judgment should be thrown out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.837" offset="13087035">But the question is what facts do you have to follow through on in order to reach that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.693" offset="13118382">You have to assume, first of all, that Judge Collins sat in a case violating his judicial oath, knowing that a university that he served as a trustee had an interest, and yet sat to favor that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.135" offset="13180240">When it was called to his attention eighteen months later in a motion, he falsely denied that he knew about it.</text>
