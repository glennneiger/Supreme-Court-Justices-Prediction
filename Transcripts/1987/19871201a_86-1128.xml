            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text syncTime="13.141" offset="189921">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.991" offset="193265">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case raises the issue of when a reviewing court can compel the immigration authorities to reopen a deportation proceeding for an evidentiary hearing after the alien has already been given a hearing and after an order of deportation has been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.202" offset="274140">The context in which the issue arises is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.439" offset="291067">Respondent has been here illegally for almost 12 years, since 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.510" offset="315309">His deportation hearing was held in 1982, and involved five appearances before the immigration judge between 1981 and 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.199" offset="354075">Respondent, who was represented by competent counsel at the hearing, declined to seek asylum despite specific questioning by the immigration judge on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.988" offset="393259">In 1985, respondent filed a motion to reopen to apply for asylum and withholding of deportation based on an event that occurred in 1984, namely, a visit to respondent by a Ghanian official who was also respondent's personal friend, and I will have more to say about this event later in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.170" offset="478000">The issue of the extent of deference in the context of a motion to reopen has been addressed by this Court three times in the immigration context, in Jong Ha Wang, in Rios-Pineda, and in Phinpathya.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.145" offset="533902">These cases emphasize the great deference that must be given to the Board of Immigration appeals in its decision not to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.183" offset="566085">The Court has emphasized the importance of finality and has pointed out that in this context reopening is not required by statute but is purely a product of regulation, and in fact the regulation itself does not mandate reopening in any particular circumstance, but rather, as the Court noted, is framed in the negative.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="126.330" stopTime="133.318">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="126.330" offset="642676">Mr. Klonoff, then reopening is not a procedure provided for by statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="133.318" stopTime="308.130">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text syncTime="133.318" offset="670574">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.068" offset="673605">It is purely a matter of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.168" offset="681964">And this Court has made that clear in Jong Ha Wang in its discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.805" offset="704534">Notwithstanding this Court's decision, the Ninth Circuit held, contrary to the BIA, that respondent had alleged a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum, and that an evidentiary hearing was therefore required.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.897" offset="760854">As a result of the Ninth Circuit's holding, the entire process will begin anew, including possible appeals, even though the deportation hearing was held more than five years ago, and even though the only fact that was offered by respondent in support of his motion to reopen is one that even the Ninth Circuit itself said could be viewed as ambiguous or benign.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.311" offset="846535">Now, if I could just elaborate briefly on some of the facts that are critical to this case, as I said, respondent entered the United States originally in 1965, approximately ten years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.636" offset="895854">He left briefly during the summer of 1973, and the returned on a visa that was good until 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.391" offset="930859">In 1981, while respondent was here illegally, he pleaded guilty to three narcotics offenses, and based on his plea of guilty to those offenses, the Immigration and Naturalization Service instituted deportation proceedings and those proceedings in fact resulted in hearings that occurred between November and July, November, 1981, and July, 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.126" offset="1029810">There were five separate appearances.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.292" offset="1038483">The continuances on each occasion being at respondent's request.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.380" offset="1058859">One of the continuances in the case, from November 10th, 1981, to January 11th, 1982, appears to have been requested in part so that respondent could prepare an application for asylum and withholding of deportation, and in fact respondent's counsel specifically represented to the immigration judge that such an application would be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.359" offset="1138793">Respondent ultimately chose not to seek asylum or withholding of deportation, and he was consequently found deportable in July, 1982, and that decision was affirmed by the BIA in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.501" offset="1191352">In February, 1985, while that appeal was pending in the Ninth Circuit, respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.159" offset="1237954">As respondent concedes, the only new fact that relates to the respondent other than just the general events in Ghana was this visit from the Ghanian official, and it is significant to note that although this visit occurred in the spring of 1984, respondent waited almost an entire year until February, 1985, before seeking reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.857" offset="1328756">There is no dispute that this individual who made the visit is someone who respondent had known for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.678" offset="1356027">The additional fact which--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="308.130" offset="1369820">Mr. Klonoff, is that new evidence not available before within them engaging of the regulation, do you suppose?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="315.986" stopTime="331.728">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text syncTime="315.986" offset="1401272">--It probably was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.920" offset="1409004">Since the deportation hearing occurred in 1982, and since the visit did not occur until 1984, this was new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.109" offset="1445784">We have a serious dispute with the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that it was material evidence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="331.728" stopTime="338.834">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="331.728" offset="1464174">So you think it was new evidence not available before, but you take the position that it just wasn't material.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff" startTime="338.834" stopTime="376.440">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text syncTime="338.834" offset="1492596">That's exactly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.150" offset="1497925">The old facts which were in existence at the time respondent chose not to play or as you in essentially involved allegations involving his brother and other close associates in terms of their associations with prior regimes in Ghana and the fact that those individuals may well be in danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.532" offset="1587472">It is important to note, as the BIA pointed out in its opinion, that respondent doesn't explain how the risk to those individuals would necessarily translate into a risk to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.405" offset="1630940">Respondent now concedes--</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.690" offset="4672116">The second point that the Ninth Circuit held in reviewing these cases is that when the board reviews a motion to reopen, it has to give the alien all inferences or all benefits of the doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.173" offset="4973987">There is nothing in the opinion to suggest that the board was applying the same standard here, and a couple of other points are quite significant in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.029" offset="5005438">As we have noted in our reply brief, in the Court of Appeals, respondent clearly indicated... I believe it was Page 28 of his Court of Appeals brief... that he had no objection whatsoever to the legal principles applied by the BIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.352" offset="5062699">We noted in our Court of Appeals brief that in our interpretation of the BIA's opinion the BIA's was correctly applying the lower standard for asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.894" offset="5100837">We made that quite clear in our brief, and respondent in his reply brief never challenged that and the Court of Appeals never questioned the fact that the Ninth Circuit... or the fact that the Board of Immigration Appeals understood and was applying a lower standard for asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.452" offset="5155067">So would submit that that is simply riot an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.106" offset="5169696">If I could make a few points as to why we disagree on the de novo review point, first of all, as I have noted, this Court has made clear on several occasions that it is not appropriate for the Court to engage in de novo review in these contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.281" offset="5234480">Rios-Pineda could not have been clearer in stating that it is not the function of a court to review the attorney General's decision de novo.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.645" offset="6891897">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, we would like to first state our view of what the Ninth Circuit did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.743" offset="6976325">When we look at the finding of the Circuit Court, we remember basic rules, basic things that we were supposed to be studying in law school, the approach to a case, the approach to resolving a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.276" offset="7078411">In Pullman Standard versus Swint this Court did make reference to this in the context of discussing whether there are mixed questions of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.868" offset="7132746">The approach that was discussed and which we remember from those days, three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.308" offset="7166496">First, there is the establishing of the historical facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.193" offset="7186036">Second, there is selecting the applicable rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.664" offset="7204008">And third is applying the rule of law to the established facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.984" offset="7225219">In the prima facie case test, however, I think one comes through the same steps, but at the first step of establishing the historical evidentiary facts, in the traditional prima facie case test, the adjudicator of the tests does not determine the facts, he or she accepts the facts that have been offered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.975" offset="7473174">This is not in the regulations, as came out in the earlier discussion, when the Attorney General made the regulations he did not state in what instance motions to reopen should be granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2027.231" offset="8246189">If we very carefully examine the BIA decision, we find that the manner in which they interpreted, they, one, chose to interpret, chose to determine, and the manner in which they did determine the motive of the caller from the Ghanian government was the fact that led to their conclusion that this was not... that there had not been a sufficient explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.052" offset="8373562">The Board of Immigration Appeals said we don't think that by itself this visit sufficiently explains failure to raise this earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.879" offset="8424867">And when the Ninth Circuit found that they had determined a fact they shouldn't have determined, and that the facts should be interpreted otherwise, then it became an explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.972" offset="8485157">That answered the question, and there was reference to that in the Circuit Court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.958" offset="8509190">It was not a lengthy reference because it did sort of emerge as self-proving fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.862" offset="8540746">It is our opinion that when we look at these steps in resolving the prima facie case test, we find that what the Ninth Circuit said here basically was, you determined a fact when you weren't supposed to determine it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.776" offset="14080377">Ultimately, as Justices Scalia and O'Connor recognized, the issue is whether the BIA must reopen because of a new fact, whether it is compelled now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.417" offset="14130950">Now, the BIA accepts the fact that the visit occurred, and the questions whether or not that fact is so significant that the BA must give compelling weight to it, and the reason that we are arguing that he BIA should be given leeway in making these judgments is, Number One, because of the expertise that it has in reviewing thousands of cases, an expertise in fact recognized in Cardoza-Fonseca in the decision, making clear that there is a difference between a straight question of statutory interpretation and a question of applying the law to the facts of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.852" offset="14252681">I believe it is Slip Opinion Page 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.721" offset="14264174">And finally, the greatest deference of all because in this situation, as counsel concedes, Congress did not specify the reopening had to be required in any situation whatsoever, and for that reason we would submit a particular degree of deference should be given to the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.064" offset="14329585">Consequently, unless there are any further questions, we would urge that the judgement of the Court of Appeals be reversed.</text>
