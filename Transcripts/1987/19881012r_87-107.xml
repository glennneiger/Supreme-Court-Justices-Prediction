            <text syncTime="57.499" offset="363990">Thus, even if the Court decides to revisit Runyon, I submit that Runyon was correctly decided and should be reaffirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.744" offset="400979">Congressional ratification and stare decisis, as adopted and applied by this Court, require that Runyon be followed and not reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.492" offset="439954">Runyon and Section 1981 have become a significant part of the web of joint congressional and judicial efforts to rid the country of public and private discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.722" offset="496797">Reversing Runyon under these circumstances would not only reject congressional reliance and decisions of the Court but legislation specifically designed by Congress incorporating the Court's decision and attempting to encourage the use and enforcement of Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.665" offset="580597">It would virtually abandon stare decisis as a fundamental doctrine of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.019" offset="605988">Legislative efforts of Congress since Runyon and its precursor, Jones v. Mayer, show a consistent pattern of congressional adoption and ratification of the Court's holdings that Section 1981 prohibits public and private discrimination in contractual dealings.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.133" offset="686446">Three months after the decision in Runyon, Congress passed a law providing attorney fees to encourage enforcement or use of Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.598" offset="728346">The Attorney Fees Act is highly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.809" offset="741198">It is not simply that the Congress was aware of Runyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.803" offset="757185">It is not merely that the Attorney Fees Act shows that Congress approved of Runyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.928" offset="781636">Both points are true, but there's more.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.969" offset="793861">Runyon and Jones were the foundation building blocks for the Attorney Fees Act and its applicability to Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.754" offset="832940">Congress built on Runyon by passing a law that would have made no sense had Runyon not been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.951" offset="869721">That is true because Runyon and Jones held that Sections 1981 and 1982 permitted an individual to use those acts to challenge private discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.590" offset="920294">If Jones and Runyon are now reversed, there would be no basis for lawsuits based on Section 1981 and 1982 in which attorney fees could be awarded if one is successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.480" offset="979853">The Fees Act applies the private attorney general theory under which Congress encouraged private attorneys to use civil rights statutes to vindicate a policy of Congress by providing a fee for litigants who bring Jones and Runyon types of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.434" offset="1071699">Congress asserted that the people who litigate those claims vindicated congressional policy and Congress wanted--</text>

            <text syncTime="261.883" offset="1181518">And without Runyon and without Jones, 1981 and 1982 would be of little value at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.807" offset="1213179">So, Congress noted that one could recover under 1983 in challenging public bodies, and it wanted to encourage the use of 1981 and 1982 to encourage lawsuits challenging private discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.087" offset="1274305">This is of direct congressional endorsement and ratification of Runyon and Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.424" offset="1319654">And I don't know of anything else that Congress could do to tell the Court that it accepted and ratified and wanted to use the Court's decisions to encourage enforcement of 1981 and 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.142" offset="1374511">Congress expressly said we endorse your decision in Jones and Runyon, and we want to build upon it, and we want to encourage private litigants to use this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.012" offset="1426024">As Congressman Drinan said, the way to make that Act effective is to provide attorney fees so that private parties can use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.857" offset="1461342">Now, this is the same, in our position, as Congress expressly enacting 1981 with an attorney fees provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.974" offset="1497809">It endorsed, it encouraged, and it wanted to make that Act a part of the civil rights provisions that would permit one to challenge public and private discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.022" offset="1546083">And reversing Runyon under those circumstances would in our opinion fly right in the face of Congress' efforts to use your decision to prohibit public and private discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.443" offset="1607732">And the way the Court and Congress has worked in this area, where Congress has built on what the Court has decided, to try to rid the country of discriminatory practices would be contrary to decisions that this Court has rendered and every precedent that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.285" offset="1679099">And I don't think that under these circumstances it would be appropriate for the Court to strike that building block that Congress had built to remove Runyon as a means for now challenging private discrimination in contractual matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.602" offset="6204343">And what Congress was looking at in 1866 was a... was a condition in which people were concerned about the Federal Government reaching State practices.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger S. Kaplan</label>
            <text syncTime="1563.113" offset="6386364">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.255" offset="6411024">I think the basic problem in the presentation of the Petitioner's arguments in this case is that they start from the wrong baseline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.871" offset="6449476">Instead of looking to 19... the 1960s or 1970s, I think the proper point of departure is really much earlier date, 1883, when the Court handed down the civil rights cases and indicated in a opinion, which was generally respected for a long time thereafter, that this statute would not reach private acts of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.856" offset="6585417">Many years go by.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.097" offset="6602344">The Nation matures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.060" offset="6610181">We encounter other types of problems, particularly in the area of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.441" offset="6635677">And in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there's a movement in Congress that something has to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.406" offset="6663575">And after four years or so of angst and anger and controversy, Congress comes up with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.995" offset="6717910">I think what we are dealing with here is really the force that sets in motion a pattern of congressional action, a decision that it is the legislative branch which must take control of these things, which must provide the remedies, since none apparently exist, and must control how our society is to develop in terms of meeting racial equality in the work place and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.637" offset="6844552">The problem that I see with these decisions, Runyon in particular, is they threaten this... this orderly development and this appropriate, I think, allocation of authority to Congress to deal with these... with these measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.195" offset="6958759">Title VII, for example, which is the primary statute where these cases really come up, has a different thrust, a different emphasis, than Section 1981.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.059" offset="7042142">To some extent, we have interfered with the function of the Congress and violated to a degree the separation of powers, which is the point you're making I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.628" offset="7092506">But surely you wouldn't say that we should have no stare decisis whatever in the field of statutory construction, would you?</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.813" offset="7193234">I think that what has to be focused on is the impact of this kind of legislation or rule-making evident in Runyon on the operation of Title VII itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.402" offset="7251539">And I think this has been discussed and noted, and I think it bears repeating that what that statute is emphasizing is a conciliatory approach involving a government involvement by the EEOC which is a congressional determination as to how things should operate, and also a specific congressionally determined judicial remedy if that fails, which basically is equitable and remedial, back pay, reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.701" offset="7368777">This rule, the rule of Runyon, allows for punitive damages, for compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.908" offset="7405557">It cuts the EEOC out of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.251" offset="7423007">It doesn't allow it to escape... to shape the scope of investigations and determine how broad the remedies should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.227" offset="7458847">It doesn't certainly encourage a conciliatory approach to settlement of these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.321" offset="7483193">But it also disregards something else in Title VII which is federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.725" offset="7504823">And that statute specifically encouraged the States to pass laws and create agencies to take care of these problems and solve it in its own jurisdiction through the deferral procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.735" offset="7568875">This also threatens that procedure and that concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="3486.330" offset="14079321">That's the heart of the matter, and that's what Congress was trying to reach with 1866 and what Runyon is trying to reach and what the cases subsequent to Runyon is trying to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.197" offset="14122788">In 1976... 1972 and 1964 when Congress was enacting the Title VII or the Civil Rights Act of that time, it was looking at pervasive practices of discrimination, and it wanted to provide a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.427" offset="14183706">And it said it wanted to provide multiple remedies to make it possible for black people and other minorities to challenge this kind of discrimination.</text>
