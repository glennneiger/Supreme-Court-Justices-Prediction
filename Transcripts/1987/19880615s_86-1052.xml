            <text syncTime="15.213" offset="60813">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Appellate Court of Illinois and it concerns the scope of an international treaty called the Hague Service Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.976" offset="107833">The convention prescribes what methods may be use to serve process when there is occasion to transmit a document for service abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.333" offset="145241">Petitioner argues that the convention applies to this case and that the service of process was invalid because it was not in accord with the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.968" offset="183798">In the opinion filed today, we reject petitioner's argument and affirm the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.785" offset="207099">Although the petitioner is a foreign corporation, it owns a subsidiary registered to do business in Illinois and petitioner was served properly by substituted service on its subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.015" offset="256000">Under Illinois law, this service did not require official transmission of documents to the petitioner abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.570" offset="282227">Therefore, the Hague Service Convention does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.182" offset="296647">Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Marshall and Blackmun have joined.</text>
