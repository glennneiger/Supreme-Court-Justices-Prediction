            <text syncTime="62.802" offset="381791">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.629" offset="393076">The facts in this case are simple and not in dispute High's, a building contractor, was engaged by Wilson's, a retailer, to build a department store.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.859" offset="438007">The department store was to be located on a shopping center owned by DeBartolo.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.515" offset="456606">The union had a dispute with High's because it allegedly paid non-union or sub-standard wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.637" offset="481057">The union did not have a dispute with Wilson's.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.589" offset="492864">It did not have a dispute with DeBartolo, and it did not have a dispute with any of the tenant stores, approximately eighty-five tenant stores, that were located on the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.117" offset="527032">Neither DeBartolo nor the tenant stores had any relationship whatsoever with High's.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.020" offset="550647">Now, the union had many ways to express its message, but it did not its message as to High's allegedly substandard wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.361" offset="583979">It did not, however, picket or place any economic pressure whatsoever on High.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.031" offset="602683">It did not boycott or place any economic pressure on Wilson's.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.295" offset="623685">It did not merely publicize to the public the fact that High paid sub-standard wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.449" offset="648345">Instead, the union took a different lack.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.010" offset="658585">For three weeks during the Christmas season, busiest time of the year, the union placed hand billers at all the entrances to the interior mall of the shopping center and urged a total consumer boycott of all the tenants of the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.238" offset="715532">It only stopped when it was enjoined after the Florida courts found irrevocable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.564" offset="736848">In 1983, this Court heard the case and unanimously concluded that the hand billing was not protected by the publicity proviso of Section 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, that the required producer-distributor relationship of that section had not been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.275" offset="803617">The proviso, the Court indicated, was not intended to preclude all types of peaceful, truthful hand billing, only hand billing that met the terms of the proviso, the three terms of the proviso was to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.333" offset="855862">The case was then remanded.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="191.236" offset="895463">Correct, and, if so, whether it was protected by the 1st Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.016" offset="906644">The Labor Board first, there was no dispute, of course, that the union's objective was forbidden and that those tenants were neutral employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.512" offset="948544">The only question, of course, was whether there was coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.496" offset="956485">The Board found there was coercion because the purpose of the union hand billing was to impose substantial economic harm on the tenant stores, and it concluded that was not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.803" offset="1001729">The 11th Circuit, however, refused to enforce the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.598" offset="1016985">It held that only picketing focused exclusively on the form of the union's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.769" offset="1037674">It held that only picketing could be coercive within the meaning of Section 8(b)(4), and that every other form, hand billing or any other form of publicity, would not be in any way coercive or prohibited by Section 8(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="239.889" offset="1090128">The decision, we submit, is contrary to the specific language of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.152" offset="1119176">The Act itself does not only talk about hand billing I mean, about picketing, the Act talks about any action that threatens, coerces or restrains a neutral employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.834" offset="1161912">A threat, for example, to engage in conduct to shut down the business of a secondary or to impose substantial economic harm on them, however that threat is communicated, would be prohibited by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.110" offset="1214993">Similarly, coercion, as this Court indicated in Tree Fruits, whether by picketing or otherwise, is forbidden by Section 8(b)(4), and coercion, as this Court has defined it in both Safeco and Allied International, is any conduct which predictably encourages customers to boycott a secondary business or which reasonably can be expected to threaten neutral employers with ruin or substantial loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.333" offset="1319901">That's certainly what happened here, and that's what the Board found.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.988" offset="1334529">The only type of coercive conduct that's exempted from the statute is that which meets the three specific terms of the proviso; it has to be truthful, it has to involve a producer-distributor relationship, and it cannot induce a work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.139" offset="1391058">If it doesn't meet the terms of the proviso, then it is coercive within the meaning of the Act and prohibited by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.480" offset="1420420">The union here did not, let me repeat, did not just try and express its message.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.244" offset="1439542">That, it was permitted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.463" offset="1444348">It could have said in any way it wanted to that High did not pay sub-standard wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.306" offset="1463783">What it did impermissibly here was go a step further and add to that message the fact of trying to impose pressure, economic pressure, on the neutral tenant stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.707" offset="1505370">That's where the union violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.503" offset="1516551">Prior to the decision in this case, that's been the decision of not only all the lower courts and the Labor Board itself consistently from the thirty years since those amendments to the statute were passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.905" offset="1558138">The court below disregarded that history and it disregarded that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.480" offset="1580498">Its read of the publicity proviso, as the 7th Circuit said in Boxhorn, as simply so much blab.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.120" offset="1603068">The publicity proviso served no useful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.180" offset="1619264">It was a pointless gesture.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.555" offset="1624802">It was a mere collection of idle words because if the publicity proviso, as the union now argues, was only a clarification point.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.725" offset="1657403">The statute never covered anything but picketing to begin with and the proviso only applies to non-picketing publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.771" offset="1681645">That is, we submit, the vice here.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.409" offset="1700139">It's not a the union position is not one that is supported by the legislative history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.673" offset="1725217">When the Act was passed, the purpose was to prevent direct coercion of secondary employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.168" offset="1755205">That's what this Court indicated in Tree Fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.308" offset="1763774">Now, there were differences, of course, as between the House and the Senate as to how you could prevent direct coercion of secondary employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.633" offset="1793031">The House said, we think it ought to be prohibited, as they explained in the joint analysis, by any conduct, whether it be picketing, leafleting, radio broadcasts, advertisements, any of that conduct would have been prohibited by the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.270" offset="1843604">The Senate did not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.003" offset="1850605">The Senate had no restrictions on secondary consumer boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.548" offset="1868786">As a result, there was a compromise, and that compromise is embodied in the publicity proviso to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.780" offset="1893654">Some non-consumer some non-picketing consumer boycotts are allowed, but only those that meet the three terms of the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.058" offset="1926778">Other non-picketing publicity, if it's coercive and it's not protected by the proviso, is forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.055" offset="1958751">It doesn't matter on how the union does it, whether it's doing by picketing, hand billing, leafleting.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.083" offset="1982889">The only question is whether it has complied with the terms of the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.863" offset="1998040">If it has, then it can make its appeal, even if it's coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.549" offset="2012773">If it hasn't, it can't.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.195" offset="3615333">What the union is claiming in this case is that it has a constitutional right to do exactly what Congress has forbidden, if enough shoppers in the East Lake Square Mall agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.376" offset="3672071">Congress said thou shall not coerce the neutral businesses in the mall into helping in the dispute with High's, and the union's core claim is that it is constitutionally entitled to put that prohibition to a sort of shoppers' referendum, to issue an explicit call for a secondary boycott and ask the shoppers to decide that the neutral businesses should be coerced after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.208" offset="3787427">Some calls for boycott, of course, receive the highest constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.940" offset="3818356">Claiborne Hardware and Citizens for a Better Austin are leading examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.093" offset="3846882">But the Court has said repeatedly, including in Claiborne Hardware, that the tactics used by the combatants in a particular labor dispute are not entitled to that level of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.900" offset="3910098">In particular, the Court said in Claiborne Hardware, secondary boycotts by labor unions may be prohibited in the interests of preventing the coerced participation of neutrals in industrial strife.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.799" offset="3965791">Professor Cox put it this way in his comment on Safeco, he said,</text>
            <text syncTime="964.797" offset="3989720">"requests for immediate assistance in putting economic pressure upon one with whom the speaker is engaged in driving a private business bargain are readily distinguishable from words looking forward to political action. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.782" offset="6081710">I wish to begin by recharacterizing what the union's message is in this case from what DeBartolo's counsel said it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.837" offset="6133850">The union's message is set out in full in the appendix to the red brief, and the message is not simply that High's, the construction company, pays sub-standard wages; it is that there are a series of relations here between the tenants, the mall owner, Wilson's Department Store, and High's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.592" offset="6252864">The relationships, insofar as they support giving business to High's to do the construction, is contrary to some important social interests, buying power of people, community interests in adequate demand along Keansian lines, although there's no citation of that in the hand bill, and argues that given this set of relationships, the mall tenants and the mall owner are blame-worthy insofar as they are supporting what High's is doing and how it's treating its employees, and on the basis of that argument, the union asks people to make their judgment, please don't patronize, and to show their disapproval of these arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.499" offset="6548570">The facts are fairly set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.155" offset="6555153">The message is temperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.919" offset="6570200">There was no picketing or patrolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.856" offset="6577932">No misconduct of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.104" offset="6594964">And the way that the Board would read the statute at the present time, although it has never so read it before the remand and the decision in this case, is that that message can be obliterated from the face of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.064" offset="6682840">Unions may not make that argument to members of the general public who owe the union no fealty and they may not do it no matter what method of communication is used and how the point is made.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="1691.497" offset="6896521">Well, we believe, based on the decisions of this Court that if the statute was directed at leafleting, in other words, if Congress said that the streets are close to union that want to communicate this message with this viewpoint, that would be unlawful because leafleting has always been regarded by this Court from Schneider v. State on as a form of pure speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.921" offset="7022222">My only point, Justice White, is that I don't have to carry that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.405" offset="7036120">The argument here is that this message, because it may have an adverse effect on these store owners, if members of the public are persuaded by it, is subject to total ban, and that is the situation we find ourselves in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.051" offset="7142699">That is why we are in the dock, because we have made this argument to members of the general public, and I wish to emphasize in the regard that in contrast to the standards secondary boycott cases, if i can call them that, that have come to this Court before, this is a situation in which the message is directed at people who have a total absolute right, a freedom maybe more accurate, to act on the message without violating any law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.925" offset="7314271">Congress has not required and has never required, I don't know of any legislature that has ever required, anyone to shop at a store whose policies that person finds unpleasant, wrongful, in any way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.571" offset="7412805">Let's take an antitrust case in which a bunch of distributors ban together and go to the manufacturer and they say, we want you to cut off this other distributor because he's selling at too low prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.610" offset="7492949">Now, there are those who think that would be in violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.561" offset="7508831">The manufacturer is entitled to cut off any distributor he wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.574" offset="7540805">So, he's entitled to get that kind of information, that kind of urging from the distributors, and, yet, it is made unlawful for the distributors to induce him to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.302" offset="9543770">Industrial picketing is more than free speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.360" offset="9731956">The question is similar to one that could have been asked, it seems to me, in the Central Hudson line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.216" offset="9767378">One of the Central Hudson issues was whether institutional advertising, talking about the desirability of nuclear power, was tree free speech to be judged on true free speech based on not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.850" offset="9841984">The answer wasn't this utility is regulated and therefore the regulatory authority can do whatever it chooses as a guid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.315" offset="9883780">The understanding was that the real question, and this is the point, too, of Colautti, that the real question is what does free speech demand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2478.205" offset="10043336">Although the arguments on the other side fall one step short of this, and this is the issue that the Court was so conscious of in the Ohralik case in 436 U.S. and In Re Primus; namely whether we are going to have not only the paradox of first picketing being said to be different from leafleting and newspaper advertising and then gobble it up, but also whether we're going to have another paradox, namely the overruling of Valentine v. Chrestensen, leading to the conclusion that commercial speech is not limited to offers to buy and sell of a commercial kind, building going to start to chew up other aspects of what has historically been part of the 1st Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.463" offset="10272378">After all, the lead case with regard to the 1st Amendment and all of this is Thornhill v. Alabama, and although Thornhill v. Alabama has not survived as a picketing case, it certainly has survived as Colautti shows and as other cases show in terms of what we understand to be the generous confines of the 1st Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.640" offset="10369135">Whether the issue is one raised by a community group, saying that, as Justice Scalia's example suggests, that someone is running his business in a way which is contrary to the interests of the society by investing in South Africa or by moving facilities overseas or whether the argument is that the employers in general have moved to such a strong position in the society that they're hurting the society by not providing adequate health and safety, by violating the rights of women or minorities, whatever the issue is, it seems to us that those issues have always been understood to be part of a public dialogue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.196" offset="10595356">A particular dispute, whether it is the dispute that generated Thomas v.

            <text syncTime="2667.598" offset="10800887">I'd like to take it in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.082" offset="10806843">First of all, in Organizations for a Better Austin, as you raised, if this is a case which, like that case, is to be judged under the standards applied to speech generally, it seems to us that protecting these neutrals, these secondary employers and their right to have any business relationships they want, without anybody knowing about it, and without being able to make their own judgments about whether that's good or bad, is plainly not a sufficient interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.600" offset="10948949">And I want to point out that it was not simply the state was not simply protecting a particular business man there as Mr. Cohen was suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.174" offset="10983222">It was protecting a basic right of privacy, though the leafleting, the demonstrating in that case was taken to the individual's home and his home territory, and as the Court noted in Carey v. Brown and this is going to be a debate that continues this term from the cert grants, the question of whether the privacy interests in neighborhoods and homes is sufficient to limit expressive conducts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.818" offset="11109863">So, that was not a small interest, but going on, if the test here is the test of Central Hudson, we don't believe that this is narrowly limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.751" offset="11165556">Even in Central Hudson, the complete ban did not stand up to scrutiny under that test and we don't believe that saying that this message is obliterated so long as it's forwarded by union is obliterated from this society, is one that can possibly be justified by this supposed interest in industrial peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.301" offset="11279764">We're not disrupting industrial peace in any sense other than telling people facts which they have a right to know which they either will believe or won't believe, will find convincing or won't find convincing, and will either act on or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.436" offset="11340263">I don't think that any of this, if I may, would come as any great surprise to the 1959 Congress because the point that given the nature of the discussion with my colleagues I jumped over and very improperly is that it is our position that the Board has misread this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.472" offset="11440469">The constitutional background is critical to making that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.003" offset="11462516">So, I also started as I did in part for that reason, but in the first DeBartolo case, and in the Bishop of Chicago case, the Court has made it plain that there is a presumption that when Congress uses words which could be applied to expressive conduct, that language is to be read narrowly if it is at all possible to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.799" offset="11605772">Indeed, in Bishop of Chicago, the Court said that there had to be an affirmative indication of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.937" offset="11646314">The Congress focused on the particular expressive activity and decided to prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.247" offset="11667525">Certainly, as this Court has made plain many times in the Labor Act context, the words "threaten", "restrain" and "coerce" are not words with a single definite meaning, and, in reality, what this case comes down to insofar as the Board makes a statutory argument, aside from the fact that it started from a totally erroneous premise and didn't grant us the presumption that the Court stated, is to say that the fact that there is not only threaten and restrain and coerce in the statute, but there is this publicity proviso which, as the Court said in terms, is more limited than the situation here, creates a negative inference and shows that Congress intended in using the words "threaten", "restrain" and "coerce" to reach this kind of reasoned non-picketing appeal to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.156" offset="11947140">The language of publicity proviso, among other places, is set out at page 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.716" offset="11977442">I want to note two points about the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.229" offset="12003460">First of all, it's in the form saying that nothing contained in the overall section shall be construed to prohibit a particular kind of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.348" offset="12051943">That language was added in conference in a situation where the House had a bill which prohibited threatening, restraining and coercing and the Senate had no provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.780" offset="12101680">Opponents of the House language had claimed that it might reach pure speech activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.058" offset="12138774">No proponent of the language had over so claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.540" offset="12160717">At that point, the conference ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.616" offset="12180988">Now, it seems to us that there are two fair way of understanding what happened in that conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.987" offset="12214529">I was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.034" offset="12218709">None of the legislators have both kissed and told.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.454" offset="12248384">What one is that the House conferees said to the Senate, what is it that you're afraid of, what do you think we have up our sleeve, and the Senate conferees said, we believe that this language could reach not only picketing, which we all agree is subject to a greater degree of regulation, both in the labor and non-labor context since Hughes v. Superior Court was not a case involving a union, but would also reach other forms of expressive activity in the example that President Eisenhower had given in his speech, which was an example involving a producer-distributor relationship, and that the House people said, we don't intend to do that, and we'll show you we don't intend to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.557" offset="12476799">You're afraid we're going to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.413" offset="12484218">We will state in so many words we have no intention of doing that because we really do not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.615" offset="12836975">In other words, that this really was done with malice aforethought to narrow the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.519" offset="12864665">My point is that there are two ways of seeing it against the background of the overall debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.156" offset="12903222">Normally, that would not be of any help to someone attacking a Board decision reading the language the other way, but we're not in the normal situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.434" offset="12948257">The presumption is that unless you can show an affirmative indication of Congress to reach the activity in question, then you're to read the statute narrowly to as not to limit the expressive activity, and I wish to conclude by saying not only are there these different ways of reading both the general prohibition and the proviso against the background of constitutional doubts requires a narrow construction, I do wish to point out that when the parties left the conference, the manager on the House side of the Landry-Griffin Bill, Representative Griffin, and Senator Kennedy was the manager on the Senate side, went back to their colleagues and explained what they had done, the language--</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.590" offset="13260890">The union is not being limited in articulating the facts of its dispute with High.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.494" offset="13280534">It's not being limited in any way from asking for customers or the public to aid it in its dispute with High.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.679" offset="13309269">The only message that is being limited is a message that says injure neutral parties who have no connection whatsoever with this dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.611" offset="13352946">That's the only message that's limited, and that type of message being limited is similar to acts of limitation in the labor context and in many other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.091" offset="13394951">For example, an employer, although he may have a free speech right in other contexts to make predictions about unionization, can't under Gissel say to his employees, I think if you vote for a union, you're going to have to close this plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.962" offset="13446360">That would be impermissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3604.496" offset="14548518">It should pay attention to the language.</text>
