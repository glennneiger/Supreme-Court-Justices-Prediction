            <text syncTime="15.667" offset="191768">This case deals with the rights of a party to seek redress of grievances for an alleged violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Equal Protection Under The Laws, under 42 USC 1983, and whether that right is in any way delimited or in any way proscribed by the fact that somebody else started an action relating to a related condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="76.673" offset="435857">The pass mark for that examination was set at the first thousand candidates plus ties and yielded a list of 1,040 candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.340" offset="486534">There is an affidavit by the personnel director at the fairness hearing held in the Hispanic case that the pass mark did not define minimum competency to do the job and this was in response to an objection by certain intervenors who represented ethnic societies that the... to promote the minority officers would somehow lead to promoting unqualified people.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.704" offset="603981">So, the issue of whether or not the minority beneficiaries of the settlement are qualified has been decided and is not in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.667" offset="643791">The Marino Petitioners have a mark equivalent to or higher than the minority beneficiaries of the settlement but below the first thousand cut-off.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.631" offset="687677">When the racial remedy was employed, after the Hispanic suit was instituted and settled, it turned out that everyone on the list, that's the 1,040 original passers, plus all minority members who would make up the disparate impact perceived to have generated the lawsuit in the first place were promoted, there were still 400 vacancies in the rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.179" offset="829888">The Marino Petitioners take the position that as long as there were 400 vacancies in the rank, their exclusion by the employment of the racial remedy was not narrowly tailored to prevent unnecessary trammeling of rights, and that is the issue that brought Marino into court in the first place.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald Podolsky</label>
            <text syncTime="272.050" offset="1217336">Yes, indeed, there are a number of reasons cataloged in my reply brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.813" offset="1240428">The most important one, of course, is that the remedy existed in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.968" offset="1261012">The second, if a party chooses to intervene in somebody else's lawsuit, their burden of proof is different on some... in many respects from the 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.334" offset="1334469">The 2nd Circuit, for example, sometimes limits intervenors to just whether or not there's a fairness in the proposed settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.252" offset="1374175">Now, in 1983, you don't have to go into whether or not the racial remedy was or was not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.077" offset="1405417">One of the most important considerations, Your Honor, in answer to your question is that the intervention provision, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, I believe, and I think the 11th Circuit bears me out, is for people that have no other remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.958" offset="1504996">Now, for example, the Schneider intervenors, they represented the ethnic societies, were they attempting to get a passing grade here?</text>
            <text syncTime="356.765" offset="1556196">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.547" offset="1547315">Were they attempting to get promoted?</text>
            <text syncTime="357.656" offset="1559749">Their objection was we are police officers, and if you lower the mark for the beneficiaries of the settlement, we are going to be supervised by unqualified people.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.354" offset="1610531">They did not have a Fourteenth Amendment provision, and FRCP 24 provides for a person without a remedy to seek redress of an objection that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.863" offset="1672598">No remedy, no specific statute giving rise to a plenary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.188" offset="1697884">Now, the Marino people, they brought their action and it was dismissed as an impermissible collateral attack on a proposed settlement, not a judgment, a proposed settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.495" offset="1767057">Where did the 2nd Circuit get the idea of impermissible collateral attack leading to inconsistent results?</text>
            <text syncTime="417.600" offset="1799553">That's the verbiage of the Rule 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.974" offset="1809061">Rule 19 makes it the duty of the people who feel they're going to be subjected to duplication of effort to inconsistent results.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.406" offset="1854723">It puts the burden on them when somebody asserts a claim, not has a claim, Rule 19 says a person who claims an interest in an action, which may lead to inconsistent results, the people who are at risk, the parties who may be subjected to inconsistent results, have a duty, not the people who brought the 1983 action, but the people of the lawsuit have a duty to plead, to join, and let's see how strong that requirement is.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.361" offset="2002577">Rule 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.859" offset="2016578">Persons to be joined if feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.920" offset="2028803">Now, the fact was that they were subject to the jurisdiction of the Court and we're not involved with the jurisdiction over the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.746" offset="2060150">The person claims, not has a claim that he doesn't assert, he must claim an interest, let the folks know I have an interest I am pursuing, he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action, his 1983 action is authorized by Congress, enforcement of your equal protection rights, and is so situated that the disposition of the action may in the person's absence... now here's where we're talking, Subdivision 2, leave any of the persons already parties subject to--</text>

            <text syncTime="584.625" offset="2467661">Now, Justice Scalia, one of the other reasons is Marino was not attacking the promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.528" offset="2507262">They took the position that the minority beneficiaries were qualified to hold the position and this was confirmed by the personnel director.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.327" offset="2638397">No defendant wants to be... no person wants to be made a party to a litigation against his will, but Congress gave the Hispanic litigants the power and opportunity to do that, like they would any other defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.604" offset="4947517">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.070" offset="4981372">Justice O'Connor has asked a question that probably occurred to all of us, why didn't the Petitioners in this case intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.692" offset="5011883">The fact that that question occurs to all of us, though, is a question that we would like to suggest is not a question that the District Court should be asking of litigants who bring subsequent lawsuits, challenging actions that existed in prior lawsuits, and our reason for that is it would be both unfair and would produce an inefficient allocation of society's and judicial resources in the subsequent lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.105" offset="5105506">It is certainly the case that it's in the interest of fairness and in the interest of judicial economy for everyone who has a sufficient interest in a piece of litigation to be made party of that litigation and be bound by that litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.925" offset="5168826">But it's also true that the same fairness concerns and those same economy concerns counsel that when a person doesn't have a sufficient interest in a piece of litigation, that he not be made party and that he not participate in it because his participation would confuse and complicate the litigation needlessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.684" offset="5235909">The problem comes... and it's easy to say those two generalities in the abstract, what's more difficult is analyzing the question as to whether or not you have a sufficient interest to justify being a party in that litigation, and until a court answers that question for you, you won't know, and the problem is that there is a risk of error of mistake, and the question should be who can best bear the burden of those mistakes of thinking I didn't have a sufficient interest to intervene, so I didn't, or I had other reasons for not intervening, and I didn't want to, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure wisely, we think,--</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.993" offset="5429110">The question, though, is should that question be asked of someone who doesn't intervene, and we would suggest that it would be inefficient to create a rule of law of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.346" offset="5490550">The reason being is that many people don't have counsel on an on-going basis and aren't in the position of monitoring on-going litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.859" offset="5524614">If that litigation may be effecting their interests and the fact that they haven't intervened may mean that they didn't have counsel at the time who told them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.230" offset="5554080">They may know about the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.636" offset="5559723">They may not understand the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.057" offset="5565365">The Rules of Federal Procedure say put the burden on the parties to the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.931" offset="5584800">If they want to bind those people who haven't intervened, then join them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.210" offset="5601937">That's the burden the Rule 19 places, and we think it's a wise one because it would be inefficient for all of us to have to continually retain counsel to evaluate litigation to know whether or not we should intervene.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.975" offset="5756999">They aren't strangers from a foreign country, and they were aware of the litigation, and when you look at the... and they had counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.208" offset="5785943">A lot of people don't have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.333" offset="5794511">Yet, they may still know that the litigation is going on and they may not know that they have to intervene, and they shouldn't have to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.704" offset="5823977">If they don't intervene, what you have is you have these kinds of cases where we're looking back in retrospect asking whether or not they had sufficient notice, whether or not at the time they had that notice the court had jurisdiction over them, and whether or not their interest was sufficiently implicated in retrospect to have required them to have intervened to protect their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.556" offset="5895344">The parties to the litigation, however, are more familiar with the complaints, more familiar with the pleadings, more familiar with the relief that they expect to ask the court to award or in the case of the consent decree to approve, and they're in the best position of bearing the burden of not having made someone a party to the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.581" offset="5963471">It will expend judicial resources, we think, more in the long run to engage in these inquiry, retrospective inquiries as to whether or not someone has sufficient notice to have required them to have intervened and thus they're precluded from not having intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.482" offset="6023030">Now, from just placing the burden on the existing parties to the lawsuit to file a Rule 19(c) which says that they should list everyone who may have an interest and is affected by the litigation so that the court can evaluate whether or not those litigants should be joined.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.847" offset="11460470">Indeed, if you'll look at the survey of cases throughout the country, the reason why collateral attacks have been uniformly rejected, except for one Circuit that I'll discuss in a minute, is because of the protracted process of Title VII litigation, and the fact that all interested people do participate, that because the numbers of people affected are so numerous, they do not have any trouble retaining an attorney and this case is an example.</text>

            <text syncTime="2887.061" offset="11677391">They're affected by the quota the way everybody else is affected, that when you hire minorities, you exclude non-minorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2922.109" offset="11817512">After the objections and an order was entered approving the consent decree, two appeals were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.076" offset="11841440">One from the dismissal of the federal 1983 action and one from the dismissal of the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.572" offset="11867458">The Circuit Court, and we believe correctly, that since Mr. Podolsky never chose to become a party through his Petitioners to the litigation, he cannot appeal, and that is well established in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.739" offset="11920121">It emphasizes, however, the point we've been trying to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.629" offset="11931615">He obviously was alert to the loss of his rights in the consent decree litigation because he filed the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.267" offset="11954185">What makes his practices more incomprehensible is that a notice of appeal was also filed by the one intervenor that did not support the quotas, the Schneider group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.262" offset="12002146">He had constantly from day one opposed the quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.010" offset="12017192">He withdrew that appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.260" offset="12026178">So, Mr. Podolsky knew that the only other non-minority party on appeal had withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.945" offset="12048957">Despite that, he still did not move to intervene in the Appellate Court and ask for permission, and we believe that what he has done here has placed himself in the middle of nowhere and that there was an easy avenue of approach which he chose not to use, and for all those reasons, we ask that the orders be affirmed.</text>
