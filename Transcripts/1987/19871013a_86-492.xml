            <text syncTime="71.679" offset="430409">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="81.135" offset="468234">On April 27, 1983 one and a half miles off the Virginia coast, a young Marine helicopter pilot and chaplain was killed in the crash of a Sikorsky CH53D helicopter.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.376" offset="525285">The helicopter crashed into the sea due to the negligent design and subsequent repair of the steering mechanism of that Sikorsky helicopter.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.500" offset="569693">As the helicopter sank, LT David Boyle drowned because his escape system was defectively designed and did not function.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.724" offset="618595">And in the murky water, he was unable to use another escape route.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.395" offset="637298">This case was tried to a jury verdict in favor of Appellant, where the jury was charged with a form of the Government contractor defense, a form of the Government contractor defense specifically approved by Defense counsel on the record at the Joint Appendix page 450 at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.077" offset="732071">Respondent did not object pursuant to Rule 51 to that jury charge on the Government contractor defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.366" offset="769164">Also, the trial judge was not requested nor did he give a jury charge of the Virginia Logan burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.955" offset="799571">Respondent appealed to the Fourth Circuit, but Respondent did not challenge the Government contractor defense as given by the trial judge in the trial jury charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.013" offset="855786">However, the Fourth Circuit sua sponte reversed the jury verdict based on (1) the Logan Case in Virginia, and (2) based on a new version of the Government contractor defense just articulated on the same day in the Fourth Circuit case of Tozer.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.843" offset="939065">Now, in this Court, we, the Appellant, ask that the jury verdict be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.532" offset="973860">We further ask and point out the Sikorsky's only response is an unsupportable Government contractor defense and a disagreement with the sanctity of the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.209" offset="1024537">Appellant, therefore, asks this Court to decide on this first impression several issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.814" offset="1062990">They are: (1) was the jury verdict correct and should it be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.801" offset="1086918">Appellant contends that it was correct and it should be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.270" offset="1104786">(2) Was the Appellant's Seventh Amendment rights of a right to jury trial violated by the Fourth Circuit by the Fourth Circuit announcing law that was not given to the jury and then applying that law to the facts without the benefit of a jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2683.005" offset="10875731">I think another point on that, really a side light, I think, in terms of the mission before the Court, is that when these contracts were let and when these helicopters were being designed, it was in the 1960's when a liability suit of this sort would have been virtually unthinkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.150" offset="10948351">We are in this position 25 years after this contract process began because liability law has evolved far beyond insurance coverage at the time, but I think that is not the real issue on which we reset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.726" offset="11002686">I was going to emphasize that the only issue before the Court is that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.630" offset="11026301">In Petitioner's brief before the Court of Appeals, he said on two occasions, and the Court of Appeals took him at his word and expressly reported this in its opinion, that the only issues that were being advanced were the claims that there was a negligent repair of this servo-system and a negligent design of the escape system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.948" offset="11131522">Petitioner said that twice in his brief below and that is the way the Court of Appeals characterized the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.233" offset="11152629">I think it is too late now to say that there is another negligent design issue that this Court ought to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.153" offset="11176348">The Logan Case, the Virginia law burden of proof case on page 395 of the transcript was specifically argued as a basis for directing a verdict on the ground that Plaintiff had not borne his burden under Virginia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.996" offset="11235698">That is exactly what the Court of Appeals held on appeal was the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.567" offset="11258059">So, as the case comes before this Court, the only issue is the one that was framed in the petition: What are the appropriate standards for the military contractor defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.775" offset="11302885">We have explained in our brief why the defense should exist, why it should be recognized as a matter of Federal Common Law and why it is a corollary of important constitutional and legal doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.515" offset="11353772">At bottom, it is a separation of powers question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.253" offset="11368714">In this kind of suit or any kind of suit, where the Plaintiff is claiming that he is entitled to damages because military equipment has been improperly designed and where the contractor shows that that very feature was approved by the military, what the Plaintiff is asking the Court and civilian jury to do is to say that the military decision to provide him or her with that piece of material was wrongful and should bear consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.374" offset="11505282">Now, the United States is immunized under either Feres or more generally under the discretionary function exception and the question, therefore, is: Should there be a backdoor attack on the nature of the military decision by exposing the contractor to liability in tort for the consequences of the design decision, that the contractor proves were specifically approved by the military department.</text>

            <text syncTime="2897.960" offset="11735577">What you have there, Justice Scalia, is a different question, obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.596" offset="11750102">Several of the bases for the military contractor defense would involve or could involve immunity under that circumstance, just as the United States would be immune if the decision that the Court would have to make would be to inquire into the soundness, the reasons of the military judgment to design a helicopter with those rotors, you might very well have the same reasons for a defense even where the civilian is injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.765" offset="11862846">One factor that would not be present that is present in this type of case, and it is the typical case involving military accidents is that Congress has another system of compensation that it has set up equivalent to Workmen's Comp system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.790" offset="11918853">So, the balance might be different, but some of the bases for immunity would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.867" offset="12283209">And in that sense, we think the closest area of legal doctrine in terms of an analogy is the area of Federal employee immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.556" offset="12318004">In that instance, you are talking about protecting the general functioning of the Government and that is an area where this Court has, for years and years, dealt with cases involving questions of whether the balance of the interests of defending the Government functioning, outweigh the interests of the plaintiffs in that particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.018" offset="12391773">I think in those cases, it has been clear that the Common Law approach has been the appropriate approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.813" offset="13322986">Well, it is arguably separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.015" offset="13331764">I think maybe preemption is a little closer, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.134" offset="13344302">The idea that the power of the Government to get weapons systems without itself manufacturing all of them is a power that I think it is fair to say is inherent in the power to provide for the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.727" offset="13402608">And that is really what we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.929" offset="13415460">We are talking about complex changing technology where it is not practical for all sorts of reason for the United States Government to set up factories to manufacture this equipment which changes every few weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.403" offset="13465302">And it is perfectly reasonable to enlist the assistance of private industry in doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.057" offset="13487976">Now, the absence of a defense does not absolutely prohibit that, but it creates burdens which were alluded to by Justice Scalia, quite correctly: burdens which include increasing cost, which include delays in the ability to get the product produced because the contractor is focusing not only on what the Government wants but what state courts in their tort law application responsibility are demanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.124" offset="13592257">The biggest problem that is generated is the incentive that is created to not go forward with a cooperative relationship with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.813" offset="13631022">Under the contract specification defense that applies in most states, a contractor will have a defense if he simply does what the Government tells him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.336" offset="13669057">And the question here is whether the Government can enter into a cooperative give-and-take relationship to get this kind of equipment or does it have to do it at arms' length, simply saying, "We want this".</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.958" offset="13707613">If the Government can't have that kind of cooperative relationship, it is going to be impossible to develop the technology that we need on the leading edge of technology around the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.701" offset="13758500">And that is why I say this defense is really inherent in the power to provide for the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.688" offset="13786503">I would just like to briefly emphasize that we are concerned that the defense also be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.942" offset="13811476">We are not foreclosing a similar defense in later different cases, but this defense in this case need only and should only be limited to, (1) military equipment, (2) features of military equipment which can be described as "special order", either an entire system that is special ordered or specific features on a system which is generally available, which are special ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.028" offset="13927878">We are not in favor of creating a defense for the Government for the contractor when he provides a can of beans which is no different than every other can of beans that it provides, nor when the contractor provides a jeep which is just like every other jeep.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.586" offset="13986079">Unless the Government says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.221" offset="13992662">"We want this one to be different. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.406" offset="14001334">Or, unless the contractor says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.941" offset="14011470">"This is just our standard jeep. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.441" offset="14021501">"Now, for you, in your application, we would like to put on a something or other. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.928" offset="14035502">"We would like to put on a special metal undercoating. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.713" offset="14046578">or something like that, "to make it safe".</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.447" offset="14053579">And the Government comes back and says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.249" offset="14060789">"No, we want it just the way it is. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.832" offset="14067058">In our view, that would be a special order application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.486" offset="14081687">But we are not talking about protecting contractors when they are selling the Government the same thing they sell to everybody else, even if they run blueprints past the Government and the Government signs off and says, "This is what we want".</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.211" offset="14128603">What we are trying to protect is the process, the interaction and the developmental process of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.198" offset="14156502">And we feel that the Government has got to be able to have that flexibility to deal on a close coupled basis with contractors or you are really denying the Government the ability to procure these fundamentally essential weapons systems that it has got to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.807" offset="14215016">The other ways in which the defense is limited in our view and is limited under the McKay test, (1) there is no protection when the manufacturer produces a product negligently or fails to live up to the specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.067" offset="14280009">So, we are not in favor of simply a blanket immunity such as was embodied in one of the pieces of legislation that was put up for a vote in Congress last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.442" offset="14325462">And, finally, there is, of course, the burden of warning the Government of known hazards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3711.507" offset="14989808">But we already have negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.359" offset="14997226">We already have product liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.226" offset="15004645">We already have breach of warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.077" offset="15012064">All of these defenses are available to United Technology Sikorsky to prove that supposedly the Government approved this one particular... or these defects in this helicopter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.449" offset="15053546">In the actual record in this case, there was not one military person that testified at the trial and said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.039" offset="15083849">"We approved the escape system. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.055" offset="15091999">"We approved the specific defect in the control system. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.942" offset="15107463">That did not exist in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.958" offset="15115613">And the military has not said that in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.279" offset="15132854">And I would also again point out to the Court that a jury heard all the evidence, including the Defendant's position on the facts and found for the Appellant, despite even a version of the Government contractor defense having been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.706" offset="15190533">And I also think that it is important that if Your Honors are inclined to adopt a form of the Government contractor defense, there are a multitude of issues that have to be balanced because this defense would apply, then, throughout the entire military procurement process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.417" offset="15265452">And Congress, instead of wanting something of this nature has in fact in 1984 been enacting legislation that has made the Government procurement complex even more competitive and have been trying to disassociate themselves with the close symbiotic relationship between the Government and the contractors to create more of an actual competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.599" offset="15362105">Thank you.</text>
