            <text syncTime="12.574" offset="179886">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.676" offset="192320">I'd like to open this afternoon with a very brief statement of the case and next comment on the nature of the issue as it was faced by the District Court, and then turn to the matter of appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.685" offset="248326">As set forth in the briefs, while appellate jurisdiction does not stand or fall on the merits of any particular rule, it seems quite clear that the presence of appellate jurisdiction does turn on both the nature and the importance of the ruling, and on the practicalities of delaying appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.147" offset="326171">Now, the underlying facts and legal issues of this case are completely unremarkable from a Federal point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.789" offset="368699">What is remarkable from that standpoint is the notion that a Federal Court should undertake to adjudicate this type of dispute when a competent State court was already doing so on the exact same issues, exact same parties, and when removal had been available to the State Court defendant but had been foregone.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.737" offset="468486">After summarizing the case, I will argue that the Federal suit that resulted was not only identical and duplicative of the State Court lawsuit, but because removal had been available the duplicative Federal suit was wholly unnecessary even from the Federal plaintiff's point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.483" offset="547481">And wholly without justification under this Court's decisions or under the intention of Congress since 1789 when Congress created the removal process.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.112" offset="733995">I'm advised by counsel for the respondent that today or Friday, Mayacamas has filed papers in the trial court in Georgia seeking a new trial, and because of the outcome, we certainly expect on Gulfstream's part that whatever the outcome of the new trial proceedings in Georgia, it will be followed by an appeal by Mayacamas as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.051" offset="1417776">So I don't know if I'm quibbling with you, but I'm saying that we don't argue the, and in this particular case, we haven't argued it in the briefs and I'm not arguing it this morning what the specific res judicata effect would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.947" offset="2977391">Our primary argument on the practical impact is that when the District Court insisted on proceeding with this duplicative lawsuit, that it was creating a practical impact on Federalism concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="740.381" offset="3091076">I think that at the threshold that the ruling in question on our motion citing the availability of removal and arguing under Colorado River that the District Court shouldn't proceed at all, I think that was... and I'm anticipating the problem of appealability here... I think that was a conclusive type of ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.913" offset="3185221">There are other kinds of circumstances that might have taken place down the road, the District Court perhaps considering purely prudential matters, looking at the practicalities of one suit or another, may possibly have ordered a stay, a temporary stay or a permanent stay later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.810" offset="3260767">But I think the particular ruling that it made came up squarely and appropriately at the threshold that the suit had no business being allowed to proceed at all, given the duplicative lawsuit in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.284" offset="3310713">And that ruling, I don't think there was any chance that there would have been a reconsideration or reevaluation of that legal ruling based upon any future circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.842" offset="3356898">I think that in effect... I don't know that it would have been a Colorado River motion say a year and a half later... but perhaps it would have been purely a... I guess it would have been a discretionary Colorado River motion, after the Court had said that, well the removal factor does not bring this case out of the ordinary realm of discretionary stays.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.006" offset="3437564">And a year and a half later, it might have said, well, now the Georgia case has proceeded faster or whatever, maybe it would have stayed it, but I think that would have been a fundamentally different kind of ruling down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.896" offset="3489182">And that is where I think the Moses Cone Hospital analysis does not govern our particular case as far as appealability is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.454" offset="3535366">Perhaps I should turn to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.573" offset="3543830">In Moses Cone Hospital, you had a Court granting a Colorado River type motion, and the question was at the threshold was is that appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.345" offset="3582909">And the Court ruled that it was appealable for two different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.131" offset="3598060">One was the rationale under the Idlewild case that the plaintiff had been put effectively out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.236" offset="3626482">But then the Court reached a second ground for appealability, and that is the doctrine that I primarily rely on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.473" offset="3655425">And that is the Cohen collateral order doctrine where the three or perhaps four categories of a narrow class of preliminary orders, of interlocutory orders are deemed appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.816" offset="3712790">And we certainly I think have all four here.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.184" offset="3726269">We have an important issue, indeed I would say we have an historically important issue, given the origins and the purpose of the removal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.855" offset="3756989">We have an Order that Moses Cone Hospital, itself, held squarely was separate from the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.742" offset="3780499">I think when you flip and say that we have an order denying a stay, I think it's still equally separate from the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.980" offset="3805473">We have an order which is not effectively reviewable if you wait until the end of the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.918" offset="3833267">All the conflicts and tensions between the State and Federal courts are moving along as the case proceeds to the final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.072" offset="3865868">And to reverse the judgment at the end I think provides no effective recourse at all for this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.511" offset="3899618">And finally, as I was stating in response to the Chief Justice a little bit earlier, you have a ruling which, under the analysis of the Moses Cone Hospital, I think is clearly conclusive in that it's a determined, it's a considered judgment on the significance of the removal factor in the context of identical duplicative lawsuits, and I believe that it's conclusive for two kinds of reasons, both found in Moses Cone Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.899" offset="4025215">One is if you look at the decision of the District Judge, it's a memorandum opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.970" offset="4045486">The Judge considered the Colorado River issue, and said the Court must exercise its jurisdiction on those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.242" offset="4082579">And I believe it fits Moses Cone Hospital quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.461" offset="4099402">And we also argue in our briefs if you look back at the two companion cases in 1963, one was the Curry case involving National labor relations proceeding, and the one that followed it involving a national bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.370" offset="4159066">You had a trial judge, just as here, making a decision at the threshold simply to proceed with the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.393" offset="4191144">And the defense, similar to our defense here, was that the very fact that you're proceeding with the lawsuit is inimicable to a very important federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.665" offset="4236284">In the one case, the policy to have a labor dispute adjudicated by the Labor Board, and in the second case, in the Langdo case, the policy was not to have a national bank sued in a venue not its home venue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.592" offset="4515899">That's similar to Colorado River in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.177" offset="4530318">In fact, it's very similar to Iowa Mutual v. LaPlante, which was decided in February of this year where an insurance company in an insurance coverage dispute with some people on an Indian Tribe came to the Federal District Court asserting diversity jurisdiction over a coverage dispute which was in excess of $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.340" offset="4602939">The same dispute looking on the mirror image side of it had already been before a Tribal Court of the Black Feet Indians, so a Colorado River motion was made and granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.379" offset="4647138">And the reason was, conceding the presence of diversity jurisdiction as certainly we do, that the important Federal policy of I think the way it was framed was of maintaining the ability of the Indians to have their self-government and respecting that self-government, called for a stay and a deferral to the Indian Court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.430" offset="4743268">And I think the analogy is quite close here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.313" offset="4754867">We concede jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.334" offset="4766883">I think what takes this case even beyond Iowa Mutual and beyond Colorado River and all five cases that have come up under the Colorado River doctrine since 1976, is that the insurance company in Iowa Mutual had invoked Federal subject matter jurisdiction in the only way it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.396" offset="4847131">There's no removal from the Black Feet Indian Court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.200" offset="4862387">There was no prior pending action in Colorado River or in the San Carlos Apache case where somebody could have removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.370" offset="4891017">These plaintiffs had come to Federal court in the only way they could and if the Federal court didn't exercise its jurisdiction there, the Federal plaintiff would have had no Federal adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.912" offset="4937202">In our case, Mayacamas could have had a Federal forum under the diversity jurisdiction by removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.033" offset="4969698">It had an absolute right to that forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.135" offset="4982132">It simply had to file a petition for removal within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.837" offset="4996970">It would have had its diversity adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.706" offset="5008359">Then it could have moved for a transfer and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.741" offset="5016509">The reason why this Court has allowed a duplication of efforts when there is concurrent jurisdiction as the reason was explained in the Colorado River case, was that Congress had created the jurisdiction for a reason and that there's a presumptive... I think the court said... virtually unflagging obligation to exercise that jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.874" offset="7001084">I think that unlike a circumstance where a Court has granted a stay, and there may be a conclusion that can be drawn from that that this is a final ruling, that is conclusive, which was this Court's ruling in the Moses H. Cone Hospital case, where we have a Court merely saying, no, let's proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.323" offset="7090841">That is much more in the nature of a tentative ruling which can be revisited at any time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2477.065" offset="10037871">And Gulfstream has indicated in its papers that it's not asking the Court to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.869" offset="10061068">What it is saying is that it wants this Court to make the failure to remove a very significant factor to be considered by the District Court in its Colorado River analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.092" offset="10109969">In fact, I think they indicate that there should be a presumption that there should be a stay or a dismissal taken into effect by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.448" offset="10147376">In that case, our position is that the District Court was aware of this argument, took it into consideration, and that is the only factor which could arguably be called exceptional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.616" offset="10568052">The order was not conclusive, it did not deal with an important issue which was separate from the merits, and it is reviewable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.907" offset="10613192">The question of whether or not this Court should have stayed the action is reviewable on final appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.179" offset="10654256">No significant rights are lost during the proceeding of this litigation other than the fact that the parties have to endure some expense and some irritation which has repeatedly been stated to be an insufficient basis for concluding that an action is unreviewable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.093" offset="10737953">All of the points which are raised can be dealt with after final judgment and the Cohen collateral order exception is just not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.048" offset="10777763">Under the Enelow/Ettelson rule, which has been criticized greatly recently, the simplest way to deal with that is, other than just indicating that there's no longer any basis for it now that we have the one forum of action rule, is that Gulfstream is not attempting here to interpose an equitable defense to a legal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.968" offset="10885492">It is merely raising an equitable consideration which should be considered by the Court in deciding whether or not to proceed with the action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.679" offset="10956336">It's a defense to an action, an equitable defense to an action is one that has been recognized in the context of an injunction situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.952" offset="11001371">Merely raising the fact that this case should not proceed because of wise judicial administration issues is merely an equitable consideration to be taken into consideration by the Court for purposes of this pretrial matter, and has nothing to do with the adjudication on the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.164" offset="11070230">With respect to very briefly on the issue of mandamus, I think we're dealing here with a question of the discretion of the District Court in deciding whether or not the criteria of Colorado River have been met.</text>

            <text syncTime="3054.260" offset="12346573">That case, and also the Morris Treatise also cites Section 1448 of Title 28 as instructing the District Court following a removal, to look into all questions of the adequacy of service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.889" offset="12417104">And the Polizzi decision, I think, comes pretty close to the question that you raised, that certainly there would be no waiver by Mayacamas in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.055" offset="12721796">I think that that same concern was expressed by the framers in the debates that I cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.643" offset="12748127">I think that same concern about avoiding Federal court/State court tensions in litigation of this kind has been cited with concern over and over again by this Court, most recently in the Pennzoil Texaco case in a different context of younger abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.039" offset="12825763">But there once again, you talk about the premise upon which basis our federal system was established, that the Federal courts are not to gratuitously intervene in situations where it would put itself into a posture of this very kind of conflict and potential tension with the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.870" offset="12913012">With respect, my opponent belittles those concerns about Federal and state relationships as something that, and I'm quoting, "of dubious relevance" in today's world of modern interstate commerce, as if this nation had no further reason to be concerned about conflicts between the national courts and the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.414" offset="12995246">With respect, I think that's a striking notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.485" offset="13011546">I think this case can be seen as just perhaps a garden variety procedural dispute and so forth, but I think with removal, it implicates a very fundamental Federal concern.</text>
