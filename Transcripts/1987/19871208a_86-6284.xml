            <text syncTime="743.516" offset="3091837">And as far as the harm to be effected, we have to, of course, look at what a jury is going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.722" offset="3124646">Is a jury... and do we have any type of a standard in which we can say what a jury is going to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.859" offset="3149201">I think as this Court said in Cal v. Romulus, California v. Romulus, that there's no objective or normative marker available to say what a jury is really thinking, and if, in fact, there is a harm or at least there is the error and if the error is of constitutional dimensions, such as in Estelle v. Smith, without the notice, then this Defendant has been harmed because the jury very well could have used that testimony, even though there may have been some very horrible fact situations underlying the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.747" offset="3276784">We don't know, and for that reason, we cannot really peer into the minds of the jury and see exactly what they would do, and it's on that basis that I believe that harm has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.269" offset="3314922">It is the conduct so much not of a state agency as it is of the prosecutor of an attorney, one in which knows by the ethical rules should be noticing opposing counsel of motions that are presented to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.629" offset="3372287">This is exactly what is being complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.231" offset="3382736">More so than anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.039" offset="3433936">The harm... if this is harmless error, it is still the Government's burden of proving this beyond a reasonable doubt, and they have got to prove that the error did not contribute to the verdict of taint.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.029" offset="3481897">Now, I don't see how that could possibly in this case, especially since this Court has before reviewed the testimony of Dr. Grigson, and there's no question about it but for the notice provision, but for the availability of a defendant to have his counsel, at least to talk to him prior to such examination, he may not have said anything and there may not have been an examination, there may not have been even testimony, and this is one thing that is just so ever-presently clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.783" offset="3600911">There is continued repeated references made to the Dallas psychiatrist and that he was a medical doctor in the jury argument, and it's this basis in which the state's use of this improperly-admitted evidence that the Defendant was denied a fair trial, was denied effective assistance of counsel, and it's on that basis, following Chapman, upon the harmless error doctrine, that harm was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.814" offset="3693071">Harm was committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="912.376" offset="3767259">In disputing the harmless error finding of the Court below, the briefs filed by Satterwhite and by the amicus advance essentially two arguments.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.171" offset="3838521">The second argument then, and the issue for the Court to decide, is whether on the facts of this case, the state proved that Dr. Grigson's testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.895" offset="3885332">Now, we have made an argument that there was no Sixth Amendment violation in connection with Dr. Grigson's examination of Satterwhite.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.216" offset="6554628">At the punishment hearing, the punishment hearing lasted five and a half hours, Dr. Grigson was one of a number of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.001" offset="6577825">There were eight witnesses to Satterwhite's bad reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.822" offset="6593081">There was testimony by the psychologist, Dr. Schroeder, whose diagnosis of Satterwhite was the same as that of Dr. Grigson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.642" offset="6624323">There was testimony about Satterwhite's prior criminal record, two misdemeanor convictions, two felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.682" offset="6656506">There was testimony about Satterwhite's violent nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.634" offset="6668313">A year and a half before the capital offense, he attacked his blind father-in-law in the man's home, shot him twice through the door, put him in the hospital for a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.592" offset="6708124">Some six months prior to this capital offense, he was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon which he attempted to pull from his waist band and use it on a policeman who accosted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.815" offset="6757025">In the face of all of this very damaging testimony, Satterwhite presented no evidence whatsoever, no psychiatric testimony, a reputation evidence, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.707" offset="6812614">It's... as I said, the punishment hearing lasted five and a half hours, and we really can't tell from the record how long Dr. Grigson was on the stand, but it was certainly not the bulk of that time or anything approaching it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.467" offset="6863709">Now, as far as how the prosecutor relied on the testimony, again the record doesn't show how much time elapsed during the final argument on punishment, but it does show in the printed statement of facts of the trial that the prosecutor's argument occupied 291 lines of argument, nine of those were devoted to Dr. Grigson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.582" offset="6956078">I would submit to the Court that that is not heavy reliance on Dr. Grigson's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.390" offset="7003308">Unless the Court is prepared to say that this type... well, perhaps I should back up a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.810" offset="7033087">Only last term in Buchanan v. Kentucky, the Court stated that this type of error can be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.447" offset="7055552">In Buchanan, the defendant claimed that he was examined in violation of his right to counsel and that there was error in the admission of psychiatric testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.803" offset="7092960">The Court rejected that, holding there was no Estelle v. Smith violation and then also stated, however, even if there had been, it would be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.092" offset="7126188">So, I think there's no substance whatsoever to Satterwhite's argument that this particular type of error cannot be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.348" offset="7163177">That being so, I would submit to the Court that certainly on this record, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.919" offset="7189508">When the state puts on overwhelming evidence to support the issues on punishment and when the defendant puts on no evidence whatsoever, and when the complained-of testimony is essentially the same as that of properly-admitted testimony, it would seem that any error was harmless beyond any doubt whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.248" offset="7270801">Satterwhite has chosen to focus on the fact that Dr. Grigson testified on a critical issue and from that argues that this can never be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.556" offset="7311970">However, the admission of a confession taken in violation of Miranda can be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.560" offset="7340078">Certainly, Dr. Grigson's testimony on punishment is no more damaging to the defendant than his own word inculpating himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.899" offset="7369440">If that sort of error could be harmless, we submit to the Court that this can, too, and that on this record, it certainly was.</text>
