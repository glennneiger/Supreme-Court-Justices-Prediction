            <text syncTime="14.622" offset="201535">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.497" offset="237061">This case is before the Court for review of a final judgment of civil contempt against the two National Organizations of Catholic Bishops.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.113" offset="271543">It is the Bishops' contention that the contempt judgment against them is void because that judgment, and the underlying orders, were beyond the constitutional power of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.619" offset="313548">The facts can be stated simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.050" offset="323265">The Respondents brought suit seeking an order directing the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to revoke the tax-exemption of the Catholic Church in the United States on the ground that the Church had allegedly engaged in impermissible political activities in the area of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.961" offset="382929">The Respondents served subpoena duces tecum upon the Bishops, and the Bishops moved to quash those subpoenas on the ground, among others, that the Court was without power to issue them.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.976" offset="427024">Without power because the Plaintiffs lacking standing to bring a lawsuit challenging the tax-exemption of the Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.491" offset="453042">Without power, in other words, because there was no case or controversy before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.466" offset="472895">The District Court denied the motion and later held the Bishops in contempt when they declined to comply with the subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.928" offset="498808">In the District Court's view, the Respondents... the Plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.994" offset="519079">The Court of Appeals affirmed the contempt judgment without deciding the issue of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.568" offset="541336">It held that a non-party witness may not challenge the power or jurisdiction of a court; he may only raise a limited challenge that there is no colorable claim of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.984" offset="586998">In its present posture then, this case presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.135" offset="603612">Whether a witness and an alleged contemnor may challenge the Article III Power of the Court to Act, and, if so, whether the District Court in this case was without power because the Plaintiffs lacking standing to bring the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.066" offset="659305">Now, there is a very simple and straightforward answer to the first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.209" offset="679889">A witness who is subpoenaed and held in contempt may challenge the Article III Power of the Court because that power is being invoked against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.386" offset="720640">The subpoena and contempt powers that are at issue in this case are themselves elements of the Article III Power of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.262" offset="756167">They don't exist independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.393" offset="764630">They are part of the judicial power that is conferred by Article III, and as this Court said in United States v. Morton Salt, the subpoena power is therefore subject to the limitations of Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.682" offset="813845">What that means--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="169.452" offset="820846">Mr. Baine, certainly there's language in Blair v. United States, as you know, that it certainly cuts against your position.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_t_baine" startTime="176.397" stopTime="248.793">
            <label>Mr. Kevin T. Baine</label>
            <text syncTime="176.397" offset="848640">--Blair v. United States is a case that concerns the subpoena power of the Grand Jury, and what the Court held in that case is that one who is subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury cannot object on the ground that the criminal statute that he believes is the subject of the investigation is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.588" offset="925440">That kind of a challenge is speculative and premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.971" offset="938919">A grand jury's subpoena power, unlike the subpoena power of a court in a civil case, does not depend upon the existence of a case or controversy, and, in fact, in a case of the grand jury, as the Court said in Blair, the grand jury and the court don't even know whether there's a matter within the jurisdiction of the federal courts until the end of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.724" offset="1018018">In a civil case, on the other hand, the complaint is at the beginning of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.027" offset="1035154">One can determine at the beginning of the case whether there is jurisdiction, whether there is a case in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.941" offset="1058874">So, it's our contention that Blair simply has no relevance to this case, and, in fact, when Blair says that the witness may not challenge the jurisdiction, it is referring to the jurisdiction of the grand jury and the court to investigate, and to bring a case within the jurisdiction of the court if it finds that a violation has occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.793" offset="1138286">Mr. Baine, if the case were one in which the burden on the witness was minimal rather than the greater burden that you allege in this case for these witnesses, do you think that any witness should be able to make the same jurisdictional challenge, regardless of the burden on the witness?</text>

            <text syncTime="274.579" offset="1241417">However, the contention is that the Court has no power to act at all if there is no case or controversy, and if there's no case or controversy, it has no power to do anything relating to the merits of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.289" offset="2516193">What the Respondents say is that the Bishops could have argued on appeal that the contempt judgment was invalid because the subpoenas were unduly burdensome, that it cost too much to xerox the documents, or that it would take too many man hours to search for the documents, but they say that we can't raise on appeal the more fundamental question whether or not the subpoenas were invalid all together because they were beyond the power of a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.063" offset="2607308">What that overlooks is that the first issue on any appeal is the question of jurisdiction or power, not just of the Court of Appeals, but of the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.678" offset="4157832">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.287" offset="4204225">I plan to devote my time to the issue that is of most concern to the Federal Government, the underlying question of whether the Plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit against the Internal Revenue Service, seeking to compel us to revoke the tax-exemption of a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.135" offset="4263576">That standing issue raises a general problem that the Court has confronted on several occasions in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.470" offset="4288967">Namely, the circumstances under which the federal courts may be asked to review the workings of the Executive Branch by a party who is not directly affected by government actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.157" offset="4327732">The basic principle in these cases is that the Plaintiffs have standing to challenge executive action only when they have suffered a concrete injury thereby, and one principle that the Court has made clear time and time again is that the courts will not entertain challenges brought by citizens whose interest is no more than a generalized interest in having the Government obey or enforce the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.671" offset="4417803">In the words of this Court, the federal judiciary is not an ombudsman of the general welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.504" offset="4441104">It is not designed to act as a continuing monitor of the wisdom and soundness of executive actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.309" offset="4464301">In our view, the injury that is claimed here is so theoretical and abstract that acceptance of it would almost completely obliterate this principle that limits judicial monitoring of the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.567" offset="4513306">It would expose the Government to untold numbers of suits by interested but not affected persons who seek to challenge its day-to-day execution of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.333" offset="4548415">Specifically, we think the claim of injury here is considerably weaker than the claims of injury that have been asserted to underlie standing in recent cases that the Court has rejected standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1116.843" offset="4610482">Well, the claimed injury in this case, basically the gist of it, is that there has been government favoritism, that the government... that the Catholic Church has violated the prerequisites for having a Section 501(c)(3) tax-exemption and, yet, the government has failed to take away that tax-exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.925" offset="4682789">Therefore, this failure to enforce the law by the government as somehow favoritism towards an entity with whom the Plaintiffs disagree and that favoritism necessarily injures them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.960" offset="13242906">Yet, that would bring the religious divisions that the Plaintiffs are complaining about into the political process, which is exactly what the First Amendment has sought to avoid, sought to take to avoid political division along religious lines, to avoid political divisiveness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.193" offset="13691794">Those who agree with the Catholic Church on abortion would have standing to challenge the exemption of the Presbyterian Church or of the American Jewish Congress, who have joined an amicus brief, pointing out that they take a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.692" offset="13741845">Those who agree with the Catholic Church or disagree with the Catholic Church or any church on any of the issues the churches speak out on, including arms control, civil rights, the economy, capital punishment, to name just a few, would have standing to challenge the tax-exemption of that group on the ground that the group's activities had crossed the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.516" offset="13829094">And what the Respondents say is that a citizen would have standing to bring that suit, and this is the critical point, regardless of whether that citizen himself has been subjected to any unequal or any unfair treatment by the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
