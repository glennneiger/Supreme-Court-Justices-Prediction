            <text syncTime="20.395" offset="208789">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the questions presented in this case are, first, whether the full faith and credit clause and the due process clause require Kansas, a quorum state, to apply the limitations laws of the States of Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, where the claims arose in favor of class members residing in those states, and secondly, whether Kansas has failed in this case to apply the interest laws of those same states to those claims as required by this Court's decision in Phillips Petroleum Company versus Shutts, which was an identical case to this one except it did not involve the limitations issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.916" offset="438876">Sun Oil sells gas from wells located in various states and pays royalty to landowners, thousands of land-owners located in these states.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.093" offset="499584">In the 1970s Sun had received, filed for and received price increases from the then Federal Power Commission subject to refund pending a determination of their legality, and once determined to be legal, royalty was paid on the suspended funds representing the increases to the royalty owners, and such payouts were made in July of 1976 and on another occasion in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.862" offset="618703">Plaintiffs filed this suit in August of 1979 in Kansas state court seeking to collect interest on the principal payout of these suspended royalties on behalf of the class of these royalty owners located in these various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.125" offset="703757">Ninety-nine percent of the class members resided in states other than Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.279" offset="724342">Over 90 percent of the wells were located in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.500" offset="749210">Now, in the first Wortman case in 1984 the Kansas courts held that Kansas interest law should be applied to all the claims in all the states and also held that the Kansas limitations statute, which it determined was five years, should apply to all the claims in all the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.716" offset="850147">Thereafter, this Court decided Phillips versus Shutts in 1985, which required Kansas to apply the interest laws of the other states to the claims arising in those states if those laws were different, and it pointed out they probably were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.779" offset="934366">On Sun's petition this Court then remanded the first Kansas Wortman case back for reconsideration in light of this Court's case of Phillips versus Shutts.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.437" offset="984939">And on reconsideration the Kansas court, reviewing many decisions in these other states, and not finding anything directly on point, nevertheless held despite this Court's direction that the Kansas theory of equitable interest would be uniformly adopted in each one of these states.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.587" offset="1085563">Then on the limitations question when we again raised the constitutional objection that the limitations laws were substantive, certainly as substantive as interest laws, where the difference is between 6 percent and 10 percent, between liability and no liability, the Kansas court adopted what is a standard black letter conflicts rule that limitations goes, is remedial or procedural, therefore the law--</text>

            <text syncTime="275.760" offset="1230281">It seemed to me that at least in your brief you didn't argue that Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma courts consider their shorter statutes of limitations as substantive.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.320" offset="1392554">Those states follow the common law rule, as Kansas does, as most states do, that the normal statute of limitations such as we have involved here, are considered procedural or remedial for conflict of laws purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.699" offset="1462040">That does not mean to say that those states do not apply those laws to claims arising in each one of those states in such a manner as to terminate completely any claim or cause of action that has arisen in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.959" offset="1527032">And my whole point, Justice O'Connor, is that the nature of a statute of limitations when it is applied by each one of these states is such that constitutionally it is substantive because it deprives a party of a claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.420" offset="1588890">Well, I can imagine certainly that a particular state could make a determination for itself that it wanted to treat a particular statute of limitations as substantive, but absent that, I wonder whether we should assume that it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.132" offset="1663809">I think that in applying the constitution, Your Honor, we must look at what a statute of limitations does to a party and to a claim, and because of the history, the common law history by which this common law fiction arose, a fiction that limitations goes to the remedy and not to the right, which arose way back in McLemoyle versus Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.888" offset="1802781">Prior to that time, Justice Storey... I am getting back into history now, but it goes right to the very essence of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.226" offset="1832143">And that is that Justice Storey in LeRoy versus Crowninshield analyzed this common law fiction and from every aspect he concluded in effect that a limitations law by its nature was substantive because it affected the substantive rights of the claimant.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.404" offset="2016880">It didn't carry the day, Your Honor, because the majority opinion in Wells simply rotely adopted the old McLemoyle line of cases, and if you look back at McLemoyle, likewise it did not analyze the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.080" offset="2071529">One would think that before we rotely adopt an old rule for the sake of old times and antiquity that we ought to look at the reason behind the rule and see if the rule stacks up in light of the purposes of our constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.840" offset="2138611">And if we do go back, you will note that McLemoyle and Wells recited the common law fiction that limitations goes to the remedy and not to the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.517" offset="2193259">Well, that is pretty well accepted by scholars that that remedy, common law remedy type of thing was basically something to preserve English sovereignty over England's people and its courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.911" offset="2262849">Now, when Justice Storey, really the only analysis made in the early days was by Justice Storey in the Crowninshield case, and he examined it by reason and logic and said, in effect, the common law rule is wrong, but it is the law, and I will apply it to the case, but that case did not involve the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.094" offset="2359607">And if you come to the Constitution, where Kansas must respect the laws of Texas which affect people's rights, and like any other substantive law, then we have an issue which is not, which is not simply a question of the common law of England.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.554" offset="4929429">And Professor Loeffler points that out very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.089" offset="4939565">And if you assume that what I am saying is correct, and I think it is correct, then a state's artificially saying that something is true that is not true cannot possibly govern the operation of our constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.664" offset="4993899">So we come again to the... I was mentioning the law of England that gave rise to this whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.788" offset="5038412">The Law Commission made a study and concluded, yes, limitations laws by their nature are substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.292" offset="5064430">Therefore the law in England now is, pursuant to Parliament, that the law of the place where the occurrence happened or the claim arose governs, whether longer or shorter, when the action is brought in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.439" offset="5141021">Now, there are also movements under foot to revise the Restatement of Contracts, Conflicts, second, section 142, which recognizing this problem, because you see, in the Ferens case, when the Ferens case, the Third Circuit held that this basically was a constitutional problem, and we had a situation where an accident in Pennsylvania and barred by the Pennsylvania statute was brought in Mississippi, where they have a longer statute, in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.980" offset="5299114">So it is brought in federal court, and the consequence of our old common law rule was that it is procedural and therefore you apply the law of Misssippi, which was six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.852" offset="5338611">Well, then under the forum non conveniens statute you bounce it back to federal court in Pennsylvania, where it was barred, of course, if it had been brought there by the statute, and suddenly you have a claim that is alive in Pennsylvania that was really dead in Pennsylvania, and this points out the whole illogic and irrationality of this common law fiction that says that a claim which is dead and unenforceable in the state which created it, and it is one, nevertheless lives and survives well in any state that fortuitously may have or later enact a longer statute of limitations, and allow this kind of forum shopping and hopscotching among the states in litigation to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.054" offset="5551457">And this is especially a problem in class actions such as this particular case, because what we will have is a forum state that has a law favorable to one particular class or one particular interest, so a class action will migrate to that state, and that state will then with the longer statute apply the law everywhere and perhaps apply its own law to the other states like Kansas has here and become a magnet state and a state which applies national law which it creates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.692" offset="6098043">--This again is a combination of objects by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.746" offset="6122180">For example, libel and slander might be one year in most states but two years or longer in some other states, even though the evince of libel may be maintained for years and years, but there is something about the public policy entitling people to repose, and saying to people that have claims and know about them, you assort these in a certain time or they are lost, and the defendant, the other party is entitled to be free and go about his business and not worry about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.432" offset="6240985">And there are different times for different types of activities, different wrongs or different breaches of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.138" offset="6271809">So again these are for the substantive repose of the litigants and to allow life to go on, and they are substantive because they affect the particular claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.000" offset="6343280">They terminate it entirely when it is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.118" offset="6351744">Now, under the present rule, procedural rule we can bring a case in Nevada, for example, against the Howard Hughes estate and be barred by limitations by the claim arising there, but the plaintiff then may march over to Texas and bring an action and say, you have a longer statute, and I am not barred by the judgment there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.448" offset="6433037">You not only do not give full faith and credit to the limitations law, but you don't give full faith and credit to the judgment because it didn't bar it on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.221" offset="6468146">It was just procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.337" offset="6472534">And then if Texas for some reason should find it barred, you jump over to another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.773" offset="6490298">Now, that's an actual case cited, from Texas, cited by respondents, and this business of substance and procedure is just an awful mess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.997" offset="6531258">Now, I am not proposing that this Court need to get involved in delineating when a state for its own purposes may call something procedural or substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.788" offset="6578383">Statutes of limitation by their nature are substantive, and constitutionally under due process under the Ferens case, under the expectations of the parties under the due process clause, they are entitled to rely upon the law of the state, that bundle of substantive rights which was created in that state where that claim arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.987" offset="6679215">Now, the Schreiber case... excuse me, the I mentioned the Ferens case and I was really thinking of the Schreiber case in the Tenth Circuit before where the Schreiber case allowed the action to be perpetuated in Kansas when it was barred in Kansas by being filed in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.023" offset="6791333">In the Ferens case, they said you can't do that, you can't jump over to Mississippi and come back to Pennsylvania and let the case continued because the Constitution requires that you look to the law where the claim arose and prevent this kind of nonsense, jumping back and forth between the states and applying hit or miss, fortuitously somebody's jurisdiction's longer statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.125" offset="6911705">Now, I have mentioned the lack of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.500" offset="6953187">It is an object of the full faith and credit clause, of course, in particular to obtain finality in litigation, as this Court has held, Justice White in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.343" offset="7012642">Another thing that has happened as a result of this old McLemoyle rule is that borrowing statutes were created by the states because there was a constitutional void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.583" offset="7065618">It doesn't seem right, this whole mess did not seem right to many states, and they enacted borrowing statutes to apply the statutes of limitations of these other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.966" offset="7363101">It did not adopt the higher federal rate from the federal statute which Kansas had adopted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon Penny</label>
            <text syncTime="1870.106" offset="7607711">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I believe the Court granted certiorari in this case to consider these interesting and important choice of law questions, and they are difficult and subtle, and they should not be regarded lightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.971" offset="7699140">But I think it's important not to become so deeply involved in the intricacies of the choice of law that we lose sight of the fundamental question in this case, and in my opinion the fundamental question is, are our courts, our institutions of justice capable of redressing an enormous interstate ripoff by a large national corporation at the expense of about 3,000 people located in several states, or does the expense of individual suits and the fact that the victims are located in many of the states mean that the courts can do little for them, and that the defendant can take and use their money with no real fear of accounting?</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.670" offset="7901955">The facts in this case show that Sun used money belonging to the plaintiff class members for several years and paid no compensation for its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.080" offset="7959529">This is money... is not money that Sun thought they might own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.949" offset="7979068">It was money which Sun never could own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.751" offset="7990249">It either belonged to the royalty owners, our clients, or it had to be refunded back to pipeline.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.917" offset="8186898">Do you think the full faith and credit clause might require Kansas to apply that Texas law?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon Penny</label>
            <text syncTime="2022.106" offset="8215633">Yes, I do, Justice O'Connor, if Kansas did not have enough other contacts with the litigation to make its application of its own statute of limitations reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.132" offset="8275715">I think the... I would like to talk a little bit now about substantive and procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.322" offset="8312495">I am not sure that the labels are very important here, but they are more than labels, and this is evident by the fact that when you get a... when the case is dismissed because it is brought too late for the statute of limitations, when it is an outlawed claim, that is not treated anywhere that I am aware of as a judgment on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.455" offset="8421060">Statutes of limitations have been considered procedural rather than substantive because they have nothing to do with the substance of the lawsuit, nothing to do with whether it is just or unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.167" offset="8487934">They are just either too old or still fresh enough to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.904" offset="8510817">Substantive laws governing liability have entirely to do with whether a claim is just or unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.295" offset="8564420">I guess statutes of limitation in that... in their application are completely arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.251" offset="8600260">They draw a line... in this case Sun says we are approximately two months too late on a part of the claims in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.744" offset="8654177">They don't allege that they are damaged in any way by our two-month delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.849" offset="8690644">The records have not gone anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.801" offset="8702451">Witnesses haven't died.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.253" offset="8712273">Their computers haven't burnt up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.787" offset="8718334">There is no damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.639" offset="8733798">But that is the way statutes of limitations work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.943" offset="8746964">The attack on Kansas' application of its own statutes of limitation is made on a couple of different grounds, and I would like to talk about the Fourteenth Amendment ground first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.558" offset="8841423">As I read the cases of this Court, the Fourteenth Amendment would not require Kansas to apply the statute of limitations of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.049" offset="8899414">In Hague versus Allstate and Phillips versus Shutts this Court determined what modest restrictions there are on the state's application of its own substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.428" offset="8964929">It seems to me that in application of a law which is part of the state's policy, part of the state's machinery for regulating its judicial process that the restrictions on the state's actions should be even more modest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.757" offset="9046223">Due process of law as Mr. Sawatzky discussed has a great deal to do with the expectation of the parties, and for the last 150 years I suppose any reasonably well informed potential litigant in this country would expect that the statute of limitations of the forum would apply in any lawsuit brought against that person.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.096" offset="9395636">And that is what we would have if Kansas is required to apply statutes of limitations of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.368" offset="9428655">Kansas has interests in this case which make application of its statutes of limitation and other procedural rules reasonable rather than unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.397" offset="9496783">I think in the administration of its court system there is a whole package of procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.151" offset="9531891">I think Kansas has an interest in maintaining the integrity of this package and of the scheme which it as a sovereign state has in regulating litigation in its own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.827" offset="9586539">It has an interest in regulating Sun Oil Company, which is qualified to do business and does do business in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.332" offset="9616528">I think there is an interest here in cooperating with other states to furnish a forum where this... where these 3,000 approximately claims can be litigated in one action that would save judicial resources and simplify the task.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.346" offset="9704613">And of course Kansas has an interest in regulating the oil and gas business which is an important commercial activity in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.619" offset="9741707">The other prong of the attack is full faith and credit, and as I understand this attack on Kansas... on the application of the forum statute of limitations, is that it somehow impairs other states' interests or offends other states in the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.353" offset="9848600">It is difficult for me to see how this can be when the other states involved here consider their statutes of limitations to be procedural.</text>

            <text syncTime="2683.033" offset="10859329">These are on written contracts, the oil and gas leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.087" offset="10879600">Although our recovery was probably based more on the theory of unjust enrichment, it was unjust enrichment by Sun keeping the money it owed our clients under the written contracts for longer than it should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.298" offset="10952430">Maybe one of the thorniest problems in this case is the Kansas courts' determination of the other states' law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.088" offset="10991614">When this case was... not this case, when the companion case, Phillips, was here before the majority opinion questioned the Kansas courts' finding all the law the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.436" offset="11920946">Their ruling was, if you have a case on a contract, and by looking at the face of the contract you can tell how much money is due on the contract, then their 6 percent interest rate applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.500" offset="11993253">They have judicially limited the application of that 6 percent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.051" offset="12015405">On all other cases, as I understand the Texas ruling, they are granting prejudgment interest at a rate corresponding to the bank prime rate compounded daily.</text>
