            <label>Mr. Franklyn M. Gimbel</label>
            <text syncTime="99.497" offset="539937">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.382" offset="551536">This Court has held for more than fifty years that a person accused of a crime may assert entrapment as a defense to such charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.804" offset="589256">In Russell, the entrapment defense was characterized as a judicially fashioned rule to enforce limitations upon the Executive branch of Government in the execution of Federal laws under our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.731" offset="648920">The Sorrells case of course which was the case that was decided 55 years ago, defined entrapment in the following terms:</text>
            <text syncTime="136.955" offset="689776">"The defense is available not in the view that the accused, though guilty, may go free, but that the government cannot be permitted to contend that if government officials are the instigators of the conduct, the person is guilty. "</text>
            <text syncTime="156.952" offset="769815">The essence of the position that we are asserting here today is that while this Court in the four significant cases in which it has addressed the issue of entrapment, Sorrells, Sherman, Russell and Hampton, has dealt various with the prerequisites for the establishment of entrapment as a method by which non-guilt can be established by a person who is the object of government ploy.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.804" offset="897188">This Court has not to date dealt with the ground rules by which that issue can get to a person's jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.410" offset="931669">Consequently, what has developed is a scenario where we have essentially three different predicates for a person who asserts an entrapment defense to get to his or her jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.622" offset="992482">If a person is accused of a crime, for example, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin... as is the case here... that person must first admit that he or she committed all of the elements of the offense with which he or she is charged, and also that he or she intended to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.285" offset="1075134">If the same person were accused of the same crime in the District of Columbia, that person would have to admit that he or she participated in the acts which are forbidden by the criminal statute, but not that such conduct was intended to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.414" offset="1155696">In San Francisco or Phoenix, a person who is accused of the same crime need not admit to any misconduct, need not admit to in fact having participated in the acts which constitute a violation of the underlying accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.327" offset="1235317">And so--</text>

            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="274.093" offset="1238347">What is your point?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.712" offset="1248796">Maybe that's why the case is here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="franklyn_m_gimbel" startTime="278.897" stopTime="557.895">
            <label>Mr. Franklyn M. Gimbel</label>
            <text syncTime="278.897" offset="1257573">--That's very good, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.599" offset="1264365">That is why the case is here, but in the government's response to our brief, it seems as though they are suggesting this is an inappropriate case to be a vehicle for addressing the dichotomy of views on how a case gets to the jury, because they argue essentially that there is not a sufficient factual basis for this case to have presented the issue of entrapment appropriately.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.947" offset="1357779">And I would hope that that would not be used by the Court to sidestep in fact the need to send out a signal to the courts throughout this country as to what in fact is the predicate for a person who asserts that their conduct was not the product of predisposition but rather was as a consequence of the intent which was implanted within their mind by government conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.699" offset="1472822">Now what rings clearly as essentially the competition in the views of what entrapment is or should be in this Court's cases is, on the one hand, the majority views of Sorrells, Sherman, Russell, and Hampton, that entrapment is in fact a method by which a person who shows inducement can be found not guilty of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.889" offset="1617540">Whereas, the alternative view that has been at least articulated by the concurring opinions in Sorrells and Sherman, and by the dissenting opinions in Hampton and in Russell, is that entrapment should be viewed in the sense of a confession of illegal conduct by an accused individual and the avoidance of the sanctions of that illegal conduct by essentially a forgiveness of the conduct as a matter of public policy in that the government conduct should essentially be a bar to prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.834" offset="1793292">Now, in Sorrells, the Court very clearly rejected the notion that entrapment, if asserted as a defense, should be asserted as in essence a plea in bar to the extent that that has any meaning in today's jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.647" offset="1868525">And if essentially that point of view is viewed as against the decision in this case in the Seventh Circuit, I maintain and urge you to consider that essentially what the Seventh Circuit and other circuits in the country which follow that rule have done is to say to people accused of crime in this country that if you wish to have a jury consider that issue, you must first assume that you have committed all of the elements including intent, and make this confession that was spelled out in Justice Robert's concurring opinion in Sorrells, in Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion in Sherman, and in the dissenting opinions in Russell and in Hampton.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.799" offset="2089207">And so I suggest to the Court that if this Court were tempted, as the government urges it to be, to adopt as standard for telling trial courts throughout this country that if an entrapment issue arises during the course of a case, it must arise in an environment where there is an admission of all of the elements of the offense, including intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.919" offset="2217625">And then essentially there is the posture of the court or the jury forgiving the conduct because it is less egregious than the government conduct which brought it about.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.180" offset="2278752">I don't think then for example that this Court could both maintain as precedent on the issue of entrapment the dictates of Sorrells, Sherman, Russell, and Hampton, and adopt the point of view that is expressed in the Seventh Circuit in the Mathews case as the precondition to having the issue considered by a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.165" offset="2498598">And I say that what was not adopted by the majority was the notion of confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.984" offset="2521900">If you look again at the very basic definition that grows out of Sorrells that is essentially stating the proposition of what entrapment is, it says it is not the view that the accused, though guilty, may go free but that the government cannot be permitted to contend that he is guilty of a crime where the government officials are instigators of the conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.267" offset="2611029">Yes, but I don't see that lays down much substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.071" offset="2634226">Certainly, entrapment is an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.940" offset="2645720">It's created by the courts for that situation where these opinions describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.760" offset="2669021">And it seems to me it's quite natural to have it very narrowly tailored since it isn't the absence of a statutory element at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.199" offset="2706742">And I for one would think there is a considerable danger of jury confusion if you could just introduce it without a very substantial requirement of a showing such as the Seventh Circuit said.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.875" offset="2761495">I think that juries in this country have been given a great amount of credit for being able to diligently follow the instructions of courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.897" offset="2801619">As is legion, there have been frequent occasions where there have been mid-trial errors and curative instructions and appellate courts have found that traditionally that jurors will follow the instructions of the judge and they will not be dissuaded from their purpose of finding the truth by reason of the fact that during the course of the trial, some incident occurred that was inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.404" offset="2943620">So isn't one reason that we should now think about how easily administered is this judicially created defense going to be?</text>

            <text syncTime="709.510" offset="2979983">--I think that it will be more easily judicially administered if this Court adopts as its standard, as a minimum, the positions that have been asserted and now constitute the law in the District of Columbia, in the Fifth Circuit or in the Ninth Circuit, than following in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.291" offset="3079144">Because the Seventh Circuit view essentially, not only in my view, intrudes into the area that's not been recognized by majority opinion in the landmark cases on this issue as the confession avoidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.170" offset="3150719">But additionally, there is the conflict between the requirement that an accused essentially admit to his or her criminal misconduct and his or her Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.179" offset="3202755">In other words, the essence of the requirement in the Seventh Circuit is that no person accused of crime can consider asserting entrapment as a defense, but for the fact that he or she does in essence incriminate himself of the offense by admitting every aspect of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.878" offset="3293452">And while this Court has essentially not yet dealt with the entrapment defense as rising to the level of giving birth to a Constitutional basis in the entrapment defense, it has said, and in the Russell case, that doesn't mean that some day there might not be a fact situation which will in and of its own essence suggest that there is such an outrageous abuse of those due process fundamentals incorporated in the Fifth Amendment, that it won't view entrapment as having constitutional overtones that have to be addressed by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.481" offset="3519882">The government seems to take the position that what we review here is the District Court's denial of the motion for mistrial, rather than the denial of the motion in limine.</text>

            <text syncTime="863.176" offset="3594696">I think that my colleague, Mr. Kaufman, who assisted me in this and tried the case, was so persuaded that this was an appropriate case for the presentation of the issue of entrapment to the jury that he used every procedural device possible to try to revisit the subject with the trial judge and get the trial judge to find that this case should be considered outside the mold of the Seventh Circuit prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.731" offset="3724891">And so he started with the motion in limine and he ended with the motion for mistrial, but the essence of all of those trial procedures is essentially that the trial judge made an unequivocal decision that declined to submit the issue of entrapment to the jury on the ground of the Seventh Circuit rule against having that issue considered by a jury where there's not first this admission of culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.750" offset="3837008">And while the government urged as an alternative consideration for the Court to sidestep giving the issue to the jury, a factual insufficiency, the Judge said that he would not address that as he had already resolved the issue on the first step, although he made a parenthetical side comment that he thought that the evidentiary base was somewhat shaky.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.587" offset="4072319">And in fact, in the Berkeley case which extensively discusses the burdens of proof... that's a decision that came out of the D.C. Circuit and which was affirmed and followed in the recent case, Kelly case, the court said, it is appropriate to place on the defendant... and I'm using the language of that case... the ultimate burden of showing government inducement of the crime, and thus the possibility... and that's the word of the Court... of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.622" offset="4192482">We do not think that the defendant should bear the burden of proving inducement by a preponderance of the evidence, his burden in requiring the prosecution to prove predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt is met by convincing the jury that there is some... and that's another word of the Court... some evidence of government inducement as the term is defined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.069" offset="5714272">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.938" offset="5725766">Mr. Gimbel spent I think most of his time talking about the inconsistency question in this case, and I'll reach that in a little while and explain why we think he's wrong on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.860" offset="5761397">But before I do, there is a prior question in this case, one which we think is logically precedent to that issue, and one which is of considerable practical importance: that is, when is there sufficient evidence in a case to bring an entrapment defense to the jury in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.453" offset="5819807">Now, to appreciate our position on that point, one has to appreciate what went on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.921" offset="5841645">This case was a run of the mill undercover operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.640" offset="5852512">A government agent offered petitioner a payoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.492" offset="5864006">At trial, petitioner conceded that he accepted the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.694" offset="5876753">The offer was repeated on several subsequent occasions and petitioner conceded he accepted each one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.831" offset="5897338">Petitioner conceded that he on at least one occasion that he himself asked for the payoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.069" offset="5914265">Petitioner conceded that he took the money without hesitation when it was finally produced by the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.138" offset="5942582">The jury's verdict establishes conclusively that this payoff was in fact an illegal gratuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.376" offset="5963480">Now, we think it is quite clear that on these facts, which are repeated in closely varying forms many times everyday in many undercover operations, petitioner has not produced sufficient evidence to bring his entrapment instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.812" offset="7001273">We have no quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.079" offset="7006288">That is the usual standard that is applied by the Federal courts where affirmative defenses are involved, except in the insanity case where Congress changed that by statute in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.787" offset="7049129">Although again, it is clear that Congress or in the absence of congressional action, the Court can place the burden, allocate the burden however it wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.094" offset="7098344">In order to resolve what I think is a very important legal threshold question when entrapment instruction should go to the jury, it is essential to start with a number of characteristics of the entrapment defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.152" offset="7146618">Entrapment, I think, is fair to say, is a curious doctrine and its origins and rationale are somewhat obscure and have been hotly debated by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.358" offset="7179428">But the definition of entrapment is at this point quite clear, as Mr. Gimbel suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.977" offset="7197922">A defendant, to make out a case of entrapment must show that government action induced criminal conduct on the part of someone who was not predisposed to commit the crime, someone who is the unwary innocent described in this Court's opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.921" offset="7261661">Several things follow directly from this definition of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.456" offset="7275767">First, it is quite clear that although it is often said that the entrapment defense is designed to protect innocent people against overzealous police conduct, an entrapped defendant is not an entirely nonculpable defendant and a simple example makes this clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.050" offset="7334177">If someone is induced to commit a crime by his friend or his brother-in-law or by any private party, he has no entrapment defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.322" offset="7371271">No matter how powerful the inducement, so long as it falls short of duress, that person will be convicted at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.142" offset="7394572">Now, when the government provides the inducement, there may be some reason... and the Court has found a reason to create a defense... but the complete lack of blameworthiness on the part of the defendant is not one of those reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.498" offset="7435950">There must be some other reason to let someone go after he has in fact committed all the elements of the offense with the requisite mental state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.721" offset="7464894">A second thing follows from the definition of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.639" offset="7480567">The entrapment doctrine is often said to act as a prophylactic rule that prevents the police from making criminals out of otherwise law abiding people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.162" offset="7514631">But the status of the defendant as otherwise law abiding we think is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.583" offset="7532290">It means that the kind of government conduct that may give rise to an entrapment defense is conduct that is calculated to make a normally law abiding person commit a crime, conduct that might be said to put the moral fiber of that person to an unfair test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.075" offset="7594252">And even in those circumstances where there is this sort of coercive conduct, an entrapment defense is not necessarily made out no matter how coercive the government's action, a defendant will be convicted if he was predisposed to commit the crime, if he was the unwary criminal and not the unwary innocent described in this Court's opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.954" offset="7669798">Now, these characteristics of entrapment tell us something very important about the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.774" offset="7685054">It is a very narrow doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.824" offset="7693309">It comes into play only at the intersection of two independent policies, where the defendant has a relatively reduced culpability, and where the government action is overbearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.998" offset="7733955">And this central fact about entrapment dictates what the defendant must show to take his entrapment claim to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.902" offset="7761645">First, in a formula used by Judge McGowan, among many other lower court judges, defendant must show inducement of a sort that might realistically be expected to lead a normally law abiding person to commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.460" offset="7811800">It's obviously not enough to satisfy this requirement that the government is the but for cause of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.864" offset="7833429">That's going to be true in every, for example, police decoy operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.316" offset="7847222">But the unlucky criminal who chooses to mug an undercover police officer clearly has not been entrapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.588" offset="7876375">By the same token, a simple criminal proposition or simple solicitation of the defendant, a simple offer of a payoff cannot be enough to raise inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.127" offset="7914513">The Court has always emphasized that the government must be free to present opportunities or the facilities for the commission of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.550" offset="7944189">And again, in Judge McGowan's observation is a general behavioral assumption that people should not have difficulty resisting criminal temptations, no matter how tempting the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.839" offset="7989328">When the offer stands alone without more, it is something we expect people to resist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.726" offset="8012943">And again examples make this quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.595" offset="8024332">If an undercover policeman approaches someone on the street and offers to buy heroin from that person or offers to sell him stolen goods, or offers him a payoff, that person if he accepts the transaction clearly has not been entrapped because that's the sort of thing we expect everyone to be able to resist without any difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.323" offset="8095281">For inducement to be present in a case, there must be something more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.210" offset="8110850">There must be clearly some element of coercion in the government's conduct, or some powerful appeal to sympathy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.364" offset="8135405">Something that explains why a normally law abiding person might have committed the crime, and something that serves to mitigate that person's involvement in the crime, something that gives us a good reason to let him off.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="2063.556" stopTime="2199.106">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="2063.556" offset="8396211">Well, our preferred approach... and we understand that there is a close question as to which of the two approaches is preferable... our preferred approach is the Seventh Circuit's approach, as I'll explain later on at the end of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.780" offset="8445113">We think that a defendant who is seeking the special care of the entrapment defense should not be entitled to argue to the jury simultaneously that he was not guilty of the crime, because the existence of entrapment presupposes the existence of all of the elements of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.806" offset="8505194">As I say, we understand that when the defendant has not himself taken the stand, or introduced evidence which is directly inconsistent with that, the inconsistency is not quite so powerful as it is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.049" offset="8562141">But as I say, I'll explain our position on that in more detail at the tail end of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.803" offset="8589204">We think and my focus now is we hope the Court uses it to dispose of this case is the ground that because there was no coercion, no powerful appeal to sympathy of this sort, no overbearing government conduct, there could not have been and clearly was not inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.682" offset="8660675">And when there is no inducement, the case should not go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.451" offset="8675826">There is of course a second prerequisite to the entrapment defense, that is, the existence of predisposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.056" offset="8702262">Defendant who wants the benefit of the entrapment defense must have been at least persuaded to commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.393" offset="8735594">He could not have been waiting for an opportunity that the government happened to present to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.030" offset="8750118">And while it may not always be easy to separate predisposed and unpredisposed defendants, certainly a defendant who jumps at a criminal opportunity, in Judge Friendly's words, who was ready and willing to commit the crime without persuasion, cannot assert that he lacked predisposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.790" offset="8813126">And without at least some evidence in the case that there was a lack of predisposition, the courts are quite clear... or at least many courts have held that entrapment should not go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.681" offset="8856698">And we think that's appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.747" offset="8864953">As I say, in making this argument, we are not asking the Court to make any factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.715" offset="8880835">We think that accepting the petitioner's own account of the crime, own account of what happened here, his own account of the inducement and his reaction to it, the Court can decide and should decide as a matter of law that there was no entrapment and therefore the issue should not have gone to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2250.873" offset="9145508">Let me simply then make one final point on our first submission, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.244" offset="9174974">The reason that we think it is quite clear that the Court will not have to make factual findings and why it is an important legal principle that should be settled in this case, can be found from looking at the facts of this case, which I suggested at the outset are typical of undercover operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.356" offset="9243415">Here there was as I suggested a simple offer and acceptance, in fact a series of offers and acceptances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.860" offset="9269433">There was no coercion, there were no attempts at persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.795" offset="9281136">There was nothing that could be remotely called overbearing on the part of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.782" offset="9297122">In arguing for inducement, all the petitioner himself was able to say was that the government agent told him that if he didn't take the money quickly, the agent would spend it himself so that his wife wouldn't find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.340" offset="9343307">Putting this sort of time limit on a criminal proposal we think is clearly not overbearing and is not the sort of thing that should lead anybody to commit an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.612" offset="9380401">And as I said, a defendant who cannot show inducement beyond a simple offer and acceptance is not entitled to bring his case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.100" offset="9410389">While that's enough to dispose of our first argument, I should add it is quite clear that the defendant in this case was in fact predisposed to commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.039" offset="9438184">There was a simple offer and acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.656" offset="9444662">He conceded a trial that he expressed in interest in the first offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.240" offset="9458977">He conceded at trial that he expressed interest in all the subsequent offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.477" offset="9471934">He conceded that he took the money without hesitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.694" offset="9480816">His only excuse was that he viewed the payoff as a personal loan and not an illegal gratuity but that excuse was conclusively rejected by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.452" offset="9523761">Now, on the second point, which we think provides an independent and equally fundamental reason for denying an entrapment instruction here, a point that Justice O'Connor has asked about and that was the focus of the Court of Appeals' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.645" offset="9584574">The Court of Appeals noted, we think, obviously correctly, that the defendant's simultaneous attempt to say that he did not commit the crime, and to argue entrapment as an alternative ground for acquittal presented inconsistent defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.321" offset="9647268">The defendant was trying to say, in effect, I didn't do it, but if you don't believe that, I've got another one for you; the government made me do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.446" offset="9691780">It seems to us, as an initial matter, there is no doubt about the inconsistency of these defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.433" offset="9711738">The Court has specifically defined entrapment as the commission of all of the elements of the offense at the instance of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.770" offset="9737024">And the Court has made it very clear that the essence of entrapment is the implantation of a criminal disposition and a specific criminal intent in the mind of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="2430.558" offset="9864189">The question arises with great frequency in entrapment cases and with great infrequency in other sorts of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.212" offset="9894804">We searched diligently and could find very little authority anywhere on whether or not inconsistent defenses outside of the entrapment context are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.318" offset="9927300">And I think the reason for that is that defendants generally perceive that they will so damage their credibility if they make clearly inconsistent defenses before a jury, that they just simply don't try to do it very often.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.458" offset="9971813">So the question really has no practical importance outside the entrapment area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.880" offset="11457553">When he tells a story that is inconsistent with his having been entrapped, we think for him to ask for acquittal on entrapment grounds is to ask for a windfall acquittal, which is not justified on his stated view of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.438" offset="11503738">And a defendant who is acquitted on that ground has been acquitted on the basis of something that he has implicitly testified is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.759" offset="11537070">Now, this is particularly clear in the entrapment setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.781" offset="11561103">A defendant who, let me take a step back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.566" offset="11584300">As I suggested earlier, in discussing the first aspect of this case, a defendant who has been entrapped and wants to be acquitted on that ground is not a non-culpable defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.791" offset="11625155">He is unlike a defendant acquitted on any other affirmative defense basis, and unlike a defendant who is acquitted on insanity grounds or self-defense grounds or duress grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.336" offset="11695372">And therefore the Court has emphasized entrapment is a uniquely narrow defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.955" offset="11709792">We ought to have a particularly good reason to allow a defendant to make this defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.590" offset="11724316">Now, certainly when a defendant believes that there are factual grounds that exist that support his claim that he did not factually commit the crime, he's entitled to present those grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.105" offset="13158438">Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.640" offset="13168574">I would like to address the comments of Justice Scalia, Justice Stevens, and Justice O'Connor, on what I believe to be uniquely in this case the lack of inconsistency between what Mr. Mathews did at the trial and his being in an appropriate position to have his jury consider the entrapment defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.288" offset="13251121">In fact, while the facts are kind of immaterial to the ultimate call in this case by the Court, it is not Mr. Mathews view that the entrapment defense should be revisited and changed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.178" offset="13302739">We're willing to settle on the fact that an accused must first show that he was induced to do something improper, and secondly that there must be a demonstration that he was not otherwise predisposed once the activities were undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.121" offset="13362507">But in this case, Mr. Mathews was accused of having received a gratuity, and the facts show that Mr. Mathews was a long time associate and friend of the government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.698" offset="13412767">They had a personal relationship away from their business relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.917" offset="13429694">They had in fact exchanged finances on prior occasions, prior to the time when Mr. DeShazer who was the person who put the money in Mr. Mathews' hand and who was working under the tutelage of the FBI and recording conversations between them took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.611" offset="13500433">And so Mr. Mathews was essentially confronted with this dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.182" offset="13518719">And I think in this case, uniquely so because as Justice Stevens appropriately pointed out, the call on whether or not Mr. Mathews could get the entrapment defense submitted to his jury was made before the case began.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.740" offset="13576920">And so, as counsel for Mr. Mathews, it would be incumbent upon his trial lawyer to say, look, Fred, if you want to go to this jury on the issue of the fact that the government really induced you into this conduct, you can't get up on that witness stand and tell that jury that you did not intend to give him something in the nature of some official performance on your part in exchange for this loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.009" offset="13686007">And Mr. Mathews had to make the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.709" offset="13692799">That would be dishonest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.461" offset="13703875">I did not anticipate that receiving this money was in any way connected to my position as an employee of the government and his position as a client of the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.653" offset="13960607">That it doesn't make any sense to exclude it because an argument can't be made that it's not contradictory in a rather global sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.044" offset="14006164">And I think Justice Stevens came up with a hypothetical and while it didn't apply to this case, the fact that a person works for the government, another person's a client of the government in that particular agency and there's a financial transaction between them that essentially doesn't have any co-relationship to each other would be an appropriate basis for that particular individual to say, no, I didn't violate the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3614.056" offset="14598203">If it were just that, there would be no inconsistency at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.008" offset="14610011">He is saying that this idea in my mind was not there of its own, the government put it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.412" offset="14635611">That's what he's saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.146" offset="14638536">He is saying something about his mind that is utterly inconsistent about what his not guilty plea says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.650" offset="14660584">He's saying this idea to commit the crime was put there by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.118" offset="14674481">Now, it is an inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.304" offset="14679183">Maybe you don't mind inconsistency in criminal trials, but the advantage of it is that it puts the defendant to the test and thereby improves the truth finding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.843" offset="14717322">He has to tell the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.943" offset="14721710">Now, which is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.826" offset="14725263">You say the one or the other, but don't come in and say both because it makes it harder, you get two bites at the apple and you're playing games with the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.432" offset="14759744">I just can't agree with that proposition, Justice Scalia, because the truth on intent is an amorphous concept and ten people looking at the same incident, nine may view it one way, and one view it another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.727" offset="14820871">That doesn't mean that the one is a liar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.679" offset="14832678">It's from his perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.512" offset="14839993">And Mr. Mathews was entitled to say I did not intend to relate this loan to some improper government conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.868" offset="14873429">And that's not inconsistent with his saying that, I did take the money, and I did have some dealings with this man, and they superimposed this intent, they juxtaposed the intent on me in the scheme of their dealings with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.210" offset="14934869">And so while I don't need to say that at least in my view, I don't need to convince you that inconsistent defenses should never be allowed, because I don't believe that, but I think in this case that the truth is something that is so elusive when it comes to intent, that Mr. Mathews was not necessarily playing a game, when he said, jury, I didn't do this to violate the law, and yet whatever I did, I did because of the creative activity of the government, and so I should have had my jury decide, first, did I do this to violate the law, and then once reaching that, did I do this because the government essentially made me do it, or induced me by their creative activity to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.441" offset="15119712">And I think that that's what Mr. Mathews was entitled to, and I think that the Seventh Circuit rule on the subject matter is too confining and it's not good law and you ought to look elsewhere for your decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.666" offset="15168613">And the elsewhere is out there in this circuit, in the Fifth Circuit in eloquently argued cases, and even beyond that in the Ninth Circuit where they say, you can go in and say anything you want but inconsistent arguments will be seen by a jury very quickly, and you'll lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.044" offset="15242174">And that's probably the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.944" offset="15249802">And so, in conclusion, I urge you, as I know you will, to look very closely at the unfairness... and that's what it really is... the unfairness of the constrictions that were placed upon Mr. Mathews and anyone else similarly situated by the Seventh Circuit rule, saying essentially, that you must admit your crime.</text>
