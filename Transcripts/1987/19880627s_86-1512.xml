            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">Finally, Pierce versus Underwood comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.467" offset="33855">One of the petitioner's predecessors as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development decided not to implement a program authorized by federal statute, which was intended to provide payments to owners of Government-subsidized apartment buildings in order to offset rising utility expenses and property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.105" offset="108356">Various plaintiffs, including respondents who are members of a nationwide class of housing tenants, successfully challenged that decision in lawsuits filed in nine different Federal District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.379" offset="153496">After two of these District Court decisions were affirmed on appeal, a newly appointed Secretary of HUD settled with most of the plaintiffs including respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.312" offset="197172">While the settlement was being administered, Congress passed the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), which authorizes an award of attorney's fees against the Government, “unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified”.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.429" offset="273659">The District Court in this case awarded attorney's fees to respondents under the EAJA concluding that the Secretary's decision not to implement the operating-subsidy program had not been substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.652" offset="322560">The Ninth Circuit affirmed and we granted the Government's petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.117" offset="344398">The case raises four separate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.378" offset="353489">First, what standard of review should the Court of Appeals use when reviewing a District Court's determination that the Government's position was or was not substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.577" offset="398211">We conclude that the Ninth Circuit was correct in applying the deferential abusive-of-discretion standard rather than applying the de novo standard and giving the determination plenary review.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.057" offset="448157">Deferential review was suggested by the EAJA's language structure and as a matter of sound judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.727" offset="478877">The next question is, what does the phrase “substantially justified” mean as used in the EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.788" offset="503118">The word “substantial” can have two quite different connotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.210" offset="528823">On the one hand, it could mean considerable in amount or large, on the other hand, it can mean for the most part or in the main, as for example, in the statement what he said was substantially true.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.433" offset="557662">We conclude that this latter connotation is correct and that substantially justified means justified in substance or in the main that is justified to a degree that would satisfy a reasonable person.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.426" offset="605623">This interpretation accords with related uses of the term substantial and is the standard that has been adopted by the vast majority of the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.433" offset="641672">The third question is, did the District Court abuse its discretion in deciding that the Secretary's position in this case was not substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.478" offset="673855">We conclude that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.857" offset="679393">The Government's arguments on the merits of the underlying issue do not command the conclusion that its position was substantially justified, therefore, the award of attorney's fees is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.952" offset="723801">Finally, we turned to the problem of calculating the amount of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.695" offset="746684">The EAJA provides that fees awarded must “be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished except that fees shall not be awarded in excess of $75 per hour, unless the Court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved justifies a higher fee."</text>
            <text syncTime="212.128" offset="848457">We conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in awarding fees at a rate in excess of $75 per hour adjusted for inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.187" offset="880744">In order to give any substantial effect to the statute's $75 cap on fees, the special factors referred to in the statute must be such as are not of broad and general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.441" offset="929750">The factors relied on by the District Court here such as the work and ability of counsel and the contingent nature of the fee do not qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.759" offset="962978">We therefore affirm in part, vacate in part and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.469" offset="981786">The Chief Justice and Justice Stevens joined the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.610" offset="998400">Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justices Marshall and Blackmun joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.320" offset="1029224">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice O'Connor joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.476" offset="1053884">Justice Kennedy took no part.</text>
