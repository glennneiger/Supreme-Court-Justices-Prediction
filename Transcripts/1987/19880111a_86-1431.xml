            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Van Amburg</label>
            <text syncTime="82.717" offset="456882">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="86.169" offset="470674">For over 75 years since this Court's decision in National Home v. Parrish, it's been the general rule that an agency authorized by Congress to sue and be sued is liable for prejudgment interest in the same way and under the same circumstances as a private enterprise would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.724" offset="544862">The Government today seeks an exception to this general rule to deny interest to employees of sue and be-sued agencies who have been the victims of employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.688" offset="592718">We believe that the issue in this case, that is, whether or not an employee may recover prejudgment interest in a Title VII case against the Postal Service is flatly resolved by the application of a longstanding principle governing resolution of claims against sue and be-sued agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.680" offset="672758">And that principle is one first articulated by this Court in a 1940 case, FHA v. Burr known as the "liberal construction rule".</text>
            <text syncTime="147.081" offset="714345">And that rule is that a sue and be-sued clause in the charter of a Federal agency effects a broad waiver of immunity and subjects that agency to suit and the natural incidence of suit which a private enterprise would be liable for in the same circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.277" offset="791145">That rule was more recently reaffirmed by this Court in a suit against the Postal Service, the Franchise Tax Board case in 1984 interpreting the scope of the waiver of immunity in the charter of the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.287" offset="851122">The no-interest rule, which is another longstanding rule which is to the effect that interest cannot be recovered against the Government absent an express statutory waiver, is not applicable to the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.124" offset="914547">This Court, in another Title VII case the last term, Library of Congress v. Shaw, noted that the no-interest rule doesn't apply to agencies which have assumed the status of a private commercial enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.322" offset="975256">And typically Congress has waived the immunity of the agency by inserting into its charter, a sue and be-sued clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.662" offset="1008692">We believe that the Postal Service is one such agency noted by this Court in footnote 5 of the Shaw opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.063" offset="1042234">The no-interest rule doesn't apply to it because it does not have the status of a sovereign for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.591" offset="1072431">The Government's position is that there is not one agency which fits within the footnote 5 exception of the Shaw decision to the no-interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.805" offset="1121228">We don't believe that footnote 5 is superfluous; we think it's a reflection of this Court's understanding of the 75-year-old rule that interest is recoverable against a sue and be-sued agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.286" offset="1175145">Is the Postal Service a footnote 5 agency?</text>
            <text syncTime="268.079" offset="1198341">Clearly, the Franchise Tax Board case answers that question squarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.061" offset="1222269">It is such an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.076" offset="1230315">Congress intended the Postal Service, when it chartered it in the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act, to operate as much like a private business as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.430" offset="1271693">In Franchise Tax Board, this Court stated that because of the Charter of the Postal Reorganization Act, because of the legislative history, we must assume that the Postal Service's liability is the same as a private business.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.535" offset="1340134">And we must also assume that Congress did not intend to preserve sovereign immunity for the Postal Service.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="310.218" offset="1366883">Well, if this weren't a Title VII case, don't you think that the Government would agree with you, with everything you've said so far?</text>

            <text syncTime="326.102" offset="1430413">What about the Postal Service, would they agree with you in the Postal Service if this were an ordinary lawsuit, rather than a Title VII case?</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Van Amburg</label>
            <text syncTime="333.038" offset="1458207">I would hope they would because there's so many consistent court decisions to the effect that interest is recoverable against a sue and be-sued agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.207" offset="1494883">Those decisions have followed in the breach of contract actions, other back pay actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.110" offset="1518498">Their position is based upon an inference, Justice White, that under section 717, Congress intended to impose equal liability upon all Federal Agencies regardless of whether it's a sue and be-sued agency.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="365.730" stopTime="369.992">
            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="365.730" offset="1588924">I think their argument follows from Title VII in Shaw.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.992" offset="1605956">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.445" offset="1611807">But they don't acknowledge that the Postal Service is a footnote 5 agency where the no-interest rule doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.614" offset="1640438">Because all Section 717 does is lays out a statutory scheme for processing charges for Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.751" offset="1677009">But once that employee gets to the Federal courtroom, the remedies are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.576" offset="1696340">The only thing that prevents an employee of the Federal Government from getting interest is the no-interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.075" offset="1722358">And that rule simply doesn't apply to the Postal Service.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="403.058" stopTime="437.466">
            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="403.058" offset="1738240">Well, Ms. Van Amburg, I suppose at bottom, we're dealing with waiver of sovereign immunity and the extent to which it's been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.900" offset="1769587">And I suppose you can take the position that when Congress enacted Section 717 in Title VII, that it was adopting a more limited waiver of sovereign immunity, and that that more limited waiver should be read as limiting the more general waiver enacted in the sue and be-sued clause for the Postal Service.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lisa_s_van_amburg" startTime="437.466" stopTime="648.676">
            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Van Amburg</label>
            <text syncTime="437.466" offset="1875853">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.997" offset="1878047">That's what the Postal Service's position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.652" offset="1888601">However, Congress is experienced in legislating against the backdrop of liberal construction rule, and Congress knows how to express in a statute what it wants to do if it wants to delimit the general waiver of a sue and be sued agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.458" offset="1959863">It did that in the Federal Tort Claims Act back in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.596" offset="1976372">Section 2679 of the Federal Tort Claims Act explicitly states that the authority of any Federal agency to sue and be sued in its own name shall not be construed to authorize suits against such agency on claims cognizable under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.464" offset="2055889">And the remedies provided by the Federal Tort Claims Act shall be the exclusive remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.117" offset="2078459">So here Congress in the Federal Tort Claims Act acknowledges that a sue and be sued clause in the charter of a Federal agency can be a separate source of authority for proceeding under suit or for certain remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.846" offset="2137391">And Congress did not do that in Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.751" offset="2148989">Not that it wouldn't have known how to, but it simply is silent in Title VII about how to treat sue and be sued agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.607" offset="2188487">So I think that we have to defer to Congress' experience in legislating against this long-standing liberal construction rule which tells us that it's up to Congress to draw the line on these delimitations of a general waiver effected by a sue and be sued clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.411" offset="2267690">It shouldn't be the Court's inferring any delimitations absent plain evidence of Congress' intent to delimit the general waiver, or absent a grave interference with a Governmental function, which I don't think we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.123" offset="2342505">There's certainly no policy reason for drawing the line on interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.198" offset="2366851">This Court's recognized in General Motors v. Devex that interest can be a catalyst to avoiding prolonged litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.287" offset="2411154">The Postal Service is one of the most frequently sued employers under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.738" offset="2432993">Making them liable for prejudgment interest might further earlier settlement of meritorious claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.406" offset="2463608">I might note that this case was appealed on the merits to the United States Court of Appeals on issues of credibility findings of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.731" offset="2504986">If Federal Express takes interest into consideration as to whether to settle a claim, why shouldn't the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.679" offset="2548767">I think that Congress intended the Postal Service to bring its management decisionmaking as nearly as possible up to the level of private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.863" offset="2589518">And so there really is no policy reason to draw the line by inference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.579" offset="2612297">And Justice O'Connor's point about Section 717 is correct; that's the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.905" offset="2637584">The Government wants the Court to infer a delimitation on the general waiver from the language of Section 717, but all that that language does is tell us how to process the charges for the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.931" offset="2689724">Once that employee gets into the Federal courtroom, that employee's entitled to the same remedies as a private employee would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.182" offset="2834756">More by what it doesn't say than what it does say.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.680" offset="2844787">I think its silence on the issue of whether interest is recoverable is not particularly instructive, because as this Court noted in the Shaw case, interest is an element of damages that's historically been viewed as separate from damages on a separate claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.845" offset="2909362">But its silence on the exclusiveness of the damages or the remedy for sue and be sued agencies is more instructive, given what Congress had done in the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.590" offset="2964323">So if we are to conclude that the no-interest rule applies to the Postal Service, we would be doing so undermining this liberal construction rule which has been in place for 48 years now.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.194" offset="3018763">The fact that it's in different names is, I think, an irrelevant procedural distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.969" offset="3409868">And there was some debate about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.422" offset="3415719">The debate was not over sovereign immunity; it was a debate whether to leave the employees of the Postal Service under the Executive Order or to put them under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.356" offset="3455425">Which shows, I think, that Congress is viewing Title VII as a different kind of agency, the fact that they even talked about putting them under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.120" offset="3482488">But the issue was where would the employees be better off, under the Executive Order or under Title VII, and that was the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.304" offset="3515194">But they later changed their mind about where they'd be better off.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.443" offset="3527837">The issue of sue and be sued in the official name versus the name of the Postmaster's the exact kind of issue that was raised in FHA v. Burr, and dismissed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.374" offset="3591471">Courts have been reluctant to draw procedural distinctions that would sabotage this rule construing sue and be sued clauses broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.480" offset="3627938">I think that this Court rejected a similar procedural distinction in the Franchise Tax Board case when you said we're really not going to say that a suit in an administrative proceeding is not covered under the sue and be sued clause versus a suit in the courtroom.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.687" offset="5376784">Well, I think there are two answers to that, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.935" offset="5389740">First, let me just spell out a little bit how the system worked from 1964 to 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.465" offset="5415863">In 1970, when Congress created the Postal Service it preserved, we think, the sovereign immunity as to employment discrimination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.306" offset="5455256">Congress specifically considered extending to the Postal Service the existing private sector provisions of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.820" offset="5481274">It decided not to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.023" offset="5486080">So in 1970, it was quite clear that a Postal employee could not sue the Federal Government under Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.571" offset="5644278">--That's quite right, Justice Stevens, but the crucial point is not when the cause of action was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.427" offset="5667683">We certainly agree that causes of action created after the enactment of the sue and be sued clause may be brought under that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.972" offset="5693910">But there are two reasons why the clause here is not the waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.422" offset="5711674">First, Congress in 1972 when it enacted the Federal sector provisions of Title VII which grant a remedy for employment discrimination to all Federal employees, Congress viewed that as you say, as creating a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.574" offset="5768307">It also clearly said at the time, and the Court has since recognized that that was a blanket waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.073" offset="5790354">It is that blanket waiver of immunity that allows all Title VII actions against the Government, including this one, to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.367" offset="5819507">Now, the fact that Title VII was extended to an agency like the Postal Service that already had a sue and be sued clause in its charter, I think, is a matter of happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.393" offset="5855556">It doesn't affect the identity of the waiver of the statute that's waiving immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.532" offset="5876140">Congress viewed that blanket waiver as the waiver which made these suits possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.624" offset="5892545">And I think there is clear textual evidence of that, and that is the second reason for saying that it is Title VII and not the sue and be sued clause that is the waiver here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.153" offset="5926609">Those two provisions actually authorize suits against different named defendants, as Justice Scalia noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.792" offset="5949179">Section 717(c) of Title VII waives the Government's immunity in suits brought against the head of the defendant's agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.805" offset="5985228">That is why this case is captioned, Loeffler v. Tisch, Postmaster General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.693" offset="6000797">In contrast, the sue and be sued clause makes the Postal Service amenable to suit in its official name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.721" offset="6028905">And that is why a typical suit that is brought pursuant to the clause in which the clause is the waiver is captioned something like, Freed v. U.S. Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.921" offset="6061714">Now, this obviously is a technical distinction but it has real significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.811" offset="6077283">The courts will uniformly dismiss Title VII actions that are brought against the agency rather than against the agency head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.683" offset="6108735">That means that this case can proceed only because it is Title VII that makes the Postmaster General amenable to process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.306" offset="6135275">And if it is Title VII that makes the defendant amenable to suit, it must be Title VII itself that provides the relevant waiver of immunity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.661" offset="6168607">Now, in turn, the Court has made it quite clear repeatedly that it is the statute waiving immunity that sets out the conditions under which the Government has agreed to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.455" offset="6203820">And Shaw held clearly that one of the conditions under the Title VII waiver is that it does not authorize awards of interest to employees suing any part of the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.040" offset="6470165">But I mean, I should emphasize that the Postal budget is part of the budget of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.022" offset="6494093">The Postal Service in allocating expenditures from the Postal fund, which as I said is part of the Federal Treasury, will send its budget to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.847" offset="6529411">The President, through the Office of Management and Budget, will send it on to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.471" offset="6543935">Congress approves that budget as part of the United States' budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.158" offset="6554697">The money comes out of the Federal Treasury, out of the Postal Service comes out of the Federal Treasury and therefore adds to the Federal budget deficit, one reason why Congress is now tinkering with the Postal budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.310" offset="6595239">In fact, in Section 409 of the Postal Reorganization Act which deals with suits against the Postal Service, Congress specifically categorized judgments paid from the Postal fund as judgments against the United States which are paid out of the Postal fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.242" offset="6658978">So I think the money that's at stake here must be characterized as Federal money, money coming out of the United States Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.910" offset="6681652">Certainly, without a waiver of sovereign immunity, an express waiver somewhere, petitioner could not sue and get its hands on that cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.688" offset="6712790">And that we think is the first dispositive reason for ruling for the Postal Service here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.639" offset="6736614">The waiver of sovereign immunity in this case is Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.888" offset="6749571">That waiver does not allow for awards of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.059" offset="6762214">Therefore, the express waiver of sovereign immunity, the only waiver that allows the suit to proceed, is not broad enough to allow them to obtain awards of interest under this Court's holding in Shaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.134" offset="6806518">And there is also, as I suggested, a second independent reason for ruling for the Postal Service in this case, which is not at all technical or sophisticated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.190" offset="6846746">It's a simple matter of Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.862" offset="6853434">Even if it is true that the sue and be sued clause is the source of the waiver here... and we don't think that it is... but even if that were true, all that would mean is that the clause allows petitioner to bring the Postal Service into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.357" offset="6907455">It would remain Title VII that provides the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.372" offset="6919471">It would remain Title VII that defines the scope of the relief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.886" offset="6933577">And there's nothing controversial about this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.369" offset="6943504">If Congress had said expressly in Title VII that Federal employees could not obtain interest under that statute, it is quite clear that nothing in the sue and be sued clause could change that outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.069" offset="6986240">But that is essentially this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.114" offset="6994495">The Court has already held in Shaw that Title VII does not authorize awards of interest to Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.846" offset="7021349">Therefore... it did that of course not by expressly withholding interest, but by omitting any mention of interest from the statute... that means that petitioner is not entitled to interest, simply because his cause of action does not provide interest as part of the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.903" offset="7077669">Now, Ms. Van Amburg's response to that point this morning has been to suggest that the Federal sector provisions of Title VII have a split personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.117" offset="7110478">That those same provisions should be interpreted to withhold interest from other Federal employees, while granting interest to employees of the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.710" offset="7144856">And her rationale for that assertion is the suggestion that Congress viewed the Postal Service as being just like a private commercial corporation and that it therefore must have wanted Postal employees to be treated just like private sector workers under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.987" offset="7202011">Now, we think there are several fundamental problems with that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.688" offset="7216745">First, it oversimplifies the nature of what is a very complicated Federal Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.654" offset="7236598">It is certainly true that, as petitioner effectively lays out in its brief, that there are many ways in which the Postal Service is like a private corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.714" offset="7272856">But it is equally true, as we point out in our brief and in an enormously long footnote on pages 19 and 20, it is equally true that there are a great many ways in which the Postal Service is nothing like a private corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.836" offset="7317368">Among many other things, the Postal Service exercises power of eminent domain, and enters into international agreements, and investigates criminal violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.348" offset="7351432">Obviously it's represented by the Solicitor General when it appears in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.830" offset="7365329">And in a variety of other ways, the Postal Service is just like all other Federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.547" offset="7384242">Now, the second more fundamental problem with petitioner's suggestion that the Postal Service is very much like a private corporation is that we think it is beside the point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.090" offset="7418410">We think that petitioner's list of Postal Service characteristics and our competing list are essentially irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.086" offset="7454354">It would not be a sensible approach for the Court to add up the number of statutes cited by each brief and decide on the basis of who has the longer list that for all time and all purposes, the Postal Service is more like a private corporation or is more like a Government agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.049" offset="7514227">The question here is a much narrower one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.282" offset="7523109">It concerns how Congress wanted Postal employees to resolve their complaints of employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.031" offset="7542126">On that we think the answer is quite clear; Postal employees are Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.624" offset="7556545">They are in the Postal Service which is expressly made by statute, a part of the Civil Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.809" offset="7581205">In particular, and of dispositive importance here, Congress has always treated Postal Service employees identically to all other Federal employees for purposes of equal employment opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.415" offset="7623628">In 1970, Congress specifically considered protecting Postal Service employees by the private sector provisions of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.631" offset="7652571">It decided not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.270" offset="7655079">It decided to extend the existing Federal sector antidiscrimination provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.112" offset="7670439">In 1972 of course Congress placed the Postal Service in the Federal sector and not in the private sector provisions of Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.709" offset="8268852">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was the basic charter of rights of Federal employees, applies to most to Postal employees who are veterans preferences, and applies to other Federal Postal Employees except to the extent that it's displaced by a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.905" offset="8341682">There are also as I say a wide variety of independent provisions of personnel laws that apply to Postal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.497" offset="8371984">And in particular, in the Title VII contracts, the differences between Postal Service employees and Federal employees on the one hand, and private sector employees on the other, will remain whether or not the Postal Service is viewed as being like a private corporation, and whether or not the rights of Postal employees are otherwise viewed as being similar to the rights of private as opposed to public sector employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.409" offset="8467696">And there's no answer to this, we think, to suggest as petitioner does, that Congress' inclusion of the sue and be sued clause in the Postal Charter can somehow change that and signal a Congressional intention that Postal employees should be treated identically to private sector workers under Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.132" offset="8582531">Well, I think that the Court had two things in mind, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.599" offset="8596428">First, it clearly had in mind the long line of cases cited by the petitioner in which a cause of action is brought pursuant to a sue and be sued clause in a setting in which the relationship between the agency being sued, and the person bringing the suit is the same as one in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.343" offset="8663406">That was the case, for example, in the Franchise Tax Board case where the Postal Service's relationship to the Franchise Tax Board was the same as that of any other employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.277" offset="8695171">I think the best example of what the Court had in mind is the illustration provided in Footnote 5, a case called Standard Oil Company v. United States, in which the Federal government had essentially gone into the insurance business, into the rural risk insurance business in competition with private insurers using contracts identical to those used by private insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.674" offset="8780748">And the Court said in that case, the relationship between an insured party and the Government was identical to the relationship between an insured party and a private insurer, and therefore the terms of the lawsuit should be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.356" offset="8843442">Now, that is clearly not true in the case of a Title VII suit which as been brought against the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.542" offset="8864235">It must be brought pursuant to the Federal sector provisions of Title VII, which differ in a variety of significant ways from the private sector provisions of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.351" offset="8895373">Federal employees, including Postal workers, for example, must use the administrative mechanism set out in the Federal sector provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.709" offset="8924839">Federal employees including Postal workers, unlike private sector workers, must use Title VII exclusively as their remedy for employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.970" offset="8953887">Those differences will remain however the nature of the Postal Service is characterized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.108" offset="8974472">And as I suggested, the existence of the sue and be sued clause can't change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.419" offset="8991713">It can't magically move the Postal Service from one provision of Title VII, the Federal sector provision, to another provision, the private sector provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.822" offset="9025254">That means that Postal employees must bring their employment discrimination claims pursuant to the Federal sector provision, using Federal sector administrative remedies against the Federal defendant like other Federal employees, but unlike workers in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.207" offset="9082828">They must use Title VII exclusively as their remedy for employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.799" offset="9101218">Now, we think the clearest indication of how Congress wanted to treat Postal employees under Title VII is how it actually did treat them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.108" offset="9130475">It treated them identically to all other Federal workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.794" offset="9141238">Those Federal workers cannot get interest under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.965" offset="9157851">Now, by giving petitioner the special benefit of interest, it will introduce an incoherence into the statutory scheme which is now nicely symmetrical dividing private sector and Federal sector workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.304" offset="9207275">It would also give employees in the Postal Service a special benefit and distinction which is not awarded to any other Federal sector employee, any other employee of the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.861" offset="9257430">Now, the Court of Appeals properly declined to give this special and unique benefit to Postal Service employees, and we think that this Court should affirm that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2390.415" offset="9687719">Mr. Rothfeld suggests that this Court must make a decision between the two waivers, the waiver in the Postal Service Charter, or Title VII, which one applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.285" offset="9747174">I don't agree that the two are mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.549" offset="9764206">I think that the Court can take into consideration and give effect to each waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.890" offset="9785626">The waiver that occurs in the Postal Reorganization Act is a waiver of the status of the agency as the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.058" offset="9818227">The waiver that occurs in Title VII concerns a substantive right to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.962" offset="9841842">Both can be taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.851" offset="9857411">Title VII doesn't tell us anything, however, regarding interplay of these two waivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.724" offset="9884891">Congress has expressed interplay in the Federal Tort Claims Act, but has not done so in Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.346" offset="9915403">So then we are left to infer a wavy line as to what the Postal Service is immune to and what it isn't by Mr. Rothfeld's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.496" offset="9960020">Under the longstanding liberal construction rule, no inferences to that broad waiver of the Postal Reorganization Act should be lightly drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.618" offset="10000457">And it's clearly a rule that's very functional for the courts in the sense that if you assume that Congress is experienced in legislating against this liberal construction rule, they you really don't have to draw wavy lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.659" offset="10060643">Maybe they're liable for punitive damages, maybe they're liable for costs, for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.704" offset="10080810">That's up to Congress to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.814" offset="10089274">Congress knows how to do it, it's done it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.953" offset="10097842">It's expressed it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.890" offset="10105574">And Congress understands that a sue and be sued clause can be a separate source of authority for proceeding even as to certain damages, elements of damages which interest theoretically is an element of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.728" offset="10164924">So the Government's position is based upon a mere inference, not upon any express statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.756" offset="10197003">And the fact that interest is not articulated in Title VII isn't particularly instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.347" offset="10219363">It doesn't mean that Congress did not want sue and be sued employees to get interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.485" offset="10243918">It's a function of the fact that interest has historically been viewed as an element of damages separate and apart from the substantive claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.155" offset="10278609">So a as a natural incident of Title VII suits, interest should be recoverable against the Postal Service because it occupies the status of a private commercial enterprise for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.960" offset="10337855">I don't think that the Court needs to make a broad decision that would affect over 124 sue and be sued agencies because of the unique character of the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.956" offset="10381845">It's clearly one of those agencies the Court had in mind in footnote 5 of the Shaw opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.829" offset="10405355">Congress when it created it, removed the cloak of sovereign immunity and launched it into the world of private commercial enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.622" offset="10440464">There are a lot of sue and be sued agencies.</text>
