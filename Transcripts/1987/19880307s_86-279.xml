            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="8.535" offset="34064">Well, this case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.389" offset="73456">The Securities and Exchange Commissionâ€™s Rule 10b-5 prohibits in connection with the purchase or sale of any security, the making of any untrue statement of a material fact or the omission of the material fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.078" offset="140225">In 1978, Basic Incorporated and another firm agreed to merge, and during the two years immediately preceding the merger, there were various meetings and conversations between the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.116" offset="204382">And during that same time, however, Basic made three public statements denying that merger or merger negotiations were underway or that in knew of any corporate developments that would account for heavy trading activity in its stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.304" offset="277211">The respondents are former Basic shareholders who sold their stock between the first public denial and the suspension of trading in Basic's stock just prior to the merger announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.748" offset="330919">And they filed suite against Basic and some of its directors alleging that the statements had been false or misleading in violation of Section 10 of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and of the Rule 10b-5 and that they had been injured by selling their shares at prices artificially depressed by those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.232" offset="432901">The District Court certified the plaintiff's class but granted summary judgment for the defendants on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.961" offset="459755">The Court of Appeals affirmed the class certification but reversed the summary judgment and it rejected specifically the District Court's view of the preliminary merger discussions were immaterial as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.777" offset="519105">But we vacate that judgment and remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.069" offset="536242">We hold that the standard set forth in a case recently here called TSC Industries whereby an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that its disclosure would have been considered significant by a reasonable investor is to be expressly adopted for the 10-b and Rule 10-b(5) contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.786" offset="643135">We reject the so-called agreement-in-principle test under which preliminary disclosure does not become material until the would-be merger partners have reached an agreement as to price and structure of the transition.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.969" offset="707814">Materiality in the merger context depends on the probability that the transaction will be consummated and its significance to the issue of the securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.700" offset="758700">Materiality therefore depends on the facts and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis. The courts below properly applied the presumption of reliance and that presumption is also supported by common sense and probability in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.518" offset="825992">An investor who trades stock at the price set by an impersonal market does so on the reliance on the integrity of that price.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.532" offset="870087">And because most publicly available information is reflected in market price, an investor's reliance on any public material representations may be presumed for purposes of a Rule 10-b(5) action.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.241" offset="928914">But that presumption of reliance, however, may be rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.947" offset="947722">Justices Brennan and Marshall and Stevens joined the opinion in full and create a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.814" offset="983249">Justices White and O'Connor joined parts one, two and three thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.337" offset="1005296">Justice White joined by Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part and taking no part in the consideration or decision of the case or the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Kennedy.</text>
