            <text syncTime="12.042" offset="48065">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.367" offset="73456">The question to be decided is whether a federal court has authority to review a decision of the General Counsel in National Labor Relations Board dismissing an unfair labor practice complaint pursuant to an informal settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.076" offset="132284">We hold that such a dismissal is not subject to judicial review on either the amended National Labor Relations Act or the Administrative Procedure Act because the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain the action under either Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.422" offset="205636">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit concluding that it had jurisdiction and amend with instructions to dismiss the cause for the want of subject-matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.468" offset="261851">Justice Scalia joins the Court opinion and has also filed a concurring opinion in which he was joined by the Chief Justice and Justices White and O'Connor.</text>
