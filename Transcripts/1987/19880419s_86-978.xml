            <text syncTime="8.521" offset="114979">Under the Federal Statute authorizing aid to families with dependent children the receipt by a family of a large lump sum a non recurring payment, such a settlement of a personal injury case or something like that, will have an adverse effect on the family's eligibility for future payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.248" offset="197839">In this case the respondents received such a payment and they used it to pay outstanding bills before they reported the receipt to the case worker or in charge of their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.637" offset="259384">Then they learned for the first time that their eligibility for future benefits had been adversely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.694" offset="291671">They participated in a Federal action seeking a restoration of those benefits on the ground that the failure to tell them through an adequate notice of the consequences of receipt of such payment violated a regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services requiring the recipients and applicants for sucg benefits be given adequate information about conditions of eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.818" offset="396161">The District Court and the Court of Appeals held that there was a violation of the regulation and granted respondents relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.970" offset="420716">We have reviewed the case and the majority determined that regulation was not violated and therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.881" offset="460422">Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion which dissents in part from our conclusion and she has joined by Justice Brennan and partially by Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.577" offset="507129">Justice Kennedy has not taken any part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
