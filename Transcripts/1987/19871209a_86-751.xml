            <text syncTime="59.367" offset="371600">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Eighth Circuit, which denied Arkansas Best Corporation an ordinary loss treatment on the sale of National Bank of Commerce stock it had purchased after 1972, stock that, as the Tax Court expressly found, Arkansas Best purchased solely for business purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.481" offset="488106">The decision of the Eighth Circuit is in direct conflict with a number of other decisions of the Circuit Court, Court of Claims, Tax Court, and, indeed, is inconsistent with past decisions of this Court as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.767" offset="573265">The Eighth Circuit's Opinion challenges the fundamental premise of what is known in the tax world as the Corn Products Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.123" offset="630630">That is, that it is the purpose for which an asset is purchased, and not the nature of the asset, that determines whether it is a capital asset or a non-capital asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.850" offset="701579">In doing so, it presents a rather fundamental question of the entire application of the tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.468" offset="756018">The question of whether taxpayers can rely on the words of this Court, the rulings of the Internal Revenue Service, the words of the Congressional committees interpreting what the state of present law is, and numerous other courts which also have interpreted the language of this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Vester T. Hughes, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="256.036" offset="1158303">The Corn Products decision actually was a development in a much older line of thinking on the nature of a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.669" offset="1244821">You go back to the 1932 and the Opinion of Justice Stone, in Burnet v. Harmel, and there was interpretation of the 1921 Act, as modified in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.975" offset="1322039">The 1921 Act, Congress decided that sales of what had been denominated as capital assets would be treated differently than the sales of other assets, and in defining what a capital asset was, assets acquired and held by the taxpayer for profit and investment, were to be treated as capital assets, for profit and investment, and taxed at preferential rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.101" offset="1462578">In 1924, that language was modified so that it would become clear at that point that a taxpayer's personal assets could have the same treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.312" offset="1535407">But business assets continued to be treated as in the 1921 Act, and, indeed, in Burnet v. Harmel, the Supreme Court said that there had been no material change when the 1924 Act modified the 1921 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.099" offset="1622552">Consistent with this purpose, in 1936 then, the Treasury, in GMC 17322, determined that hedging transactions really were, in essence, insurance, and that they would be treated, when they were entered into for protecting a taxpayer's manufacturing process, they would be treated as ordinary assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.598" offset="1784511">That ruling was very clear to announce that hedging transactions of a speculator would be treated as a capital asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.656" offset="1832785">Therefore, you have the situation that the same transaction, precisely the same transaction, had either capital or ordinary treatment, depending on the motive, depending on the motive of the person engaging in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.287" offset="1935290">This was consistent with what the Supreme Court had decided in Burnet v. Harmel, and of course was the prelude to the Court's decision in Corn Products.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.092" offset="1998506">In the Opinion authored by Justice Clarke, the question was whether Corn Products Corporation, which used corn products in various manufacturing operations, would, by reason of hedging transactions, realize a capital or an ordinary gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.315" offset="2115430">In that case, as the Court will recall, the taxpayer had entered into the hedging transactions in order to protect itself from price increases in corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.745" offset="2185125">If the price of corn escalated, there was protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.571" offset="2212397">That was not a true hedge.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.071" offset="2218457">And so, technically, it was not under the 1935 GCM.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.256" offset="2243221">But the Court said that didn't matter, that the transaction was one of a prudent manufacturer, not one of an investor, not a transaction entered into with an investment or profit motive, if you will, but one directly related to the taxpayer's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.057" offset="2346352">In 1958, then, the Internal Revenue Service issued another ruling, the three examples, Revenue Ruling 58-40, where it rules that stocks, bonds, or other securities that were purchased solely for the purpose of obtaining inventory, or for other business purposes... for example, the Government securities that were purchased in order for a bonding requirement to be met... would give rise to ordinary treatment, not to capital treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.415" offset="2507789">And at this point it is clear that Revenue Ruling 58-40 is in direct conflict with what the Service, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is urging on this Court today, and is in direct conflict with what the Eighth Circuit determined in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.984" offset="2606114">Since the decision in Corn Products, a quick noting of the CCH Citator indicates that it has been cited more than 260 times.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.750" offset="3385190">I don't believe so, Your Honor, for two or three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.047" offset="3398356">You will notice that, both in the Petition for Certiorari and in the Brief, of both parties, the importance, the continuing importance was indicated to this Court, indeed, that being, for asking, for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.085" offset="3466483">When the capital gains system was set up, it was not solely a benefit to taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.787" offset="3489262">Capital losses are offset only against capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.863" offset="3513608">And indeed, if the capital loss can be taken only against a capital gain, there is no help.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.469" offset="3544015">That system is left in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.781" offset="3553314">That will be in place next year when we have a 28 percent tax rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.638" offset="3572749">And so taxpayers will have the detriment of the capital loss situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.495" offset="3596155">My understanding is that this was considered in the 1930s, in the early 1930s, when there was some thought of elimination of capital gains, and it was thought that the revenue, because of the stock market crash, the Federal revenues could not stand the loss of revenue which would be incident to allowing capital losses against... what had been capital losses... against ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.013" offset="3714228">And of course, at any time of a stock market decline, that would be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.902" offset="3741709">The second reason I would say so, the Committee Reports relating to the 1986 Act specifically left the capital gains system in place, because Congress was not clear whether it could maintain the 28 percent rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.926" offset="3805866">And if the 28 percent rate changed, then indeed there should be some kind of modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.845" offset="3837526">The situation is not just that the Courts have followed Corn Products and have developed the reasoning of the profit motive, the importance of the profit motive, a dominant business motive, as contrasted with a profit motive being the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.349" offset="3955495">The Congress has followed that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.706" offset="3977020">In 1975, Treasury suggested to Congress that all capital stock be treated as capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.906" offset="4017771">And had that been enacted, of course, this taxpayer would not have had a basis for bringing this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.120" offset="4058627">Both Houses of Congress considered Treasury's proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.571" offset="4076390">Both Houses of Congress rejected the Treasury proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.380" offset="4103662">They enacted, each House enacted instead a provision that said that 30 days after the purchase of stock, that a taxpayer would have to market as either a business asset or as a capital asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.356" offset="4195613">However, it was in the last days of the session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.792" offset="4221317">And so, at that time, they never had a Conference Committee on it and Congress never went back to a decision as to whether or not there should be legislation, or never made a decision saying that all stock would be capital assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.421" offset="4335838">A type of 30-day proposal passed each House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.498" offset="4356109">But there was never a Conference of the Senate and the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.308" offset="4375335">And so it never became law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.152" offset="4382754">The Treasury proposal is essentially what the Eighth Circuit said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.038" offset="4410339">The Eighth Circuit, in essence, said capital stock is always a capital asset unless of course it is held by a trader.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.583" offset="4440432">You can have a trader who has stock as inventory, and that is clear from the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.282" offset="4471257">But it is also clear from the law that Congress, in the Committee Reports, talked about what the present state of the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.170" offset="4506783">As is always true in Congressional hearings, there will be a Committee Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.759" offset="4549206">There was a House Report, and there was a Senate Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.399" offset="4563730">And it said, under present law, the treatment of gain or loss on sale or exchange of stock or other security depends on whether the security is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.972" offset="4622036">It seems absolutely clear that Congress understood the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.999" offset="4642098">Then it says, if stock or security is held for business purposes, generally it would not be treated as a capital asset, and therefore, any gain would be treated as ordinary income and any losses would be treated as ordinary losses, which could be deducted in full in the current year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.383" offset="4715659">That is our fact situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.117" offset="4726630">This taxpayer had a bear by the tail, in a manner of speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.349" offset="4751499">It had to divest itself of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.612" offset="4768635">Congress passed the One Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.377" offset="4779606">And either the taxpayer, which owned a trucking company, a furniture manufacturer, a tire sales company, a retreading company, a computer company, and then it had the interest in the bank, which it had acquired in 1968, it could expand no further in its other businesses unless it divested itself of the stock, because of the Bank Holding Company, which became effective December 31, 1971, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.284" offset="4935296">And then in 1971, in August, this taxpayer filed with the Federal Reserve a statement that it would divest of its stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.904" offset="4985765">So it is clear that the taxpayer had no interest in acquiring more stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.949" offset="5009902">Indeed, it was trying to get rid of the stock it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.885" offset="5021709">As the Tax Court found, the stock that it bought, after 1972, was solely... and I reiterate the word "solely"... for the protection of its reputation, for its business purposes, because by that time, it was clear that the bank was in financial trouble, and that the taxpayer was going to have trouble selling the stock it already had, much less any other stock that it purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.496" offset="5152112">The fact that the taxpayer sold the stock solely for business purposes then accords with what had been the traditional rules as set forth in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.613" offset="5236645">First, you take a look at the Burnet v. Harmel, then Corn Products, then P.G. Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.891" offset="5273739">The Eighth Circuit was very concerned about where in the statute you found the definition of a capital asset and an exclusion that would fit this particular situation, or fit any capital stock situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.290" offset="5499332">But that is not within the traditional meaning of</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.646" offset="5520752">because we were going to sell the stock to whoever we could sell it to, because we had to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.908" offset="5553771">So we had no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.532" offset="5564325">However, we had the situation where if we didn't pour more money into the bank, the regulators were threatening to close it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.793" offset="5613330">It was at the time of the real estate depression in Dallas... I should say the first real estate depression, because we are in another one right now... but the first big real estate depression that followed the tightening of money in the early days of President Nixon's Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.113" offset="5682607">So every indication was that things were getting worse and worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.814" offset="5713432">Texas Commerce Bank had agreed to buy, or at least we thought they had agreed to buy the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.374" offset="5739659">In 1971 they started doing their due diligence and they found a lot of bad loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.449" offset="5759930">As we moved on, we found a lot more bad loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.198" offset="5774976">And so the regulators came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.823" offset="5785425">The Texas Commerce Bank pulled out the bank examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.149" offset="5798695">We were put on the problem bank list, and they said you had to raise more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.928" offset="5825863">Of course, we didn't have to buy the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.005" offset="5838192">We could have walked away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.659" offset="5844775">But a holding company that had just gone on the New York Stock Exchange, that planned to be raising money through stock sales, that planned to be borrowing money in its various operations, would have been... well, it would have been very courageous, if not foolhardy, had it backed off at that point and not bought stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.727" offset="5953027">And of course, that is what the Tax Court found, that at that point it bought the stock, but it didn't buy the stock as an investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.364" offset="5995554">It bought stock as required by the regulators, solely, solely for its business purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.049" offset="6490313">The Internal Revenue Code sets forth limitations on the deductibility of what are called capital losses... that is, losses suffered on the sale or exchange of a capital asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.106" offset="6530542">And the question here is whether the losses suffered by Petitioner on the sale of all of its shares of bank stock in 1975 are subject to those limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.447" offset="6571920">In other words, the question boils down to whether those shares were capital assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.889" offset="6677663">Mr. Horowitz, it seems to me that until the 1986 changes to the Revenue Code, that it was often to the advantage of the IRS to adopt the very view that Petitioner does here, that we ought to preserve the Corn Products Doctrine and prevent things from being treated as capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.036" offset="6766271">And is the Government changing its position simply because the tax law changed in 1986 and now it cannot work to the IRS's advantage any longer to maintain the Corn Products rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.778" offset="6837219">Let me give a couple of responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.012" offset="6846206">First, this is not a case where the Government has changed its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.620" offset="6860625">There are Revenue Rulings out there, and after the Court denied certiorari in 1971 when we sought to have the so-called Corn Products Doctrine reviewed, where the IRS was forced to give some guidance in light of the lower court decisions that have developed, but the IRS has never embraced and has always continued to challenge what is called the Corn Products Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.956" offset="6937948">So I don't think we are changing our position at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.821" offset="7037422">The Corn Products Decision did not create this kind of amorphous judicial exception which throws the terms of Section 1221 out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.506" offset="7068142">It was a finding that so-called hedging transactions which had always been recognized administratively as inventory transactions, not as speculative capital transactions, fell within the inventory exception to Section 1221.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan A Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="1753.122" offset="7146614">The Court said it wasn't true hedging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.449" offset="7155913">That was the issue that came before it, whether what was called true hedging in the IRS' interpretation was the only thing that could follow from the inventory exception or whether the sort of hedging that was involved in Corn Products could also fall within the inventory exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.772" offset="7209203">That is what the Court held, and the Second Circuit held there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.037" offset="7222264">The only difference between the so-called true hedging and what actually happened in Corn Products was that the... well, maybe I should back up and talk about the facts of Corn Products a little.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.640" offset="7268658">There, the Corn Products Company was engaged in, made a lot of contracts for selling its corn products at fixed prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.309" offset="7307423">It did not have a lot of storage capacity for raw corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.574" offset="7320485">So what had happened to it a couple times in the late 1930s was that it had gotten squeezed by rapid rises in the price of corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.539" offset="7348279">It was already committed to sell its corn oil at a given price and it had to buy corn at a much higher price than it had anticipated, which led to losses on the sale of its product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.660" offset="7388821">So to protect itself against those sort of price rises, what it did was, it bought corn futures, so that it was assured a supply of corn at a price that it could depend on later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.781" offset="7429259">Now, the only difference from the true hedge is that it did not protect itself against a decline in the price of corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.512" offset="7460188">That is not what it was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.355" offset="7467606">It was worried about the losses that it would suffer on the sales of its product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.103" offset="7490594">If the price of corn had declined, then, it would have suffered some losses on the futures, because the value of its futures would have declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.194" offset="7526957">So there was an element of possibility of loss there on the value of its futures, but that wasn't what it was worried about, and it didn't really affect the fact that the corn futures were really part of their inventory control system, and essentially were a substitute for stored corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.624" offset="7584635">And that is what the Court held in Corn Products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.295" offset="7595293">It didn't hold anything more, and I think as we through in great detail in our Brief, the Opinion, while it is not, certainly, the clearest opinion that was ever written, certainly cannot be said to he rejected the idea that this is an interpretation of the statute, and not the creation of a new exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.545" offset="8072289">I don't think it has really been a</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.545" offset="8380325">"heads I win, tails you lose. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.105" offset="8086604">proposition for the Government, because it is effectively impossible, practically impossible, and I am not aware of any case where the Government can successfully challenge a taxpayer's assertion that he bought a stock as an investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.146" offset="8138744">The taxpayer, it is not even going to be discovered in audit if the taxpayer has a gain on the sale of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.784" offset="8165285">He is going to report it as investment capital gain and there isn't going to be anything the Government can do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.235" offset="8183048">So it might be that the Government would like to be arguing in these gain cases, to be invoking the Corn Products Doctrine in its favor, but the fact is that it is just practically impossible for it to do it, and I don't know that it has ever successfully done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.605" offset="8240517">The Petitioner in his Reply Brief points out that sometimes the Government wins these cases when there are disputes about whether it is a capital loss or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.834" offset="8277507">But I don't know about capital gain cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.538" offset="8284299">So I don't think it has ever been a</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.724" offset="8297046">process, and I don't think the 1986 Act changed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.613" offset="8312615">It has nothing to do with the Government's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.363" offset="8323587">And I should also add that the fact that the capital gain, the difference in rates on capital gains still does not completely remove the incentive or the opportunity for the taxpayers to play a</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.527" offset="8384295">game, because it is still in the taxpayer's interest in many cases to have an investment gain or to have a gain on sale of stock treated as a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.164" offset="8418777">To give you an example, suppose a company had a $100,000 in regular income from its manufacturing operations and it also had a $100,000 capital loss on the sale of investment stock, that was clearly an investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.126" offset="8494637">And suppose there is a third category of money out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.358" offset="8515535">They have some what we might call Corn Products stock, stock that they would be able to gin up a kind of argument that there was a business purpose for getting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.183" offset="8554927">Well, if they sell that stock at a gain, let's say also a $100,000 gain there, it is in their interest to have that $100,000 be denoted capital gain, because it will then give them an opportunity to offset their $100,000 capital loss that they have on the sale of investment stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.018" offset="8638206">So the upshot would be that they only have $100,000 in total income whereas if that so-called Corn Products stock is treated as ordinary gain, then a capital loss will not be available to them and they'll have to report $200,000 in income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.590" offset="8692540">So the problem that we identify in our brief of where the taxpayers can kind of wait and see whether they have a gain or loss and then decide how to treat it still remains, although to something of a lesser extent, under the 1986 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.678" offset="13456857">The Court said they were something that helped the taxpayer maintain an inventory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.205" offset="13507012">I guess there you are just talking about sort of a narrow versus a broad interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.092" offset="13534493">I think the Court found that the purposes of the inventory exception were served by having these futures in, and they pointed out the problems there would be if they were not treated as inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.509" offset="13580155">For example, at the end of the Opinion, the Court noted that the taxpayers could decide for themselves whether to make them ordinary or capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.725" offset="13613069">One other point I would like to make before my red light goes on is that the policy, the Congressional intent that Petitioners rely on is not supported by the slightest bit of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.487" offset="13652044">There is nothing in the reports, nothing in any other inquiry into Congressional intent that suggests that there was ever a general business versus investment dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.653" offset="13696766">The categories of assets that Congress decided should be separated between capital and ordinary were set forth in Section 1221.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.557" offset="13732397">Congress has added to those periodically and there is no other real policy to be relied upon here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.035" offset="13790284">To Corn Products itself, Justice Clarke's language was:</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.157" offset="13814735">"Admittedly, Petitioner's corn futures do not come within the literal language of the exclusions set out in that section. "</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="3440.993" offset="13898117">Mr. Hughes, do you think your taxpayer fits within the language of the statute somehow?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="vester_t_hughes_jr" startTime="3448.192" stopTime="3648.534">
            <label>Mr. Vester T. Hughes, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3448.192" offset="13926957">Justice O'Connor, there are two ways that this could be approached, and I think that either way gets us to the correct answer for the purpose of tax administration, as it should be interpreted and applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.152" offset="14010757">The first of these is that you don't get to 1221 if there are certain factors present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.837" offset="14045448">A good argument can be made that that is what Burnet v. Harmel was all about, because there is no doubt about it that Mr. Harmel sold property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.130" offset="14086617">He sold oil and gas leases, he sold seven-eighths interest, of 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.455" offset="14112008">There is no doubt that in 1955, in the Corn Futures case, that futures fitted within what then was the 58-40 ruling, that if you were a speculator, that that was a capital asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.323" offset="14179404">You have to look at the motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.447" offset="14187972">There is no doubt that in P.G. Lake, when Mr. Lake and the O'Connor estate sold oil payments, they sold property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.881" offset="14225693">But what the Court said was that you didn't get there, that it wasn't 1221 and the language that you would have to go back to is the 1921 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.126" offset="14266653">Now, you could go a different direction to divine the purpose of Congress, and that may be a more palatable way, because this Court has done that, if you will recall, and the reason I went back to 1932, the other way is that you look to see what Congress was trying to tax in one manner and what it was trying to tax in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.772" offset="14385249">Justice White, as for example, Justice Sutherland's Opinion in Gregory, where there is nothing in the statute, there is nothing in the reorganization sections about a business purpose for reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.018" offset="14438225">And yet that has been a requirement since Ms. Gregory's case in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.094" offset="14458496">There is nothing in the statute about continuity of interest required for a reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.887" offset="14489739">That was reaffirmed recently by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.104" offset="14498516">It started out in Letulle v. Scofield and in Pinellas Ice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.946" offset="14517951">But it was reaffirmed within the last four years by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.367" offset="14535610">There was nothing in the statute about Justice O'Connor's Opinion in Hillsboro, there was nothing about there being a tax benefit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.893" offset="14577719">But it was a way to implement how Congress intended a tax be generated on income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.999" offset="14614186">And the same thing is true also within the last four years in this Court's opinion in Bob Jones University.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.575" offset="14644488">There is no requirement of a common law of charity in the statute, in 170, it's not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.915" offset="14669775">But it is a reasonable approach to what the people over on the other side of this Hill meant as to what the purpose of the statute was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.240" offset="14711152">And the same thing is true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.395" offset="14719721">And that's what you came up with in Corn Products.</text>
