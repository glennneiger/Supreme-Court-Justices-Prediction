            <text syncTime="12.357" offset="130369">In 1980, Congress amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to provide trustees of multiemployer benefit plans with an effective federal remedy to collect the delinquent employer contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.637" offset="199436">The special remedy provides that they not only can recover the amount of the delinquency but also prejudgment interest plus liquidated damages and an amount at least equal to that interest and attorney's fees and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.142" offset="265474">There is no question but the remedy is available when an employer is delinquent in meeting his contractual obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.524" offset="290969">The question in this case is whether the remedy also applies during the period after the expiration of a contract when the employer maybe under duty under the National Labor Relations Act to continue making payments as part of his duty to bargain in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.863" offset="360351">The Ninth Circuit, in agreement with other Circuits in the country, held that the statute did not apply in that situation, and we affirm that decision for reasons stated in an opinion filed with the Clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.285" offset="409983">Our opinion is unanimous and Justice Kennedy did not participate.</text>
