            <text syncTime="570.863" offset="2418744">Peyote is a Schedule 1 drug in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.916" offset="2434939">It is... that means that it has determined that there is no safe use for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.731" offset="2458241">It cannot be used safely even under the care of a physician and that there is a great susceptibility to drug abuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.286" offset="2552386">In order to accommodate the religious practice would undermine the state's compelling interest in at least four different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.201" offset="2584046">First, peyote is dangerous to the user and to those who come in contact with the user.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.805" offset="2610482">That's the very reason why the state has criminalized it in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.889" offset="2626783">It is also dangerous to the community which must xx its presence within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.362" offset="2648726">Peyote produces an hallucinogenic state similar to that produced by LSD.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.325" offset="2668579">All fifty states and the Federal Government categorize peyote has dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.049" offset="2687491">The dangers posed by peyote are indifferent to the motivations of the user, and the state is and should be no less concerned about the dangers posed to a religious user than to the dangers posed by the drug... by one who uses it for xx purposes or for personal enlightenment.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.861" offset="2758753">Once peyote is made lawful for some purposes, as these claimants contend they have a right to require the state to do, then the problem of controlling drug trafficking is significantly compounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.118" offset="2811730">Peyote only grows in the Southwestern United States, primarily Texas and in parts of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.164" offset="2839942">It would be difficult to distinguish meaningfully between traffic for lawful purposes and traffic for unlawful purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.287" offset="2868468">The simple fact is that once some people have a right to possess peyote, there is an increased risk the drug will fall into the hands of those who do not have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.213" offset="2904099">There is a risk that others will commit crimes against persons who posses peyote lawfully in order to obtain it from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.519" offset="2933356">These claimants, like eighty-nine percent of the Native American population in Oregon, reside in urban areas, and that merely compounds the risk that the presence of the drug in the community will mean that it will fall into the hands of persons who cannot possess it--</text>
            <text syncTime="713.447" offset="2989049">The record in this case includes an affidavit from Stanley Smart, who is a road chief, who conducts the peyote ceremony.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.473" offset="3025202">He indicates that it is not uncommon for him to conduct as many as four peyote ceremonies a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.879" offset="3054773">That means that at any given time, Mr. Smart is in the possession of a large amount of peyote, and he makes himself thereby a target for those who would mean to obtain the drug from him for unlawful uses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.008" offset="5887282">In Oregon, one is disqualified only for job-related drug use and there's a very good reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.450" offset="5913091">The Federal Unemployment Tax Act requires that in order for states to have qualified programs, they can only disqualify persons for job-related misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.450" offset="5965127">Therefore, it is completely irrelevant under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and in order for Oregon to have a qualified program, we cannot disqualify persons for off-the-job drug use.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.182" offset="6103994">The criminal prohibition is just one important application of the State of Oregon's public policy to curb drug abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.588" offset="6141610">As I said earlier, the same policy is furthered and reflected in other programs and is reflected in the unemployment compensation scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.222" offset="6172121">For example, a policy memorandum dealing with employer drug testing that is attached to the Respondent's xx states,</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.597" offset="6205663">"If an employee is discharged for failing a drug test and it is demonstrated that the employee's job performance xx impaired by drugs, it is a discharge for misconduct. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.335" offset="6244637">The Federal Unemployment Tax Act limits our disqualification only to job-related misconduct, but under Oregon law, all job-related drug use is disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.261" offset="6288314">All of the health and safety concerns that drive our criminal prohibition are further served by a disqualification for misconduct connected with the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.317" offset="6324572">Job-related... and, really, the Respondents in this case can't contest that because the very heart of their claim is that the disqualification, burdens, their practice of drug case and since our purpose is to burden their practice of drug use, demonstrates that the unemployment compensation scheme serves that purpose, and the same reasons that we cannot give an exemption to their use from the criminal law would apply in analyzing whether they should be exempted from the disqualification from the unemployment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.722" offset="6462185">In fact, when drug use spills into the work place, the hazards of that use are even greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.675" offset="6489979">In this case, we were talking about drug counselors who, to serve the interests of their clients by acting as role models, that suggested that perhaps if you use drugs responsibly, you could continue to use drugs, but it might just as well have been someone manufacturing automobiles or flying airplanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.578" offset="6569601">Drug use in the work place is a very serious concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.180" offset="6579945">It's real, immediate and compelling, and the same reasons that we can't grant the exemption would apply in the context of the unemployment scheme itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.405" offset="12244859">It's not... it's sort of a false issue, you know, I agree, but in terms of whether the church practice itself is exempted, the Federal Government and every state that has considered this particular issue has found this to be a safe practice.</text>

            <label>Ms. Suanne Lovendahl</label>
            <text syncTime="3230.738" offset="13058208">Yeah, and there was a strongly worded dissent in that case, essentially to the effect that the Court was abdicating its responsibility as final arbiter of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.803" offset="13098437">In any event, in terms of the constitutionality of the practice, the state has a history of lack of enforcement, So, it doesn't appear that they have an overwhelming interest in over-riding or disposing of this particular church practice, and the only concern that they have is that flood gates will essentially be opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.516" offset="13233333">This isn't a situation, though, where many other churches meet the test of safety that the history of the Native American Church has demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.294" offset="13280458">This is an ancient religion that's been going on before the practice was made criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.508" offset="13305326">The classic kind of situation that was presented in Wisconsin v. Yoder, with the Amish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.003" offset="13331240">Their practices were not illegal before enactment of the state criminal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.375" offset="13348794">In fact, this church practice serves the purpose that the criminal law statutes were intended to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.371" offset="13384739">It's actually a treatment program for individuals who have had difficulty with problems of alcoholism and a number of alcohol rehabilitation treatment centers use peyote in Native American Church ceremonies as a way of helping Native Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.583" offset="13449627">It's an extremely important cultural-specific treatment plan that would actually compromise the interest of the state in helping people overcome, particularly Native Americans to overcome, the problems of drug addiction and substance abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.723" offset="13510126">The reasons that the state has given are purely speculative and, in essence, they have admitted that they do not have a strong interest in terminating this particular religious practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.702" offset="13562058">There have been a number of state court xx that have had the benefit of the full evidentiary record on this particular issue, and they have made it clear that this is something that should be constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.211" offset="13616079">The effect of a decision finding the criminality of these individuals' conduct to distinguish this case from Sherbert, Thomas and Hobbie by implication suggests that there is no constitutional protection here, and I submit that that would indicate a discrimination against this religious practice that would effectively cast a shadow over this entire church.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.740" offset="13734257">I don't see any reason why these people, this situation presented here is different from a situation in Sherbert, Thomas and Hobbie, and I feel that the same results should obtain.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.321" offset="13812520">Quickly to answer your question, Justice Stevens, the Oregon Supreme Court held in this case that a denial of benefits did not violate the Oregon Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.826" offset="13846584">They have not specifically addressed the question that you asked under the Oregon Constitution, but in Oregon, it is very clear under their other decisions that that would violate what is our equivalent of the establishment clause because, to borrow a phrase from Justice Scalia, in Oregon, a pinkie on the scale is as bad as a thumb and that would favor the religious practice, unless it is required by the free exercise clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.393" offset="13936863">Claimants do not get unemployment benefits under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.476" offset="13949192">That's settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.744" offset="13954208">These claimants cannot prevail unless you conclude that they had a right to engage in the conduct that they engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.088" offset="13979599">If the conduct is criminal, they had no right to engage in the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.413" offset="13996944">This Court has never held that a state must accommodate prohibited conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.575" offset="14017529">Therefore, the criminal law issue must be addressed as a matter of federal law in order for the claimants to prevail, and at a minimum, this case must be sent back to the Oregon Supreme Court with instructions to do so.</text>
