            <text syncTime="13.122" offset="186897">Over the years, private claims for damages under Section 10b have proliferated.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.543" offset="208526">At one time or another, countless publicly held companies have been charged with wrong doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.597" offset="228797">When investors find the market moving against their positions, they often wonder whether the price they paid was higher than it should have been, or the price that they received was lower than it should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.952" offset="270175">Some, such as respondents in this case, elect to sue to see whether any corporate wrong doing contributed to their financial misfortune.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.074" offset="306642">This case began in June, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.962" offset="326286">Essentially, respondents contend that three statements issued by Basic were materially false and misleading insofar as they claimed to have denied the existence of merger negotiations when in fact merger negotiations were on going.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.572" offset="380725">The fact is that the statements at issue which are the key to this case, as are the contacts between Basic and C.E. but the statements did not themselves deny merger negotiations in the sense that respondents claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.731" offset="441330">The three statements, the first one issued in October, 1977, was issued by the company because a rumor had been present in the marketplace that Basic was having discussions with a company called FlintKote.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.539" offset="492530">Basic determined that that rumor had no foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.241" offset="507367">Whatever discussions it had were not leading to a merger with FlintKote, and as a result, it properly issued a prompt statement to deny that it was having any discussions with FlintKote.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.049" offset="550626">That statement says, the rumors as to FlintKote are inaccurate and we're having no merger negotiations with anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.869" offset="577898">The second and the third statements don't even refer to merger negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.372" offset="595870">They're issued in September, 1978, and in November, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.343" offset="615723">The earlier statement is to the effect that the company is unaware of any reasons for unusual trading activity in its stock, and there are no corporate developments that would account for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.818" offset="661699">The November statement is essentially an echo of the September statement and was issued by the company in an effort to insure that its shareholders who might not have seen the September statement which was part of a press release would become aware of the substance of the November statement which was included in a report to shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.030" offset="738499">No, during this period, beginning even prior to the first statement, Basic had been approached by an executive from Combustion Engineering who had made very clear to Basic that he had an interest in seeing whether a possible acquisition of Basic could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.741" offset="813313">Combustion had a line of business that was very similar to the business that Basic was engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.930" offset="842152">That was the refractories business.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.897" offset="849989">So, on four occasions between September, 1976 and the issuance of the first statement in October, 1977, this individual who would go to Cleveland, Ohio, at times to deal with other businesses that Combustion had, would contact representatives of Basic, would have lunch with them, and would say, I'm interested in your company, I would like to see an acquisition made, can we do something, are you interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.882" offset="965868">The Basic representatives told him in no uncertain terms that they were not interested, that they desired to remain independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.555" offset="996588">They were polite.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.672" offset="1001081">They did have lunch with this individual, but nothing came of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.876" offset="1017904">And at the time the October, 1977 statement was issued concerning the FlintKote rumor, they had had only brief contact with this individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.665" offset="1061059">Similarly, in the period between October 1977 and September 1978, they had only three more in-person visits by Mr. Kelly who was the combustion engineering representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.591" offset="1116752">Significantly, two of those visits concerned an interest that Basic had developed in acquiring the refractories division of Combustion Engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.347" offset="1155831">Basic decided that it might be of interest to it to see whether C.E. would be willing to sell that division.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.869" offset="1185819">Mr. Kelly agreed to provide certain information.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.505" offset="1204419">Meetings were held, one in February, 1978; another one in March, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.360" offset="1231795">And finally, in June, Basic proposed that it acquire Combustion's refractories division.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.430" offset="1260112">Mr. Kelly said no, but what if I were to suggest to C.E. that it make an offer to acquire Basic for $28 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.555" offset="1300654">The Basic individual said, we wouldn't be interested, but if we were, that would be too low a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.626" offset="1324895">The individuals had occasional telephone contacts during the balance of June and July, 1978, and then Mr. Kelly stopped calling.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.934" offset="1370139">No word was heard from him during August or September or October and November, with the exception of one brief telephone call that he made in September when he became aware as did the rest of the public that Basic had issued a statement denying any knowledge of reasons for unusual trading activities in its shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.113" offset="1454881">So it is an extreme claim to assert that statements such as these issued by Basic in these circumstances were false and misleading.</text>

            <text syncTime="1039.607" offset="4292823">Now, the other issue that is before the Court involves the fraud on the market theory that has been used by courts to facilitate class certification in actions under Section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.033" offset="4354472">We have argued that the only case in which this Court has even approached anything that's come lower courts feel relates to that theory is the Affiliated Ute case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.607" offset="4396791">And there is nothing in Affiliated Ute which involved a face to face transaction and omissions, rather than misstatements, and a need to shift an evidentiary burden, that provides any justification for fraud on the market theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.267" offset="4451439">Lower courts, however, have concluded that it is good policy to abandon the traditional xx requirement under Section 10(b) and instead to replace it with what they call reliance on the integrity of the market, something that is derived from the efficient market hypothesis, a hypothesis that many people have questioned in light of the events of the last few weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.800" offset="4545584">But in a recent Fifth Circuit decision in the Finkel case, they pointed out that even if you accept the fraud on the market theory for some cases, you should not accept it for a case such as ours, which is a 10(b)(5)(b) case, that is, a case that involves misleading statements, rather than omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.046" offset="4634610">To the extent this Court continues to believe that Section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5) have their origins in a more common law type fraud situation, the element of reliance has to be respected and should be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.175" offset="4703050">It is misleading, I think, for some to argue that reliance is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.113" offset="4734815">It's there in forms of a rebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.930" offset="4746100">The presumption of reliance effectively cannot be rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.832" offset="4757699">People are confronted with enormous class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.302" offset="4771596">The class in this case consists of persons who traded two million shares over a fourteen-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.206" offset="4799181">They claim damages of many tens of millions of dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1172.877" offset="4825930">They sold into the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.896" offset="4833976">Any damage that they claim to have suffered did not arise from any benefit that any of the petitioners received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.002" offset="4866368">If they feel they were misinformed, which we claim they were not, other innocent market participants received an offsetting benefit from the lack of information in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.957" offset="4910254">If a case such as this is proper for certification as a class action, the class should be limited to those who can show that they relied upon the statements in making their investment decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.102" offset="5182763">This results in the aggregation of enormous groups of people, enormous classes, and we think violates the Rule's enabling act, as well, because it changes the ball game when you're confronted with a class action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.175" offset="5319122">It reads the predominance requirement out of the Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.043" offset="5330512">It reflects a policy that class actions are good, that corporations are evil, and that anything that can be done to circumvent... and this is in the language of the Court of appeals... to circumvent the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) and to facilitate class actions, is something that should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.992" offset="5422358">That, in our view, is unsound policy and unsound law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.479" offset="5444301">We also think in this case that even if the fraud on the market theory were not rejected on its face by this Court, that nevertheless its application in this case should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.489" offset="5512324">This is a seller's class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.076" offset="5526743">Most class actions are purchaser's class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.761" offset="5537401">This does not xx a company that has made a historical misstatement xx its earnings or some significant event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.415" offset="5568017">It involves misleading statements because a company was having preliminary merger contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.652" offset="5589019">The case involves a fourteen-month class period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.854" offset="5601767">The claim is that everyone who sold during tis period can be represented by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.925" offset="5626113">For all of those, none of the fraud on the market cases has arisen in a situation such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.495" offset="5652340">Where historical events are misrepresented and there is a market impact, perhaps Courts are attracted by the logic of believing that everyone who purchased a stock that was artificially inflated should be able to join a group and bring a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.956" offset="5722244">But these statements logic would dictate in our view had no market impact or a minimal market impact, perhaps a few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.229" offset="5763308">The lower courts believe that it was appropriate not to look at the question of impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.299" offset="5787550">It was alleged, they claimed, therefore it can be assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.268" offset="5807507">So it thrusts this conditional certification upon the parties at a very early point in the litigation and its hangs over everyone's head until the trial has taken place on the merits, and then after the trial, an opportunity is given to try to rebut that presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.379" offset="5871873">Well, in many respects, that opportunity is just not going to be something that litigants are going to wait for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.616" offset="5896846">The risk is too great and the imbalance that results in securities litigation from having a fraud on the market theory and class certification that's loosely granted, plus ease in denying summary judgment, plus something that renders material just about anything exposes defendants in the securities marketplace to enormous liability and enormous risks, and we think ends up in creating a risk of windfall settlements that ultimately hurt American businesses and investors in those businesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1491.549" offset="6100601">On August 10 of this year, Barron's magazine titled its article about this case, "Is It Okay to Lie"?</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.024" offset="6146472">and I hesitate to oversimplify in that kind of journalistic way, but I really think that's what's at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.178" offset="6171132">I don't think notwithstanding the extensive discussion of the facts that the petitioners seriously claim that the reasonable investor articulated by this Court in TSC v. Northway, could not have considered the discussions between Basic and Combustion significant to their investment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.143" offset="6266949">They try to minimize the extent of those contacts, but the suggestion that a jury, there's not enough evidence of those contacts that a jury could not conclude that a reasonable investor would find it interesting, significant, alter the mix of information available to them in deciding that a buyer sells securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.456" offset="6352213">That is not a serious suggestion, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.091" offset="6358796">I submit that what is really at issue in this case and at issue in the agreement in principle articulation by the petitioners is a statement that for reasons of corporate efficiency, corporate ease, corporate convenience, companies are free to say virtually anything they want to say about the state of merger negotiations up until the time that there's an agreement in principle, which means an agreement on price and structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.826" offset="6469659">In the practical world, agreement on price and structure are typically reached the day the merger is announced, perhaps the night before late at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.533" offset="6508530">Typically the investment bankers sit down at the very last minute and discuss price, go to their respective boards of directors with a recommendations frequently in writing saying do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.056" offset="6550639">Up until that point in time, you do not have what they call an agreement in principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.319" offset="11287684">What I'm suggesting is that the reliance requirement is judicially created, it can be judicially modified, and I think that all the Circuit Courts have done is taken a requirement of direct individual reliance and imposed an indirect reliance requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.829" offset="11357692">There's no suggestion that you don't have to rely on the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.152" offset="11398965">The suggestion in the fraud in the market cases is, a) that the efficient market reflects the fraud... the market goes up or down based on the fraud; and b) people in making trading decisions rely upon the fact that the price at which they're trading is a fair price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.908" offset="11434074">There's still a connection between the fraud of the defendants and the injury to the plaintiff at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.162" offset="11455076">It's simply that, as I think the Blackie Court put it, the fraud on the market theory uses the market as the analytical agent for the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2851.559" offset="11540654">I think another one of the Circuit Court's called it, the market becomes the transmission belt for conveyance of information from defendants to plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.848" offset="11581823">I don't think that the fraud in the market theory eliminates reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.485" offset="11600317">I don't think it does great violence to 10(b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.604" offset="11608781">It customizes the practicalities in 10(b)(5) xx of the xx involved with thousands, sometimes millions xx being required to troop into court, one after, and say whatever it was they relied upon, and why they made their investment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.614" offset="11676804">That's a practical consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.399" offset="11684014">That's why presumptions are entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.982" offset="11690283">It's a rebuttal presumption and I don't think it does any great violence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel W. Sternman</label>
            <text syncTime="2898.054" offset="11726645">Thank you, Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.554" offset="11732601">In many respects, this case represents hindsight run rampant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.910" offset="11762067">There was an agreement that was reached between Basic and Combustion in December, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.230" offset="11787354">There was disclosure that at the time the agreement documents were publicized that the companies had had discussions for the prior 27-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.233" offset="11819328">This lawsuit followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.685" offset="11825179">And the attempt to take the fact that there was an agreement and that there had been contacts during a 27-month period and then to convert that into making three statements misleading does not stand up under the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.929" offset="11882126">There was a reference by the respondents to there being dozens of contacts before the first statement was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.083" offset="11910756">In our reply brief, at xx and xx identify each and every meeting that the parties had during the class period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.872" offset="11949836">And it comes to four meetings before the first statement, three before the second statement and none before the third.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.977" offset="11978257">And we describe those meetings These were not negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.346" offset="11995811">It's a distortion of the English language to call an attempt by an executive of a company to see whether another company might be interested negotiations that render statements false and misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.820" offset="12041682">Second, we should make it clear that the District Court did not require that there be a deal before the statements would be materially misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.294" offset="12091524">All that it required was that there be negotiations destined with reasonable certainty to become a merger agreement in principle, or negotiations which might imminently produce an agreement in principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.833" offset="12133738">It's our argument that at no point during the class period did these contacts between Mr. Kelly and the people at Basic ever approach the level of that definition, or approach the level of the significantly increased possibility formulation that the SEC has used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.015" offset="12226420">Primarily, we advocate adoption by this Court of the agreement in principle test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.586" offset="12248781">It has been used over the years by all of the lower courts in dealing with non-disclosure cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.823" offset="12269679">Cases in which no statements are made and persons who trade on the open market claiming that they would not have sold shares had they known that the company was having discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.630" offset="12316908">The courts uniformly have held in those cases that that information is not material and did not have to be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.468" offset="12344285">And all that's happened in the Greenfield case is that that Court has said that that test that courts have been using for years in the non-disclosure area was an appropriate one when a statement such as the statements here have been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.061" offset="12398619">The agreement in principle test also provides a bright line so that corporations that are the subject of a stock exchange inquiry as to rumors in its stock can know that if they do as Basic did here, seek to disclosed accurate information, that they will not be vulnerable to the type of litigation that was brought here because it's going to be claimed that there were issues of fact as to whether there were material negotiations preceding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.111" offset="12502796">There's been reference to the chilling effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.395" offset="12511991">That is another policy benefit that the agreement in principle test provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.032" offset="12530485">It will not require premature disclosure of negotiations which traditionally have caused acquiring corporations to leave, not to want to pursue a possible acquisition because the price of the company stock increases and there's no longer an economic benefit for the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.827" offset="12605718">Premature disclosure under a test other than the agreement in principle standard also is damaging to executive and employees moral at companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.615" offset="12640827">People who have xx corporations do not want to hear that someone has approached that there may be a possible takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.471" offset="12680324">They're going to start looking for other jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.157" offset="12687011">And any policy that is going to require very early disclosure of the types of contacts that were had here is going to have a devastating effect on employee and corporate morale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.863" offset="12729852">Premature disclosure also runs the risk of putting a company into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.981" offset="12750332">Basic had absolutely no desire to be acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.267" offset="12763498">It recognized that it had an obligation to its shareholders to listen to offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.171" offset="12783037">Had it made a statement in October, 1977, that we've been approached by Company X, we're not interested but this representative of Company X said he might recommend an offer, the raiders and the corporate vultures would be out there, and you'd have market disruption in Basic as well as all of the other impacts that I've referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.286" offset="12871540">One other point, I think, has to be made very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.904" offset="12885960">We do not contend that the agreement in principle test should be applied where insider trading is alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.760" offset="12921382">That is not what's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.129" offset="12930890">And we feel that the SEC's reluctance to endorse the agreement in principle test reflects a concern on its part that power courts will blindly apply that test where there's insider trading.</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.703" offset="12985225">Mr. Sternman, xx answer just one quick question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.055" offset="12998600">You haven't commented at all in the fact that the data was rather confidential information was given as early as 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.577" offset="13032663">Would you just respond to that thought?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel W. Sternman</label>
            <text syncTime="3226.779" offset="13041545">The sales data was given... first of all, in 1978, when there was some sales data given, Basic was interested in acquiring Combustion's refractories division, and it thought that it would pay for that acquisition with Basic stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.325" offset="13107687">So it wanted to give Combustion an opportunity to take a look at what Basic was doing and what that stock might be worth if such an acquisition took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.062" offset="13142691">But in 1976, the Basic individual, Mr. Muller, did give Mr. Kelly certain confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.751" offset="13169441">He trusted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.651" offset="13172993">That information was solely to assist Mr. Kelly to see what he was going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.988" offset="13198384">But it did not, as the District Court noted when it discussed that, create any negotiations out of what was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.927" offset="13226074">It may have been ill advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.844" offset="13229731">It may have been indiscrete, but it did not render the discussions that were had material.</text>
