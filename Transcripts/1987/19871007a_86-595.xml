            <text syncTime="208.164" offset="965924">That's true, but that other statute gives him no remedies, and this statute is the comprehensive statute covering adverse actions against federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.472" offset="1011168">If it simply neglected to deal with this employee, that would be one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.024" offset="1033424">But the whole scheme of the statute shows that Congress dealt advertently with this class of employee in this situation, and has provided, as we have stated, that the Office of Personnel Management could provide that he was covered and had the rights in Chapter 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.920" offset="1112941">It hasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.937" offset="1117016">In this situation where Congress dealt with him, gave him no rights at all under the comprehensive scheme that it set up, and provided that OPM could decide to extend those rights to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.613" offset="1175739">What we think that the proper result to draw, the conclusion to draw is that Congress didn't want him to be able to go to court to complain about a suspension for misuse of a government vehicle unless OPM said that he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.142" offset="1237911">And OPM has said that some employees, excepted service employees may go to court to do that, but it did not grant that right to short-term employees like the Respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.151" offset="1297888">And so under that scheme where Congress hasn't forgotten about him at all, it is just like the Carducci decision where Congress had provided no remedies in the case of reassignments, but had dealt in great detail with all sorts of adverse actions, and it was clear that it had deliberately decided that federal employees can't go to court to complain about reassignments.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.395" offset="1462877">And as I understand it, that is not what's being relied on here, any basis that's set forth in the act itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1511.936" offset="6181009">No one gets a right to judicial review under Subchapter 1, and it has been argued in a number of cases, analogous to the argument here, that because minor adverse actions aren't covered there, that that employees, they are not excluded in any way; that employees can go to court under the Tucker Act to complain about minor adverse actions just as they can't... we argue analogously that they can't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.009" offset="6317369">One last point I'd like to make is that besides being undisputed that under Chapter 43 employees cannot go to court, it is undisputed that probationary employees who are excluded from Chapter 75, in the same sentence that I just read of 75.11(a), cannot complain about adverse actions either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.673" offset="6400020">And that's even though the Greenway decision, which is the basis for the implied cause of action here, held that a probationary excepted service employee was entitled to go to the old Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.813" offset="6452578">We don't think any distinction can be drawn between probationary and excepted service employees in the way they are treated in Chapter 75, and we think it's plain, as we state in our briefs, that Congress didn't want to make a federal case out of adverse actions taken against these sorts of employees.</text>

            <label>Mr. John M. Nannes</label>
            <text syncTime="1607.581" offset="6563651">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.596" offset="6655707">The judgment of the Court of Appeals below rests upon three propositions, all of which are important and two of which the government does not contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.552" offset="6695517">First, Mr. Fausto was discharged in violation of agency regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.873" offset="6720804">The Department of Interior regulations provided that a career-type, nonpreference excepted service employee who was discharged had a right to receive notice in a discharge decision of his right to pursue the agency grievance mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.418" offset="6786946">And the regulations of the Department of Interior further provide for the small universe of employees that they had a right to a full evidentiary hearing if they were being discharged for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.792" offset="6836474">It is undisputed that Mr. Fausto was not provided these rights at the time that he was discharged, and I do not understand the government to contest that the agency fulfilled its obligation under the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.016" offset="6885375">Thus, this case comes to the court with the concession by the government that the agency violated its regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.586" offset="6911602">Second, Mr. Fausto would have been entitled to judicial review if he had been discharged prior to passage of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.811" offset="6960503">The government endeavors in its reply brief, and it has made the point once more here today that that is somehow an implied right or a judicially implied right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.833" offset="7000627">But I would submit to the court that prior decisions of this court and of the old Court of Claims support the proposition that that was a statutory right of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.724" offset="7040229">The combination of the Tucker Act, which provides for a cause of action when there has been a violation of an agency regulation, in conjunction with the Back Pay Act, which is a money mandating remedy, and the violation by the agency in this instance of his procedural regulations, provided Mr. Fausto with a statutory cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.686" offset="7120059">The Greenway decision, which happens to be one of the cases that the court below cited, is by no means the only case holdings in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.141" offset="7153809">Indeed, if the court goes back and looks in the aftermath of its decision almost 30 years ago in Vitarelli v. Seaton, it will find that the employee who was there wrongfully discharged was then reinstated by his agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.718" offset="7212219">He contended that the back pay that the agency had awarded him was insufficient, and he filed a cause of action in the old Court of Claims, and that cause of action was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.240" offset="7246283">It is very much a statutory cause of action, and it preceded the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.875" offset="7268748">Third, the Court of Appeals below found that there was no evidence that Congress intended when it enacted the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, to repeal rights of judicial review that previously would have been available to employees such as Mr. Fausto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.403" offset="7338861">This is certainly a proposition that the government does contest, and thus, the issue presented for this court is whether it is fairly discernable that when Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act, that it intended to extinguish or repeal statutory right that otherwise would have continued to be available to nonpreference excepted service employees such as Mr. Fausto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.685" offset="7427991">Notably, Your Honors, the government does not rely upon any specific preclusion language in the Civil Service Reform Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.291" offset="7466443">There is indeed no provision in that act, Chapter 75 or elsewhere, that specifies that prior remedies that had been available to other types of employees were intended to be extinguished by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.134" offset="7517852">Thus, under the holding of this court almost 30 years ago in Vitarelli v. Seaton, Mr. Fausto has a right of judicial review to obtain review of his discharge in violation of agency regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.192" offset="7566022">The government seeks to distinguish Vitarelli on the proposition that Congress had not specifically indicated with respect to the statute there involved an intention to preclude judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.416" offset="7614923">But I would note for the court that the statute pursuant to which Mr. Vitarelli was discharged provided the Secretary of Interior with a right to discharge him that would be "final and conclusive" in the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.223" offset="7670198">And there is certainly nothing of an analogous preclusionary sort in the Civil Service Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.477" offset="7691200">And yet, in Vitarelli a right of judicial review was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.746" offset="7704262">Instead, the government relies upon broad arguments drawn from a so-called statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.066" offset="7733519">It is certainly true that in other provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act, such as Chapter 23, which deals with prohibitive personnel practices, and Chapter 43, that deals with performance appraisal standards, that various rights are accorded to nonpreference excepted service employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.527" offset="7803422">But the inclusion of references to those employees in Chapter 23 and Chapter 43 simply provide no guidance to the court as to what the congressional intention was underlying enactment of Chapter 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.919" offset="7856921">It is notable that the government ignores the legislative history underlying that chapter, but it nevertheless tries to draw broad conclusions based on the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.977" offset="7901225">The legislative history demonstrates quite conclusively that when Congress enacted Chapter 75 it had a far more limited objective in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.635" offset="7947827">Part of the purpose underlying Chapter 75 was to transfer the adjudicatory jurisdiction over employee appeals that had formerly resided in the old Civil Service Commission, and instead, to transfer that to the new agency, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and that Congress also intended thereby to consolidate judicial review of such decision in what has now become the Federal Circuit, rather than to permit actions to be initiated in district courts throughout the country under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.172" offset="8073947">There is simply no indication in the legislative history underlying Chapter 75 that Congress was intending thereby to change the rules that had previously been available to nonpreference excepted service employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.899" offset="9712869">And what we maintain is simply that when Congress endeavored to abolish the old Civil Service Commission and to substitute the Merit Systems Protection Board, it simply brought forward and transferred over to that appellate process the same employees who had formerly enjoyed those rights prior to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.409" offset="9778907">Since, of course, Mr. Fausto prior to 1978 would have had a right to pursue his claim under the Tucker Act, we argue that the mere transfer of those responsibilities by Congress in 1978 cannot be read so broadly as to extinguish rights that he otherwise would have enjoyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2665.520" offset="10795383">In the absence of broad language either of a specific preclusive sort or of a statutory scheme that supports its broad characterization of the effort by Congress to preclude judicial review, the government does make certain illusions to the possibility of anomalous or illogical results by virtue of the fact that an excepted service employee such as Mr. Fausto might be able to get into court more quickly than might a competitive service or a preference eligible employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.055" offset="10917532">I think the fact that the competitive service employee enjoys the rights that are conferred by Chapter 75 is indeed a very substantial advantage and was intended specifically by Congress to confer additional rights on those employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.283" offset="12038394">We submit to the Court, Your Honors, there simply is not a basis upon which the court can fairly discern that Congress intended to repeal rights that this man would have otherwise had to obtain judicial review of the completeness of the remedy that he was awarded by the agency for his wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.161" offset="12117911">The government has not dispelled the substantial doubt that this was Congress' intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.564" offset="12443605">I would like to very briefly address the nature of what actually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.420" offset="12479027">Mr. Fausto was notified that the agency intended to discharge him, and he was allowed to respond to that before he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.942" offset="12521032">The error that was committed, and the only error that was committed was that the agency did not then tell him that he had a right to file a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.397" offset="12558858">A year later, after the camp at which he closed... at which he worked had closed, the agency realized that it had made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.272" offset="12602430">It then told him he could file a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.141" offset="12613819">He did file a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.707" offset="12620089">He was awarded seven months back pay; back pay from the date the mandatory 30-day suspension would have ended, until the camp closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.199" offset="12658123">What was subsequently held by the federal circuit was that even though it had done that and granted him his grievance rights, and even though a 30-day suspension was mandatory, that somehow the agency lost its right to suspend him for 30 days as a result of failing to notify him of the right to filing a grievance such that the grievance proceeding occurred late in the day.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.942" offset="12825098">--clear that the only mistake here was failing to notify him that he had a right to a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.227" offset="12846205">One point that's worth noting is that one area that Congress wanted employees, including nonveterans and the excepted service to still be able to file claims in court, was in discrimination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.355" offset="12914750">And as we have pointed out, Congress in Section 7707 and 7702 has very carefully integrated the procedures in discrimination cases with the procedures it set up in Chapters 43 and 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.031" offset="12973473">So in that area Congress wanted to preserve a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.317" offset="12986534">It preserved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.019" offset="12993326">The final point I'd like to make is that there are indeed anomalous results flowing from the court's decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.756" offset="13028330">The amicus has told us that even though it's undisputed that a veteran competitive service employee cannot go to court to challenge a 10-day suspension, he thinks that an excepted service employee could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.282" offset="13086427">There is anomaly in Section... Chapter 43 versus Chapter 75 that we have discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.288" offset="13122476">And finally, there is a short of reverse anomaly even though probationary employees are excluded from Chapter 75 in the same sentence of the same subsection as excepted service employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.214" offset="13178169">It is thought that they, of course, have no right of action, whereas this employee does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.285" offset="13198440">We don't think that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.952" offset="13205127">We think Congress clearly meant to exclude nonveterans excepted service personnel and probationary employees from going to court except in discrimination cases.</text>
