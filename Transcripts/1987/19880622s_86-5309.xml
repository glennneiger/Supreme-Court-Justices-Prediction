            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinions of the Court in two cases to announce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.644" offset="18495">The first is Ross against Oklahoma, No. 86-5309.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.892" offset="39497">This case comes to us on certiorari to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.070" offset="60186">The petitioner here, a fellow named Bobby Lynn Ross, was charged with capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.429" offset="81711">During voir dire in selecting his jury, a prospective juror named Darrell Huling indicated that if the jury found Ross guilty, that juror would automatically vote to impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.202" offset="136777">The trial court denied Ross' motion to remove Huling for cause and Ross then used his sixth peremptory challenge to strike the juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.865" offset="179409">Ross ultimately exhausted all of his peremptory challenges provided under Oklahoma law.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.618" offset="202397">The jury found him guilty and sentenced him to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.315" offset="217234">On appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals said that the trial court had erred in denying the challenge to juror Huling for cause, but that Court also held that petitioner had established no grounds for reversal because no objectionable juror had been seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.354" offset="293407">For the reasons explained in an opinion filed today, we affirm the judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.809" offset="319216">We agree that juror Huling should have been removed for cause, but we think the trial court's error did not abridge Ross' Sixth Amendment right to an impartial juror because Huling did not sit and Ross has not shown that any partial juror sat on the panel that actually heard his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.366" offset="393404">The trial court's error forced Ross to exercise one of his peremptory challenges and may thereby have affected the composition of the jury that sat.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.443" offset="429767">But we reject the argument that because of this fact, a Sixth Amendment violation occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.226" offset="452859">We also reject the argument that the trial court's error somehow deprived Ross of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.105" offset="484415">Peremptory challenges are creatures of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.972" offset="495804">They are not mandated by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.750" offset="506984">And under the ruling of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, Ross obtained all he was entitled to under Oklahoma law.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.400" offset="537600">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan, Blackmun and Stevens have joined.</text>
