            <text syncTime="18.628" offset="211961">In this case the Court is called upon to examine the constitutionality under the "equal protection" clause of a fee charged of some North Dakota parents to bus their children to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.935" offset="265147">The fee is imposed only in a minority of districts which includes the Dickinson district, where the Plaintiffs reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.260" offset="306420">In a majority of districts in North Dakota, busing is provided to all free of charge subject to local mileage limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.099" offset="345813">That is a statutory mandate in all of those other districts which compromise some 260 out of the 310 districts in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.525" offset="399520">Within the Dickinson district, the fee is imposed against all save handicapped or special education students without exemption, without regard to ability to pay or the financial status of the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.039" offset="489591">The effects of these two aspects of the Dickinson bussing policy and the authorizing statute come together and converge in this case where a poor family, unable to pay the fee, lives within one of the few districts where the fee is permitted to be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.304" offset="574645">The parent who brought this case, Paula Kadrmas, lives with her husband and three children called New Hradec, North Dakota, on a farm that is some 16 miles from the school their oldest daughter is designated to attend by the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.933" offset="653117">She encounters the fee at all, again, only because she happens to live in that type of district.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.253" offset="678404">If she lived in any other districts, there would not be any kind of bussing fee that could, by law, be charged to her.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.614" offset="5455886">I think some more facts might be illuminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.399" offset="5475008">This matter of charging a fee actually, although it is a state law, did originate in Dickinson back in 1973 and it was a plebicite of the bus uses that it came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.523" offset="5519520">Prior to that it was a practice of picking up the children at the main road which could mean a half-mile or a mile or a quarter of a mile; and the bus patrons said we would rather pay a... that didn't cost anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.783" offset="5576572">They said we'd rather pay a fee if you'll come to our yard and pick up the children and return them there in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.104" offset="5601858">So that is what happened and that's what is still going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.258" offset="5618472">Subsequent to that, actually, the law was passed in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.293" offset="5634564">The fee at the present level and for the past several years as in the case of Serita Kadrmas was $97.00 for the full year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.065" offset="5669672">She's sixteen miles from school, so if you figure in and out each day, that comes to 1.7 cents per mile, far less than anybody could afford their own children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.325" offset="5726724">And as the evidence showed, that the Kadrmases, by their own testimony during the 1984-85 year... '85-86 year, excuse me, which was the year that this case was tried in trial court, that they spent $114 each month for actual expenses, and this was gas and similar expenses to haul the child back and forth, versus the fee which would have been $10.70 a month.</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.370" offset="9534854">It's purpose was to encourage consolidation, and as a quid pro quo, where there was consolidation, to guarantee that there would be school bus transportation provided to parents who were fearful that when their local school closed, they would have to face the responsibility of bussing or transporting your child in from a great distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.481" offset="9607370">And that system has to be looked at based on its impact on the entire state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3242.343" offset="13106733">So that has nothing to do with the reorganization statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.111" offset="13121884">Secondly, this is not a local option case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.663" offset="13136095">This is not a Rodriguez "difference in quality of education".</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.217" offset="13158247">As Justice Stevens pointed out, these are mostly state funds, and it's more than 2/3rds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.205" offset="13182280">And in may cases it's 80 percent of the funds are state monies that are being distributed to the various districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.772" offset="13280500">That's true, but withholding it from a person who doesn't pay it, withholding all that state benefit, is not something that a local option ought to be able to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.365" offset="13342880">What I'm saying is that it's even worse that this fee could deny those people all of the state benefit as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.804" offset="13384676">The formula apart from that, they don't pay the same percentage in every district; the formula is the same; the state funding of transportation formula is based on whether you use a small or a large bus; and the number of pupil days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.634" offset="13463984">Some districts get over 100 percent; they get more than their cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="3341.007" offset="13501391">I suppose you can say that the person who can't afford the 1/3 fee or whatever proportion of that is charged, has to forego the other 66 percent just because that person doesn't have the money, but another resident of the district who has no children forgoes the whole thing, all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.772" offset="13588536">So one doesn't have the money; the other doesn't have children.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.126" offset="13613927">It is like other parts of education; people pay taxes and fund it whether they have children or not because education is important to our society as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.484" offset="13659380">And this is the same concept, Your Honor, at least I see that in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.090" offset="13693757">The question or the specter that this is a local kind of case It think is most disturbing because we're not talking about the inability of a district to tailor a plan mileage limits based on the size of the cities within their district or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.205" offset="13798247">They most certainly have the right to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.407" offset="13807024">What we're talking about is the denial altogether of the essential part of the education process in North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.846" offset="13844745">The difference, I think, in the geographic cases that were cited by Mr. Spaeth, here we have that element of compulsion again, and we have the benefit being given throughout the state and then being arbitrarily withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.961" offset="13933248">Most of the questions I noted from this Court has been what is the purpose of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.330" offset="13950698">Why do we have this difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.615" offset="13959893">The reorganization statute in 1947 reorganized the state as it was destined and designed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.138" offset="13993956">The fee statute, 32 years later, had absolutely nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.256" offset="14010466">It served no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.725" offset="14020288">It has little to do with reorganizing those districts as any other statute you might find on the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.580" offset="14051739">That process, as they have conceded, is complete, and it is not likely to happen in Dickinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.753" offset="14088415">Unless there are any further questions, thank you very much.</text>
