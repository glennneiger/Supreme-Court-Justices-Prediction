            <text syncTime="97.886" offset="527073">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented by this case is whether states like Wisconsin, which opened their courts to 1983 actions, may require 1983 plaintiffs to comply with notice of claims statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.518" offset="589558">Had Bobby Felder filed this 1983 action in the federal courts he would not have been required to comply with the Wisconsin notice of claims statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.343" offset="632921">The Wisconsin Supreme Court acknowledged this, but characterized the notice of claim requirement as a procedural requirement, and relying in part on the Tenth Amendment, held that state courts entertaining 1983 cases could require compliance with state procedural rules such as notice of claim requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.120" offset="728007">Despite this characterization of the notice of claim requirement as procedural, the requirement has nothing to do with regulating the conduct of litigation in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.885" offset="771057">The notice of claim statute in Wisconsin has its origin in legislation enacted in response to the Wisconsin Supreme Court's abrogation of governmental tort immunity in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.026" offset="827586">In addition to partially restoring governmental immunity, the notice of claims statute established a condition precedent for commencing or maintaining civil actions in the state courts of Wisconsin against local governmental entities and their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.769" offset="898534">To maintain such a suit, a prospective plaintiff must serve a written notice of the circumstances of the claim within 120 days of the event giving rise to the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.116" offset="951929">When a governmental employee is a defendant, as in the present case, the prospective plaintiff must serve the notice of claim on both the governmental entity and on all of the governmental employees in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.879" offset="1027057">Service must be made according to the requirements of service of process for summons under Wisconsin law.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.972" offset="1055374">In addition to the notice of the circumstances of the claim, a claimant must also present an itemized statement of the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.740" offset="1090482">This itemized statement of the relief sought may be in the same document, but it need not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.133" offset="1120053">In cases involving damages, however, it must contain the specific sum of money sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.078" offset="1143772">At that point a claimant may not go into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.462" offset="1161326">There is a 120-day waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.863" offset="1170939">A claimant may not sue until the claim is disallowed or until the 120-day period expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.467" offset="1201346">At that time there is a six-month statute of limitations under Wisconsin law within which the plaintiff... the claimant must bring their action.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.914" offset="1611155">Firstly, they must establish that the entity had actual notice of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.028" offset="1639576">Secondly, they must demonstrate that there was no prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.195" offset="1680327">The plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendants were not prejudiced by virtue of the absence of timely, formal statutory notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.792" offset="1722646">In the case at bar, the plaintiff would have had to have shown that the City of Milwaukee and all ten of the individual defendants, respondents in this Court, were not prejudiced by virtue of their not having received formal statutory notice within the 120-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.916" offset="1807178">Now, the Wisconsin courts have given very little guidance as to what this prejudice requirement means or how a plaintiff is to establish this additional element of their case, but it is important to note that the focus of that inquiry is not upon why the plaintiff did or did not file their notice of claim, but the focus is solely on the prejudice to the defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.328" offset="2500781">I don't believe the specific argument that you raise was in fact raised in the Wisconsin courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.975" offset="2531397">This Court in Wilson versus Garcia addressed the appropriate statute of limitations in Section 1983 actions and held that in each state there should be a single limitations period for 1983 litigation, and that that limitations period should be the limitations period for general personal injury actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.311" offset="2624706">The Wisconsin Court of Appeals in the present case identified the appropriate limitations period in this case as three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.134" offset="2656053">The notice of claims statute, we contend, operates to cut off a plaintiff's right to sue short of that full statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.812" offset="2698789">Now, in support of the notice of claim requirement the Wisconsin Supreme Court identified as the primary purpose of the requirement the desire to settle disputes without resort to litigation, certainly a legitimate purpose in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.620" offset="2757930">However, this Court rejected that identical purpose when offered by the State of Maryland as a justification for its six-month limitation period in cases involving administrative agency allegations of employment discrimination in Burnett versus Gratten.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.173" offset="2836193">But the Court has noted that in choosing a appropriate limitations period, a different balance of interests enters into a state decision than the appropriate balance of interests that should be considered when a court is dealing with a federally created cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.863" offset="5698900">In fact, virtually every state in this country has entertained 1983 cases with very, very minimal guidance from this Court in terms of what should happen when a 1983 case is heard in the state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.590" offset="5805898">In Martinez versus California the Court held that when state courts entertained 1983 cases they were obligated to apply the federal immunity standard, so we have some minimal guidance which supports the proposition that when state courts entertain 1983 actions, they are required to entertain the entire cause of action with all of its attributes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.136" offset="5904014">One of the attributes of 1983 is the no exhaustion policy that was established in Patsy, but in Wisconsin a claimant who believes they have a 1983 claim and wants to pursue it in state court cannot immediately go to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.739" offset="5982486">They have to go to city hall, and then they have to wait 120 days, and they have to do that in all cases as a result of the notice of claim requirement, so the immediate access to a judicial forum that is the right of plaintiffs is 1983 cases is not available in Wisconsin.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.746" offset="9498463">I would also point out that there's another important purpose behind this statute, and it's a purpose that's consistent with 1983 and the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.834" offset="9538796">It provides us with an opportunity when we receive notice of a claim such as this to investigate and to, if necessary, take remedial action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.271" offset="9644539">For example, if a case involving a strip search, a claim were filed against the city for a strip search, I think all would agree that there is nothing more degrading than a person who is subject to strip search by police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.042" offset="9711622">In a case such as that, if we receive a claim reasonably shortly after the incident occurs, it gives us an opportunity to review the policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2417.878" offset="9807021">That's correct in this case, but the overall purpose is to afford the city an opportunity to take remedial actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.351" offset="9836905">I agree with you that in terms of the incident we had knowledge of the incident very shortly after it occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.537" offset="9865640">Our courts said that knowledge of the incident simply was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the claim statutes, but we did have knowledge of the incident and in fact we did conduct a full investigation of the incident itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.546" offset="9925721">But again in the strip search example, if we find that there is a problem with the policy, we can rewrite policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.252" offset="9960517">If we find that it's necessary we can re-educate our police officers in what the requirements of that policy are, and we can do it in such a manner that others may not suffer the same alleged injustice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.072" offset="10019762">That is why the statute is so important to municipalities, not only to resolve the claim before it, but also to take remedial action so that this type of incident does not occur again.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.159" offset="13656112">The court held that while the city was aware that there was an incident, we were not aware that this person would seek as a result of the facts of that incident to recover damages against the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.071" offset="13723821">The court held that in order to comply with the actual notice requirement you must advise the city, the common council, and the mayor that you intend to seek to recover damages as a result of that incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.878" offset="13778992">We get notices of this type of incident or other types that could result in lawsuits throughout the departments of the city that the common council and the mayor never become aware of, so they can't afford themselves of the benefits of the statute because they are not aware that these incidents occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.750" offset="13850463">In fact, in this case there is a footnote regarding comments made by one of the aldermen who received a call about this incident and who reported it to the chief of police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.969" offset="13899364">He indicated that he didn't feel that this was a claim or a notice of claim, that it was nothing more than a telephone call that he had received from a constituent regarding an incident that he wanted the department to look into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.958" offset="13951295">He didn't believe that there was compliance with the statute as a result of the call that he received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.210" offset="13976373">Again, the statute is somewhat confusing because of its two parts and the time frames contained in the two parts, but it has served its purposes well, and it is not, and I repeat, it is not a substantial burden placed on a claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.184" offset="14060278">Compliance is minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.086" offset="14071877">The problem that the claimant had in this case was simply a refusal to comply with the statute in any regard, even though the claimant was put on notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.779" offset="14154632">We don't dispute that the statute may work very well in Wisconsin in the traditional tort litigation for which it was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.955" offset="14191308">In cases involving potholes, ice on the sidewalk, defective highways, the statute may work fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.060" offset="14215759">There is nothing in the record and no experience to support the conclusion that it works fine in Section 1983 cases involving allegations of constitutional deprivations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3536.830" offset="14282841">With all respect, I have to say that the final colloquy between counsel and the court demonstrates many of the complexities of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.525" offset="14317637">And this is a statute that an unrepresented claimant is supposed to be able to understand and comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.030" offset="14343654">I think it flies in the face of reality to conclude that it is a simple statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.954" offset="14367269">In this particular case the plaintiff was put on notice about his alleged non-compliance with the statute after his litigation was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.884" offset="14418992">At that time it was impossible for him to file a notice complying with the second part of the requirement, and wait 120 days, because by definition that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3639.539" offset="14693695">Well, what I have is that as this Court pointed out in Robertson versus Wegman, in which the Court indicated that the issue was not whether a particular plaintiff wins or loses in terms of determining the propriety of a state policy, but for the same reasons we would say that the issue is not whether a particular plaintiff might or might not have been able to comply with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.255" offset="14804559">The issue is the appropriateness of the requirement in 1983 litigation and the appropriateness of the requirement in 1983 litigation not only in the Wisconsin courts but in the courts throughout the country, because any decision that this Court makes affirming the use of notice of claim requirements will in all likelihood be a binding precedent throughout the country.</text>
