            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="134416">We'll hear argument next in No. 85-1910, Business Electronics Corporation versus Sharp Electronics Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.939" offset="178093">Mr. McGowan, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary V. McGowan</label>
            <text syncTime="13.641" offset="188960">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.759" offset="201394">This antitrust case arises under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and involves an allegation of vertical price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.413" offset="232009">It concerns two independent dealers in Houston, Texas, who bought calculators from Sharp Electronics Corporation, and resold those calculators to their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.154" offset="274955">The jury below found an agreement between Sharp and Hartwell, Hartwell being one of the dealers in Houston, to terminate the petitioner, Business Electronics, the other dealer in Houston, for the purpose of eliminating price cutting, an agreement to eliminate price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.099" offset="350710">On appeal, Sharp did not contest the sufficiency of the evidence supporting that jury finding, but instead the issue in this appeal is whether an agreement to stop price cutting by terminating the price cutter is a per se violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.978" offset="414240">The Fifth Circuit below held that such an agreement did not constitute price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.930" offset="434093">The Court said that a finding of price fixing required literally an agreement to charge resale prices at some level.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.618" offset="468888">The decision below, which carves out conspiracies to eliminate price cutting from the definition of resale price maintenance should be reversed for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.093" offset="510788">First of all, such a rule would eviscerate the per se rule against price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.663" offset="533045">The per se rule would be so narrow as to catch only blatant smoking gun cases of price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.317" offset="559585">Such a rule would deter only the ill informed and unsophisticated.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.769" offset="577453">It could easily be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.805" offset="585603">Instead of agreeing on price directly, suppliers and dealers who wish to achieve adherence to resale prices could simply collude to terminate dealers who refuse to charge those prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.314" offset="647670">Second, a conspiracy to terminate dealers who don't comply with the suggested resale prices is clearly a form of resale price maintenance under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.740" offset="701273">This Court has never limited the definition of vertical price fixing to direct agreements on price.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.394" offset="723947">In Parke, Davis and Albrecht, for example, the Court said that resale price maintenance need not take the form of an actual agreement on price.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.834" offset="757698">It's enough for the plaintiff to show collusion to enforce suggested resale prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.135" offset="778909">And this makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.187" offset="787164">There is no meaningful difference between a direct agreement on price and a conspiracy to terminate dealers because they charge lower prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.161" offset="831049">Was it established here that the non-terminated dealer would only charge list price all the time, and that the price cutter was always cutting below list.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.221" offset="887265">That wasn't established, was it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary V. McGowan</label>
            <text syncTime="190.137" offset="894893">It was established here, Your Honor, that the terminated dealer was continually discounting and it was established that the non-terminated dealer wanted to avoid that discounting.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="202.029" offset="942436">But sometimes discounted himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.064" offset="950586">He wasn't always selling at the manufacturer's suggested retail price, was he?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary V. McGowan</label>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="211.717" offset="981201">So you really can't say for sure that by terminating the other one for discounting, what you were establishing is in effect the manufacturer's suggested retail price, or at least we don't know that for certain.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gary_v_mcgowan" startTime="226.060" stopTime="248.676">
            <label>Mr. Gary V. McGowan</label>
            <text syncTime="226.060" offset="1038566">--What we can say for certain is that a price cutter, a firm that was clearly charging lower than the manufacturer's suggested resale prices was taken out of the marketplace in order to get rid of that price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.737" offset="1089348">This is a form of an agreement on price, because it's in effect an agreement which says these lower prices should not be charged by that dealer.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="248.676" stopTime="267.387">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="248.676" offset="1129054">Well, Mr. McGowan, why couldn't an agreement to eliminate a price cutter reflect an agreement to maintain the conditions necessary for the continuation of some presale promotional practices, instead?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gary_v_mcgowan" startTime="267.387" stopTime="291.502">

            <text syncTime="267.387" offset="1203869">Well, Your Honor, that contention was raised in this case, and the so-called free riding concern, promotion services.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.093" offset="1246710">In this case, the evidence showed that in fact, the plaintiff, Business Electronics, was not a free rider.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.330" offset="1271683">There was never any complaint from Sharp that he wasn't providing those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.216" offset="1287252">The complaint from Sharp was that he was price cutting.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="291.502" offset="1300418">Well, the facts may show that, but it would seem to me that it speaks to whether there should be the application of a per se rule, or not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gary_v_mcgowan" startTime="300.774" stopTime="349.922">
            <label>Mr. Gary V. McGowan</label>
            <text syncTime="300.774" offset="1337512">Well, the free riding rationale would in effect as used here, Your Honor, as a thinly distinguished attack on the per se rule in general, the same free rider arguments are made with respect to the per se rule itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.736" offset="1405325">The free rider arguments should not be given any weight in the context of vertical price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.307" offset="1431552">In Sylvania, this Court alluded to free rider effects, but only in the context of vertical non-price restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.543" offset="1456525">And the Court made it clear that as to price restrictions, there are significantly different policy concerns and effects as to price restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.483" offset="1492261">As to price restrictions, the courts will always apply the per se rule.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="349.922" offset="1534057">Well, I don't think you've, at least not to my satisfaction, completely answered Justice O'Connor's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.545" offset="1560493">You say that the free rider consideration shouldn't be taken into account here, but why shouldn't they.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.515" offset="1588392">I mean, if we're talking about economic utility and that sort of thing, why shouldn't that consideration along with many others be taken into account?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary V. McGowan</label>
            <text syncTime="371.287" offset="1619529">It depends on what you mean by free rider, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.572" offset="1632695">Free rider means a failure to provide a certain level of minimum promotional services, there are far less restrictive alternatives than vertical price fixing, which can be used to remedy free riding to the extent it's a problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="387.964" stopTime="394.820">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="387.964" offset="1686194">But why must we look for the least restrictive alternative in a statutory case, and it's not a First Amendment case--</text>

          <turn speaker="gary_v_mcgowan" startTime="394.820" stopTime="437.680">
            <label>Mr. Gary V. McGowan</label>
            <text syncTime="394.820" offset="1713675">Because free riding is a ready label which can always be used to excuse what amounts to a conspiracy to eliminate price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.140" offset="1746903">And this case is a good example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.359" offset="1755784">I mean, there was no evidence that Business Electronics was actually free riding.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.512" offset="1776369">And in fact, the evidence shows that if anybody was free riding, it was Hartwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.447" offset="1792147">Because Business Electronics had been an established dealer in this market for four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.101" offset="1810746">Hartwell was then appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.601" offset="1816806">Hartwell then started soliciting customers from Business Electronics.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.755" offset="1833420">So the free rider rationale, this business of inducing dealers to provide additional services is something that came to life in hindsight, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.127" offset="2382827">The manufacturer can also impose non-price vertical restrictions subject to the rule of reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.883" offset="2941848">The first reason being, as Justice Powell recognized in the Sylvania opinion, it may facilitate cartelizing, cartelization of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.656" offset="2981032">For example, we have evidence in this case that Sharp's motive in imposing resale price restrictions on its dealers was pursuant to a promise that it made to its competitors not to enter into a meaningless price cutting war.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.368" offset="3051876">That's one reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.651" offset="3056996">The second reason, and I think a more obvious reason, is that rigorous price competition at the retail level is eventually going to put back pressure on the manufacturer's wholesale prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.460" offset="3112166">The manufacturer cannot stand there and watch retail prices continue to go down without eventually lowering his own prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.160" offset="3207043">Now, this theoretical freedom is an artificial distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.195" offset="3223134">It's unrealistic to suppose that the remaining dealer will use his freedom to do anything other than raise prices or increase margins.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.218" offset="3255213">I mean, after all, the purpose of the agreement here was to eliminate price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.836" offset="3269737">And focusing on the remaining dealer's supposed freedom ignores the reality of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.989" offset="3298367">It's purpose and effect was to destroy Business Electronics' freedom to lower prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.253" offset="4187366">An exclusive distributorship is defined as an agreement between a supplier and a distributor, whereby the supplier agrees not to appoint any other dealer in a defined territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.930" offset="4358103">For example, if Sharp had appointed Business Electronics as its exclusive distributor, a price cutter would have remained in the market and would have represented price competition viz a viz interbrand competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.774" offset="6921446">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.399" offset="6963974">I think listening to the argument of petitioner here, it is well for us to make very clear at the outset that Sharp is not contending that terminating a discounting dealer, such as has occurred here in June of '73, is always permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.764" offset="7061463">What we're arguing is that such a decision to terminate a dealer is not necessarily legal, that is to say, it is not per se legal, and should be open to inquiry in the courts as to just what were the circumstances that led to that termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.844" offset="7149756">What was going on in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.880" offset="7157907">What services, functions, etcetera, that the various dealers hired in the marketing system of the manufacturer and supplier, were doing best so as to be as competitive as possible in the interbrand marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.143" offset="7246932">In other words, we're arguing that this Court and the lower courts should not presume conclusively that terminating dealers is always anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.851" offset="7293743">In many instances, as this Court has already recognized in Sylvania and Monsanto, there can be circumstances where this kind of termination for price cutting is not anticompetitive but procompetitive, particularly when you measure what is going on not only interbrand but intrabrand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.566" offset="7384649">Now, let me suggest that one of the difficulties with the rule apparently argued for by petitioner is that without really doing anymore than using the phraseology, the petitioner seems to assume that terminating a discounter is so obviously and exclusively and constantly pernicious that it can be assumed in each case to be anticompetitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.392" offset="8363928">And that is to prevent a remaining dealer, Hartwell in this case, from being able to sit down with his supplier and actually tie Hartwell, the remaining dealer's hands, as to what he can charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.409" offset="8564026">Because in the cases such as Sylvania and Monsanto, as I read them, this Court has recognized that you have to be a little less wooden than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.733" offset="8609270">You have to allow a dealer the option to say, hey, I have two dealers, one's a discounter, the other I consider a full service or at least a better full service dealer than that discounter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.028" offset="8682517">There has to be flexibility to allow that manufacturer to make that determination if he's in a highly competitive position interbrand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.236" offset="8723268">And the distinction that the Court below drew is perfectly sensible and consistent with Sylvania and Monsanto because it said, look you've got to go further, discounter, who comes in with a treble damage action, and show there was some agreement to hobble or restrain the surviving dealer's right to decide what to charge in that marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.304" offset="8839565">And Business Electronics didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.588" offset="8852731">And with that instruction, there was no way in the world that the greatest jury or fact finder could avoid doing what they did with no economic advantage, purpose, or fairness whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.467" offset="8912186">Think about another aspect of the argument petitioner makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.919" offset="8926083">They seem to think that somehow what happened here was terribly offensive, but apparently are willing to recognize that the law of the land is that what happened here in practical effect is legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.248" offset="9007376">And what I'm adverting to here is that once Hartwell was the surviving dealer, he became an exclusive dealer in the Houston area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.156" offset="9058994">The Courts say you can do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.442" offset="9068085">I would argue that once you say, hey, fellow, you're an exclusive in Houston, that's a lot more devastating and stark to any discounter who was kicked out on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.250" offset="9123360">The other thing is the argument, apparently, as I understand Business Electronics is that look, what was going on here leads to the possible cartelization of the calculator industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.361" offset="9191800">Counsel for Business Electronics cross examined the sales manager, a man named Burkholder in this trial, and brought out happily that at the time there were a hundred firms in the business of manufacturing, like Sharp, and selling calculators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.941" offset="9274138">Cartelization with a hundred competitors across this great country?</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.095" offset="9294723">Ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.129" offset="9298903">Another thing that the argument comes down to as I understand petitioner is this, that we are in no trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.652" offset="9344983">The courts would take no offense to the teaching of Sylvania and Monsanto, if they took the broad rule that they argue for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.060" offset="9394615">Well, it seems to me that that really is a little bit tough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.781" offset="9413528">As I read Sylvania, the Court in that case reasoned and concluded that exclusive dealerships which certainly eliminate intra-brand competition are permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.374" offset="9475908">Now, if this Court can say that, why not allow this, particularly since all we're arguing for is not a free ride ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.515" offset="9520421">We're simply arguing that the rule of reason should apply and we may lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.919" offset="9546021">You recall in the decision below, Judge Clark pointed out his view of the evidence as he understood it in the trial record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.810" offset="9585623">There's evidence on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.110" offset="9590847">I assume we're not here to argue with you or to ask this Court to decide on the evidence, but the point is there should be a chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.849" offset="9629717">And if the price cutter can show that what happened was the result of a true conspiracy to do no more than to fix retail prices through his surviving retail dealer, or some other anticompetitive effect, then he wins.</text>

            <text syncTime="2417.795" offset="9805574">Let me make one other point, and that is this: one of the curious things about petitioner's argument here is that normally it would seem from an economic and practical point of view that if I were a supplier of a calculator and I liked to sell calculators particularly in a big city like Houston, and if as I think the marketplace truly was in the early 70s, you know, calculators were still coming along and weren't quite as popular as they are today, but very competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.920" offset="9961995">I would really hesitate to think that any sensible supplier would just say willy nilly, okay, other dealer, you come in and say, I get rid of the price cutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.162" offset="10011000">I want to think about that a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.329" offset="10019673">Why should I throw out the fellow who might sell the most calculators in Houston unless there were powerful reasons in terms of what I was trying to achieve across the board that I'd want somebody that doesn't discount as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.724" offset="10089263">Let me point out another obvious economic circumstance here which petitioner seems strangely to ignore in arguing on the law point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.016" offset="10130432">There are suppliers in this world which don't like to be known as having a marketing system whereby they sell in discount stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.625" offset="10192813">On Fifth Avenue in New York City, there are fellows who have signs saying, I'm going out of business tomorrow, come in and buy calculators and cameras at a discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.381" offset="10231892">A few blocks over there's Bloomingdales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.166" offset="10243072">They sell these same things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.535" offset="10248506">Their suppliers don't want sometimes to sell their products by these discount guys on Fifth Avenue who have fire sales or going out of business sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.460" offset="10308169">It seems to me that under the Court's existing reasoning in the earlier cases such as Sylvania and Monsanto, leave open to a supplier the right and the capacity so long as he doesn't do something to maintain retail prices at some level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.576" offset="10400643">If he makes the determination to go with somebody who doesn't charge the cheapest prices--</text>

            <text syncTime="3420.664" offset="13817041">I think we first of all need to be clear on the full instructions given by Judge Seals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.134" offset="13842850">If you read the instructions in their entirety, he made it clear to the jury that the jury had to find a conspiracy to eliminate price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.007" offset="13878377">And I'm quoting now from Joint Appendix 19, where the Judge said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.394" offset="13899902">"Sharp, on the other hand, contends that it terminated Business Electronics unilaterally, not as a result of any agreement or understanding with Hartwell, but because of Business Electronics' sales performance. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.917" offset="13938040">"If you find that Sharp did not terminate Business Electronics pursuant to an agreement or understanding with Hartwell to eliminate price cutting by business electronics, then you should answer, no, to question number one. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.724" offset="13989240">It's also important, to repeat, that sufficiency of the evidence supporting the finding of that agreement has never been contested on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.949" offset="14030200">We submit, Your Honors, that there should be the requirement of a further finding of some sort of direct agreement on price is mere surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.423" offset="14080042">What we have here is a form of pricing agreement, an agreement to stop price cutting can't be anything other than an agreement on price.</text>

            <text syncTime="3589.907" offset="14494031">It has to be a form of... there's no reason to have that purpose other than to eliminate price cutting.</text>
