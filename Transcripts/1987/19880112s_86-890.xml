            <text syncTime="7.891" offset="112469">This case comes to us from the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.792" offset="128038">It concerns an application for a warrant to search a corporation's premises for evidence of alleged crimes that were the subject of an ongoing state grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.220" offset="181746">I think that statement indicates that the issue is really one of abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.473" offset="198777">The District Court to the Federal District Courts said that it would abstain; the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case holding that there should be no abstention of equitable crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.968" offset="268681">In an opinion filed today, we affirm in part and vacate in part and remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.056" offset="293132">We hold that there is no longer a live controversy over whether the Federal Court may hear the respondent's claims for equitable relief and the abstention issue in this regard is therefore moot till those claims are to be dismissed with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.642" offset="359378">So far as the claims from monetary relief are concerned, we hold that even if a case here some years ago will called Younger against Harris required abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.921" offset="404518">The District Court had no discretion to dismiss rather than to stay those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.519" offset="430954">Justice White has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice O'Connor has joined.</text>
