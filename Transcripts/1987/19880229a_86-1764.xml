            <text syncTime="55.118" offset="354824">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.801" offset="369557">The issue before this Court is whether the Secretary of Health and Human Services can deny Medicare providers a hearing with respect to the amount of malpractice premium cost they are reimbursed under his regulations on the grounds that they followed those regulations when completing their cost reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.843" offset="441759">Petitioners Bethesda and Deaconess provided service to Medicare beneficiaries and should not be denied the right to challenge how those services are reimbursed simply because they followed the Secretary's regulations in completing their cost reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.774" offset="505498">After listing their malpractice premium costs in the cost report, Bethesda and Deaconess had three options available to them when the apportioned those costs between Medicare and non-Medicare patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.091" offset="558788">First option.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.483" offset="564326">They could do as they did and complete the cost report in accordance with the malpractice regulation and submit it to the intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.178" offset="595151">The Secretary that says compliance with his Regulation is not an acceptable option if one is to challenge that regulation before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.565" offset="632662">Second option.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.147" offset="639036">They could decline to follow the Secretary's regulation and apportion the cost contrary to regulation and submit it to the intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.132" offset="670906">The Secretary says through an informal policy that has been adopted that this is what they should have done if they wanted to challenge the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.279" offset="711552">Third option.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.160" offset="723046">They could apportion their malpractice premium costs in accordance with the regulation, submit the cost report to the intermediary with a cover letter indicating they wanted to challenge the malpractice regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.168" offset="775082">While this is not the process that the Secretary claims to be necessary for the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, which I'll refer to as the PRRB, to entertain such a challenge, he concedes that it is an available option.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.510" offset="840493">Now, the only difference between the first option, which is what we did, completing in accordance with the regulation and submitting it to the intermediary, and the third option, completing in accordance with the regulation and submitting with the cover letter indicating a general dissatisfaction or desire to challenge the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.212" offset="915203">I'd like to comment first on this second option, apportioning costs contrary to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.567" offset="948639">The Secretary contends such a requirement should be read into subparagraph (a)(1)(A) of subsection 139500.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.445" offset="988137">Now, there is a practical consideration here that has not been mentioned in the briefs, and that is by filing costs contrary to regulations, providers run a risk of the intermediary not accepting the cost report.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.815" offset="1045711">Subparagraphs (a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(C) provide that the intermediary cannot be required to render a final determination or forced to proceed with a final determination of the cost of the reimbursement due unless the cost reports comply with the Secretary's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.369" offset="1131915">And also with regard to the second option, no purpose is served by filing out of compliance with the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.406" offset="1172039">The intermediary cannot give relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.719" offset="1189279">The intermediary's bound by contract to audit the cost report and bring it into compliance with regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.785" offset="1221567">When the question is the substance of the regulation, the dispute is with the Secretary, not the intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.520" offset="1252496">Filing out of compliance does nothing more than create additional work for the intermediary who must now issue an audited adjustment and conform the cost report so that it complies with the regulations, redoing the calculations.</text>

            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="294.320" offset="1311637">I would assume though that the intermediary could reallocate the claimed costs under some other category that was permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.888" offset="1353955">If you claimed $15,000 for malpractice, it might find a way to give you $8,000 or $9,000 of those costs under some other category.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.415" offset="1396065">If we have something that's by definition a malpractice cost, then it must be allocated in accordance with the malpractice regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.031" offset="1430546">But aren't there cases where it's difficult to characterize costs, or there's some question as to their proper characterization?</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="334.569" stopTime="349.871">
            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="334.569" offset="1472656">Well, insofar as the rule is concerned, might not there be instances where how to characterize a cost is open to question and so it serves a purpose to submit the issue to the fiscal intermediary for its determination as to allocation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_c_homer" startTime="349.871" stopTime="536.952">
            <label>Mr. Leonard C. Homer</label>
            <text syncTime="349.871" offset="1533887">The fiscal intermediary is required and they spend about 300 hours on a medium to large hospital doing the audit of the cost report, and they are required to look at each and every cost and determine how it is to be allocated under the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.253" offset="1599402">There may be, as you indicate, an instance where that would be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.686" offset="1621136">Let me given an example of a different kind of instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.780" offset="1637541">Let's said that we made an error in the filing of the cost report and we made the error in the Government's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.175" offset="1667111">It would be the intermediary's job in that instance when they do the audit to issue an audit adjustment in the provider's favor, bringing that allocation into conformity with the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.613" offset="1720819">But it's not something where they take advantage of the mistakes in the Government's favor and then go forward with the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.867" offset="1745897">Let's go further and say the intermediary missed that and there's no intermediary action or audit adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.636" offset="1788946">Should the provider have a right to a hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="415.667" offset="1797097">And certainly they should.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.618" offset="1804829">Because the first time the provider gets to the Government agency with a complaint that they didn't get paid what they should have for their services is when they go to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.918" offset="1858119">The cost report stops with the intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.740" offset="1869404">It does not go on to the Agency unless it is appealed to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.015" offset="1890511">And I had mentioned, there is no purpose served by filing out of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.650" offset="1928963">And if, in this instance, the Secretary felt that there was a purpose, they wanted some early warning of an intent to challenge the regulation, in this particular case, these providers had already challenged that regulation in the Hadley litigation in the Tenth Circuit and had been told they had to go to the PRRB, only to be tripped up by this informal policy with regard to how the cost report is to be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.461" offset="2044215">With regard to the third option, that is, filing the cost report in accordance with regulation but attaching a cover letter saying you want to challenge the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.660" offset="2101057">This option serves no purpose at either the audit process level or at the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.767" offset="2137420">The cover letter is not a part of the cost report.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.980" offset="2154347">It does not generate any intermediary action and it generates no intermediary comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.134" offset="2178902">When the intermediary renders its final determination of total program reimbursement due, there is no substantive difference between what we did, filing in compliance with the regulation, and the third option that the Secretary has conceded will be a basis for jurisdiction, that is, filing in compliance and attaching a cover note saying, I would like to challenge the regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.449" offset="2364163">And they're not required to under the Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.291" offset="2371582">Subsection A of 139500 says you don't have to give the Secretary notice that you want to litigate until you get your final determination of reimbursement due.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.309" offset="2415676">And there's good reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.178" offset="2419124">If I'm happy with the amount I get, I may not choose to proceed with litigation over some regulation to get a few dollars more.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.997" offset="2650360">I would like to continue by clarifying a point that was made by Justice O'Connor and that is the fact that indeed we did ask for reimbursement of malpractice premium costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.476" offset="2700306">We entered those in the cost report and then apportioned them in accordance with the regulation requiring them to be apportioned in the manner we did, and then proceeded before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board to ask for a hearing once we got our notice of program reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.457" offset="2764254">Now, the Secretary claims that filing the cost report or entering costs in non-compliance with the regulation or out of conformity with the regulation is something required by subparagraph (a)(1)(A) of the Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.613" offset="2844816">He says that Bethesda and Deaconess forfeited their right to a hearing by following his regulations when they completed their cost report.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.499" offset="2880447">Now, subparagraph (a)(1)(A) of 139500 sets forth when providers have a right to proceed to a hearing before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.137" offset="2922974">It says that the provider may proceed to a hearing if, and I will quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="703.040" offset="2946589">"if the provider is dissatisfied with a final determination of its fiscal intermediary as to the amount of total program reimbursement do. "</text>
            <text syncTime="712.758" offset="2985459">The Secretary asks this Court to rewrite subparagraph (a)(1)(A) so that it reads,</text>
            <text syncTime="720.492" offset="3016388">"the provider may obtain a hearing only if dissatisfied with the intermediary's disallowance of costs entered in the cost report and then submitted to the intermediary. "</text>
            <text syncTime="732.333" offset="3063722">The foundation or core of the Secretary's argument that one must file contrary to regulation to generate the intermediary adjustment is his characterization of the cost reporting and audit process as an adjudicative process in which the intermediary is both adversary and tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.984" offset="3150344">However, if you'll keep in mind, the Secretary has conceded that a cover letter attached to a cost report that is filed in compliance with the regulation will suffice for jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.175" offset="3211053">And as I mentioned, the cover note is not part of the cost report.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.499" offset="3228398">It generates no intermediary action or comment when the final determination is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.932" offset="3250132">Indeed, it does not serve a single purpose advanced by the Secretary for this purported need for an adjudicative process during the audit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.761" offset="5649426">And his argument that we have to file contrary to the malpractice regulation, as I mentioned, runs specifically afoul of subparagraphs (a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(C) where he's saying on the one hand, we have to violate the regulation to get a right to challenge it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.558" offset="6108659">Despite petitioners' attempts to depict this case as one that turns on the procedural peculiarities of the Medicare reimbursement system, we think that the issue of statutory interpretation that's presented here is neither novel nor complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.218" offset="6167278">It's an issue that arises with some frequency in administrative law, which is whether claimant must exhaust its administrative remedies in order to preserve its claim for further review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.925" offset="6206148">Now, this Court and the lower Federal courts have held in a variety of contexts that where Congress has established a multi-tiered administrative process, a party must exhaust its administrative remedies in order to obtain further review of its claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.337" offset="6279709">I mean, the very term, exhaust administrative remedies, it means there's some administrator who can provide you relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.242" offset="6311369">But here the intermediary cannot provide you relief, so how can you possibly call that an administrative remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.589" offset="6348777">Well, Your Honor, we think that there are two questions presented in this case, and we rely by analogy the way the Court has interpreted other exhaustion requirements under other parts of the Social Security laws in cases like Southland and Ringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.259" offset="6403425">In those cases, the Court has really applied a two step process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.439" offset="6416173">The Court has first looked to see whether there is a general exhaustion requirement in a run of the mill case, a case in which the administrator can grant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.818" offset="6461626">And then it's looked to see whether the facts of the case before it in which the claimant is typically urging that exhaustion is not necessary merit an exception from that general principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.385" offset="6499973">And we think that's the proper way to analyze this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.568" offset="6508646">Petitioners focus on the fact that this case involves a reimbursement claim that rests on a challenge to a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.761" offset="6537485">But it's still a reimbursement claim, and there are a lot of cases raising this same issue in which there wasn't a challenge to a regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.436" offset="6632153">I think it is certainly true that the intermediary could not award the relief that they sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.792" offset="6661619">But in Ringer the Court specifically said that exhaustion may be required in a case where it appears to be futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.138" offset="6690981">For example, it may be that a provider frames its claim for reimbursement, the provider thinks that it depends on the invalidation of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.912" offset="6722014">Upon examination of the claim, it may turn out that reimbursement can be rewarded because the provider is under a misapprehension about the scope of the regulation, or because the reimbursement can be awarded under some other theory, or it may turn out that the claim is barred for some reason that the provider didn't recognize and so the challenge to the regulation is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.225" offset="6799337">And the Court recognized in Ringer that it is appropriate to have an administrative entity that can't rule on the precise claim look at those issues to apply its expertise to make sure that what is in-fact presented is a challenge to the statute that the administrative entity can't resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.909" offset="6878017">And I think those rationales are equally applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.339" offset="6931725">I mean, certainly the statute treats regulations differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.102" offset="6946772">In (a)(1)(B) and (C), it does make a special provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.162" offset="7051053">Now, the statute treats that kind of an issue quite differently from other issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.261" offset="7091490">We think the rules and regulations that those provisions are talking about are the rules and regulations dealing with the form and procedural requirements in preparing a cost report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.328" offset="7123673">We don't think it's a coincidence that this point is not discussed in the briefs or any of the appellate decisions raising the issue because we think it is simply a non... it doesn't have anything to do with the substantive disagreement about the cost rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.718" offset="7177276">It has to do with the procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.799" offset="7185635">And if a provider files a cost report applying a substantive cost rule or not following a substantive cost rule, we don't think that that provision applies and to our knowledge it hasn't ever been applied to throw out a cost report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.829" offset="7245717">And let me just go back to your question about why there should not be a difference for claims based on challenges to regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.999" offset="7306426">In addition to the reasons that I've already given, which is that in many cases what a provider thinks to be a challenge to a regulation may not be, we don't think there's any basis in the Statute for making that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.618" offset="7348848">And especially we look to subsection (F)(1) which is where Congress created an expedited judicial review remedy to deal specifically with cases resting on challenges to regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.458" offset="11500228">Let me turn back to the legislative history for a moment because I think that the legislative history really illuminates what Congress was trying to do when it created the PRRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.968" offset="11550279">As I was saying, the Board was created in response to complaints of providers who were dissatisfied with their intermediaries determinations, and more particularly dissatisfied with the fact that they had no where to contest the determinations that intermediaries made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.619" offset="11616839">And the legislative history is quite explicit that filled with those complaints and Congress made clear when it created the Board that it was doing so in response in order to create a forum for resolution of those disputed issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.111" offset="11682876">And we think the fact that Congress was focusing on that illuminates the dissatisfaction requirement and makes clear that what Congress was doing was creating a body designed to review disputed intermediary determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.802" offset="11741599">And in order for the determination to be disputed, it's got to be raised before the intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.454" offset="11760199">And let me just return one more time to the question of why exhaustion makes sense in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.719" offset="11921322">The cost reimbursement, I think the regulatory challenge in this case may be somewhat deceptive in terms of the way the Secretary's cost reimbursement regulations are written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.311" offset="11975657">In this case, the question is just what percentage of medical malpractice insurance costs are going to be allocated to the Medicare program and just reimbursable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.468" offset="12008257">In other cases, the Regulations may contain more flexible definitions of whether a cost is reimbursable, what the standard is for reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.425" offset="12048068">For example, the Secretary treats differently transactions between related entities, and the definition of whether an entity is related is of course there are standards set out in the regulations but those standards are somewhat flexible in application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.034" offset="12098537">And so it may, a providers claim is really always just a claim for reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.239" offset="12123405">And the fact that the provider places a particular label on the basis for its legal challenge to the claim may not be determinative of how the claim is resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.656" offset="12161022">So we think it is deceptive to say, this is a regulation challenge so we can put it in this box.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.354" offset="12199787">What this is really, is just a claim for more money, and the provider presumably will be happy to get the money on any basis that it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.437" offset="12224133">And frequently, the regulations that govern that question will have some flexibility in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.501" offset="12256421">And we think that the intermediary should be allowed to determine in the first instance, or given the opportunity to determine in the first instance, whether the regulation covers the particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.078" offset="12294664">And that way, the question as it goes to the Board will be illuminated, and perhaps the claim will be resolved without any need to resolve the challenge to the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.236" offset="12335311">Similarly, the intermediary may find that the particular regulation that the provider wants to challenge is inapplicable for some completely unrelated reason that the provider didn't realize or didn't want to bring to anyone's attention at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.946" offset="12386197">And we think because of the complexity of the situation, it's just not possible to pigeon-hole a claim as a regulation challenge claim and automatically give that some exemption from the exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.974" offset="12430292">These cost reimbursement issues are complex and we think that the better course is to allow exhaustion in all circumstances so that the intermediary which has expertise in dealing with the claim has the opportunity to winnow out those cases that actually don't involve challenges to regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.097" offset="12502808">And save the Board's time and the Court's time for challenges that actually do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.999" offset="12522347">Unless the Court has any further questions.</text>
