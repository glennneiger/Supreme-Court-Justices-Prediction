            <text syncTime="11.540" offset="177564">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.380" offset="184983">This case presents two questions of appealability of collateral final decisions to the Courts of Appeals under 28 USC 1291 which is the basic statute that provides for appeal from the district courts by right.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.458" offset="241303">The suit is a civil action between two Belgians.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.082" offset="255722">It was filed by the Respondent; a Brussels stockbroker for 20 years against the Petitioner, who was a Brussels real estate broker for 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.857" offset="290831">It was brought in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.940" offset="311206">The Petitioner was arrested in Switzerland at the request of the United States government while he was on a business trip to Geneva.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.527" offset="349554">He was then extradited to the United States pursuant to the extradition treaty of 1900 between this country and Switzerland.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.130" offset="379961">The charges against him were mail fraud and causing interstate transportation of a victim of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.096" offset="407860">And he was tried and convicted in the Central District of California on those charges, one count of each.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.430" offset="433146">The issue in the criminal case centered around what he knew, what his state of mind was during conversations that he had with Respondent, most of which took place in Belgium or Switzerland and that extended over a period of about three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.349" offset="488839">And that also included, as a jurisdictional basis for the criminal case, a three-day visit to Los Angeles during which the Respondent gave him a check for a loan to a real estate partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.878" offset="538994">After the conviction, Petitioner was placed on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.950" offset="559265">As a part of a sentence of the criminal court, the court ordered him to stay in the United States for the next five years or until he made satisfactory provision for payment of $34,000 as restitution of what the court held he owed to the Respondent, plus some additional money to another Belgian.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.953" offset="691236">What happened was the judge said at first that he had to stay in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.955" offset="711298">It was then modified and said he could stay anyplace in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.399" offset="729061">The Petitioner asked the judge later to modify the conditions of probation and the judge said that if an adequate arrangement could be made to provide security for the payment of all the amounts in the criminal case, not the civil case, the judge would... and if the government agreed that it was satisfactory, that he could return to Belgium.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.124" offset="819967">And, earlier this year, this is spelled out in the papers filed in this Court in the criminal case, he entered such a contract, and the government agreed he could return to Belgium.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.822" offset="930726">It demanded millions of dollars in travel and punitive damages for alleged violation of the U.S. civil RICOH statute and for various California laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.587" offset="969806">The Respondent later explained that he waited until after the trial to serve Petitioner and to quote Respondent:</text>
            <text syncTime="217.023" offset="999481">"Because of case authority questioning the validity of serving a defendant during a compelled appearance in a judicial proceeding. "</text>
            <text syncTime="224.776" offset="1030514">The Respondent claimed that handing the summons in California in the probation office was what created jurisdiction for the civil case based on personal service of process within that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.648" offset="1085998">The Petitioner was allowed to appear specially in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.049" offset="1103657">He moved to dismiss on several jurisdictional grounds, two of which were the subject of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.863" offset="1126854">The first ground was that he could not be called to answer in a civil suit that was based on personal service made on him while he was compelled to be in this country because of extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.020" offset="1171471">And he relied on U.S. extradition statutes, the extradition treaty with Switzerland and this Court's decision in 1886 in the United States v. Rauscher.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.608" offset="1221835">Rauscher held that an extradited person while here in the United States is immune from being required to defend in a criminal court except against the criminal charges for which he was extradited.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.548" offset="1273662">Rauscher didn't involve appealability; did it?</text>

            <text syncTime="290.741" offset="1294351">It actually came up prior to final judgment on a certificate of division between the two judges who were sitting in the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.687" offset="1322145">In fact, I don't believe at that time the criminal cases were appealable to the federal courts, if I'm not mistaken.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.462" offset="1365300">And then after Rauscher, within three or four years, the question came up in the lower courts of: What do you do with the Rauscher principle when there is a civil case and it was immediately held in the Southern District of New York in what became the leading case on the subject, In Re Reinitz, that the principle of Rauscher necessarily applied equally to a criminal prosecution or a civil case.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.126" offset="1515974">Immunity from having to defend a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.500" offset="1525482">And just to complete the status of the proceedings in the District Court, the other motion that was denied and that Petitioner appealed from was a motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.247" offset="1576369">And in support of that, he submitted affidavits showing that the courts in Brussels were open as indeed the Respondent conceded that most of the witnesses were Europeans, most of the documents were in foreign language, that Belgian business customs were involved and it didn't belong in a U.S. court and that he was... that the Petitioner was able at all times to have been sued in Belgium if the Respondent had wanted to sue him there.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.884" offset="1675007">Basically, the argument was that Los Angeles was not a convenient forum for a civil case for anybody except for the Respondent to try to come under the U.S. treble damage and punitive damage provisions of the peculiar U.S. civil RICOH law.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.314" offset="1736656">The District Court denied the motion without any argument and without any opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.398" offset="1761002">The Petitioner then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.160" offset="1772078">The Court of Appeals did not consider his claim of immunity or his claim of forum non conveniens, and instead it dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.657" offset="1810008">The issue before this Court is whether a district court order that denies an extradited person's claim of immunity from civil process and denies a documented and uncontroverted showing of forum non conveniens is an appealable collateral final decision under the doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Loan, Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, and Mitchell v. Forsyth.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.392" offset="1904989">With your permission, I will address the first part of my argument to the immunity claim and the second part to forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.116" offset="1935918">The forum non conveniens case, we will submit, comes within the familiar three tests of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Cohen and reiterated in many others.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.461" offset="6169322">And venue really is not what is at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.963" offset="6187295">As a technical matter, I think that the forum non conveniens issue really focuses around the second of the Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Cohen tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.812" offset="6246645">The question whether it is enmeshed in the merits and therefore should not be viewed as a final collateral decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.358" offset="6280813">Judge Wilke talked about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.152" offset="6296068">The cases, even from some of the circuits which have feeling under the compulsion of Coopers held that these orders are not appealable, the cases have made clear in the Second Circuit and in the Fifth Circuit that a forum non conveniens determination does not require or involve getting deeply into the issues of the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.305" offset="6388646">You simply have a few affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.947" offset="6399200">The affidavits will plainly or not plainly show whether this is a convenient forum in which to hold the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.283" offset="6436607">The issue is collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.084" offset="6443817">It doesn't bog the reviewing court down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.647" offset="6458028">And, indeed, the Fifth Circuit, which has held that under the compulsion of its reading of this Court's cases, it cannot hear forum non conveniens cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.204" offset="6496271">The Fifth Circuit has practically begged the district judges in that circuit to certify such issues to the Court of Appeals so that they can be decided without having the waste of going through an unnecessary trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.520" offset="6549561">There is only one reported case in which a forum non conveniens denial has ever lead to a reversal after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.099" offset="6595850">So, the only time that you can, as a practical matter, enforce this protection, and keep cases out of the U.S. courts that do not belong there, is to do so... is to do so before trial or never.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.759" offset="6654468">It is a pre-trial motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.782" offset="6662514">It is always decided pre-trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.051" offset="6671605">And that is when it should be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.872" offset="6678919">With the Court's permission, I will reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="1644.559" offset="6709639">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.239" offset="6724372">The Petitioner in this case was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced in the United States District Court for the Central District of California for, among other things, transporting the Respondent to Los Angeles for the purpose of defrauding him out of a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.403" offset="6801068">He was also convicted of the substantive offense of wire fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.875" offset="6818935">That conviction was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit and certiorari has been denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.358" offset="6836908">This case that is presently before you is the civil aftermath of that criminal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.272" offset="6860522">The legal questions presented, although as has been mentioned, they have a few nuances to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.247" offset="6888421">Basically, what they asked this Court to hold is that motions based on lack of jurisdiction, motions challenging venue, when they are denied, they are immediately appealed under the collateral order doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.415" offset="6941084">Now, he says he does not want a ruling that broad, but that is the practical effect of what he is asking you to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.280" offset="6964594">And I suggest that that type of a ruling, if it comes from this Court, has substantial implications for our justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.744" offset="6998449">It will further open the doors to interlocutory appeals and will overburden the already overtaxed appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.040" offset="7031572">Now, this is really a frontal assault on the final judgment rule, in my view, Section 1291 of Title 28, which is in reality the cornerstone of appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.688" offset="7082145">The final judgment rule goes back to the first Judiciary Act and has a number of salutary purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.185" offset="7112134">One of which is that it of course prevents repetitive piecemeal appeals of what is in essence a single lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.368" offset="7140868">It allows review after the case so that claims of error can be put in their proper perspective to determine not only if they were in fact erroneous, but if they were prejudicially so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.195" offset="7188202">It recognizes the critical role of the trial judge in our system, as Justice Marshall mentioned in the Firestone case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.651" offset="7218086">It prevents the appellate court from looking over his shoulder at every turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.666" offset="7242119">It makes the appellate court appropriately a reviewing court and not an intervening court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.178" offset="7268137">And, finally and practically, it avoids appeals in a large number of cases which are either settled or eventually won by the party who was originally aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.059" offset="7323621">And since 80 to 90 percent of our cases are eventually settled, it is obvious how the final judgment rule helps to relieve the burden on the appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.943" offset="7363223">Of course, there are exceptions to the final judgment rule some of which come from Congress, such as Section 1292(b), the Interlocutory Appeals Act, Section 1651 which is the Extraordinary Writs Act providing for mandamus, Section 1292(a)(1), injunction cases, and this Court's Rule 54(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.439" offset="7457159">But, generally, the price we pay for the administration of justice in our federal system in this country is that we await the final judgment before we take our complaints about the way the proceedings were conducted to the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.738" offset="7510344">Now, in 1949, in the Cohen case, of course, this Court carved out what it called a narrow exception to the finality requirement to be applied in a small class of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.856" offset="7562903">And that is the Cohen v. Industrial Beneficial case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.000" offset="7579412">And there were three requirements set out by the Court in Cohen and reiterated by Justice Stevens in his opinion in Coopers &amp; Lybrand just 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.326" offset="7616715">The first, in order for an interlocutory order to be appealable as a collateral order, it must first conclusively determine the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.654" offset="7658093">Secondly, it must involve an important issue that is completely separate from the merits; and, thirdly, the order must be effectively unreviewable after final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.252" offset="7712428">Now, in the last decade or so since Coopers &amp; Lybrand this Court has grappled with the collateral order doctrine on a number of occasions and has consistently said that it should be applied with the utmost strictness and the exception should be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.295" offset="7792571">And, thus, cases such as Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Firestone, United States v. MacDonald, and Flanagan, and Richardson-Merrell, in addition to Justice Powell's opinion in Stringfellow and the opinion in Hollywood Motor Car Company of all refuse to expand the collateral order doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.687" offset="7874178">And when read against the context of Abney, which involved double jeopardy, and Mitchell and Nixon, which involved immunity, the rule that comes out of this whole series of cases is that as far as item 3 of the Cohen formulation is concerned, namely, effective unreviewability, what that really means is that what is at stake in order to justify a collateral order appeal must be indeed the right not to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.592" offset="8021822">Any other right, the Court has held, can be vindicated after final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.868" offset="8050870">Now, let me turn to the forum non conveniens motion here against that background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.342" offset="8080754">Forum non conveniens as has been mentioned is a venue-based objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.876" offset="8102906">We believe that it fails the collateral order doctrine because it does not pass either the second or the third test of the Cohen or Coopers &amp; Lybrand criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.444" offset="8153166">In Gulf Oil v. Gilbert and Piper v. Reyno, this Court set up the elements of a forum non conveniens termination, particularly as regards the private factors to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.504" offset="8217427">The Court in weighing the forum non conveniens motion must look at the access to sources of proof and the availability of witnesses and must also make some practical determinations about the problems associated with the case that might make the trial easy, convenient, and expeditious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.407" offset="8301019">Now, in a forum non conveniens setting, we suggest that this kind of analysis, necessarily, requires the Court to delve into the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.897" offset="8355040">And, therefore, we believe that the issue of forum non conveniens is not completely separate from the merits within the meaning of the Cohen doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.623" offset="8397881">It is in effect a discretionary ruling by the trial court based on speculation at the outset of a case as to whether the forum will indeed be inconvenient and if inconvenient, whether it will be prejudicially so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.856" offset="8462873">And I guess it is not surprising that six of the seven circuits that have ruled on the precise issue that is before you today have held that forum non conveniens does not meet the collateral order requirements because it is, among other things, not completely separate from the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.908" offset="8551063">Now, counsel has referred to the fact that there is split in the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.931" offset="8571125">The only circuit that has gone the other way is the Fourth Circuit and it did so without any elaboration of its reasoning, whatsoever, in a footnote to an opinion after it had decided the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.020" offset="8619504">And all the court said was,</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.321" offset="8624728">"we find that the Cohen criteria have been met. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.633" offset="8637998">The other circuits have engaged in a fairly elaborate analysis of the issue and have determined not only, for the most part, that forum non conveniens does not meet the second criterion of Coopers and Cohen, but that it does not meet the third, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.695" offset="8714171">Now, as regards the third Cohen element and forum non conveniens, there really isn't any reason why this issue is not reviewable at the end of the case like any other venue motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.904" offset="8767043">From his brief and from his argument here today, I gather that counsel's strongest point on that issue is that it doesn't very often result in reversal after final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.454" offset="8833290">Well, this Court has been approached with that argument before in Stringfellow and Firestone and Richardson-Merrell, and has said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.504" offset="8877489">"That may well be, but that is true of a lot of pre-trial orders and that goes more to the difficulty of showing prejudicial error after final judgment than to the question of whether the order ought to be appealable before trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.582" offset="8933809">It also raises the question in my mind that if that is true, is forum non conveniens objection that important?</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.887" offset="8974978">Because if it never results in reversal, how important can it be?</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.931" offset="8991174">And, indeed, in spite of his empirical study which he has in his brief, it is recognized that the Fifth Circuit very recently in the Gonzales did, in fact, reverse a final judgment based on forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.374" offset="9072885">So, obviously, forum non conveniens does not involve the right not to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.649" offset="9098067">And, therefore, it fails the third Cohen element as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.322" offset="9116771">With regard to what has been labeled "immunity" by the Petitioner, which really results from his extradition status in this country, obviously, the label "immunity" is appended to that status in order to avail himself of the holding of Nixon and Mitchell which dealt with true immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.170" offset="9236098">That is the right not to undergo trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.253" offset="9244457">But this is not of that kind, obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.445" offset="9261175">This is in effect a claim of defective service or a claim of lack of personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.099" offset="9287820">Whether it is really immunity or not immunity isn't the issue, I don't think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.924" offset="9319167">The issue is whether it passes the Cohen land Coopers &amp; Lybrand tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.557" offset="9341633">And, again, we suggest that it does not for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.042" offset="9367651">First of all, I question again whether this is the kind of important right that Cohen was designed to make collaterally appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.602" offset="9421881">That doesn't just mean important to Mr. Van Cauwenberghe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.635" offset="9441943">That means according to the commentators that the issue must be settled by this appeal not just for the Petitioner, but for many others similarly situated.</text>
