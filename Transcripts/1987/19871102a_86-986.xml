            <text syncTime="19.895" offset="213014">This case involves a review of two major holdings of the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.965" offset="241330">The first that Michigan Act 144, which regulates the securities of utilities and natural gas companies, is implicitly preempted by the Natural Gas Act because Congress had the purpose to deregulate securities of natural gas companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.462" offset="323250">Secondly, for the opposite purpose that FERC was sufficiently regulating securities under its Section 7 certificate powers and thirdly because of what the Court viewed as an imminent possibility of conflict between Michigan Act 144 Securities Regulation and the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.459" offset="411231">In addition, the Court of Appeals found that Michigan Act 144 represented an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce on all tests, the per se of discrimination test, the balancing test of Pike v. Bruce Church and also on the basis of a need for national uniformity with respect to Securities regulation of natural gas companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.674" offset="504122">In reaching these holdings, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals failed to follow this Court's preemption test, and failed to follow Congressional intent in the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.834" offset="560756">Congress, in the Natural Gas Act, did not occupy the whole field of natural gas regulation, it did not speak to Securities regulation whatsoever, it did not preempt the States from regulating securities by its silence in the NGA regarding this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.145" offset="634003">This Court has held extensively in Panhandle Eastern that the purpose of the NGA was to close regulatory gaps brought about by the prior decisions of this Court in a specific area, interstate transportation of gas and sales for resales.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.174" offset="4526144">In 1981, ANR, the parent company, owned Michigan Consolidated Gas, which was a local utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.363" offset="4558849">The Michigan Public Service Commission, throughout its existence and in more recent years, has promoted in Michigan the development of vast natural gas storage fields which are huge caverns thousands of feet below where the gas can be stored in natural sea beds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.799" offset="4680684">Many of these fields were developed and MichCon had its transmission lines to these wholly-in-State facilities, and MichCon had its lines between one part of its service area in Detroit and another part of its service territory in northern Michigan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1194.920" offset="4913174">It would have to pay ANR for that right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.940" offset="6061203">Well, the Michigan Commission does get involved in safety by assisting FERC as the eyes and ears of FERC with respect to safety requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.696" offset="6092237">But we're looking at a way to prevent over capitalizations or the assets being over collateralized so that they would be neglected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.088" offset="6137794">But there's another purpose, also, and that is that in the gas business, interstate transportation, when it goes from storage to customers, let's say in Montana, is done by displacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.098" offset="6201846">So what occurs is that this gas is stored in the center of Michigan, the storage company transports it to 24 miles to an interstate pipeline which does the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.671" offset="6252106">Storage has no interstate transportation, it doesn't sell any gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.207" offset="6266317">It doesn't have any transportation tariffs to be approved by FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.325" offset="6278751">Gas molecules actually are used in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.713" offset="6296305">They are part of the reliability of supply in Michigan, but the storage company delivers it to Michigan located interstate transportation which sells the molecules in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.223" offset="6350326">And on the other end of its system in Montana, it gives an accounting credit to that person over there, and gives them the molecules over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.578" offset="6387734">So theoretically and conceptually, yes, there's interstate transportation if you go right from the beginning, right to Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.248" offset="6418454">But it isn't done by ANR Storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.184" offset="6426186">It's done by an interstate company that FERC does regulate in terms of interstate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.604" offset="6451890">Storage company's wholly in Michigan, the gas properties are in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.758" offset="6472475">It does have an importance to supply even in Michigan because the displacement is basically an accounting type exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.979" offset="6501314">And so if there's a failure of those facilities, it will affect Michigan not only in the viability of the facilities, but with respect to supply applications in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.071" offset="6553768">So in conclusion, Your Honors, we have a vast area of regulation over here and over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.581" offset="6611760">The respondents have said there's potential conflict, only a possibility of conflict in this narrow area about Section 7 certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.502" offset="6643420">We see there isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.787" offset="6648645">But why deregulate securities with respect to all the rest of this area when there has been no actual conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.627" offset="6687933">There is nothing in this record about any actual conflict in the 50 years that the NGA and the Act has survived together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.898" offset="6717086">This is a facial attack, and Congress did not occupy the field of securities regulation it intended the States to continue to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.790" offset="6764628">And it's not a burden on interstate commerce because we are focusing totally on Michigan's interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.302" offset="7066604">Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.568" offset="7075695">None of those 33 States regulate interstate pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.622" offset="7091890">Those 33 States were local distribution companies they were regulating, the local distribution company that also had some high pressure pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.876" offset="7124909">The concern of the States at the 1950 legislative amendment proposal... might as well straighten this one out the concern of the States was so broad, the FPC proposal was so broad that it brought under proposed FPC preissuance security regulation local distribution companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.921" offset="7201082">The States came screaming in and said, oh, no, we traditionally regulate the local distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.241" offset="7222398">We traditionally do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.324" offset="7230757">It's these interstate pipelines like ANR that we don't regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.645" offset="7244028">And as to what FPC does with that, that's their business, but for heaven's sakes, don't touch these local distribution companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.930" offset="7265135">So the FPC comes along, and it says, well, we'll amend our proposal, we'll amend our proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.501" offset="7287495">We'll ask for this preissuance authority, this additional regulatory technique only for those companies and those operations that the States cannot reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.611" offset="7339845">Now, just to nail that down, let me give you two sentences out of that hearing where Commissioner Smith made it very plain that his proposed amended legislative proposal was not going to impair the State regulation of those gas companies that are essentially local, meaning, do local distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.155" offset="7414033">But here's an example of a company that's clearly beyond the reach of the States as to securities matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.309" offset="7438692">The Commonwealth of Massachusetts regulating the securities of a pipeline operating at wholesale within the State of Massachusetts but carrying gas from Texas to Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.915" offset="7477144">They can't do that, and the States right proponents says, if that's the question, it cannot, we concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.819" offset="7504730">And of course you have to concede that, because can anybody who... take 1925, when the Missouri v. Kansas Gas was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.460" offset="7551332">Can anybody believe that these States could have regulated any aspect, securities or anything else, of these interstate pipelines when this Court held that these lines were "beyond State interference" or beyond the reach of State regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.719" offset="7616325">Now, the Attleboro case which was electrics is a very different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.087" offset="7633775">Justice Brandeis dissented in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.706" offset="7640253">It was a more localized problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.039" offset="7645582">Even there, the Court at that time said the States couldn't touch it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.991" offset="7661360">That case is different, it's electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.479" offset="7675361">Congress in regulating interstate electric power provided expressly provided that States could regulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.048" offset="7705664">That's a delegation of the States that Congress could have made when it broke its silence, it did make in the case of the interstate electrics, because after all, they're very localized really little grids around a few States, and they sharply distinguished that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.808" offset="7768671">And instead of delegating to the States, they created a comprehensive Federal regulatory system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.331" offset="7794793">And as far as we know, Michigan is the only State that an interstate gas pipeline of this character has any problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.835" offset="7824782">We serve Wisconsin almost as much as Michigan, and we have no such problem with Wisconsin, although they have a regulatory statute that permits a preissuance approval of securities as to utilities in Wisconsin, but it doesn't apply to this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.911" offset="7885073">Now, the premise of this argument of Michigan is that somehow financing and securities are unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.302" offset="7926659">That there's some big gap that has to be filled here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.004" offset="7937422">And I'd like to show the Court that that gap doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.325" offset="7962708">And it's a combination of regulatory tools, the first of which is the certification power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.693" offset="7980263">In order to have a project you're going to finance, you have to go to the FPC, FERC now, get a certificate of public convenience and necessity before you can finance it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.399" offset="8019028">For example, we want to build a pipeline extension in Wisconsin, say a $75 million one, and we have to go to FERC and get a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.940" offset="8061242">And while we're there, because Congress made it very express that Congress was speaking to securities regulation, in 1942, Congress expressly authorized FERC to condition its approval of certificates and to modify the financing as the public interest might demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.335" offset="8130833">So we go down to the FERC and we say, all right, its going to not only cost $75 million but we're going to raise $25 million through equity and we're going to have a $50 million bond issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.460" offset="8175241">That's the way, that's our financing plan, and we get the certificate, and this certificate power along with the rate power is described by this Court as the heart of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2191.821" offset="8900713">The Public Utility Holding Company Act, when the company is subject to it, did deal with those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.911" offset="8929135">It's true that somebody, either Congress or the States, has a highly legitimate interest in worrying about over leveraging, over capitalization, all the evils, all the financial evils of the Insull era.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.052" offset="8981693">And here's how it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.837" offset="8988798">As to the certification power, the FERC looks at the initial financing proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.241" offset="9014398">As to the rate making power, the debt equity ratio is a crucial part of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.144" offset="9038013">Now, it is true that it is only rare that the FERC exercises that power to grant rates that impute a different capital structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.750" offset="9068419">And the reason it's rate is that FERC has made its standards so widely known that you don't dare go otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.154" offset="9094019">You're not going to finance it in a way you know is going to get in trouble with FERC so you always keep within a reasonable bounds because FERC makes you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.392" offset="9122963">That takes care of over leveraging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.844" offset="9128815">Now, over capitalization which, if you read the Michigan Supreme Court decisions, you'd think is the principal evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.831" offset="9152743">Just what is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.498" offset="9159430">And the Michigan Supreme Court correctly defines over capitalization as did counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.985" offset="9181373">It's a lack of correlation between the debt and equity on the liability side with the amount or value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.523" offset="9219512">That's the problem, lack of correlation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.559" offset="9231633">Used to call it watered stock, same problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.927" offset="9245112">That cannot happen under a FERC regulated company, and the reason is, apart from certification, apart from rate making, FERC regulates the accounting, and if there's anyone in this world it was Charlie Smith, the head of the Bureau of Accounts of the FPC, who was the most vigilant original cost proponent and insisted on original cost accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.709" offset="9344273">So the assets all have to be at original cost net and the liabilities debt and equity has to balance and there cannot be over capitalization on a FERC regulated company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.684" offset="9392233">It cannot happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.302" offset="9402682">Now, there's one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.985" offset="9409370">They say, what if there were financial ruin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.004" offset="9417415">Well, if there's financial ruin, there's something wrong at FERC because one of their duties is not only to protect rate payers but to have a financially healthy entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.276" offset="9458584">But if something goes wrong and there is financial trouble, you have to go to FERC to get an abandonment order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.196" offset="9490245">You can't just stop serving people in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.965" offset="9497350">You have to go to FERC to abandon service no matter what your financial situation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.267" offset="9514486">So in all elements, FERC regulates these securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.071" offset="9533713">Here's where the problem comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.454" offset="9539250">The problem comes in after you get a FERC certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.241" offset="9558372">And here you are, you've told them you're going to raise $50 million in bonds to finance this FERC certificated project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.913" offset="9593063">Now, what do you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.597" offset="9599855">You go to your investment banker in New York, and they advise you on timing and placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.917" offset="9621066">As far as placement's concerned, it could be domestic, it could be a Eurobond deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.555" offset="9643636">Our last offering was a $50 million equivalent of Swiss francs, not registered, so nobody in this country could buy it, Michigan or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.446" offset="9683237">Nobody could buy it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.479" offset="9687313">And then the other problem whether it's domestic or foreign is the timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.932" offset="9709151">The timing is everything in financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.468" offset="9719286">You go to these investment bankers and they say, oh, wait a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.170" offset="9730153">Hold up a month or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.136" offset="9734019">We think interest rates are going up, and you'll save a couple of basis points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.705" offset="9744259">Or, get it our right away, we think interest rates are going up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.424" offset="9759097">And the timing is everything in this, and that's exactly where this Michigan statute intrudes on the Federal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.930" offset="9789190">Because Michigan says, you've got to come trotting in with your $50 million proposal to issue securities to finance a FERC certificated project.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.555" offset="10259708">It's the divestiture of Michigan Consolidated by ANR, the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.673" offset="10276113">Now, bear in mind, there's two quite separate sets of securities here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.844" offset="10296801">One set has to do with the divestiture and at record 118 and 123, the Michigan Commission wanted to investigate that, and they got out orders to investigate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.532" offset="10339538">The orders were directed at MichCon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.084" offset="10345807">That's the company the regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.003" offset="10353435">They were directed at MichCon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.770" offset="10360540">They asked ANR to come along and participate, and we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.538" offset="10371616">But the orders were directed at MichCon and properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.657" offset="10384050">Now, over here in a totally unrelated transaction, FERC had issued certificates to enable Storage to expand its storage facilities and pipelines, $105 million, some such amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.369" offset="10450924">In order to get the underwriter's counsel to go along with it, they had to either get a Court order saying this Michigan Statute didn't apply, or go get an order proving these securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2647.279" offset="10722597">I'm saying that this example they give of how wonderful it was for Michigan proves the point that they use it for unrelated purposes, they hold hostage these securities necessary to finance a FERC authorized project, and they'll hold it up until they get what they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.121" offset="10785918">You'll find that the record stipulates that the way we got the certificate for storage was by settling the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.561" offset="10823639">And November 24, 1981, happens to be the date we made our deal with the State and happens to be the date that they let this security out of hostage and approved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.750" offset="10860419">It was part of that deal and it was putting leverage on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.904" offset="10873063">Now, let's look on the facial part of this Statute to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.023" offset="10885497">We have a stipulation in the record of what this statute means to Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.808" offset="10900648">And the stipulation at record page 60 says that, even without regulatory authority that they have all over these other local utilities, the Michigan Commission can still exert influence over pipeline and storage if it has the right to regulate the security issuances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.786" offset="10976612">They can still exert influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.988" offset="10985389">That's what this is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.254" offset="10990509">Now, let me give you an example of what they have in mind for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.125" offset="11009944">And in their brief at page 5, note 3, they tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.279" offset="11030529">They tell you that what they're interested in here, and why they want this statute, and bear in mind the club in the closet routine,--</text>

            <text syncTime="2771.527" offset="11219551">And this is what they say in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.493" offset="11223417">They want this Statute because it provides an opportunity for the Michigan Commission to assure that ANR does not violate the divestiture settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.532" offset="11259570">Now, the divestiture settlements they're talking about are the same settlements... and I was going to say, blackjacked out of us... but I'll honor the nomenclature they now use... these are the same settlements they clubbed out of us before, and how instead of enforcing those settlements which are agreements, actual signed agreements, instead of enforcing those agreements the old fashioned way by going to court to sue on the contract, they want this club to hit us over the head to make sure we honor whatever interpretation they want to place on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.933" offset="11365210">That's what this case is about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.170" offset="11386108">But they've got so used to using it on us, they want to keep it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.525" offset="11419544">Maybe we showed the wounds too badly but with or without these examples, past and future, this is a plain flat out violation of the Commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.333" offset="11474819">Now, we cited not only the 1925 cases but the case last year in Brown-Forman and there's a two-tiered test and this doesn't make it past tier one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.825" offset="11516720">Because, as the Court said, it's a violation, you can't require a company to seek regulatory approval in one State before undertaking a transaction in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.366" offset="11558934">You can't make us go to Michigan to get approval to finance securities to build something in the Gulf.</text>

            <text syncTime="2904.929" offset="11753180">They cite in their reply brief from the Michigan Supreme Court saying that securities regulation serves the interest of the rate payers in assuring continued service and in receiving that service at reasonable rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.535" offset="11883584">We have raised both points.</text>

            <text syncTime="2943.388" offset="11906989">But as to the Commerce Clause, we think there's no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.308" offset="11930708">As I said, the over capitalization theme which the Michigan Courts and counsel stress, that cannot happen under FERC regulations, and interests of investors is totally taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.498" offset="11971459">So the Commerce Clause test and the so-called preemption test really somewhat overlap in this area because of the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.706" offset="12008240">It was so clear from the Missouri v. Kansas Gas and related decisions that in 1938 by the time Congress go around to breaking its silence, it was so clear that the States could not interfere, the power of regulation could not reach these kind of companies, that Congress came in and they occupied the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.619" offset="12091936">This is not a preemption case like Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator where the States had long been traditionally regulating grain elevators since Mond v. Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.825" offset="12136762">All of a sudden Congress comes in in that case with a non-comprehensive statute, Warehouse Act, and the question is whether they had preempted longstanding State regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.068" offset="12185768">This is not what this is about at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.668" offset="12192142">The purpose of this Statute, as this Court has said a dozen times, is to occupy the field in which the Supreme Court has held the States may not act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.940" offset="12229236">And that's clearly this company and this field and this activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.160" offset="12250134">And having occupied the field, having decided to in that comprehensive regulation instead of just delegating it to the States and staying silent, its all occupied by the FERC authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.872" offset="12316903">Now, this preissuance approval, as I said, is just one regulatory tool of many.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.693" offset="12340204">And when the Statute I mentioned earlier, the FPC proposal, had been narrowed down to whether the FERC should be given this added power, the focusing on that issue, the parties came in, the industry came in and said, who needs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.203" offset="12406241">They don't need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.405" offset="12411048">They've got plenty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.955" offset="12413242">They've got certification, they've got regulation of rates, they've got the accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.657" offset="12428080">Who needs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.190" offset="12430170">And Congress didn't act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.025" offset="12437588">It was perfectly obvious they weren't persuaded that FERC needed this additional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.810" offset="12452635">But whether they thought they did or not, Congress had occupied the field that this Court had said the States could not enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.166" offset="12486072">The Court had drawn a bright line as the Court has put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.785" offset="12500596">Congress occupied the field from a bright line that the States couldn't occupy and Congress occupied this field and therefore it's preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.438" offset="12527241">Now, bear in mind while this is a facial attack on this Statute, it has no affect, no affect on the application of this Statute to the local distribution companies as to which the States always could act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.162" offset="12578127">This case has nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.281" offset="12586591">It only applies to this one State and applies to ANR which doesn't to any end user business in Michigan and is about as clear and clean and purely exclusively an interstate company as you'll ever find.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.413" offset="13187094">Your Honor, this is a facial attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.632" offset="13204021">There has been no problem with Michigan's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.650" offset="13212067">We are at a disadvantage to argue from a record that doesn't exist with respect to either interstate commerce or preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.089" offset="13245817">The burden of proof is on Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.689" offset="13252191">We have no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.722" offset="13256370">Secondly, look at Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.557" offset="13267655">That takes care of Your Honor's rate question because in that we have an analogous situation where this Court preserved the securities regulation even though the Federal Government took over all other aspects including rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.717" offset="13320318">And it found the purposes that the State could continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.019" offset="13337559">Interstate Commerce, there's no discriminatory affect, no discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.323" offset="13362741">The Congress itself has recognized that uniformity's not necessary with securities regulation over interstate utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.929" offset="13397118">It has done so in Federal Power Act 204.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.730" offset="13408403">How are you going to distinguish in any rational sense interstate natural gas companies from interstate electric companies when those two Acts grew out of the same purpose, the same history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.355" offset="13446855">And this Court has interchangeably interpreted both Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.974" offset="13461379">Congress when it passed the Natural Gas Act displayed a willingness to allow the States to regulate securities because it provided for no preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.580" offset="13499727">You don't have preemption by silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.865" offset="13508922">And Congress recognized that the States could regulate securities, uniformity was not required.</text>
