            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="61.031" offset="372365">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.141" offset="388770">In this case the Plaintiff Respondents were terminated from the Social Security disability roles and subsequently their disability benefits were restored either through the appeals process or by new application, and they were restored retroactively either through the appeals process or in compliance with the 1984 Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.635" offset="522726">Separately, they brought this Bivens action against the Secretary of Health and Human Services; the Commission of Social Security; and the head of the state agency charging that their due process rights, their constitutional rights, had been violated in that those three individuals had caused them to be subject to advertently inaccurate and legally unwarranted determination which resulted in the loss of their benefits in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.964" offset="692104">Our contention is that whether or not there was a due process violation here, and whether or not ultimately the three individual defendants are found to be qualifiedly immune, this cause of action is precluded for three reasons: it is precluded by the statute itself; it is precluded because the statute occupies the field and is a comprehensive scheme so-occupying the field; and it is precluded because there are here special factors counselling hesitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.080" offset="856571">Taking the statutory preclusion first, 405(g) provides an unusually capacious system for raising any kind of claim, statutory or constitutional, and allows a wide variety of relief: class action relief; injunctive relief, and allows constitutional as well as statutory claims to be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.723" offset="1003066">405(h) says that this scheme is to be the exclusive scheme for raising issues regarding social security benefits, and the third sentence, the second sentence... one might say, says what you must do... which is to have recourse to 405(g) scheme; and the third sentence, what you may not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.231" offset="1113198">What you may not do is try an end-run around the 405(g) scheme by having recourse to Section 1331 General Federal Question jurisdiction, which is precisely what the Respondents did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.304" offset="1193446">The second reason that this cause of action is precluded is that there is here an unusually comprehensive and complex scheme, which over... which occupies the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.487" offset="1262200">And it's a scheme which is not only complex, but is continuously fine-tuned by Congress, so that Congress has, as it were, not only laterally, but over time, occupied this field, so that it quite inappropriate to overlay that scheme with a personal action for damages against high government officials out of their own pockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.424" offset="1361884">And finally, there are special factors counselling, hesitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.258" offset="1385289">Now, these three bases for preclusion are each of them in our view quite sufficient to dispose of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.126" offset="1428757">But in fact they converge and work together.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.278" offset="1441296">The 405(g) and (h) scheme precludes a Bivens action here because the scheme is so comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.717" offset="1491137">And the scheme is so comprehensive because of the special factors which counsel hesitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.694" offset="1523007">Congress was surely aware how contentious it was to deal with and to take away or to deny social security benefits, and the numbers of cases in which these contentious issues would arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.546" offset="1598448">So these three reasons are separately, but they work together jointly as well, and together they make quite clear that this is not a case in which the Bivens action is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.627" offset="1658739">I would suggest that after a certain amount of oscillation, this Court came to rest in Bush v. Lucas on the proper role of the Bivens action.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.126" offset="1720701">There were two extreme poles in which the argument proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.402" offset="1749854">One pole would have had... and no member of this Court I believe ever took up a position there... one pole would have said that there must be constitutional damages where there is a constitutional right, and that damages are specified by the Constitution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.615" offset="1834700">That would make every constitutional clause carry with it a constitutional damage remedy in the way that this Court in the First English case last term, said that the 'just compensation</text>
            <text syncTime="442.015" offset="1896244">"clause is a constitutionally-mandated damage remedy. "</text>
            <text syncTime="447.500" offset="1918187">The other way, the opposite pole, was taken up by Justice Black in his dissent in Bivens, which said, 'only if the Congress has specifically authorized the Court to grant a damage remedy, should there be one.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.049" offset="1980463">Where Bush v. Lucas came to rest is to see that there is here an interpretive partnership between the Court and Congress, a partnership which, in the end, should leave the area of law with a scheme that makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.962" offset="2056114">But it is a partnership in which Congress is necessarily the senior partner; it is the senior partner because it's been recognized that Congress can preclude a damage remedy; and Congress can act in such a way... and this is where I think Bush contributed, can act in such a way that it no longer makes sense to imply that damage remedy which otherwise the Court under 1331 would have the power to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.011" offset="2176277">Now, this case seems to us to be just like Bush.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.943" offset="2196026">There is one and only one point of departure, and that is the obvious fact that persons who are terminated from social security benefits are often likely to suffer greater hardship than those who have been fired from federal jobs.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.767" offset="2327265">We have set out in our brief the finding from the Senate Report explaining why those initial determinations are likely to have been upset.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.054" offset="2368434">New evidence comes in at later stages; the ALJ stage is the first stage at which there is a personal confrontation with a decisionmaker, so I don't think it would be appropriate to lay all the incorrect decisions at the door of callousness or malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.118" offset="2452653">The hardship is greater, but it is a kind of hardship which this Court specifically confronted in Mathews v. Eldridge, and there held that post-termination restoration of benefits were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.555" offset="2542409">Working in the opposite direction, this case seems to us clearer than Bush, because the fine tuning which Congress has engaged in, is a fine tuning which has occurred frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.697" offset="2615030">Congress has revisited this problem time and time again, and has in fact addressed many of the complaints which are raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.327" offset="2661528">And most importantly, unlike Bush, the constitutional violations, if they occur, occur in the course of an administrative, adjudicative process, such that the process itself carries with it a means for redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.070" offset="2744493">The crucial point in our view is that the Respondents are profoundly wrong in saying that it is necessary to imply a Bivens remedy, lest the Respondents here are left voiceless in respect to their constitutional claims, lest their constitutional wrongs remain voiceless, because we have in 405(g) a remedy which this Court, together with Congress, and I think this Court particularly, has made particularly receptive to all kinds of claims, and most recently in the City of New York case.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.020" offset="2936336">in the City of New York case, we had precisely the same complaints that are being raised here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.317" offset="2973534">And the Court found a way to make 405(g) perfectly adequate to respond to those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.705" offset="3019092">So those claims, whether constitutional or statutory, whether factual or legal, can be raised and can be raised within what has been described as the unusually protective scheme of 405(g).</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.140" offset="4960826">The Respondents in this case spent their working lives paying into Title II's disability insurance program, and they have no quarrel with its comprehensive design, the one that the Solicitor-General praises, for deciding who gets what benefits; how errors are reviewed and corrected; how mistakenly-withheld benefits are to be recovered from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.586" offset="5058524">As he correctly points out, the benefits were recovered, and they don't really complain about where Congress chose to locate what the Solicitor-General in his reply brief, calls the</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.633" offset="5102723">"ballast of the social security system. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1249.458" offset="5126024">Their point is, they didn't fall overboard; they allege that they were pushed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.861" offset="5143683">And their complaint is that the individual Petitioners in this case deliberately abused this well-designed machine; and abused their power by setting arbitrary quotas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.280" offset="5201361">And these, we think, are not simply "adverbs" of constitutional import, even if one doesn't agree to the exciting First English decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.097" offset="5240649">I think there was no disagreement with at least that part of Justice Stevens' dissent that suggests that when there are improperly motivated, or fairly conducted, or unnecessarily protracted facts of government decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.780" offset="5307314">That's a separate due-process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.753" offset="5315255">And it has been quite traditional for courts to recognize intentional abuse of process as a tort quite distinct from any benefits lost and recovered along the way according to the exclusive government system for recovering those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.416" offset="5385890">I think Judge Friendly was the first to see it in the Title II context in the Second Circuit in 1981 in Ellis v. Blum, when he held that abusive termination of Title II benefits, which are later restored retroactively, give rise to a Bivens action under 1331 for emotional distress and consequential damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.500" offset="5470213">Actually, he may not have been the first, although the context was a bit different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.304" offset="5485469">Justice Kennedy, in Flores v. Pierce, in the Ninth Circuit, held that, when state officials deliberately and for unconstitutional reasons, interfere with the attempt of a licensed applicant to obtain the license, the fact that the license is ultimately obtained according to the normal course of the normal process does not prevent the 1983 action seeking consequential damages and damages for emotional distress for the deliberate abuse of the process putting them through the ringer, when they ought not to have been put through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.910" offset="5647846">Now, the Solicitor-General, I think, paints quite a false picture when he says--</text>

            <text syncTime="1748.799" offset="7123451">First of all, the fact is that here, unlike the Civil Service area, Congress did not calibrate what it wants to be done to the existence of any abuse.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="1769.194" offset="7204953">It seems to me that, to answer the question of what Congress sort of had in mind in this area as it revisited it over and over,</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.408" offset="7233897">"as the Solicitor-General says it did in the '80s, it is important to understand what was going on in Congress during the period when this fine-tuning occurred. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.834" offset="7271513">Late last week, in Bowen v. Galbreath, this Court pointed out that, when it fine-tuned one of the titles; that is, when it passed Title XVI of the Act, Congress, in a telling omission, did not include certain language that had appeared in Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.209" offset="7361061">And that led me to inquire over the weekend what proposals did Congress have before it that might bear on this question, during the period of the 1980s when it was fine-tuning the delivery system?</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.558" offset="7414455">And the fact is that in December 1981, ten months after the Second Circuit had applied Bivens to the abusive termination of Title II beneficiaries, Secretary Schweiker, the Petitioner in this case, joined several other Cabinet members in officially urging Congress to pass S. 1775, which would have ended Bivens liability for most federal officers, including most particularly, officials of Health and Human Services, when plaintiffs allege what Secretary Schweiker called "constitutional torts" in the denial or termination of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.378" offset="7593759">That law had some predecessors in the late '70s that this Court took note of in Carlson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.243" offset="7621240">1775 would have actually given liability damages from the U.S. Treasury from the people who were cut off as for others who were denied Bivens remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.132" offset="7680799">And yet it was opposed on really two grounds; first that it was not sufficiently protective of victims; and second, that it wouldn't deter future abuses well enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.331" offset="7733567">In the end it died in committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.013" offset="7748300">And Majority Leader Baker in January 1984, said on the Senate floor, that Bivens reforms of that kind had proved too controversial to press as part of any other kind of reform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.702" offset="7799082">Later that year, unanimously, Congress passed the Social Security Reform Act of 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.857" offset="7823637">Now, to take from history, where Congress is adjusting and fine-tuning the system for returning benefits withheld by honest mistake, to take from that the lesson in this partnership between Congress and the Court, that Congress has implied a negative with respect to Bivens actions, for abusive termination, seems to me to take the possibility of employing implied repeal of the Bivens background much further than is justifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.330" offset="7965534">I don't think you can read either in what Congress did in 1939, before anyone dreamed of Bivens, when it was really enacting a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, for what it did do in the 1980s as somehow suggesting that it wouldn't make sense for this Court to do here what it did in such cases as Bivens and Davis and Carlson.</text>

            <text syncTime="2016.579" offset="8194576">But the suggestion that it's vast; and that its size is somehow the criterion that should make it rather like Bush, the elaborate civil service system, we think is not defensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.497" offset="8246194">In Bush, and indeed later in Chappell and in Stanley, the special factors were all qualitative: they related not to size, but to subject matter, like the commitment of federal personnel policy, or the incidence of military status to the political branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.261" offset="8321217">Size; complexity, I don't think provide a judicially-manageable line.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.396" offset="8649838">But this Court, I think, made a point, of which I know that in those cases you were not in full accord, that the ordinary concept of constitutional command draws a line between deliberate abuse of power and honest mistakes; the kind of thing that, in First English could happen as the regulatory process drags on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.640" offset="8738759">And we do not think we could make out a procedural due-process, or an equal protection violation, for mere honest error.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.588" offset="9058602">Certainly in Carey v. Piphus, emotional distress is separately, judicially, cognizable if provable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.410" offset="9085874">And in the Flores case in the Ninth Circuit, that was at the heart of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.414" offset="9101861">But let me return for a moment, if I might, to Justice O'Connor's question about Bush v. Lucas, because I think there is a deeper irony here, in that making the magnitude of the system, its complexity a special factor counselling hesitation under Bush, if you go back to the majority opinion in Bivens and the Justice Harlan's concurrence, both of those opinions stressed that damage liability is especially appropriate for federal officers because of how much power they can wield; how many people they can hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.677" offset="9242922">It inverts, I think, the logic in Bivens to say that the more people an official can hurt, the less a court should worry about ordinary garden-variety compensation and deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.616" offset="9294644">The fact is that Petitioners in this case were in a position to inflict more injury without ever getting out from behind their desks, than the agents in Bivens could inflict by breaking into Bivens' home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.546" offset="9354413">You don't have to send agents to grab the social security checks that Solicitor-General Fried says he's not really sure are property; or to repossess the groceries and the medicines that were purchased with those checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.466" offset="9410106">They didn't have to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.117" offset="9412718">All they had to do was put in place arbitrary quotas that pay no attention to the evidence; and send a functionary out with a computer-generated postcard to someone like Mr. Chilicky, who is recovering from open-heart surgery telling him,</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.407" offset="9465903">"you're fine. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2337.319" offset="9477501">I don't think it's too speculative to say that that is stigmatizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.782" offset="9491399">Now, the fact that, when Mr. Chilicky, when recovering from open heart surgery might be able... and after all, he did join a lawsuit quite early... might be able to seek some other form of judicial relief... does not really bear on--</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.287" offset="10505368">Most of the damage at the end of the day will be the same, the medical, quantifiable damage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.565" offset="10550507">That is always the case, I think, in drawing the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.325" offset="10565554">If, for example, in Bivens, they had entered the home in good faith, subject to a Malley v. Briggs kind of immunity, and had proceeded when there to do exactly the same kinds of things that they did, from the point of view of the person who occupied that home, it might have felt just the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.358" offset="10641622">But since they would not have violated the Constitution the Bivens remedy would not be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.921" offset="10663879">That's really not unique to this situation: I think that observation goes to the question whether Bivens itself should somehow be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.939" offset="10695957">And I don't think that any argument has been made here that it ought to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.612" offset="10710690">The only argument that's been made really is that somehow this is more like Bush v. Lucas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.257" offset="10729289">But what was peculiar in Bush v. Lucas, and absent here, was the close relationship between federal employer and federal employee, which led Congress over a 60-year period continually to revisit the area and provide closely calibrated remedies; that is, if someone were fired as part of an efficiency reorganization, even though himself perfectly innocent: no remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.333" offset="10841511">A decision was made for impermissible reasons not to hire him, there would be a limited remedy, a petition to the OSC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.789" offset="10871395">If he was demoted or fired abusively the remedy would be greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.382" offset="10889786">There is no evidence at all within this area Congress has calibrated the decision to return the benefit to the wronged; indeed, the Solicitor-General's argument about Mathews v. Eldridge proves the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.450" offset="10942030">The point about Mathews v. Eldridge is that there was no violation from the mere mistaken termination of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.027" offset="10976303">As this Court held in Mathews v. Eldridge, Title II, as opposed to Title XVI, the Constitutional requirement that the risk error be kept within acceptable bounds, is fully met by a post-deprivation mechanism for correction; it's very much like the provision of just compensation for a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.341" offset="11069613">The taking doesn't violate the Constitution as long as the compensation is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.715" offset="11087062">It's strange the language, as well as an understanding of what Congress was doing to say that the mechanism for internal correction requires simply to keep the ship within the bounds of Mathews v. Eldridge is somehow a correction, a remedy, for quite separate constitutional abuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.964" offset="11196045">It's a question about the deliberate element of your tort, because I really haven't been able to think it through: when you say "deliberate", do you mean that they just... they intended that people would not get benefits the statute entitled them to; or that they deliberately violated some constitutional procedure?</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.963" offset="11256127">What is the deliberateness here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.937" offset="11272009">The notion is that, fully-knowing, a significant number of the persons that they would terminate under these quotas were deserving, and would, if they pursued reinstatement and retroactive benefits, be likely to succeed, nonetheless, they decided for fiscal or other reasons, knowing that this had no relationship to particular evidence in the case, to impose and enforce these quotas... whether they also had to have it in their heads that this Court in 1994 in the Hertado case said that such arbitrary action violates the Constitution, I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.023" offset="11428326">I suspect that, in order to be liable of deliberate constitutional abuses of this kind, officials do not have to couch their improper intent in constitutional terms; but they would surely, though I'm sure that this is somewhat of a different issue, the Harlow v. Fitzgerald defense, if they acted in an objectively reasonable belief, that what they did comported with the requirements of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.981" offset="11536159">The suggestion that the bureaucratic apparatus of the social security system is too complex and too large to be subjected to a system of judicially-developed, quite ordinary remedies, is one that might be made to Congress, as it has been; but when it was made to Congress... when Petitioner Schweiker, for example, joined other Cabinet members in urging Congress to get rid of Bivens it's striking that he did not say, or even suggest, that those who are injured through what he described as "constitutional torts" in abusive terminations, ought to be left without any damages at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.833" offset="11727585">The suggestion rather was that there should be damages from the United States Treasury; the precise measure of those damages is a question for a different day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.627" offset="11758723">And even that Congress resisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.200" offset="11773038">So the idea that, if you look at Congress not only laterally over time, but you find some implicit congressional determination, that the ordinary judicial approach of after-the-fact damages for deliberately inflicted harm in violation of the Constitution, the idea that one can find a congressional mechanism--</text>

I mean, I suppose one could try to compute what would happen under all of the Bivens remedies authorized by this Court if the millions of people who could potentially sue were all to sue the government, it would be staggering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.774" offset="12071356">But the suggestion of an avalanche of liability is rather belied; as I understand it, in all of the years since Bivens was decided in 1971, there have been a grand total of some two dozen, as of several years ago, of actual damage recoveries under Bivens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.995" offset="12136244">It's not so easy to prove that government officials deliberately set out to violate your constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.589" offset="12166546">And I wouldn't be too sanguine about the ability of people to prove that in a way that would pose grave threats for the fiscal stability of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.717" offset="12199043">But if such threats were posed, it is the Congress that has the power of the purse; it is Congress who can decide whether deliberately abusive officials should be indemnified; and Congress who could put realistic caps on damage recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.364" offset="12261632">But in the absence of such action by Congress, the course on which this Court embarked in 1971 in Bivens seems to me not really to stop short of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.871" offset="12411679">Thank you, Mr. Tribe.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="3075.056" offset="12428398">First it's important to note that Judge Friendly's decision in Ellis preceded Bush v. Lucas; and I don't think he would have decided the case the same way after this Court's guidance in Bush v. Lucas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.150" offset="12512826">Second, I would like to call attention to the third sentence of 405(h),</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.045" offset="12540411">"No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any office or employee thereof, shall be brought under Section 1331 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter. "</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="3116.945" offset="12595999">Well, Mr. Fried, do you think the Court gave that less than a literal reading in Bowan against Michigan Academy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="3124.820" stopTime="3371.263">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="3124.820" offset="12627555">The Michigan Academy case is very important on that point because the Court recognized that it had... that it was rowing uphill; but that it was willing to do so because, had there not been a remedy that was implied under 1331, there would have been no way for those particular claims to be brought before any court whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.849" offset="12743644">And that, this Court said, was weighing powerfully in their interpretation; second, it found a little bit of leeway because in any event, I believe the Court said, in any event, we are not operating directly under 405(h) in the third sentence; but only by its incorporation through Section 1395, that was a Part B of Medicare case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.197" offset="12853044">That would seem to me to suggest that, if you were square in the middle of 405(h), rather than in one of those peripheral applications dragged in by reference that you would not have had the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.668" offset="12922948">The attempt to do in rungs around the third sentence goes back to Weinberger against Salfi, the attempt to say, well, this is a declaratory judgment; well, this is procedural; this is prospective-only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.623" offset="13006749">Each time the Court has said, look, what you are doing is something which has to do with getting benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.650" offset="13046873">These people didn't slip and fall on the steps of the Social Security office and bring an action for that reason; they are bringing an action because something that happened in respect to the granting of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.340" offset="13113537">And I ask myself, if Congress wanted to proscribe 1331 jurisdiction for a situation like this, how much more really could it have spoken?</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.070" offset="13172470">Should it have said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.141" offset="13176754">"and we mean Bivens, too? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.061" offset="13184486">So I think 1331... I think that 405(h) is quite clear on this point; I do think that it's important to have a little perspective on this case, particularly given the very powerful presentation of the factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.356" offset="13265675">First, the respondents at page 6 of their brief say that there are perhaps 200,000 people whose benefits were unjustly terminated and then later reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.586" offset="13318546">But the perspective I would like to suggest is a different one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.238" offset="13337146">There is in the United States no general system at the national level of income maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.305" offset="13369433">There is food stamps; there is AFDC; there is unemployment compensation, which is time-limited; and then there is social security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.800" offset="13411438">In times of economic dislocation in the late '70s and early '80s, when most of these cases arose, were such times, there is tremendous pressure on the system and on Congress to somehow stretch what is a rather gappy safety net to cover more and more serious cases which seem to fall through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.090" offset="13528571">How to respond to those pressures is a serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.373" offset="13549678">I do not think it is sensible to respond by making the Cabinet Secretary personally liable as is being sought to be done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.323" offset="13597534">If there are no further questions, I think the Court for its attention.</text>
