            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="139029">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 86-1278, Hustler Magazine and Larry C. Flynt versus Jerry Falwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.522" offset="181034">Mr. Isaacman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_l_isaacman" startTime="13.641" stopTime="67.894">
            <label>Mr. Alan L. Isaacman</label>
            <text syncTime="13.641" offset="193573">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.610" offset="209455">The First Amendment protects all speech except for certain narrowly drawn categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.198" offset="239757">For example, the First Amendment does protect false statements of fact made with requisite fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.019" offset="263058">The First Amendment doesn't protect obscene speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.737" offset="277896">The First Amendment doesn't protect fighting words made in the presence of the person to whom the words are addressed and likely to incite violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.958" offset="302765">This cases raises as a general question the question of whether the Court should expand the areas left unprotected by the First Amendment, and create another exception to protected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.651" offset="361592">And in this situation, the new area that is sought to be protected is satiric or critical commentary of a public figure which does not contain any assertions of fact.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="67.894" stopTime="72.762">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="410598">Are you suggesting that would be a change in our constitutional jurisprudence to protect that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_l_isaacman" startTime="72.762" stopTime="276.695">
            <label>Mr. Alan L. Isaacman</label>
            <text syncTime="72.762" offset="430033">Yes, sir, I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.548" offset="437138">I am suggesting that.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.581" offset="445289">In a specific way, the question becomes: is rhetorical hyperbole, satire, parody, or opinion protected by the First Amendment when it doesn't contain assertions of fact and when the subject of the rhetorical hyperbole is a public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.830" offset="530343">Another way of putting this case is, can the First Amendment limitations which have been set out in New York Times versus Sullivan and its progeny be evaded by a public figure who instead of alleging libel or instead of alleging invasion of privacy, seeks recovery for an allegedly injurious falsehood by labeling his cause of action intentional infliction of emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.064" offset="635251">In judging the publication that's at issue here, I think it's important to look at the context in which it appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.455" offset="684779">The speaker of course was Hustler Magazine, and Hustler Magazine is known by its readers as a magazine that contains sexually explicit pictures, and contains irreverent humor.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.446" offset="736711">As an editorial policy, it takes on the sacred cows and the sanctimonious in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.635" offset="769520">It focuses on three subject areas primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.737" offset="781955">It focuses on sex, it focuses on politics and it focuses on religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.872" offset="798464">Hustler Magazine has been the target of attacks and critical commentary by Jerry Falwell for years and for years prior to this ad publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.199" offset="847783">Hustler Magazine is at the other end of the political spectrum from Jerry Falwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.436" offset="872756">On the other hand, Jerry Falwell filling out the context of this speech, is the quintessential public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.856" offset="902431">It's hard to imagine a person in this country who doesn't hold political office who can has more publicity associated with his name than Jerry Falwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.545" offset="941197">Jerry Falwell is the head of the moral majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.497" offset="953005">The moral majority, he testified at the trial, numbers some six million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.587" offset="977351">It's a political organization, he indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.337" offset="988322">It was set up to advance certain political views.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.889" offset="998562">One of the foremost views is to attack what he considers to be pornography, and to attack kings of porn, in his words.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.078" offset="1035238">And foremost among those kings of porn in his mind is Larry Flynt.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.631" offset="1049553">He includes in that group others as well, such as Bob Guccioni of Penthouse and such as Hugh Hefner of Playboy.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.202" offset="1075780">The moral majority and Jerry Falwell also attack sexual conduct that they don't consider appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.456" offset="1104828">He has spoken on the subject of extramarital and premarital sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.593" offset="1121338">He doesn't approve of heterosexuals living together outside of wedlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.295" offset="1136175">He also doesn't approve and condemns homosexuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.914" offset="1150595">Now, these aren't private views he has kept to himself or just shared with his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.781" offset="1166059">These are views that he's gone on the political stump and tried to convince other people about.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.603" offset="1189360">He has been known in his words, as he testified, by the Good Housekeeping magazine which did a survey as the second-most admired man in the United States, next to the President.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.187" offset="1295731">Well, then, I guess we could move on to the arguments, because apparently your remarks are for the purpose of demonstrating he's a public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.026" offset="1331049">Is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="298.676" offset="1333661">Justice O'Connor, it's to really to fill out the political context and the fact that what we have here are people who are at opposite ends of the political spectrum, engaging in the uninhibited robust and wide open debate in New York Times v. Sullivan.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.670" offset="1401684">Does the State have an interest in protecting its citizens from emotional distress, do you suppose?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_l_isaacman" startTime="320.808" stopTime="325.426">
            <label>Mr. Alan L. Isaacman</label>
            <text syncTime="320.808" offset="1422164">Clearly, the State has an interest in protecting its citizens from emotional distress.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="325.426" stopTime="330.347">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="325.426" offset="1440658">And perhaps that's an even greater interest than protecting reputation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_l_isaacman" startTime="330.347" stopTime="386.315">
            <label>Mr. Alan L. Isaacman</label>
            <text syncTime="330.347" offset="1460407">I would submit that it is not a greater interest than protecting reputation, because in the area of reputational injury, libel as we know it, for example, when it's in written form, emotional distress is an element of recovery as well as damage to reputation, and reputation affects what other people think of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.911" offset="1546611">It affects what goes on in the minds of other people as well, and not just the minds of one citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.463" offset="1564792">So reputation in a sense covers a lot more territory than emotional distress does.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.017" offset="1583078">And the point of what I'm trying to make is that we really have people who are engaging in political debate in a way that involves vehement caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp language, as the New York Times v. Sullivan used.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.609" offset="1645458">Now, this speech is protected as rhetorical hyperbole, it's protected as satire and parody and as the expression of opinion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="386.315" stopTime="397.956">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="386.315" offset="1684224">Would this be a different case if the jury had found that the allegations could be considered factual?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_l_isaacman" startTime="397.956" stopTime="461.882">
            <label>Mr. Alan L. Isaacman</label>
            <text syncTime="401.575" offset="1745246">It certainly would be a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.260" offset="1752038">We think that even in that situation, this Court should find that these allegations could in no way be perceived as factual as a matter of law, and in exercising its obligation under Bose, I think the Court would have to do an independent review of the record to determine that constitutional fact, that is to say, that there was no actual malice in this case because this can't be perceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.125" offset="1851512">Just as in Letter Carriers v. Austin, calling the plaintiffs there a traitor to their God, their country, their family, saying they have a corkscrew soul, saying that instead of a heart they have tortured principles, was considered by this Court to be rhetorical hyperbole, and not to be taken literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.087" offset="1923297">Similarly, there's nothing in this ad parody that can be taken as a statement of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.408" offset="1944613">And we're in an unusual situation where the jury has made that determination for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.394" offset="1964570">So we now know that even this jury, which should never have been allowed to consider this.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.510" offset="2057044">--Justice O'Connor, I suggest that in the First Amendment context, when a determination is made by a jury that's adverse to speech, and when a jury finds that the speaker made statements that could be construed as statements of fact and were knowingly false, then it is incumbent upon the Court to take that review for the purpose of protecting the speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.690" offset="2145756">And that's what the First Amendment says, that you have to protect the speaker.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.898" offset="2186611">Bose is intended to protect the speaker, it's not intended to protect the emotionally distressed interest that the State is seeking to protect in the area of intentional infliction of emotional stress or in the area of libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.806" offset="2238229">And not only that, but we have a situation where there hasn't been an appeal from the determination in the jury, so that's res judicata yet.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.132" offset="2295489">Yes, sir, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.167" offset="2303640">Now, going on, we not only have the example of Letter Carriers, but we have the example of Greenbelt v. Bresler where the plaintiff in that case was accused of being engaged in blackmail.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.425" offset="2360691">And the Court said that that can't be taken literally because that was just intended to describe his negotiating position, and that is hyperbole.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.431" offset="2392665">And we have ample lower court precedents on the subject, such as the Pring case, which was a Penthouse article about a Miss Wyoming which attributed certain sexual activities on her part, and she sued for libel, intentional infliction of emotional stress, and other causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.392" offset="2460583">And the Tenth Circuit, after an adverse jury determination to Penthouse, the Tenth Circuit reversed and dismissed that case, saying that that's rhetorical hyperbole.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.581" offset="2497259">That article couldn't be perceived as describing actual facts about the plaintiff in that case, or actual events in which she participated.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.337" offset="2528293">Same finding that the jury made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.587" offset="2537279">And the Court then went on to say that since it's rhetorical hyperbole and protected by the First Amendment against a libel claim, it's also protected against an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim which there was called outrage under Wyoming law because the same constitutional defenses apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.482" offset="2604884">And earlier this year in the First Circuit in the L.L. Bean v. Drake Publishers, the Court there said that parody is protected speech, and even though the plaintiff in that case complained about the sexual parody that occurred of L.L. Bean's Catalog, that was protected speech and the case was found in favor of the speaker in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.116" offset="2707493">Beyond that, Jerry Falwell as a public figure should not be permitted to evade the First Amendment limitations that have been set forth in New York Times v. Sullivan, and many many other cases with respect to his claim for an allegedly injurious falsehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.529" offset="2789099">The California Supreme Court recently, through Justice Mosc, determined in Blatty v. New York Times, that where the gravamen of a complaint is allegedly injurious falsehood, it doesn't matter what you call your claim, because the First Amendment covers that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.960" offset="2878856">Mr. Isaacman, what the New York Times rule provides is not an absolute protection, but what a knowing element, an element of specific intent to create a falsehood.</text>
