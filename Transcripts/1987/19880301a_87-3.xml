            <label>Mr. Michael S. Fawer</label>
            <text syncTime="27.317" offset="252437">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="30.685" offset="265916">The issue in this case, stated simply, is whether the principal of a one-man corporation, simply by virtue of the fact that his status as its records custodian, can be compelled to make self-incriminatory, tacitly testimonial disclosures; or is he, like the custodian in U.S. v. Doe, to be afforded the limited act of production privilege secured to all natural persons under the Fifth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="60.555" offset="385452">The facts of the case are quite simple: the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Attorney in the Southern District of Mississippi began a grand jury investigation, criminal tax investigation, of Randy Braswell.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.648" offset="441772">He was the target of that investigation, and there is no issue as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.833" offset="458491">In August 1986, during the course of that investigation, the subpoena duces tecum was served upon Mr. Braswell as President of his corporation, of the one-man corporation that he has called Worldwide Purchasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.010" offset="511258">It was a broad-based subpoena virtually identical to the one that is before Your Honors in U.S. v. Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.414" offset="540829">It is found at pages 6 and 7 ver batem in our Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.733" offset="558174">In response, we filed a Motion to Quash, asserting our act of production privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.269" offset="576251">The Government opposed, stating that no corporate custodian has any act of production privilege; with that issue joined, there was a brief evidentiary hearing before the court in that district, and the court found that Mr. Braswell did, in fact, conduct his business as close to a sole-proprietorship, as one could see.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.135" offset="667784">Nevertheless the court held, as the Government had contended, that the act of production was not available to any corporate custodian under the Fifth Amendment; and that they relied on the case, the Lincoln case in the Fifth Circuit, which so-held.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.179" offset="735911">We, at that time refused to produce before the grand jury... we had a contempt citation against us; there was a stay of the commitment under the contempt citation; and the Fifth Circuit affirmed on the same grounds as had the ruling of the D.C. Circuit... a D.C. court, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.974" offset="811039">They did, of course, note in that context that there was a split in the circuits as to whether or not the Bellis decision of this Court was limited to the contents of records of a corporation; as opposed to the testimonial... the tacitly testimonial aspects of the act of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.006" offset="899229">Our position is quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.672" offset="905916">We feel that we are entitled... that Mr. Braswell is entitled to the same production with respect to his records, the corporate records, as is the records custodian in Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.980" offset="947085">The only distinction between the two is Braswell, Inc. chose to do business under the corporate framework.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="206.801" offset="970386">Well, that distinction has been recognized since the time of Hale v. Henkel, hasn't it, in 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.038" offset="995359">The Court said it is a distinction of constitutional significance.</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_s_fawer" startTime="217.340" stopTime="294.840">
            <label>Mr. Michael S. Fawer</label>
            <text syncTime="217.340" offset="1012600">It is true, Your Honor, I think it is fair to say, as this Court has said on... at least, I believe this Court has said, that they were addressing the question of whether or not the contents of corporate records, as opposed to the testimonial aspects of the Fifth Amendment, were in fact to be privileged?</text>
            <text syncTime="237.487" offset="1093162">We do not dispute, nor did we dispute below, that the Government has an absolute right to the contents of the records of Mr. Braswell's corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.461" offset="1141018">We do not in any way deny that, nor do we think it would be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.282" offset="1160349">That proposition has been established at least as early as Hale right through the Bellis decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.853" offset="1186576">And I believe Fisher and Doe do nothing to undercut it.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.655" offset="1201831">Our position is simply that, as to anything testimonial, of whatever nature it may be; whatever form it may take, this Court has always protected that type of disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.230" offset="1256061">And Mr. Braswell, although he is a representative of corporation, is at the same time a person of flesh-and-blood, and he has the right with respect to his testimony to claim protection of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3741.886" offset="15110781">Now, I might point out something the Government doesn't point out: the Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 801(d)(2)... you know that that rule says that it is not hearsay for somebody to testify in a representative capacity and that representative capacity can be used against him in his individual capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.067" offset="15199493">How do we deal with that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.936" offset="15206912">What does that do to the fiction that the Government wants to palm off on the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.555" offset="15225407">The answer is simple: statutory immunity in this case.</text>
