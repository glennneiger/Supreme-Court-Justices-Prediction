            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80919">And the second case No. 86-937, United States against Robinsons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.557" offset="103071">Respondent, Thomas Robinson was charged with mail fraud involving arson-related insurance claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.056" offset="129089">He did not testify a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.079" offset="141210">In his closing argument to the jury, his lawyer charged that the government had not allowed him to explain his side of the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.841" offset="172243">Following this closing and out of the presence of a jury, the prosecution objected to the remarks of the defense counsel, and contended of the defendants had opened the door to comment on the defendant's failure to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.191" offset="225637">The District Court agreed and the defense offered no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.985" offset="240788">In his rebuttal submission, the prosecution stated that the defendant's assertion that the government had not allowed him to explain was unacceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.776" offset="271926">The prosecution noted that the defendant could have taken the witness stand and explained his actions to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.136" offset="297422">The jury convicted the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.008" offset="304945">The Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit reversed the convictions concluding that the prosecution's comments had deprived the defendant of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.669" offset="347577">We intern, reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.581" offset="359175">As explained in an opinion filed today, we conclude that in a light of a remarks of the defense counsel, the prosecution's comment did not transgress the bound of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.075" offset="401180">The defense counsel basically opened the door for the matter and serious requires that the government would be allowed to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.924" offset="432527">Justice Blackmun has filed on opinion concurring in part in dissenting in part; Justice Marshall has filed the dissenting opinion in which Justice Brennan has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.740" offset="467845">Justice Kennedy took no part.</text>
