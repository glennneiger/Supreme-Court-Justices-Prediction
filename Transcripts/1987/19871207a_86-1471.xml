            <text syncTime="14.590" offset="196321">In the 23 years since the Food Stamp Act of 1964 was enacted, Congress has many times considered and several times enacted measures designed to restrict the availability of food stamps to households with members who were on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.770" offset="261000">In 1981, the 97th Congress enacted an amendment to the Food Stamp Act now codified at 7 U.S.C. 2015(d)(3) whose Constitutionality is at issue in the case this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.702" offset="320769">That amendment generally provides that households that contain strikers are not eligible for food stamps by reason of the loss of income occasioned by the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.978" offset="365908">It provides moreover that households eligible for food stamps prior to the strike will retain their eligibility but will not receive any additional food stamps by reason of that loss of income.</text>

            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins</label>
            <text syncTime="73.034" offset="430065">I think, Justice Blackmun, that Congress sought to strike what I would call a balance of competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.591" offset="480325">By retaining the eligibility, households were placed in no worse position by virtue of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.198" offset="510731">Congress simply sought not to permit the loss of income occasioned by the strike itself to increase the eligibility for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.303" offset="551169">So in that sense, it doesn't deprive households of an eligibility that vested prior to the time the strike began.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="112.644" offset="588576">Mr. Robbins, is there any evidence in the legislative history that one of the purposes was to somehow effect or establish national labor policy in any way?</text>
            <text syncTime="127.746" offset="648971">Was this just a budget device to save money, or was the exception in there to further some labor policy of the government?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="138.945" stopTime="462.689">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins</label>
            <text syncTime="138.945" offset="693693">I think, Justice O'Connor, Congress sought to promote three objectives, and it articulated those objectives in the accompanying Senate report, I believe it's 97-35, that accompanied the legislation in 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.908" offset="761611">Those three purposes are first, as Your Honor mentioned, to achieve what Congress wished to be dramatic changes in its words, in the Federal spending policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.604" offset="820334">Congress sought to reduce the overall cost of the Food Stamp program and the Congressional Budget Office estimated in fact that the amendment actually adopted in 2015(d)(3) would save approximately $165 million in food stamp outlays over the three year period 1982 to 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.550" offset="896194">But there were two other objectives as well, apart from simple saving of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.423" offset="915629">First, Congress believed that it was tying the receipt of food stamps to the ability and willingness to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.842" offset="945304">It thought that was consistent with the balance of the food stamp scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.419" offset="959619">It believed and said, that strikers have foregone available employment voluntarily and that union strike funds should be the principal source of benefits during a work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.445" offset="1003714">Finally and more clearly I think directed to Your Honor's question, Congress attempted to promote additional governmental neutrality in labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.644" offset="1048540">It believed that providing food stamps to striking workers is an incentive to wait out management, in the Senate Committee's words, rather than to reach compromises.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.796" offset="1089187">And it decided that it wished to withdraw that incentive from labor management's disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.716" offset="1112801">Now, the District Court for the District of Columbia recognized that these were rational goals and that the legislation enacted in 2015(d)(3) is, to use the District Court's words,</text>
            <text syncTime="255.758" offset="1160971">"rationally related to legitimate legislative objectives. "</text>
            <text syncTime="259.178" offset="1174659">but it struck the statute down anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.927" offset="1185631">Applying a rather loose amalgam of rational based and heightened scrutiny, the Court found that the statute irrationally discriminated against strikers, unlawfully impinges on their free association rights as well as the rights of their families and their unions to free association and exacts an excessive price for the protected right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.121" offset="1274447">We believe each of these conclusions to be mistaken and we ask this Court this morning to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.649" offset="1300569">Let me turn first, if I might, to the equal protection claim in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.273" offset="1319064">It is common ground that Section 2015(d)(3) as social welfare legislation survives equal protection scrutiny if it is rationally related to a legitimate legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.564" offset="1372249">We have no doubt that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.891" offset="1381549">But let me say at the outset that we proceed in this argument on the assumption that Congress articulated its real purposes for the statute when it enacted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.825" offset="1425226">I mention that seemingly uncontroversial point because the amicus party in this case has suggested that Congress' articulated purposes are in fact a camouflage for the anti-labor and anti-union animus that ostensibly in reality motivated the enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.395" offset="1499518">But that claim is manifestly false, resting as it does on remarks made in years past by opponents about precursors of the current legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.281" offset="1547061">We prefer to take Congress at its word, and I turn directly therefore to the reasons that Congress actually articulated as rational bases for the distinction that it drew in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.183" offset="1594708">Let me start with the cost savings goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.494" offset="1607978">In 1981, Congress confronted an economy that it believed to be in considerable financial distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.958" offset="1641833">It therefore resolved to make across the board cuts in a great many Federal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.315" offset="1667224">Several of those were made in the Food Stamp Program, and Section 2015(d)(3) reflects one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.531" offset="1692093">Now, appellees do not dispute that the Government may legitimately pursue cost savings, but they argue that savings alone cannot justify irrational distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.246" offset="1738904">And we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.463" offset="1743815">Distinctions that are otherwise irrational are not made rational simply because they save the Government money.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.899" offset="1769520">But the need to conserve funds makes distinctions inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.788" offset="1789164">And when distinctions must inevitably be made, it is equally inevitable that some persons, often with a great deal in common, will fall within and without the favored circle.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.360" offset="1839423">Here, Congress drew a dividing line rationally grounded in the determination that strikers at least have a job to go back to and have union strike funds to rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.933" offset="1893654">In those critical respects, Congress reasonably concluded that strikers may more easily than other persons absorb the necessary reduction in available benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.960" offset="1937853">Once it is seen that Congress drew a rational line in its effort to conserve funds, this Court's decision last term in Bowen against Gilliard instructs that the Statute that it enacted--</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.471" offset="6699871">There are two reasons why the First Amendment claim in this case fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.375" offset="6719515">And the two reasons are defined by this Court's decision in Gilliard at the tail end of last year's term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.576" offset="6744279">And the reason is that the First Amendment free association claim is only implicated when it is a statute whose</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.010" offset="6773954">"design and direct effect is to intrude on those First Amendment interests. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.071" offset="6798300">In this case, of course, neither of those standards is met, first because it is surely not the design of the Statute to impair free association claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.143" offset="6846574">It is first of all not triggered by a significantly protected First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.985" offset="6869876">The right to strike, as we've outlined in our Reply Brief, has historically been, as Justice Jackson put it in the UAW case, more vulnerable to regulation than the right to organize and select representatives for lawful purposes of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.838" offset="6929330">Indeed, the history of labor law is largely defined by an on-going process of adjusting the competing claims of strikers, their employers and the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.663" offset="6968618">And that historical process is only possible by virtue of the fact, and indeed it reflects the fact that the right to strike is not graven in some First Amendment stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.955" offset="7013758">And second, the statute does not as in the words of the Bowen against Gilliard case directly impair that First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.654" offset="7048553">Because like the decision, like the decision in Harris against McRae and the decisions in Castillo and in Gilliard, it simply withdraws funding where it does not affirmatively fund the protected right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2687.570" offset="10888240">For example, there are laws under Taft-Hartley directly restricting the freedom of employees to engage in various kinds of concerted activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2772.429" offset="11227727">I think what they said was in the context of a social welfare program, we think this advances neutrality by withdrawing the support from strikers and their families, but I don't think that they said, we're doing this as part of an addition to the Taft-Hartley Act to regulate striking or any of the other Federal legislation that this Court has upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.116" offset="12622457">What is triggering the disqualification is not the economic activity of striking or turning your back on employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.799" offset="12661118">It is turning your back on employment with other people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.001" offset="12673970">But in Citizens for Rent on the contributions, we had held in Buckley v. Moreno, as some people have said, that money is speech, and therefore there was probably an independent First Amendment ground in Citizens Against Rent Control to analyze the thing in First Amendment terms since it was regulating something that was the form of speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.741" offset="12776893">I think that there are other areas where you've looked at associational rights where it's not as clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.487" offset="12807926">For example, in Speiser v. Randall, which I guess to some extent was a due process case, but has later come in, it seems to me, to the First Amendment, that was the denial of a tax exemption... and I don't think you particularly have a First Amendment right to get a tax exemption... you just have a First Amendment right not to have the tax exemption conditioned on the foregoing of the exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.915" offset="12905624">And I think that's where the Government misstates what the state of the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.834" offset="12929343">In terms of they are saying that since there's no direct prohibition on striking or on associational rights, it only regulates striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.784" offset="12965079">Then the indirect effects, if you can call them indirect in the sense that they aren't on the face of the Statute, can be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.438" offset="12995694">And I don't think that the District Court felt that that was true, because he recognized it even though it was burdening more than just the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.887" offset="13033520">It was burdening this associational... the right to express your disagreement with your employer by leaving in association with others.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.296" offset="13175103">You can burden associational rights, the Government can, if the reason is significant enough, but we will subject that reason to strict scrutiny.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.473" offset="13283877">Why don't we apply strict scrutiny to the National Labor Relations Act?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Walker Mchugh</label>
            <text syncTime="3289.909" offset="13297565">Well, one reason would be there you are not discriminating among certain kinds of associates, you're not saying that we are disapproving of a type of associational activity, you're only setting up a framework that's basically neutral or helping at least in adjusting the relationships between employers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.728" offset="13380844">But in this situation, you are dealing with a situation where it's the government viz a viz individuals and I think that that is perhaps one difference in the sense that the First Amendment primarily goes to limit governments and doesn't apply to the same extent when you're talking about the adjustment of relations between private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.924" offset="13453673">Because then you have other interests such as property interest, antitrust and other things that the Court has pointed to in the Lincoln Federal Labor case and other cases that the Government cites for this pervasive regulation of striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.325" offset="13503306">So it seems like to me that's what makes this case different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.856" offset="13513337">You have definitely indicated in your cases that where the Government does something directly in terms of acting on people in the associational context that that is different from where it's doing it by just letting it happen between private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.894" offset="13597556">For example, you've said in Thornhill v. Alabama, the Court said that it's one thing for the State to regulate the give and take of industrial combatants; it's another thing for the government to come in and limit the rights of speech in the area of industrial controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.605" offset="13688357">And it seems like to me that that's the same distinction I'm trying to make here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.338" offset="13699329">Does that suggest that all labor relations type laws of the first category have to be put in the same statute, and that Congress can't in another statute perhaps, a bill sent in by another department, they couldn't have a regulation of labor relations?</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.344" offset="13775293">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.437" offset="13787727">I just think this is not a labor relations statute and that was not really the purpose that Congress had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.403" offset="13819596">What they apparently were concerned about was... or at least the proponents of this amendment were... that people might be able to be at a better advantage and not have to settle labor disputes more to the liking of employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.208" offset="13882813">But I don't think that that makes it a labor relations regulation just because it impinges on strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.267" offset="13923041">Healy v. James is another case I think in the First Amendment area is similar in terms of going to this indirect direct distinction that I'm discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.667" offset="13980615">There the Court looked at the non-recognition by a State university of a student organization and said that the fact that they couldn't use the meeting rooms or the bulletin boards at the University was enough of an impermissible burden on the right of association to be a serious constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.784" offset="14065147">In effect, what happened in Healy v. James was similar to the Government's subsidy argument, the University basically just declined to make available to the student organization, the same facilities that it normally made available to other student organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.385" offset="14135469">I want to touch before my time is up on the subsidy funding argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.522" offset="14180086">It seems to me that there are two things that make this case different from the medicaid abortion cases which the Government attempts to rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.487" offset="14219897">First of all, when you look at the comparison between voluntary quitters who quit for good cause and strikers who quit for identical reasons, there is no plausible explanation for that distinction other than the Government's disagreement with the viewpoint that's being expressed by the people who quit in concert with other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.931" offset="14305683">And this is a First Amendment element that the Court has not permitted even in the subsidy area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.507" offset="14328044">Secondly, in the abortion cases, the Court said that while government is under no obligation to remove obstacles not of its own making when people want to exercise protected rights, in this case the obstacle was poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.329" offset="14407247">The Court still recognized in those cases that the government could not turn around and put an obstacle in the place of somebody because they exercised a protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.371" offset="14451446">And it seems like to me that that's a fundamental distinction that this Court recognized both in Mahere and in Harris v. McRae.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.119" offset="14482480">Clearly this is the situation here where the striker provision is triggered by the exercise of associational rights and is an obstacle placed in the path of strikers based upon their exercise of associational rights.</text>

Verner where the person lost all their benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.847" offset="14693340">The Court made that distinction in footnote 19 of the Harris opinion.</text>
