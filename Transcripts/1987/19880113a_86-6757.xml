            <text syncTime="3550.380" offset="14346470">And further, there is nothing in the statute that suggests that the least intrusive means of meeting a presumed interest is through a screen in a courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.236" offset="14381997">And I would submit to this Court that there are clearly other less intrusive means if you need to protect a child witness from the defendant of doing that outside the courtroom where the jury would not be affected by the presence of that screen throughout the critical testimony of the child witnesses--</text>
