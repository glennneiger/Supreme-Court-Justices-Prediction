            <text syncTime="28.150" offset="246381">The petitioner, Quincy West, was a North Carolina prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.321" offset="267069">The United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina granted the respondent summary judgment and a majority of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit sitting en banc affirmed, holding that the respondent did not act under color of law when he was managing the health services of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.087" offset="362155">Petitioner's lawsuit brought under 1983 in the Federal District Court was, of course, based on this Court's decision in Estelle against Gamble, where the Court had held that the deliberate denial of serious medical services constituted... by a prison authority constituted the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.404" offset="467376">And of course, the reason for that is that the prisoner is himself helpless to have medical services unless the state provides it, and in North Carolina that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.978" offset="521711">A prisoner such as petitioner cannot obtain medical services except for the services given to him by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.983" offset="557760">Even if he could afford to hire a doctor, he is not allowed to do so according to North Carolina law.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.923" offset="585450">This then, the case that was brought then was exactly the sort of case that the Court indicated was actionable under 1983 in Estelle.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.231" offset="638740">There were allegations that there was abuse of power by an authority by denying needed medical services, and that it was done by somebody with authority granted by the state to so act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1300.685" offset="5336496">And we submit, of course, that the Fourth Circuit got the language of professionalism in Polk County wrong, that what was important in the Polk County case in terms of the professional obligations of the public defender was her professional obligation to be not only independent but to be adversarial to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.169" offset="5442449">In fact, the Dodson case, it was litigation where the plaintiff was the State of Iowa, State of Iowa against Dodson, and one looks at that and sees that the police have investigated and preferred charges in the state through its state's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.131" offset="5518309">The district attorney is prosecuting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.464" offset="5523638">And then look on the defendant's side of the table and see it's against Mr. Dodson, and there is his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.849" offset="5545163">And in those circumstances, and I think that the court said in the peculiar circumstances of the case the state employee was not said to be acting under color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.307" offset="5587063">I would point out that even in that courtroom or in the context of that the lawyer representing the state was a state actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.079" offset="5626142">Nothing has disturbed the court's rulings on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.983" offset="5641711">So was the judge, or the judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.649" offset="5652369">I think it was then before the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.535" offset="5663967">After Polk County against Dodson, we have the Glover case, where a public defender was sued, and he was found to be acting under color of state law because of his acting in concert and conspiracy with the prosecutor and the judge and other state officials, so that the professionalism of the judge and the professionalism of the prosecutor didn't cause them not to be state actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.704" offset="5772637">It seems to me that the Polk County case is very limited and peculiar, and I would note that when a public defender acts in a case of a criminal defense lawyer, he is always acting before the courts, and judges have a responsibility if they see something wrong going on to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.368" offset="5855288">Criminal defendants with some frequency complain about their lawyers, and if the complaint has some merit, the judges will act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.329" offset="5935118">That's right, Your Honor, but the case is pending in a court which would receive a complaint from a prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.150" offset="5966361">It is certainly my experience that when judges receive that, if it looks like there is any merit in it, where there is... in a criminal defense situation, that they will make some inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.123" offset="6010247">And indeed, the rule that was involved in Polk County against Dodson, it was the filing of the Anders brief which was complained about, and the rule there said that the lawyer had to tell the client, I am going to file a no merit brief, and then the person, Mr. Dodson then had the opportunity to tell the Court, I think this is wrong, and please examine it closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.489" offset="6107736">It just doesn't have its counterpart in the prison system short of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.743" offset="6132813">I would also emphasize in terms of the professionalism idea that there are lots of cases from this Court where professionals have been found to be acting under color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.688" offset="6204493">We cited the Youngberg case, where the act of exercising a professional judgment was found itself to be the state action, and if the actor exceeded the bounds of accepted professional judgment in that instance of providing certain care to a mentally retarded person incarcerated in a state institution, that would be actionable under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.272" offset="6310864">I would mention briefly the Blum case, which was the case involving concededly private physicians and concededly private nursing homes in New York, which is very much in contrast with the setting we have, which is in the Central Prison, behind walls, a core... medical care being a core function of the responsibilities of the state in providing prison services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.429" offset="6447536">And I would like also to mention that we are here construing the Civil Rights Act of 1871 that this Court has often told us was intended to provide remedies as broad as the 14th Amendment, and I certainly do submit that on the facts of this case it seems inconceivable to me that Congress couldn't draw a statute to allow petitioner to bring a lawsuit against this doctor for the things that he said were done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.852" offset="6597166">And finally, I would say to the Court that Estelle and the cases that have followed it have identified in the prison system serious problems in medical care in prisons, reaching constitutional dimensions, but the course of that litigation has substantially improved health care in the prison systems, and the two fine amicus briefs that were filed in this case by the ACLU and the American Public Health Association show that, and I submit that the Court of Appeals decision here in effect cuts Estelle in half, takes the doctors out as potential litigants, and would damage substantially the progress that has been made and turn us in the wrong direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.153" offset="6802384">If there are no further questions, I will reserve my remaining time.</text>
