            <text syncTime="8.899" offset="35527">Well, this case comes to us from the highest court of the State of Maryland and it concerns that State's capital sentencing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.416" offset="81607">The case doesn't blend itself very well though announcement from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.593" offset="98325">It involves the type of jury verdict form that was employed at that time in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.702" offset="130717">I think it must suffice to say that in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland insofar as it sustained the imposition of the death penalty upon the petitioner, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings, not in consistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.338" offset="209293">Justice Brennan and Justice White each have joined the opinion but have filed brief statements in concurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.176" offset="236669">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion and has joined therein by Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy.</text>
