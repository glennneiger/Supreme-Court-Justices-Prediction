            <text syncTime="1412.375" offset="5790911">There is discussion of that in the congressional reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.877" offset="5804912">That we don't want one court that's just going to be deciding one particular thing, and I might also point out that in this particular area, what we're doing here with the 112 issue as it arose in this case, it is a federal pre-emption question, and the irony of the case is that the Federal Circuit has specifically said, and we cite the case, Cable Electric, that federal pre-emption questions, which this Section 112 issue is, we do not believe that we have a mandate from Congress to unify the law on questions of federal pre-emption, and that we're going to follow the law of the regional circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.414" offset="5975022">So that had the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit actually come out with a different result on the merits, they would have looked to Seventh Circuit law to the extent that they could have divined it to determine whether or not there was federal pre-emption under the patent laws and, of course, this particular case is going to mean that if the result was different because of the exclusivity provision in Section 1338, which means that the states must hear... where the states now have a right to hear cases involving patent issues, but not patent cases, that any decision in a case such as this, and the Federal Circuit gave an example, if there was a state law anti-trust case brought, that that would mean even though they've heard these cases for a hundred years because of that exclusivity provision, they would have to come out of the state courts and into the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.718" offset="6240321">So, I think an answer to the question that as a matter of policy, the arising under concept makes sense because I don't think it's beneficial to bring all of the traditional cases that the states have held and bring them into the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.581" offset="10387730">The judge took the unprecedented step of patent violations and disgorged trade secrets.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.359" offset="10486891">The action created by the anti-trust laws would be under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.203" offset="10510192">The Plaintiff is proceeding to show that our patents are invalid and that the enforcement of those patents plus all the other elements of Section 2 amounts to a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.887" offset="10548958">Viewed that way, we must come to the same conclusion, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.161" offset="10566094">The Walker Process teaches and the related cases that fundamental to such an anti-trust claim is that the patents must not only be invalid, technically invalid, they must be obtained by fraud from the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.662" offset="10628057">So, inherent in Plaintiffs' claim, not a defense, is the invalidity element, and this law has been applied in the trade secret area, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="3646.697" offset="14728237">So, this whole business about Section 15(b)... by the way, Section 15(b) doesn't say that the complaint is amended, it said that the pleadings can be so, and what we have in this particular situation, we had the 112 issue, but it came up way down stream from the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.660" offset="14804096">So that we really had no patent issue in this case until Colt in its answer said we're justifying our anti-competitive conduct with a claim of state law protected trade secrets, and then, in an argument and in a reply to that claim of state law trade secrets, we injected the patent pre-emption issue for the first time, and that's the way it stayed through the end of this lawsuit.</text>
