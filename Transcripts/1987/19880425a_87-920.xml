            <text syncTime="14.241" offset="184803">The issue before the Court today is whether the State of Colorado may prohibit payment to persons who are circulating petitions to get an initiative measure on the ballot so long as it does not otherwise prohibit payment or otherwise limit the amount of money which proponents may spend.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.471" offset="257737">The purpose of the initiative in Colorado is to provide an alternative means through which the popular will may be expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.875" offset="291278">It is an addition to the already existing right to petition the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.945" offset="307578">It is not a limit on the right, but in fact extensive inherently.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.064" offset="328058">It provides a means by which the public may pass, actually pass legislation when the legislature, because of the influence of special interests, has ignored the public will.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.539" offset="373929">The initiative provisions provided for in the State Constitution and by Colorado statute are designed to ensure that the initiative remains a true alternative through which the collective will may be expressed, and to ensure that the integrity of the process remains in tact.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.952" offset="447595">In order to secure the purposes, the people of the State of Colorado, through both its constitute and its statutes, have set forth procedures which must be followed before a petition can get access to the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.176" offset="504542">The petition circulator in this process plays an absolutely crucial role which is in part set forth by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.317" offset="541113">He is not only the person who circulates the petition, but by constitutional provision he is also the one who transforms the petition into prima facie evidence that the signatures on the petition are in fact true and correct, and that the signatories are also registered electors of the State of Colorado.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.137" offset="7108401">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.891" offset="7131389">I appear before you today representing five individuals and a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.445" offset="7153541">My brother from the Colorado Bar, the Assistant Attorney General, appears representing two state elected officials There is a certain irony, however, though in our respective representations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.836" offset="7203174">Mr. Knaizer appears as a paid advocate, whereas I, more by circumstance than by choice, appears as an unpaid advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.406" offset="7233476">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.525" offset="7237864">I trust that any remarks I make in favor of paid versus unpaid will not be applied to my situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.529" offset="7261897">In this case, the same five individuals incorporation which have sent me to Court today to argue before the highest Court in our land, and try to convince you of the merit of their cause, also wished to hire advocates to go on the streets of the State of Colorado and to approach registered voters with their petitions, and ask these registered voters if they would sign the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.263" offset="7368894">They were involved in a basic First Amendment right, the right of free speech, and they were talking about certain fundamental political issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.102" offset="7400241">They were advocating a deregulation of the motor carrier industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.804" offset="7419049">And in this case, I submit that my clients were a grass roots campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.558" offset="7438067">They were seeking to change the status quo, and it was the status quo that, by and large, was opposed by the trucking industry; not entirely though.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.564" offset="7474011">Certain trucking companies, for example, Acme Delivery Service, had service throughout the metropolitan Denver, but wished to have statewide authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.670" offset="7510478">Certain other trucking industries wanted to be free from price regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.038" offset="7532003">These are the types of arguments which petition advocates would go before the voters and say, these are the reasons why we wish you to sign our petition; and they would engage the voter in a dialogue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.512" offset="7577874">And it was often a painful process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.131" offset="7588323">To approach someone cold on the street is not an easy task.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.349" offset="7601175">There is testimony in the record that it's a difficult task, but the petitioner circulator who does this for several hours, and is turned away, often without even given the chance to articulate his views, gets discouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.676" offset="7658540">The testimony was that money motivates people to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.663" offset="7678498">And while the volunteer motivated, money can also motivate someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.299" offset="7696992">And in order for my clients, the five individuals in the corporation to get this issue on the ballot, they had to obtain some 46,000 plus signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.672" offset="7734504">Those five individuals couldn't do the job by themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.708" offset="7746625">They either had to get someone else to volunteer their time, or they had to get other advocates to go out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.778" offset="7774942">Now the question has been raised, is there... you know, is there a split between a volunteer versus a paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.366" offset="7801273">Is it completely one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.218" offset="7808692">I would submit the record is different, that you get a combination of the two in the typical campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.788" offset="7830948">What you get are volunteers that are interested in the measure, but who could also be motivated by a certain amount of compensation, and money, at least enough to make it worth their while to go out on the street in this type of a fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2350.163" offset="9528489">They argued two points.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.900" offset="9551373">And I had difficulty pinning down what integrity means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.702" offset="9570599">In essence, I believe they were arguing that there must be some sort of a grass roots campaign, and that by paying petition circulators you are going to be violating that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.125" offset="9608320">And that is the integrity they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.708" offset="9618664">The other aspect of their state interest was that they felt there was some sort of correlation between the number of volunteers and the ultimate success on the merits, and this goes to their modicum of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.134" offset="9680313">Somehow that if you have sufficient fiery-eyed petition circulators to go out and gather these signatures, then probably you are going to have enough votes at the general election to have the thing passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2406.096" offset="9752202">And regarding the modicum of support, Colorado, of course, has a provision in the constitution that requires 5 percent of the electors who voted in the last Secretary of State's election who must sign this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.288" offset="9816986">So we are talking about, in our case, 46,000 plus signatures, and this establishes that modicum of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.211" offset="9856692">I would submit that there is a state interest in making sure that the ballot is not cluttered with issues that have no chance of passing.</text>
