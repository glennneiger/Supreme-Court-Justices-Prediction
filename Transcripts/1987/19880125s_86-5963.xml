            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 86-5963, Taylor against Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.968" offset="31869">In this case which comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Illinois Appellate Court for the First District, we hold in an opinion authored by Justice Stevens that the Sixth Amendment's Compulsory Process Clause does not absolutely prohibit a trial court from sanctioning a failure to comply with discovery rules by barring an undisclosed witness from testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.076" offset="124238">We hold also the petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated since it is clear from the record that this is one of the extreme cases in which a severe sanction is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.204" offset="164780">The violation was willful and the circumstances surrounding the violation created a strong inference that the witnesses' testimony would not be believable.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.041" offset="200098">Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Marshall and Justice Blackmun joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.464" offset="221832">Justice Blackmun has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
