            <text syncTime="81.718" offset="451961">We contend in this case that the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is in error and that the effect of the Appellee's argument and the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is to ask this Court to redefine either the role of counsel in an appeal or the nature of an appeal or both.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.887" offset="568572">In this particular case, the problem with that result is that, as Appellee concedes in their brief, it removes an appeal from the adversarial testing process once counsel reaches the conclusion that there is no merit to the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.033" offset="641192">In so doing, since Wisconsin has provided by its constitution that a client is entitled to an appeal as a matter of right, he is getting something less than that in the Wisconsin judicial system.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.693" offset="699811">Well, of course, indigent defendants who will get appeals as a matter of right as in Wisconsin are entitled to the benefit of counsel, but we have cases that say they're not going to get everything that the well-heeled criminal defendant is going to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.488" offset="775044">It just isn't in the nature of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.356" offset="782462">Probably a well-heeled defendant can walk into some law office and plunk down enough money to get the lawyer to make any claim the defendant tells him to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.870" offset="872533">For example, I think you are correct that a client who has a great deal of money can shop around.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.424" offset="894789">I think that was recognized in the United States v. Edwards, 7th Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.809" offset="908268">You can shop around and look for someone to make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.196" offset="925822">At the same time, this Court has held consistently that, in fact, in discussing the due process rule, they've also discussed it in the context of equal protection, and they say essentially the purpose of Anders is to try to provide a criminal defendant with the same type of representation he would receive if he were having a retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.091" offset="1005444">So, the Court has made that recognition in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.876" offset="1016519">Basically, in this situation, Appellee concedes that the purpose of this rule is to take the appeal out of the adversarial testing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.001" offset="1057061">Now, since the Court has previously described in Polk County v. Dodson and Evitts v. Lucey that an appeal is just that, it's the adversarial testing process, and that a client is deprived of due process when he has less than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.141" offset="1109620">In effect, what they are asking the Court to do is, in a context of a no merit appeal, take the appeal out of the adversarial process, redefine the nature of appeal, and give the client something less than that which he is entitled to as a matter of right in Wisconsin.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.622" offset="9487507">Very briefly, one of the arguments advanced by the Assistant Attorney General in this case is to argue that there is no way any so-called no merit letter to determine if an attorney acts as an advocate on behalf of the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.732" offset="9548007">I would point out to this Court that this case does not present that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.750" offset="9568069">This is a case where counsel has identified issues on behalf of the client, so the Court is in a better position to determine whether or not counsel's assessment is accurate based on the identification of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.093" offset="9621463">This is not the same as the situation that was presented in Anders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.295" offset="9634211">In addition, the state has conceded once again here in the argument that a client will not receive a full appeal in an Anders situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.103" offset="9681440">This is directly contrary to the Wisconsin constitutional provision that provides that all criminal defendants receive an appeal as a matter of right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2405.814" offset="9748314">That's correct, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court in making that ruling basically admitted that it was going beyond the requirements of Anders and that it was asking an attorney to do something more than remain as an advocate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2421.138" offset="9809649">But I don't see how you can rely here on a violation of the Wisconsin Constitution when the Supreme Court of Wisconsin has upheld the thing.</text>
