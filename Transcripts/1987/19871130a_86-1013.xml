            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="13.141" offset="194358">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.009" offset="213793">The question presented in this case is whether the free exercise clause bars the Government from constructing a road on government land in a national forest and from harvesting timber in that forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.751" offset="256739">The site of these proposed Government actions is the northern part of the Six Rivers National Forest, which is located in Northern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.238" offset="286727">It is important to note at the outset that this land was never contained within an Indian reservation, is not the subject of Indian treaty, and is not otherwise impressed with any Indian trust obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.046" offset="329882">Let me begin by briefly discussing the history of the Forest Service's decision to construct the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.747" offset="340749">Since at least the 1930s, a series of unpaved roads through Six Rivers National Forest has linked the California towns of Gasquet and Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.286" offset="378887">The Forest Service concluded in the 1960s that an improved road network was necessary both for its timber harvesting program and for other purposes, and it embarked upon a plan to construct a paved road linking the two towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.030" offset="433849">Two separate segments of the road totalling forty-nine miles have now been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.017" offset="457777">All that remains is the construction of a six-mile paved segment that will link up the two completed segments and complete the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.838" offset="489124">In 1977, Forest Service issued a draft environmental impact statement discussing alternative proposals for the construction of the remaining segment of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.828" offset="533010">The comments received by the Forest Service indicated that the area had religious significance for several Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.149" offset="558296">The Forest Service accordingly deferred its decision on whether or not to construct the road and commissioned a comprehensive ethnographic study of the Indian cultural and religious sites that were located in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.523" offset="603854">The 423-page report, prepared at the Forest Service's direction, revealed that a portion of the Six Rivers National Forest is known to the Yurok, Karok and Tolowa Indian tribes as the "high country" and that many of these tribes' religious beliefs and rituals focus upon that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.318" offset="671041">Journeys to the high country are an important part of the Indians' religious practices, and these journeys frequently include the performance of rituals at specific sites in the high country.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.840" offset="709075">The report stated that a successful spiritual--</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="158.284" offset="774904">--Your Honor, it's not clear from the record, I don't think, whether specific sites... I don't think that the report purported to document every exact site where a ritual is performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.325" offset="818998">For example, part of the ritual is the way one acts when... at any time one is in the high country.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.561" offset="843971">So, I think from the Indians' point of view, it is leading to distinguish between the sites at which actual rituals are performed and the other sites, because I think from their point of view, the entire area is sacred.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.203" offset="890574">I don't think that any of the sites, at least the principal sites, of greatest spiritual significance, those are not located where the road would be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.642" offset="928295">Those are located away from the road.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="198.511" offset="935818">No, but if actually the site included the site of the six-mile road, that might have a bearing, might it not, on the extent of the burden on their free exercise rights?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_pincus" startTime="212.936" stopTime="327.292">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="212.936" offset="993496">Well, Your Honor, as I said, from the Indians' point of view, I don't think they would distinguish in any way between the site.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.388" offset="1011260">I think, as a matter of fact, the sites where rituals are performed are not... the road is not going to go over those particular sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.744" offset="1040726">The report stated that a successful spiritual use of the high country is dependent upon and facilitated by certain qualities of the physical environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.634" offset="1088269">The most important of which are privacy, silence and an undisturbed natural setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.419" offset="1107390">The Forest Service consultants concluded that construction of the road would eliminate the required natural conditions and would, therefore, seriously damage the Indians' religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.561" offset="1148037">That's why, in further answer to your question, Justice Brennan, the Indians, if they are on a site where they are conducting a ritual, the fact that another part of the high country has been disturbed or changed from its natural state is as much of a burden as if that actual site that they were standing on had been disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.789" offset="1220866">So, they just don't make a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.023" offset="1225882">After considering the consultants' report, the Forest Service announced its decision regarding the construction of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.878" offset="1253258">The Service found that the completion of the road was very significant to the development of timber and recreational resources in the area and that the road would enhance the efficiency of administrative services, such as fire control.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.186" offset="1302473">At the same time, the Forest Service recognized the importance of the Indians' religious interests in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.923" offset="1325460">It reconciled these two opposing interests by determining to go ahead with the construction of the road, but to do so in a manner that minimized the intrusion upon the Indians' religious interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.962" offset="1369555">The Service emphasized that construction of the road would not deprive any believer of access to the sacred area, and it adopted the route alternative that was located farthest away from significant spiritual sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.336" offset="1415113">Finally, it specified mitigation measures in connection with the design of the road that would reduce the audio and visual impact of the road on the surrounding area.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.292" offset="1450953">Mr. Pincus, can I ask one factual question I was a little unclear on?</text>
            <text syncTime="331.263" offset="1466835">There is now an unpaved segment that joins the two roads, is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="351.225" offset="1546665">Well, it's not because Congress designated after the District Court proceedings in this case, Congress designated a large segment of this area as a wilderness, and what the wilderness designation does is to close the area to traffic, and the site of the paved road was preempted from the wilderness designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.488" offset="1619704">The site of the unpaved road is included in the wilderness designation.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.752" offset="3592784">Some courts have held that an injunction in favor of the Indian religious claim would constitute an establishment of religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.998" offset="3677735">The threshold question on the constitutional issue presented in this case is whether the construction of the road and the adoption of the management plan impose a burden on the Indians' rights that calls the free exercise clause into play, and viewed from the Indians' perspective, these government actions obviously have an adverse effect on religious interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.079" offset="3762058">They eliminate the conditions necessary for effective spiritual use of an area that is very important to the Indians' religion, but the free exercise clause is not implicated whenever the Government acts in a manner that offends an individual's religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.053" offset="3809914">A believer's conclusion that government action impacts adversely upon his belief system is not by itself sufficient to trigger constitutional protection, and that was really the holding of this Court joined by eight members in Bowen v. Roy.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.062" offset="3869996">The Plaintiffs in Roy challenged the Government's use of the social security number to identify their daughter and they asserted that the use of that number would rob their daughter of her spirit and prevent her from attaining greater spiritual power, and despite the undisputed assertion that the Government's use of the number would cause severe spiritual harm to the Plaintiffs, the Court found no burden on free exercise rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.512" offset="3959753">We think that Roy makes clear that it's necessary to look beyond the believer's subjective assessment of the effect of government action.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.031" offset="4077826">It is our position that under the Constitution, because the Constitution does not require the Government to do anything, we think that it's certainly appropriate to do exactly what the Forest Service did in this case, which is to consider those interests heavily, to investigate them fully, and to take account of them to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the statutory framework that Congress has set up, and that's precisely what Congress mandated when it enacted the American Indian Religious Freedom Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.646" offset="4180331">What Congress specifically did not do and expressly did not do was to create an additional substantive right for Indian religious claims of this sort, and we think that the Constitution doesn't do that either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.489" offset="4231740">Now, so, in addition to the believer's claim that there is subjectively... that he finds interference with his belief system, there has to be an objective element to the government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.749" offset="4292762">It has to satisfy an objective test and we think that the Court's decision in Bowen v. Roy sets forth what that objective test is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.736" offset="4320660">In concluding that the Government's use of the social security number did not implicate the free exercise clause, the Court said that the clause had not been interpreted to require the Government itself to behave in ways that the individual believes will further his or her spiritual development, and the Court also observed that the clause is written in terms of what the individual cannot do... what the Government cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the individual can expect from the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.976" offset="4565689">I think the line is that in those cases, what the Government did was put an objective burden on the individual's choice about what course of conduct he or she was going to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.999" offset="4605709">The Government put a monetary price over choosing one alternative or the other, and that is an objective indicia of coercion, and that's exactly what the Court said in those opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.022" offset="4641862">It analogized what the Government had done by conditioning the benefit to direct coercive regulation, and we don't think that there's anything in the land management decisions that are at issue here that has those objective indicia of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.281" offset="4698913">It just doesn't say anything to these individuals one way or the other about what they should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.435" offset="4715527">We think that's a very, very important line to draw in the religion context because in the religion clauses... let me start differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.874" offset="4761294">Most of the protections of the Constitution, such as the free speech clause or the Fourth Amendment, protect objectively-identified interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.980" offset="4789715">What is... this Court can decide what is speech and it can decide what reasonable expectations of privacy are protected under the Fourth Amendment, but the Court cannot decide what religion is because the Constitution leaves that to each individual to decide for himself or herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.072" offset="4850006">The problem that is really posed by the free exercise clause is how the clause can be applied without sweeping every kind of government action under its umbrella because an individual is free to attach religious significance to anything the Government does or anything the Government fails to do, and, so, if there's no objective limit on what the clause covers, everything can be converted into a free exercise claim just by the individual believing very sincerely that that action that the Government has taken infringes upon his or her religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.592" offset="4972154">We think that's why it's especially important in this context to make clear that there's an additional objective standard that the government actions have to be measured against before the free exercise clause protections are triggered, and that objective standard, I think, is the distinction that the Court was driving at in Roy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.820" offset="5041013">It's the distinction between government interference with individual conduct on one hand and individual control of government action on the other, and, really, what the clause does is shield the individual and his person and his property against government reaching in and coercively affecting his individual decisions about how to order his life and to order his property, and when the Government does that, either directly with regulation or indirectly by conditioning government benefits in a way that has the effect of regulation, then there's a free exercise violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.358" offset="5167132">But if the Government doesn't do that, if it doesn't say anything about what the individual should do or what the individual shouldn't do with his property or just does something with its own property, we don't think that that's a free exercise burden that calls the Constitution into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.599" offset="5220109">Let me just briefly say that the contrary conclusion, acceptance of Respondent's contention, would just work in dramatic, dramatic effect upon the Government's authority to regulate and control its own land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.044" offset="5285937">Hundreds, if not thousands, of Indian sacred sites are located on federal land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.114" offset="5310179">The boundaries of those sites are very amorphous and under Respondent's theory, any action taken with respect to those sites would be subject to a free exercise challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.220" offset="5342675">The important thing is that it's not just Indian claims because the Constitution can't prefer Indian claims, Indian religious claims over other religious claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.624" offset="5980272">That's probably the more logical way to take care of that problem, that there would be a discrimination against religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.611" offset="6004200">Anyway, just to conclude, I think what's important to note is that this is not... the claim that's asserted here is not a claim that can constitutionally be limited to traditional Indian religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.721" offset="6068670">It really would be a claim that would be available to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.025" offset="6085807">I just want to briefly touch upon our alternative argument, that if the Court disagrees with our principal submission and believes that there is a cognizable burden on the free exercise of religion here, we think that the compelling interest test has to be applied in a dramatically different way to take account of the very different interests that are presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.670" offset="6164383">First, as we've been discussing, to the extent that Respondent has stated the free exercise claim, it's a very different kind of a claim than those previously recognized by this Court, and we think, because it does intrude less into individual autonomy, is deserving of somewhat less protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.198" offset="6226554">Second, as the Court has recognized in the free speech context, the Government is entitled to somewhat more constitutional leeway when it acts in its capacity as a landowner, and we think that principle is especially weighty here because what we're talking about is not simply access, which is what is at issue in the public forum cases, but control of the management and the physical development of the land and, really, we're talking about using the Constitution to impose a much greater limitation on the Government, and we think that when those interests are factored together, the appropriate way for the test to be applied is to say that the Government's general interest in managing its land, combined with the particularized showing that the challenged decision is reasonable, should permit the government action to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.050" offset="12449967">One has got to look at the site being used, is it being used for religious purposes, is the Government's action occurring where the particular practice has to occur, and, so, that's a scare tactic that has no meaning when you look at it in terms of a factual case-by-case determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.261" offset="12514750">History, in fact, the cases show that while the courts have said that Indians do have First Amendment rights on those lands, it should be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.200" offset="12550590">Factually, the claims are very difficult to sustain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.902" offset="12561353">Not all claims, as I've noted, will be found to be religious, as in Sequoyah v. TVA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.306" offset="12582982">There was no use being made of that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.056" offset="12589983">Not all religious practices have to be conducted at the particular site, and, so, it would not interfere with the Government's proposal at all unless you could show that, and not all land projects are going to seriously interfere with it, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.418" offset="12763436">In conclusion, Respondent submits that the rule used by the court below strikes a proper balance and that the other Circuit Courts have felt rather than just throwing this religion totally out on the streets, that this was one way of meeting both concerns, and we feel that it is an appropriate way that should be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="3176.598" offset="12848177">Just a few things, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.117" offset="12858208">First of all, with reference to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, as we discussed in our reply brief, we don't believe that Congress created any substantive rights when it passed that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.323" offset="12894989">The second point I'd like to make is about the Roy case and the distinction that Roy does not apply because no practice was involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.579" offset="12924037">We think that that's a little bit of a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.545" offset="12931978">The only link between what the Government has done in the practice here, we think, is the link that Respondents believe that their practices will just not be spiritually effective anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.970" offset="12977640">But I don't think that there are... there are no findings of the courts below that those practices would be physically prevented by what the Government is proposing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.242" offset="13010763">And, finally, I'd like to discuss Respondent's suggestion that the serious interference requirement will take care of the line-drawing problems that came up in her colloquy with the various members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.133" offset="13062277">We think the problem with that test is it's really not an objective test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.852" offset="13077114">If a religious believer asserts that a government action has a serious interference with his beliefs or with what he wants to do, then that acceptance has to be... that assertion has to be accepted by the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.064" offset="13150048">The road would not only serve... first of all, it does not only serve logging interests, it serves maintenance interests and recreational interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.919" offset="13185470">Second of all, it will also provide a conduit for logging trucks from other parts of this forest and neighboring forests to enable the logs to get to the mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.041" offset="13221937">So, it still has purposes, and I note that forty-nine of the fifty-five miles have already been built.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.159" offset="13238342">Anyway, the serious interference test is not a real limitation, and a court can't look behind what the believer said, and, so, any believer can come into court and say just what the hypothetical posed by Justice O'Connor, that the entry of non-believers into the area offends, will make their practices impossible, and the court will have to accept that and under Respondent's theory, we submit that would be a burden on the free exercise of religion that would require the Government to show a compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.862" offset="13357147">We just don't think that the free exercise clause stretches that far and we think that the Court's decision in Roy disposes of Respondent's claim here.</text>
