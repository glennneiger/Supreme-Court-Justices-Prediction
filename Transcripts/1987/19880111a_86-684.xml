            <text syncTime="64.771" offset="384582">This case is here on certiorari to the California Court of Appeals, Fourth Appellate District.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.862" offset="412899">In February 1984, the Laguna Beach Police Department received some tips over the telephone that the occupants of a specific residence located in the City of Laguna Beach were involved in drug trafficking.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.120" offset="485937">Based on that information, on April 6, 1984 and again on May 4th, investigators of the Police Department contacted the regular municipal trash collector when the morning trash was collected at that residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.033" offset="565663">The investigators requested of the trash collector that he go down the street, pick up the trashbags that were in front of the residents' garage, were located in the public street in front of the garage, that that trash collector on each instance not mingle or mix the bags with other trash in his truck and that he bring those bags down the block to the investigator, which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.492" offset="671511">The investigator in each of these two instances returned to the Police Department with those trashbags and examined the contents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.293" offset="4518721">Preceding somewhat backwards from how I'd intended to proceed, I think I would like first if I may to answer Justice O'Connor's question about the appropriateness of arguing the due process claim in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.504" offset="4591550">There are several different aspects of this which I think dictate that the issue should be addressed on its merits by this Court, not the least of which are the circumstances that were existing at the time this matter was argued in the Municipal Court, in the Superior Court and in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.121" offset="4670022">In California for a period of over fifteen years, stare decisis had dictated that searches essentially identical to the one in this case were unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.632" offset="4715998">Much of our discussion, virtually all of our discussion revolved around concepts of stare decisis and so there was no need at those Court levels, and I repeatedly stressed that at those Court levels, there is no need to get into a detailed analysis of the State law issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.811" offset="4800739">However, that is not the same thing as to say that the State law issue was waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.136" offset="4822055">Indeed, the State law issue was raised in the Municipal Court, although tersely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1183.242" offset="4858417">The State law issue, and I'll perhaps get into this a little deeper on the merits in a moment, but the State law issue itself is Article I, Section 13 of the California Constitution provides for protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.377" offset="4910976">Article I, Section 1 provides for a right of privacy which is described as inalienable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1225.022" offset="5025601">The argument centered, and I think this is abundantly clear from the transcript, the argument in the Municipal Court centered around the fact that Krivda in its second opinion on remand had decided that the original decision was based on both State and Federal grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1257.243" offset="5154437">Well, if it's been decided that both Federal and State grounds support Krivda, certainly the Federal question is posed, is it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.068" offset="5189754">The Federal question is posed but it is not posed entirely by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.395" offset="5207100">And I think if I may go back just a little bit and explain what I mean by that because we get into a number of problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.735" offset="5236461">First of all, Krivda originally was decided before Michigan v. Long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.812" offset="5256732">I don't think that anybody has seriously contended it, and if they do, I'm prepared to address it but I don't think anybody has seriously contended that Krivda was not also decided upon independent State grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.073" offset="5301768">Indeed, this Court seems to have recognized that fact, at least the dissent of this Court seems to have recognized that fact in California v. Rooney quite recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.536" offset="5355684">I don't think that we need to get into an extended analysis of would the original Krivda opinion have survived a Michigan v. Long analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.124" offset="5401973">And I note that in a footnote, petitioner has sort of alluded to that problem, although not really briefed it in any detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.481" offset="5431439">So the answer to the Court's question I believe is as simple as, yes, there is a Federal question posed in the sense that part of Krivda rested on Federal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.883" offset="5476997">There is an independent State ground clearly presented because Krivda in addition relied on its own independent State grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.572" offset="5603743">The State law issue and the due process argument which I make in this Court was specifically, although again very tersely raised at the Superior Court level in the argument on the Section 995 Motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.847" offset="5672915">That would be Reporter's transcript at page 16 where I pointed out that we are specifically not waiving Article I, Section 13, and that we are relying in part on the rationale that Article I, Section 28(d) which did away with the State's exclusionary rule, was violative of the principle in Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.478" offset="5771449">That is the germ of the argument that I make at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.462" offset="5783361">It was made tersely and I will concede that it was made very tersely because the state of the law in California at the time this matter was going through the municipal Court, the Superior Court and the Court of Appeals, was stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.909" offset="5837173">Either analysis you took, stare decisis came up at the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.126" offset="5850025">As far as raising this in opposition to the petition for certiorari, a Federal question at this point seems to me to be raised on two different fronts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.153" offset="5886074">There is the Federal question that is posed to this Court relating to whether or not the trashcan search as indicated in this case or as based on the facts in this case violates the Fourth Amendment in the straight Fourth Amendment issue itself in the purest sense, and that is squarely presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.864" offset="5968935">But there is another Federal question I think that is raised as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.894" offset="5985026">The problem in California is not that the search under California law was lawful, because under California law the search was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.828" offset="6016791">The problem is by reason of the adoption of Article I, Section 28(d), California Courts are without power to cure or correct or remedy or deter, more appropriately, even an intentional and a willful violation of State Constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.448" offset="6527328">In adopting Mapp, this Court, even in view of the progeny of Mapp which has laid more and more stress on the deterrence rationale, even in view of that and perhaps even more because of that, the result so long as Mapp is viewed as good law and is constitutionally compelled through the due process clause, I think the question that need be posed is that of whether or not California or any State for that matter may define a right as fundamental or as inalienable and refuse any effective remedy or any effective enforcement for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.089" offset="6677898">To say that there are civil suits possible is the same argument that was made in the interim period between Wolfe v. Colorado and Mapp v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.882" offset="6721052">To the extent that Mapp is constitutionally compelled under the due process clause, the same analogy applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.222" offset="6746339">And it is one thing to say that it is a matter of California law, and indeed, it is a matter of California law determining the scope of the right of privacy as in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.125" offset="6781970">But the question that it does not answer and does not even address the question of can California define that right as encompassing say a search like the one in the present case and yet have no effective means, have the Court completely stripped of its ability to use a deterrent effect, the analogy for Mapp in order to enforce its own constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.771" offset="6876533">And the answer is that if the State is in fact legitimately even in view of the Federal due process clause stripped of that ability, then what's left?</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.815" offset="6916762">And by the analysis in Mapp, what is left is that just as in this case, the State, the police are entitled to intentionally and deliberately and willfully violate the State Constitution and the State Supreme Court is absolutely powerless to do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.292" offset="6990636">If it were not that this raises the due process clause issue, then indeed the underpinnings of Mapp itself become questionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.770" offset="7044553">This Court has historically not exercised a general supervisory power over State searches and seizures and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.487" offset="7075482">The rationale behind Mapp is that it was compelled by the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.391" offset="7091051">That same due process clause I submit compels the conclusion that this Court use the due process clause to rule that California may not define a right as fundamental and inalienable and yet withhold the only thing that this Court has held for many many years at this point is an effect remedy or an effective deterrent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.411" offset="7355096">First, with one qualifier, the qualifier would be limiting it to essentially fundamental rights which the State has already or will find to be fundamental substantial Constitutional rights bearing on the right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.607" offset="7419880">To the extent that Justice Scalia is questioning why is it that this follows from Mapp, it is not that the holding in Mapp which is indeed as the Justice just described it directed towards violation of Fourth Amendment Federal law and the Federal right of privacy, it is not that the holding directly applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.726" offset="7500442">What I'm suggesting is the force, the dynamics behind Mapp and why it applies through the due process clause as opposed to through some non-existent supervisory power that this Court would have over the States in general applies to this situation equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.624" offset="7568047">Because if you're saying that Mapp has to apply through the due process clause to enforce Fourth Amendment rights because that's the only way that you can insure that the State Police in essence will respect the Fourth Amendment right, what I'm saying is that that same due process command to use an exclusionary rule applies to make the State enforce its own law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.892" offset="7697092">However, as recognized by this Court in Hewitt v. Helms and also Vitek v. Jones, there the due process clause recognizes rights that are created by Federal law and also those that are created under State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.016" offset="7861559">And that is why it applies through the due process clause in such a fashion very similarly to the way, not identically to the way but very very similarly to the way that Mapp v. Ohio compelled State obedience to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.243" offset="7926447">I think the way to underline why that is so necessary is that historical context of this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.365" offset="7962914">It has probably never happened, or at least to my knowledge, it has never happened in the history of this country since Mapp, that a State has developed a body of law which we will put under the general rubric of independent state grounds, that respects certain rights of privacy in its citizens, and thereafter have the State stripped of its ability to enforce that same right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.797" offset="8172729">As soon as we have the advent of Article I, Section 28(d) there is what can only be described as a willful and deliberate violation of State Constitutional privilege as defined in the Krivda cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.915" offset="8701134">I think the answer to that really comes from turning the question only slightly, and I mean very slightly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.216" offset="9590342">All right, I think that would defeat the purpose of any search whatsoever, and I might indicate too, that it is not our suggestion and it is not my argument, either as a matter of Fourth Amendment law or as a matter of State law, that a trash search is illegal in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.616" offset="9664008">It is illegal when there is no probable cause and there is no warrant or there is no exigent circumstance excusing the use of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.987" offset="9693474">In this case the people eschewed at the trial court level any theory that they were going on probable cause or exigent circumstances, and so the question is squarely presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="2409.776" offset="9764631">There is suggestion, and it's dicta, but there is suggestion in that, and indeed, that's a matter that the State Court can address itself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.117" offset="9797963">And I suppose that in view of the political shift in California, there's always the question as to whether or not California will redefine the fundamental nature of privacy as it bears on cases like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.565" offset="9847805">That is a State court function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.971" offset="9857418">The due process clause I think becomes involved only to the extent that they continue to recognize the right but withhold the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.328" offset="9882809">And I would, if I may, on the question of whether there's a distinction between substantive due process or procedural due process here, it is... and I realize that in cases like Vitek v. Jones, what's really being discussed is the procedures by which the right is taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.804" offset="9956683">But the shift in emphasis in this Court since Mapp in terms of what is the rationale for Mapp v. Ohio, and why is it necessary, it has put it in the rubric of a procedural necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.908" offset="10013108">It is not an integral part necessarily of the Fourth Amendment but it is a procedural necessity, without it, there's no way of enforcing the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.780" offset="10048634">And so we're talking about procedure in both senses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.029" offset="10057621">We're talking about the procedure by which the State takes away a right in the sense that it was used in Vitek v. Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.197" offset="10086251">We were also talking about the procedure by which the State either enforces or by not enforcing takes away the right of privacy in this case, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.975" offset="10121359">And if there could be any question, can there be any question of the necessity for the deterrent effect of an exclusionary rule, I think the fact that we're here some many many years after the opinion in Krivda answers that fairly squarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.374" offset="10190950">In terms of, and I'll return just briefly to the question that Justice O'Connor did pose, which is the raisability of this issue, as I'd indicated, essentially this argument was raised in the Superior Court without objection by the State whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.706" offset="10316337">The State did not request in their brief that this Court not address the merits of this, although there's a passing reference to the timing of the raising of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.874" offset="10360954">The passing reference is not entirely accurate factually as the record would indicate, if one looks at Reporter's transcript, page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.463" offset="10391361">The issue is also purely one of law, and it is purely one of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.945" offset="10417274">And this Court clearly has the discretion under its own holding in Singleton v. Wolfe to entertain the merits of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.989" offset="10445487">And I would urge the Court to do so, particularly since it presents a substantial issue of Constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.657" offset="10484148">Now, if I may address briefly the question of the trash search itself, and I address it here not just a question of State law as we've been discussing for the last several minutes, but rather as either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.430" offset="10567217">Should it be included within the concept of a reasonable expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.412" offset="10587175">In part, the question I think can be posed why, as in why should this Court extend or apply... which I think is perhaps a better term... a reasonable expectation of privacy to opaque plastic trashbags placed out at the curbside for collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.217" offset="10662408">The issue breaks down in my mind at least to almost a why and a why not, and it is almost the latter aspect of it which seems to be the most important, or at least it's the most revealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.165" offset="10710159">On the primary question of why, it is fairly clear, and I think even the dissent in Rooney recognized that many people put all sorts of things that reveal their lifestyle that are secrets that are private in their trash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.564" offset="10791766">If you lay it out on the sidewalk not in an opaque bag so that anybody passing by can see it, I suppose there's no reasonable expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.747" offset="10828442">If it's put in an opaque container, especially under the circumstances involved in this case where it is to be picked up by the trash man, it is to be put in the trash truck and within seconds, and the record here I think demonstrates that, within seconds of it being picked up by the trashman, ordinarily the mixing part of the garbage truck would mix it in with all the other trash, and it would become essentially lost forever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2736.161" offset="11070127">--It is an interesting fact that in this case, and really in any of the cases that I've read about including I think it's U.S. v. Terry where the DEA monitored somebody's trash off and on for a period of six months that at no time did the police in this case or the DEA in that case have to fight this horde of people that were standing around the man's trash in order to get at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.573" offset="11163750">To talk about the mere possibility that a dog may get at somebody's trash or that the next door neighbor might come over and get at somebody's trash it seems to me avoids what is the real question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.565" offset="11227802">What is the ordinary reasonable expectation of any normal ordinary citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.455" offset="11247341">The fact that there might occur a private intrusion... what I mean is a non-State action intrusion into the trash, whether it's by a dog or by a next door neighbor who wants to compile a dossier on their neighbor doesn't really answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.964" offset="11317350">This Court, for instance, in Jacobsen and Walters drew a distinction between the private search and the State action type search that involves governmental intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.132" offset="11357996">It seems to me that there would have been no occasion for this Court to have looked into the question of the scope of the governmental search in relation to the private search if it were not for the fact that the private search is not a Fourth Amendment issue, not because it's proper, not because it doesn't invade the reasonable expectation of privacy as to the householder, but because it involves no State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.353" offset="11474920">And that's exactly why if you have the fact of a private search that invades somebody's privacy to the extent that the person's privacy has been breached by the perhaps unreasonable but not governmental private search, the Court will recognize that breach, but only to that extent and only within that scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.453" offset="11571364">And I believe that it was Justice Scalia in your opinion in O'Connor v. Ortega where the Court defined the question of privacy not as a matter of absolute solitude but privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.792" offset="11624654">And so if you put your trash in opaque plastic bags out for collection reasonably knowing that what's going to happen is that it's going to be there for a half an hour, maybe an hour, the trash guy's going to come by, he's going to pick it up, put it in the trash truck, and the trash truck itself will chew up all the trash and stuff it in the back with everybody else's trash, the fact that there is some remote possibility that you don't have 100 percent certainty that your trash will not be looked into by someone, would not seem to have a really significant impact on that reasonable expectation.</text>
