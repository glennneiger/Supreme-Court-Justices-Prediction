            <label>Mr. Michael J. Hayes</label>
            <text syncTime="12.891" offset="193035">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.926" offset="213202">This case comes before you today and presents two issues regarding the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Illinois Parental Notice of Abortion Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.651" offset="252072">Does the Act's twenty-four parental consultation period unduly interfere with the right of an unmarried, unemancipated minor to make her abortion decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="37.589" offset="291778">Secondly, does the judicial alternative to parental notice found in Section 5 of the Act provide a constitutionally sufficient framework to provide an expeditious confidential appeal from Circuit Court opinion adverse to the minor?</text>
            <text syncTime="52.866" offset="352905">Also, this Court has postponed consideration of its jurisdiction to hear this appeal and directed that it be considered with the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.038" offset="385610">I shall initially address the jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.490" offset="399403">Most recently, this Court has made it clear that jurisdiction under Section 28 USC 1254, Part 2, is appropriate where, as inn this case, the order appealed from is final and there are no facts to be developed at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.785" offset="468575">This case falls squarely within those elements of Section 1254.2 jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.522" offset="491563">The 7th Circuit order from which we appeal is clearly final.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.974" offset="505355">No further action to be taken by the lower court will be had on any question of fact or law presently within this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.763" offset="540569">There is no additional relief the Plaintiff can receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.215" offset="554361">There is no relief that the Defendant can receive from any adverse ruling of the 7th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.286" offset="578603">The District Court cannot reverse the holding of unconstitutionality of the twenty-four hour period, parental consent period, nor can it reverse the holding of unconstitutionality as the exceptions to that period found in Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.230" offset="646417">Neither can the District Court reverse the 7th Circuit on its finding that the existing judicial by-pass provided in Illinois law is constitutionally insufficient to meet the requirements of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.324" offset="702737">The Court has, therefore, issued final orders on the unconstitutionality on the twenty-four parental consultation period, Section 5 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.298" offset="758639">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.333" offset="770760">Section 4 of the Act and on the exceptions thereto in Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.368" offset="786955">It has also issued a final order that the judicial by-pass procedures found in the Act provided by the Illinois legislature are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.772" offset="816526">The only conceivable action on remand is hypothetical and contingent upon the some day possible activity of a party not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.913" offset="861143">The Act has been permanently enjoined and the statute was held constitutional inoperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.317" offset="886743">We contend that clearly makes the order of the 7th Circuit final.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.435" offset="899178">Jurisdictional statutes should be strictly construed, but they should be applied in a practical rather than a hyper-technical fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.743" offset="944422">Mr. Hayes, didn't the 7th Circuit reserve judgment as to a part of the matter pending in the promulgation of rules by the Supreme Court of Illinois?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Hayes</label>
            <text syncTime="210.199" offset="982247">--Your Honor, it could appear that way, but a practical look at the opinion and a close reading of it clearly indicates that the statute that the legislature passed with its by-pass procedures coupled with the rules that exist in Illinois under our Supreme Court rules for appellate practice were held to be constitutionally insufficient as they exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.429" offset="1059151">They did indicate that the case would go back in any event the Supreme Court ever passed the rules in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.183" offset="1086214">They might then consider having the District Court look at those, but as the case came before the 7th Circuit from the District Court, it is clear that everything that was there was held to be unconstitutional on those three issues that I've mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.282" offset="1790580">I think it's not correct or illogical to ask the Supreme Court of Illinois to go into a rule-making process for a statute that has never had one day of operative effect because of the intervention, we contend, improperly of the Federal District Court in entering the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.243" offset="1858394">So, this case is precisely the type of case that Congress intended this Court to review on appeal under 1254.2.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.516" offset="1899563">The 7th Circuit expressly held provisions of an Illinois law unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.270" offset="1922551">The ruling of unconstitutionality has interrupted a program which the 7th Circuit recognized as promulgated to further significant state interest of the state of minors and of parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.847" offset="1976885">The order of the 7th Circuit requires the Illinois Supreme Court to expend time and resources in order to get a ruling on an effective statute and those are the types of comity concerns that 1254 was passed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.324" offset="2054730">To allow a state statute to be reviewed, we contend that if this case or this order is held not to be final, the comity concerns 1254.2 was intended to foster would be thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.568" offset="2111782">The Court clearly, in our opinion, has jurisdiction to hear this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.138" offset="2130067">Additionally, however, should this Court determine now to grant review under 1254.2, we would ask it to exercise its discretionary authority to hear this case under a petition for writ of certiorari, Section 2103.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.362" offset="2186910">There are important issues of public policy involved in this case and that review by this Court will be significant in assisting Illinois in this statute and in others and other states who are confused and unclear because of the decisions in this case in the regulation of these areas, as to what are the boundaries that their statutes must stay within.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.430" offset="2287220">Mr. Hayes, do you think, moving from the question of whether we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, is it clear that the District Court had proper jurisdiction to entertain this suit in the first place?</text>
            <text syncTime="549.237" offset="2338420">As I understand it, the suit was brought with respect to a statute that envisioned the promulgation of emergency rules by the Illinois Supreme Court, and the suit was brought before those rules had ever been issued, and the District Court jumped right in to create the situation that you describe, which, in your words, is deterring the Illinois Supreme Court from ever issuing those rules since they are rules governing a statute that's been declared unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.209" offset="2466315">Justice Scalia, I would agree with you that... I think that's the problem with the Appellees' suggestion that this case isn't ripe because if it's not ripe for review under 1254.2 because the Supreme Court didn't pass some rules and those rules have never existed, that same argument means that it wasn't ripe at the District Court level, and that the injunctions that were entered were improperly entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.491" offset="2559416">That's another reason why I think the Court has to find finality here, and that the argument raised on appeal to this Court that because of that possibility of rules existing, some day in the future, it destroys the ripeness for appeal and reviewing this case, that same argument taken to its logical extreme in the other hand would destroy the justiciability of the case in the first instance in the trial court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Hayes</label>
            <text syncTime="744.332" offset="3118750">They have found that it was the intention and the Plaintiffs allege that it was the intention of the Illinois officials, namely the Attorney General of the state, to enforce the statute upon its becoming effective as it existed, and that because there was not what they believed to be necessary additional specificity in the rules of the Supreme Court, the Court enjoined it from going ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.847" offset="3208820">So that the threatened action of having the statute effective was enough in the Plaintiff's view and in the Court's rule to get jurisdiction to enjoin the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.869" offset="3248944">As to the constitutionality of the provision in the statute for the twenty-four hour period of parental consultation, the Court below, the 7th Circuit, acknowledged that the state has significant interest in promoting parental consultation in a minor's abortion decision, and in protecting the right of a parent to be involved in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.401" offset="3343089">The interest as to the child is based upon the recognized presumption that minors aren't able to make decisions in an informed and mature manner on very important subject matters, such as the abortion decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.178" offset="3402231">The state significant interest also takes into account its ability to protect the constitutional right of the parent to supervise, direct, nurture and properly control the upbringing of their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.753" offset="3452490">Thus, the Court in the 7th Circuit recognized that by requiring minors to give notice of their impending abortion decision to their parents, the statute and the state were validly promoting the interest and preserving the state's interest in family structure, its obligation to protect minors from their own immaturity, and also protecting the rights of individuals as parents to have a say-so and consult with their minor children in a very important family personal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.607" offset="3575893">After acknowledging these important issues, however, and recognizing that notice was intended to foster that important consultation, 7th Circuit struck as unconstitutional a short twenty-four waiting period after notice, indicating that the type of a wait was too burdensome on the minor's abortion decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.222" offset="3674322">That result is illogical and not supported by any precedence in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.976" offset="3693339">Notice without time for a meaningful consultation is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.363" offset="3710893">The Court recognized the important significant benefits of parental consultation on the one hand and the need for parental involvement in the minor's decision, and then said there is no time for the parent to be heard and importantly for the minor to hear the advice of the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.491" offset="3787484">There was no time for consultation to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.693" offset="3800232">The Court reached this incorrect position by relying on a series of cases that struck waiting periods for an adult woman seeking to have an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.299" offset="3838684">Waiting period for adults who have freely given consent have been held to unjustly interfere with the woman's abortion decision, even when the state said, well, we wanted to provide time for the woman to reflect on her decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.975" offset="3893333">That's not the case when the twenty-four waiting period is designed to provide consultation time for the parent and the minor child.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.081" offset="3929800">Although the Court below recognized that the state may have a significant interest promulgated by a statute which regulates a minor, but that same interest would not be protected by that same statute applied to an adult, it refused to apply that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.876" offset="3996986">It failed to apply the principles to this case and instead applied the standard for adults to a statute aimed solely at unmarried, unemancipated minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.184" offset="4042231">It is obvious that the twenty-four hour waiting period is more burdensome on the minor's decision than would be no period.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.004" offset="4073473">That restriction is entirely justified, however, to protect and promote the significant interest recognized by this Court and the minor to have the consultation with his parent and by the parent to have the consultation time with the minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.649" offset="4144108">The state is not obligated to pass legislation to promote its legitimate state interest and then leave that interest, the success of that interest to chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.273" offset="4190606">Rather, it is justified, we contend, in selecting means that attempt to guarantee that the good intentions of the statute do occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.331" offset="4230835">We believe that the twenty-four hour waiting period, a very short time for consultation after notice, clearly outweighs any burden or risk or interference with a minor's abortion decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.238" offset="6638384">Mr. Hartigan has not met his burden of establishing either obligatory or discretionary jurisdiction to review the issues he now raises nor has he satisfied the burden of showing that the Illinois statute is carefully enough drawn to achieve a significant state interest without burdening the exercise of fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.984" offset="6717378">There is no jurisdiction here under Section 1254 because the 7th Circuit did not enter a final order declaring the Illinois statute invalid as repugnant to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.876" offset="6768996">Starting, first, with the finality portion, the 7th Circuit's decision remanded this matter to the District Court for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.915" offset="6805150">Likewise, the 7th Circuit did not declare the statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.636" offset="6824062">Instead, as Mr. Hartigan recognized in his jurisdictional statement to this Court, the 7th Circuit specifically reserved the issue of the Act's ultimate constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.459" offset="6875262">The reason the 7th Circuit reserved the issue of the Act's constitutionality was because the 7th Circuit found that the statute by its own terms was incomplete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.834" offset="6920820">It was incomplete because the statute specifically sets out a desire by the Illinois General Assembly for a judicial by-pass for any young woman who cannot tell either both of her parents or one of her parents about her pregnancy and her desire to have an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.229" offset="6998351">Now, this incomplete statutory scheme is really at the root of the jurisdictional efficiency that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.734" offset="7024369">The statute itself in Sections 5(f) and 5(g) specifically say that a confidential and expedited appeal shall be available as the Illinois Supreme Court provides by rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.209" offset="7078286">In the next provision of the statute, the General Assembly respectfully requests the Illinois Supreme Court to promulgate any rules necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.517" offset="7119560">Mr. Hartigan's counsel misstates the statute when he contends that the statute calls for the Illinois Supreme Court to promulgate any rules that it thought were necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.992" offset="7165431">The statute doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.225" offset="7170342">The statute says any rules and regulations necessary to ensure that proceedings under this Act are handled in an expeditious and confidential manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2658.123" offset="10773986">The fact that the Illinois statute does not provide and cannot provide any guarantees of an expedited and confidential appeal raises very serious constitutional problems under the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.385" offset="10835008">Just briefly, the Illinois statute does not provide any assurances that a young woman can make an appeal and preserve the privacy interests that this Court has found to be part of her fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.144" offset="10894044">There are no provisions anywhere in the statute itself or the existing Illinois appellate rules which provide any guidance or any provisions for a young woman to keep her identity confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.452" offset="10947230">There are no provisions for filing with her initials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.154" offset="10958097">There are no provisions for filing using a Jane Doe pseudonym.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.873" offset="10972934">So, to compare this case with the Ashcroft statute, which did provide for the specific filing of the young woman's petition with her initials, this one does not provide the necessary assurances of confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.865" offset="11032911">Now, the lack of any assurances that the privacy will be protected is completely at odds with this Court's decision, including most recently the decision in Thornburgh, where the Court held that the Constitution demands that such an intensely private decision, such as the decision to end a pregnancy, must be protected in a manner that assures the young woman's privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.731" offset="11124444">Likewise, there is no provision in the statute itself or in the existing Illinois rules that provide any assurances of an expedited appeal, and that's critical and it's a critical deficiency because, as this Court is well aware, time is absolutely of the essence in the abortion context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.494" offset="11207409">Now, the problem with the Illinois system is that the timing of the entire appellate process is left to the complete and unfettered discretion of the personnel at the various levels of the Illinois appellate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.238" offset="11258400">Our experience shows us that long delays will occur even if an appeal is expedited under any of the existing Illinois rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.527" offset="11299569">Now, Defendant, Mr. Hartigan, trots out Rule 311 in his supplemental reply brief as a way in which a minor might have a chance or possibility of an expedited appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.317" offset="11346694">Now, the problem with Rule 311, as Mr. Hartigan recognizes in Footnote 10 of his supplemental reply, is that it provides a possibility of expedition only if, only if the Illinois Appellate Courts don't apply it as written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.946" offset="11417225">To not apply the rule as written provides the young woman no guidance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3260.652" offset="13184043">--But that's still a delay, Your Honor, and as indicated by the record and indicated by the briefs of Appellees, the mandatory twenty-four hour period often stretches into a much longer period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.024" offset="13229600">Indeed, as this Court recognized in striking down a similar mandatory delay period in the Akron decision, and, Your Honor, the problem with this is that it assumes, contrary to the evidence in this case, and contrary to all other evidence, that no young woman ever voluntarily consults her parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.052" offset="13297728">That's the additional problem with this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.504" offset="13307445">Even for a young woman who tells her parents, who consults with them and they reach a family decision that the abortion is in her best interests, that family cannot effectuate their decision without the mandatory state-imposed delay because under the terms of the statute, the physician must notify the parent and it's both parents, and then wait the twenty-four period, unless the young woman and her family are willing to submit themselves to one of two additional requirements, each of which result in an additional and undue burden on the young woman's fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.011" offset="13449551">Very quickly, those additional burdens would either require both parents to accompany the young woman to the abortion facility or the doctor's office, or require the young woman's parents to sign before a Notary a statement that they have been informed of their daughter's pregnancy, they've been informed of her desire to end the pregnancy, and that they do not object to the waiver of the mandatory waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.293" offset="13542652">As the District Court found and as the 7th Circuit affirmed, such an additional requirement is no exception at all, but is really an additional burden because that requirement is really tantamount to publication, especially in small towns, of the young woman's abortion decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.338" offset="13614854">In conclusion, the state statute here is incomplete and this Court does not have the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.360" offset="13646933">However, should this Court reach the issue on the merits, the Illinois statute does not achieve its stated purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.466" offset="13679324">It imposes a knowing risk of additional medical harm in return for nothing more than speculative hope, which the state did not prove below, of increased or better consultation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.524" offset="13727599">The risk of this over-broad statute, which applies across the board, is simply too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.845" offset="13752885">It cannot be sustained under previous decisions of this Court and the 7th Circuit's decision finding that in its incomplete form, it cannot be enforced, should be affirmed.</text>
