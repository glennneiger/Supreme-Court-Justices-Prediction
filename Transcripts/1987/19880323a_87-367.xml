            <text syncTime="13.324" offset="192031">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the appellant in this lawsuit is Bendix Autolite Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.881" offset="242186">It had a contract with the appellee, Midwesco Enterprises, under which Midwesco sold and installed in State of Ohio a particular boiler which turned out to be defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.375" offset="292237">The contract was fully performed in the State of Ohio, but Bendix has been denied the right to maintain an action in the State of Ohio because the applicable four-year statute of limitations had expired, and whether the action is maintainable at this time depends on the constitutionality under the commerce clause of a particular Ohio tolling statute which suspends the running of the period of limitations in situations as we have here where the defendant can't be served within the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.846" offset="422117">Both the District Court and the Circuit Court have held, and we say incorrectly, that the Ohio tolling statute constitutes an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.868" offset="462137">Those rulings were incorrect, we contend, because the supposed burden on commerce is so slight and so speculative as to make it questionable whether the burden has any reality at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.212" offset="519502">You say then that the Ohio tolling statute should have been allowed to be applied by the Ohio courts and therefore it would not have run against you in your action against Midwesco?</text>

            <text syncTime="109.221" offset="575613">We maintain that such theoretical burden as may exist is purely incidental to a valid state purpose and is clearly outweighed by the resultant benefits which have been achieved for the benefit of Ohio citizens, and those benefits, as I will explain in a moment, are not at all theoretical, but have been explicitly recognized as valid and legitimate objects of state concern by this Court's 1982 decision in the case of G.D. Searle and Company against Cohn, which we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.977" offset="726601">Now, the obvious purpose of the Ohio tolling statute is to preserve the right of Ohio citizens to assert claims against individuals and corporations who are not amenable to service within the state either because they once lived there and later moved away or because they are concealing themselves within the state, or because they never lived there at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="184.169" offset="875394">The statute here in question is virtually identical to a particular New Jersey statute which this Court reviewed in the Searle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.827" offset="918026">Now, we are accused by our opponents here of misreading Searle, and also as behaving as though Searle fully disposed of all the issues and compels a decision in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.801" offset="965882">That is not our position, and I think our brief acknowledges that it is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.920" offset="982392">But the Searle case does conclusively establish that a statute of the sort we are talking about does have a legitimate state purpose, and it is a purpose that remains valid and subsisting, notwithstanding the adoption by the State of Ohio of an alternative method of addressing the same concern, and that is the process for longarm service.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.802" offset="1081866">Arrangements for in-state service continue to be of benefit, as this Court pointed out in Searle, because it can't always be guaranteed that a particular company, a particular out of state company or out of state individual can actually be found.</text>

            <text syncTime="1691.163" offset="6903306">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Please the Court, as counsel indicated, the issue before this Court is very simply whether or not the Ohio tolling statute is what has been construed as a forced licensure provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.442" offset="6964432">And as counsel concedes, each and every court which has been faced with this provision or a similar provision has found it to be a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.298" offset="7007900">That includes the lower courts here as well as the courts in the Coons case, as well as the McKinley court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.467" offset="7032560">And the question that we have to look at, as the Court indicated in Hughes versus Oklahoma, is the practical operation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.557" offset="7064952">That is the focus, and what you have to look at is, there is a tolling statute here, and the tolling statute says that in order to obtain its benefits there must be physical presence in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.929" offset="7102359">Now, even though it is somewhat of an anachronism as we pointed out, Ohio may very well be the only state now that holds that physical presence in the state is not the equivalent to being subject to service under the longarm jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.856" offset="7158157">It is only the same as actual physical service within the confines of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.243" offset="7183652">And what we have here is a situation where Bendix had the defendant, Midwesco, served under longarm, and because of that fact and the fact that there must be physical presence, it is necessary to see how that physical presence can be obtained, and the only means and manner in which it can be done is via the qualifications statute of the State of Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="2393.898" offset="9714290">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.932" offset="9718365">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.017" offset="9722754">Now, as far as these forced licensure provisions, this Court has long held these provisions to be unconstitutional, and unlike what counsel for Bendix has said, this Court has not focused on the sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.943" offset="9782418">This Court has focused on the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.227" offset="9791613">In fact, recently in Eli Lilly versus Savon Drugs this Court pointed out that it was the conditions, the regulatory conditions that were being looked at, and it was not the sanctions at the end, and in fact in that case the Court stated that it is well established that New Jersey cannot require Lilly to get a certificate of authority to do business in the state if its participation in this trade is limited to its wholly interstate sales to New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.877" offset="9906238">There is no limitation or qualification on the sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.996" offset="9918672">This Court has long held, going back to 1914, quite some time ago, long before the interstate trade developed it the way it is right now, in Sioux Remedy versus Cope, that a provision such as this was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.660" offset="9993278">Sioux Remedy, the Court focused on the condition, and interestingly enough, 70 years ago, in excess of 70 years ago the conditions were exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.265" offset="10027760">The condition was that the corporation has to become qualified to transact business, had to appoint a statutory agent and became subject to the general jurisdiction of the Court, and this Court looked at that and said that the conditions being imposed were much too great, and Justice Vander Vanter, with a tremendous amount of prescience, kind of foretold the future in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.862" offset="10118143">He stated that if one state can impose such a condition, others can, and in that way corporations engaged in interstate commerce can be subjected to great embarrassment and serious hazards, and that was in 1914.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.705" offset="10177494">Here we are in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.306" offset="10183868">Trade is not only interstate it is international, and those burdens, those hazards, that embarrassment has only disproportionately increased over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.346" offset="10224096">It is also necessary to keep in mind the entire purpose and idea behind the commerce clause, this idea of preventing economic Balkanization, that the states are not separate economic units, and that you cannot keep corporations out of states and prevent them from transacting business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.897" offset="10326287">As the Court stated in International Textbook versus Pigg, the Court said that one cannot impose a condition upon a corporation of another state seeking to do business in the State of Kansas, which is a case of interstate business, and which is a regulation of interstate commerce, and directly burdens on such commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.958" offset="10402565">Again, it is the conditions that are being focused on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.493" offset="10412700">It is not the sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.195" offset="10419492">It is not the fact that one is being barred from the courthouse door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.881" offset="10434225">It is the fact that one is being conditioned to become registered, become licensed within the state in order to transact that interstate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.237" offset="10467662">And even though the courts found, and we believe rightfully found, that there is a per se violation here, even if one were to apply the test, the balancing test of Pike versus Bruce Church, it is our belief, as we have already set out, that that test clearly indicates that there has been a burden upon interstate commerce, because of the fact that one must weigh the consequences, and the only effect as far as the state goes, the state interest that has been established here, is that which this Court found in Searle, which is the fact that there is a certain interest in having one served or be able to be served within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.532" offset="10652818">However, some of which I have already touched upon, the effect upon interstate commerce here is great, because of the fact it will subject a corporation to the jurisdiction of potentially lawsuits within all 50 states if all 50 states should choose to enact similar statutes such as the State of Ohio has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.845" offset="10730036">And the effects on interstate commerce that we noted in our brief, this case is a construction of--</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.513" offset="12376690">The bottom line of both letters is exactly the same, and that's because of the fact the second letter, the December letter, Patricia Mell stated that in the general course of business the Ohio Secretary of State would not, would not recognize nor accept a designation of agents from an unlicensed foreign corporation, which also indicates as far as the previous questions, is there any indication that a corporation can somehow otherwise appoint an agent, this indicates, no, it can't, because the Ohio Secretary of State themselves has come out and said that you can't, we won't recognize it, we won't even allow it to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.270" offset="12523812">The only way for a company to file this with us is to first become licensed, and the previous letter, from September of 1983 came right out and stated that they will not accept for filing a designation of statutory agent for an unlicensed foreign corporation, and therefore there really is not any distinction between the letters except for some speculative language that then followed in that letter about what happened if there might be, might be some investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.779" offset="13093804">Coons II, as we set forth in our brief, I believe, is a poorly rationalized decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.135" offset="13123270">I believe that under the cases that we've cited that it would be patently unfair, besides the fact that they've waived it, to deny Midwesco the fruit of its labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.756" offset="13165693">I believe that it would have a tremendous impact upon the legal profession if one could not obtain the benefits of their own work, and if the clients could not do that, and in fact I haven't seen any cases cited by Bendix indicating, except the Coons II case, that one is not entitled to the application in their own case of a decision of unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.772" offset="13253778">First of all, it would render the decision basically moot, which this Court has held it can't do on a constitutional issue, and more importantly is the fact that in all the cases, including Chevron, which they are so fond of citing, Chevron involved the application of the holding in another case, in the Rodrigue versus Aetna Casualty, and interestingly enough, in that case, in Rodrigue, the Court held that the plaintiffs in that case would get the benefit of the holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.006" offset="13366731">The case was remanded back down, and there are no cases cited where a party is not entitled to the fruits of its work, and I believe it would be inequitable, to say the least, to deny Midwesco the benefits, and the benefits which I believe it has conferred upon the people of the State of Ohio as well as interstate corporations, who are always the beneficiaries of constitutional holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.740" offset="13465683">I believe that we have established that this is a forced licensure provision, and that it is the conditions which this Court has to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.446" offset="13504449">It has to look at that because of the whole theory behind the commerce clause, the theory behind the fact that the states are not separate economic unit, the fact that you cannot stop interstate corporations from going into and engaging in business in the various states and I believe for that reason that this Court must affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.930" offset="13614372">In describing the unthinkability of open-ended liabilities that last in perpetuity, let's not forget the defense of laches, and in that regard we acknowledge that Midwesco cites certain cases to the effect that the doctrine doesn't apply or doesn't apply in its normal way in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.577" offset="13692948">He cites cases, and we will concede that the cases are supportive of what he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.779" offset="13709771">He is just as clear that the cases are demonstrably wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.564" offset="13724922">The true state of law in the State of Ohio is in the cases we site on Page 20 of our brief, and they are more recent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.837" offset="13758045">They are more authoritative because they come from the Supreme Court of Ohio, and they make it clear that the doctrine of laches does obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.776" offset="13789810">Even if it were open ended and permanent, if the company is engaged entirely in interstate commerce, has no minimal contacts with the state, why should that be unsatisfactory to them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.631" offset="13829203">They are never going to be vulnerable to suit anywhere in the State of Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.920" offset="13866401">It provides for evenhanded treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.272" offset="13875805">What if it be the fact that there is no statute in Ohio that provides for an alternative method of service?</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.593" offset="13905063">Shouldn't it be just as relevant that if under the practice, as the Secretary of State in Ohio says is the case, there are circumstances under which they would take, and the whole message is on Page 28 of our brief, the relevant message from that office, what does it matter that there may not be a statute if it is the practice of the State of Ohio to accept designations of agency apart from the licensure process?</text>
