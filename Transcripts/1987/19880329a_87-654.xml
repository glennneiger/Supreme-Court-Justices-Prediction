            <text syncTime="14.031" offset="187578">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.755" offset="226448">This is an appeal by the New Energy Company of Indiana, an Indiana ethanol producer, from the fourth redecision of the Ohio Supreme Court on rehearing that rejected New Energy's Commerce Clause challenge to a 1984 amendment to Ohio's sales tax credit for the gasoline ethanol blend or 90/10 blend known as gasohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.440" offset="321220">Prior to 1985, Ohio had granted a credit to the motor vehicle fuel tax for gasoline for gasohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.898" offset="354971">On December 20, 1984, it amended the statute by denying the credit to gasohol containing ethanol produced in another state unless that foreign producer state grants a credit to ethanol sold there containing Ohio produced ethanol.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.059" offset="423620">The credit that Ohio grants is limited the amount of credit granted Ohio ethanol in that other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.375" offset="456953">Now, although the Ohio courts agreed that the reciprocity provision effectively excluded New Energy from the Ohio ethanol market, they nevertheless upheld it.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.953" offset="507212">Our position is that this 1984 amendment which was conceded by the Supreme Court of Ohio to be a forced reciprocity statute discriminating against out-of-state products by denying the tax credit unless the out-of-state product's home state provides a similar tax credit, must pass a strict scrutiny test, and that this clearly does not.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.061" offset="1051709">It is, Your Honor, but that kind of distinction is a distinction that this Court has always made, and frequently made, because ultimately almost everything that a State does when it spends money, whether it spends money on research, whether it spends money to facilitate matters in one way or another for its products, is an expenditure of money on behalf of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.236" offset="1136345">For example, in the Hunt case, the Court pointed out... and I think that was unanimous... that the State of Washington had spent a great deal of money to develop a grading system for Washington apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.783" offset="1182530">And when North Carolina tried to match that by taking away that advantage that the State of Washington had created, this Court unanimously said, you can't do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.294" offset="1920541">But the tax structure has so many possibilities of discrimination built into it, and it's historically so dangerous because the alternative, Justice O'Connor, I think would be to have to repudiate a line of cases that goes back to Welton against Missouri in which states again and again have said, we are trying to help our local industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.658" offset="2018030">The Hawaiian case just a few years ago, they said here is this struggling little brandy, Okolehau brandy... to an easterner, that's a little hard to pronounce, this little product which has almost no market, and then there's this pineapple wine which has no market at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.270" offset="2092531">And we will give them a tax exemption from the twenty percent tax that we've established.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.354" offset="2172780">Now, if I may take a minute to sort of recollect where I was in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.669" offset="2206112">Now, to go back, some ethanol was sold in Ohio in 1979 and 1980, but in 1981, the same year New Energy's Ohio competitor, Southpoint Ethanol, which is an intervenor in this case, was formed, Ohio adopted a sales tax credit for all ethanol sold in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.443" offset="2289181">It was about 3.5 cents a gallon of gasohol, which ultimately fell to 2.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.661" offset="2330037">Indiana had a comparable fuel tax credit which it repealed in early '84, effective July, '85, and it authorized at that time a production subsidy which in fact was dropped a year later again on July '86.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.181" offset="2392104">In the fall of 1984, New Energy went into production in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.954" offset="2411225">And Southpoint's sales in Indiana began to fall sharply.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.588" offset="2429720">On December 20th, the Ohio reciprocity provision was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.250" offset="2448424">As the Trial Court found, Southpoint had lobbied the Ohio legislature for this provision, in fact, stressing to the legislature... and the word stressing was used twice by the Southpoint witness... how important Southpoint was to the most depressed areas of the Ohio economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.624" offset="2529926">This reciprocity provision which also, by the way, excluded ethanol from almost all gas-fired plants and ethanol made from cane and beet sugar, this was done in order to pressure Indiana to restore the Indiana tax credit, and in fact it was aimed only at Indiana, for every other state that could be affected by this tax credit, the producers in other states like Tennessee, Illinois and elsewhere already had a credit which they were giving.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.088" offset="2675794">Now, loss of the Ohio tax credit, when all of the New Energy's competitors continued to get this credit inevitably excluded New Energy from the Ohio market, as the Trial Court found.</text>

            <text syncTime="761.839" offset="3178807">How in the world do you increase the amount of ethanol by excluding ethanol just because it comes from a state that uses a different incentive, because it comes from a coal-fired plant, because it is made of cane or beet sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.662" offset="3254040">Indeed, it's counterproductive to that because New Energy's loss of the market may have gone to gasoline, not to gasohol, in which case the amount of pollution in the air would multiply rather than be reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.363" offset="3320914">Now, despite these findings which, again with the ambiguity that you've pointed to, the Court nevertheless upheld the statute because New Energy was the only producer affected and would not have been affected had Indiana not repealed the tax credit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.458" offset="4209286">Well, Your Honor, even if it's not least drastic, the Court certainly has insisted on less burdensome, and there are less burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.663" offset="4250037">Indeed, the initial statute, the initial tax credit in Ohio in 1981 which allowed the credit for ethanol, just like that, ethanol or methanol itself was quite an adequate alternative without the reciprocity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.524" offset="4321508">We are not challenging the tax credit which was made available in '81 to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.250" offset="4348466">We're challenging the reciprocity and we're saying that the tax credit without the reciprocity which now some eleven states have and which in 1985 approximately 23 states had, that that is a less burdensome alternative which accomplishes the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.465" offset="4441253">After all, over the years, the rate of usage of ethanol, of gasohol, I think, has risen from something like 400 or 500 million gallons to 900 million gallons during this period without, with very few of these reciprocity statutes operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.257" offset="4516486">Now, if I may return, our argument, which is of course what we've been talking about here is that reciprocity statutes face strict scrutiny and for a very good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.337" offset="4572806">They involve facial discrimination, they create most favored nation enclaves, precisely the kind of preferential trade areas that the Commerce Clause is supposed to prevent, and they threaten economic isolation in an effort to control the policies of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.819" offset="4642709">All of those I think have been touched on by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.570" offset="4657651">Now, the Ohio courts recognized the applicability of strict scrutiny, but they ruled that because others from outside Ohio, besides New Energy, could come into Ohio, there was no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.951" offset="4719196">Now, that logic this Court has never adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.003" offset="4735392">In some cases for example that this Court has dealt with, only one out-of-state company was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.337" offset="4760783">That's true of the Pike case, it's true of Lewis against Bete Investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.020" offset="4775516">In A&amp;P, for example, many other states, I think it was something like eight states, had reciprocity agreements with Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.327" offset="4812714">Louisiana did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.887" offset="4822954">And the Court still struck that down unanimously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.951" offset="4839255">There is no requirement either that there be an absolute bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.414" offset="4861093">I think this Court has recognized right from the beginning that taxes can have the same effect as an absolute bar, and in fact in this case as the Trial Court recognized, it had precisely that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.143" offset="4915950">New Energy was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.624" offset="4925877">The fact is with the competitors getting the credit, there was no way New Energy could compete in the Ohio market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.972" offset="4967255">Now, with respect to the health claim, I think I've already touched on that, unless there are some further questions on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.288" offset="5004558">And indeed, there's some question as to whether any credit is necessary for health, because over the years, there has been a decline in the use of any tax credits and an enormous increase in the use of ethanol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.210" offset="5080208">And as I pointed out before, it's very possible that New Energy's loss in Indiana may have been diverted not to another ethanol producer, but to gasoline, which in turn would produce increased pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.011" offset="5151470">And I think the record quite beyond dispute shows that the purpose here was to pressure Indiana to restore that tax credit for the benefit of the Ohio competitor, an important employer in perhaps the most depressed area of the State that used a great deal of Ohio corn and coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.547" offset="5253557">And as I said, this was stressed at the legislative hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.870" offset="5574863">The difference is that that's a situation in which a state itself has imposed a tax burden on its own people, and it says that we don't want to hurt our own people too much so therefore we will equalize matters by saying that if you buy something outside and use it here, our people will not be at a disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.317" offset="5676636">But it's a disadvantage that the state itself created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.309" offset="5692623">In this case, there was no disadvantage when the tax credit went to everyone, and indeed there was no disadvantage had there been no tax credit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.168" offset="5736091">Ohio created a disadvantage whereas in the Silas Henneford Mason (sic) case by the reference to other states, Ohio undid a disadvantage to its people, or the State of Washington, actually, that the State of Washington itself had created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.929" offset="5807144">And it was a straight equalizer, penny for penny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.329" offset="5820727">Whereas here, when there's an attempt to equalize whatever advantages other states have, we have an attempt to mix apples and pears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.485" offset="5857403">If for example another state provides research help, here we're providing a discriminatory tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1440.383" offset="5892930">Henneford Silas Mason (sic) it was calibrated exactly to the penny and as I think it was Justice Cardozo who said it, equality is the hallmark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.168" offset="5932114">Not true here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.665" offset="6030125">The market participant is a narrow doctrine designed to deal with that situation whereas the Court has said, and I think the most detailed statement is in Reeves and I think other Justices have quoted that Reeves statement, where the State acts as the equivalent of a private business, where it is buying or it is selling or it is manufacturing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1521.846" offset="6218834">The situation appears at least to be one where the state wanted to encourage disposal of the old auto hulks, just like Ohio might want to encourage the use of ethanol.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.436" offset="6289155">But the Court, I think, has characterized it, and indeed in the subsequent cases certainly treated both Alexandria Scrap and the line of cases as a line of cases where the states act as a private trader.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.417" offset="6349132">Indeed, the justification I think that was given in Reeves v. Stake is that it acts as a private trader and may indeed even be subject to the constraints of a private trader, which a plurality of the Court then applied subsequently in the South Central Timber case, imposing restraints on an alienation and in effect preventing an effort to control a downstream operation, namely, processing of timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.757" offset="6470445">And unless I think the rule is cabined and limited that way, it could easily swallow up the entire Commerce Clause, because again almost any tax credit can be called a tax expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.907" offset="6535020">And indeed an expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.068" offset="6539722">And at that point, the Court would have to reexamine and in effect overrule this lengthy line of cases which go as recently as last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.834" offset="6578801">I think I will sit down now and reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.929" offset="6615163">And simply conclude by saying that this Statute is clearly unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause and the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio on rehearing the second Ohio Supreme Court decision should be overruled and reversed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard C. Farrin</label>
            <text syncTime="1640.273" offset="6692486">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.184" offset="6708159">The issues in this case are twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.938" offset="6719131">The first issue to be decided is whether the Ohio tax credit scheme is the type of state action that is subject to the restraints of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.095" offset="6755807">Within this one issue there are actually two questions to be considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.808" offset="6774615">Initially as this Court has heard during the initial argument in this case, whether or not the market participant principle applies to the ethanol tax credit scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.397" offset="6824979">The second issue, which is also a matter that was touched upon by this Court in the Alexandria Scrap case but not decided, is whether the Commerce Clause prohibits state action effecting a flow of commerce that is dependent for its existence upon a state subsidy rather than on the private market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.821" offset="6906690">The second issue is whether assuming this scheme is subject to the Commerce Clause restrictions, whether it is valid under the various tests established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.406" offset="6957054">As New Energy's counsel has pointed out, the Ohio General Assembly initially enacted its tax credit provision in 1981 to provide an encouragement for the use of ethanol as a substitute for lead in gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.338" offset="7020793">The result of this use would be to protect the environment of Ohio because as has been stipulated throughout these proceedings, ethanol is the most environmentally benign substitute for lead in gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.540" offset="7101563">Other benefits of the use of ethanol are the creation of an alternative market for corn and a reduction of the country's dependency on foreign oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.410" offset="7145031">It's undisputed that these purposes are legitimate purposes for the State to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.613" offset="7173870">The portion of the scheme that is the subject of the challenge before this Court is the enactment in 1984 which became effective in 1985 of the reciprocity provision that limited the credit given to motor vehicle fuel dealers to the use of ethanol that was produced either in Ohio or in any other state that granted similar credits for the use of ethanol to Ohio dealers to Ohio produced ethanol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.962" offset="7299258">This scheme, including the reciprocity scheme, does not put any prohibition on the sale or distribution of ethanol in Ohio, nor does it regulate the conditions under which the flow of ethanol may occur in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.475" offset="7365296">By this scheme, Ohio has simply entered the market by providing a subsidy to build up the price of ethanol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.769" offset="7394448">This subsidy is necessary in order for ethanol to compete with gasoline in the marketplace.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.465" offset="7441260">Justice Stevens, I believe Ohio entered the market initially when it first enacted the credit provision 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.034" offset="7483578">Its purpose at that point in time was the same, to bid up the price of ethanol so that it might compete with gasoline in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.242" offset="7528404">Because of the production costs involved with ethanol, absent both Federal and state subsidies, ethanol simply could not compete in the free private marketplace with gasoline.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.740" offset="7594337">Mr. Farrin, do you really think it solves matters to simply say it's the application of a state subsidy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.597" offset="7625789">I assume, for example, that a state could if it chooses subsidize all of its domestic industries in a lot of ways, by tax credits, or even by giving them money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.913" offset="7667062">But do you think a state could subsidize domestic production by only charging a sales tax on out-of-state products and not charging a sales tax on in-state products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.592" offset="7721815">And saying, well, that's all fine because all we're doing is subsidizing in-state industry which is certainly a laudable and valid goal?</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.201" offset="8024208">I submit though that at the least, Alexandria Scrap would allow a state to subsidize a local industry if it was part of a scheme that was effected to carry out a legitimate state purpose other than simply protectionism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.826" offset="8110726">In Alexandria Scrap, the purpose of the statute was to effect the removal of abandoned hulks in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.403" offset="8149074">In this case, the primary purpose of the ethanol credit scheme is not solely to benefit Ohio business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.416" offset="8185123">Its purpose is to encourage the use of ethanol which will have great environmental benefits in the State of Ohio, plus it will have other benefits including the increased market for corn and reduction on the dependency of foreign oil.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="3501.804" offset="14138638">Your Honor, I am not going to take any rebuttal time unless the Court has questions for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.908" offset="14167059">I will however confess with some embarrassment that the thrust of the Chief Justice's question about least drastic alternative was absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.976" offset="14203317">The Court in Sporhase used the phrase, narrowly tailored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.058" offset="14219617">And in some other cases, it has referred to, less burdensome alternatives, but has not used that particular phrase of less drastic alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.783" offset="14258592">I don't have any doubt in my mind judging by the questions and so on that the point has been made that that are less burdensome alternatives, and that this was not narrowly tailored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.154" offset="14311986">But I did want to make that clear, Your Honor, to correct what was stated in my brief.</text>
