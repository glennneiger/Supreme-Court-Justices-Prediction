            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135101">We will hear argument first this morning in No. 86-805, Billy J. B.J.&gt; ["] Pinter v. Maurice Dahl.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.609" offset="177524">Mr. Sparks, you may begin whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="braden_w_sparks" startTime="13.120" stopTime="291.282">
            <label>Mr. Braden W. Sparks</label>
            <text syncTime="13.120" offset="187555">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.491" offset="197063">The case this morning is important because it bears upon the day to day regulation of the securities industry, and it has to do with two issues that concern Section 12(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 which provides for an express private right of action against any person who offers or sells an unregistered security through the use of the mails or the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.417" offset="292672">I would like to state the questions as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.639" offset="305628">First of all, whether the long established definition of a Section 12(1) seller under the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 12(1) specifically should be modified to incorporate a new threshold requirement that the seller must be motivated, and I would like to stress that word motivated, by a desire to receive a financial benefit for his efforts in order to be held responsible for his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.815" offset="410327">And secondly, whether or not the common law in pari delicto defense, or perhaps I would prefer to refer to this as the regulatory purpose defense rather than strict in pari delicto defense, is available in a private action for the rescission of the sale of unregistered securities brought under Section 12(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="90.581" offset="497367">Just briefly, the statute provides that any person who offers or sells a security in violation of Section 77(e) of this title shall be liable to the person purchasing such security from him, and it goes on to provide for rescission in the common law fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.262" offset="568107">To telegraph my position in this case, the Fifth Circuit's addition of a pecuniary benefits test to the settled definition of a seller of unregistered securities is damaging and threatening to the continued regulation of the securities industry in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.613" offset="637488">And the ruling by the Court of Appeals that the in pari delicto defense does not apply between co-violators of Section 12(1) is in direct conflict with this Court's ruling in the Bateman Eichler case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.142" offset="687643">I think that the facts in this case are extremely important, and I would like to spend a certain amount of time with regard to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.445" offset="716796">Of course, in the trial court, Mr. Pinter was a Defendant, and Mr. Dahl was one of twelve Plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.763" offset="758069">Mr. Dahl and the other eleven Plaintiffs sought to recover from Mr. Pinter for the sale of unregistered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.998" offset="791088">The complaint detailed a number of misrepresentations, and concealments, and non-disclosures on the part of Mr. Pinter doing business under the various names of his companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.185" offset="835810">Mr. Dahl, the Trial Court found, was a California or Texas resident, a real estate broker, and a man whose personal wealth exceeded one million dollars, and whose income approached $250,000 on an annual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.615" offset="897459">And he detailed certain abortive efforts, and I am at paragraph 7 on page 31 of the petition, the appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.053" offset="943225">The Trial Court detailed certain abortive efforts by Mr. Dahl to become interested in the oil business.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.879" offset="970601">I would like to quote from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.989" offset="978961">And I want to make it clear that everything that I quote from the record will be either from Mr. Dahl's testimony who I am in opposition to, or from the testimony of Mr. Gottsch who was called on behalf of Mr. Dahl.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.426" offset="1032773">I am not attempting to support my arguments by any statements made by my client in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.521" offset="1057119">Mr. Dahl testified at the joint appendix, page 105, that he was interested in being in the drilling business, and that he did not have the money that he needed to become involved in the business, and that he hired Mr. Minor whose position was to "raise money", and that is quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.302" offset="1128277">And that it was his job, and this was Mr. Minor who was hired by Mr. Dahl to work for Puma Petroleum and Wrangle Oil &amp; Gas, it was his job to bring investor money.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.571" offset="1177282">And Mr. Minor was fired by Mr. Dahl prior to his hiring of a Mr. Kirk when it became known to Mr. Dahl that he had spent $10,000 to obtain a legal prospective, and he was fired on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.481" offset="1244992">And then Mr. Dahl then hired another individual by the name of Mr. Kirk, who was in the Texas and Oklahoma area attempting to acquire leases for Mr. Dahl who was living in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.990" offset="1355019">The only inference that I would like the Court to draw is that Mr. Dahl was aware of the need to draw a prospectus in becoming involved in the oil and gas business, and had hired Mr. Minor for that purpose, and fired him when he discovered that he had spent $10,000 in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.929" offset="1414788">The position of the government, the Attorney General, is that one must be a promoter if one is interested in becoming involved in the business, more a promoter than an investor, and one may be held in pari delicto.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.074" offset="1491379">And I want to point out that I am trying to isolate in my discussion of the facts those facts which would show that Mr. Dahl was desirous of getting into the oil and gas business, and that it was his intention to not be merely a investor at least initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.202" offset="1555849">I think that the inference that I have explained is all that needs to be drawn from that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.155" offset="1575702">Mr. Kirk was hired after Mr. Minor was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.651" offset="1597645">His job, and this is page 108 from the joint appendix, was to locate, acquire and sell leases.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.126" offset="1815506">Then Mr. Pinter came to Oklahoma and visited the properties, and looked at the geology, the well logs and the other materials which were assembled in the words of the Trial Court by Mr. Pinter.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.293" offset="1864198">And after conducting his own investigation of the circumstanced decided in the Trial Court's words that there</text>

            <text syncTime="441.319" offset="1900352">Now there were two different groups of investments which were made by Mr. Dahl, and I would like to point this out and go into some detail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.075" offset="1935356">Because again it is important, because it deals with Mr. Dahl's involvement and the extent to which he may be considered to be actively involved in seeking oil and gas business opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.383" offset="1984570">After deciding that he wanted to invest with Mr. Pinter, he went up to Kansas where he found his friend, a Mr. Gottsch, who testified for him at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.159" offset="2027725">Mr. Gottsch was in the cattle feeding business, and was an independently wealthy individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.663" offset="2045697">He contacted Mr. Gottsch, in his own words, brought Mr. Gottsch to Oklahoma, and introduced Mr. Gottsch to Mr. Pinter in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.039" offset="2087179">And as a result of that introduction, he caused Mr. Gottsch to loan him, Mr. Dahl, $250,000 and to put $250,000 of his own money into the initial three well project that the two men got involved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.091" offset="2155411">And they, Mr. Dahl and his friend, Mr. Gottsch from Kansas put up the entire $500,000 needed to fund the first three of five wells that will be discussed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.600" offset="5029403">On the in pari delicto question in this case, the Securities and Exchange Commission thinks that the Court of Appeals was wrong to the extent that it ruled that the in pari delicto defense is never available in an action brought under Section 12(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.570" offset="5089380">As I propose to explain in more detail in a moment, and I want to present our views in a manner slightly different from our presentation in our brief, we think that the in pari delicto should be available in certain narrowly defined circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.580" offset="5149357">On the second question in the case, we think that the Court of Appeals was right in ruling that a person who solicits a securities purchase may be liable under Section 12(1) along with the person who passed title, but only is the solicitor had some motivation in promoting the purchase other than a friendly desire to further the interests of the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.243" offset="5235979">Because only then can he fairly be aligned on the selling side of the transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1386.687" offset="5681837">The history of the development of Section 12, and its amendment in 1954, and its judicial history prior to that seems to us to make it clear that liability can extend somewhat beyond the person who owned the security before the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.018" offset="5759160">The question then is what kind of limits have to be placed on the extension of liability beyond the person who passed title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.654" offset="5793641">Solicitation, we think, is part of the statute, but there is an important distinction which we think that the Court of Appeals rightly captured between somebody who simply urges somebody else to get in on a good deal and on the other hand somebody who because of his own interests is properly aligned on the selling side of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.420" offset="5880681">We do not think that financial benefit is a... we do not mean by that something terribly precise or limited in that indirect financial interests can align the individual on the selling side of the transaction just as a commission can.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.556" offset="6905308">To the extent that we suggested in the brief that the first part of our test for the in pari delicto defense was that the buyer had to be more a promoter than an investor, the main thing that I wanted to do was to dispel any misimpression that what we meant by that was a simple comparison, how much did the buyer solicit and how much did he purchase, and that that would somehow automatically answer the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.353" offset="7556489">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.257" offset="7580103">We have a delicate problem here in dealing with the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.881" offset="7602569">Congress set them up, and this Court has interpreted them, and now we are juggling with those laws and taking them out of balance again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.876" offset="7638513">And the premise on which we are trying to take these delicate mechanisms out of balance is that this Court made a ruling in the Bateman Eichler case that under certain circumstances that the defense of in pari delicto may be asserted in a 10(b)(5) fraud case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.870" offset="7722523">It is sought here to extend that beyond the fraud activity to an unregistered security activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.077" offset="7755333">Frankly, my first impression was similar, that on a strict liability statute that you could never bring in pari delicto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.452" offset="7792845">I do not agree with that now, because equitably it has always been permitted in not only fraudulent conduct but also in illegal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.399" offset="7832655">And if there is a illegal act in selling unregistered securities, then I agree with the SEC that in pari delicto should be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.864" offset="7874556">However, it is a rare exception, as stated by this court, that you will permit that defense, because the normal and general rule is that it will not be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.694" offset="7925860">Now we have a special problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.717" offset="7941952">Section 12(1) specifically says that the seller will be liable to his purchaser for selling unregistered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.905" offset="7994719">There is no defense to that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.149" offset="8011646">It is absolute liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.999" offset="8019065">In this particular case, Mr. Pinter was the seller of securities, and he admitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.074" offset="8047382">And the court found that they were not registered, and the court found him liable not only to Mr. Dahl but to Mr. Dahl's friends and associates who also invested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.911" offset="8098686">The critical nature of this problem is can an illegal seller of unregistered securities avoid his liability by raising a theory that one of the buyers indirectly or directly assisted him in bringing other investors into the ventures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.260" offset="8204117">To me, that is a critical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.552" offset="8221253">It is not quite a tippee-tipper situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.624" offset="8233583">As the Fifth Circuit stated, it was a gregarious act intended to benefit his friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.599" offset="8265452">I am talking about Mr. Dahl's friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.340" offset="8276423">And to show how he tried to benefit, it is critical for this Court to be aware that Mr. Dahl invested a total of $351,000 roughly in three different ventures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.271" offset="8336087">His ten or eleven friends that he brought in invested a total of $82,000 in two ventures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.766" offset="8374121">And more importantly, the other Plaintiffs... we will call them the California investors, because that is essentially what they are except for one person who was Mr. Dahl's fiancee... the California investors invested in two wells, and those wells and leases had already been fractionated by Mr. Pinter months and months before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.217" offset="8491881">He had already drilled two wells on one lease with other investors, and he had already drilled one well on another lease with other investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.610" offset="8521452">He was trying to drill two more wells, and we call them the Doss 3-B and the Doss 2-C well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.736" offset="8546007">He had some of his investors drop out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.286" offset="8560218">When they dropped out, he approached Mr. Dahl.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.229" offset="8571921">And he said, Mr. Dahl, some of my investors have fallen out, and I have got room for some more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.622" offset="8589579">Dahl said fine, I have some close friends who probably will be interested, let me check, and he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.647" offset="8613612">In the Doss 3-B, there were three investors from these Plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.490" offset="8640988">One was Mr. Dahl himself, one was his fiancee, and one was his CPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.116" offset="8663558">Those three investors invested little.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.288" offset="8684247">The CPA invested $7400, and his fiancee invested $3500, and Mr. Dahl invested about $28,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.443" offset="8716848">But the remainder, the several hundred thousand dollars that was raised, was raised by people unknown to Mr. Dahl.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.608" offset="8745478">And Mr. Pinter, he raised that capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.290" offset="8756241">So the act of selling unregistered securities was already in process by Mr. Pinter, and all he did was get Mr. Dahl to help fill in the void for the last three interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.160" offset="8819666">As to the Antwine 2-C, the same basic idea except a total of nine of Mr. Dahl's friends invested approximately $7500 in those wells, and the remainder of the funds were raised by other investors by Mr. Pinter in his other efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.693" offset="8897824">Now the record shows that Mr. Pinter--</text>

            <text syncTime="2239.955" offset="9094892">And let me explain why, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.615" offset="9101475">We already have a complicated securities law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.171" offset="9123731">We now in a strict liability section statute where there is no defense, Section 12(1), we suddenly throw in tort negligence law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.045" offset="9163228">And we not only throw in tort negligence law, but we throw in one of the most complicated concepts that they have under that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.860" offset="9190500">That is proximate cause, legal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.133" offset="9203561">And to determine proximate cause, they now say you must be a substantial factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.116" offset="9223519">And I have cited in my brief what some of the authorities thing of substantial factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.409" offset="9244730">They think that it is good for trying to determine causation and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.995" offset="9266987">But it has no bearing and it has no relevance, and in fact is a hindrance to determining actual legal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.228" offset="9295930">That is a policy decision of this Court and of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.920" offset="9314739">It is not a decision for the court to be making at this trial level saying that if it is a substantial cause or substantial factor in causing it that then he is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.188" offset="9363849">It is sort of the old idea of but for you introducing me to him that I never would have met him and I never would have sold him, and therefore you are the substantial cause of my selling him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.325" offset="9948365">Because at one time the statute in the definition included sale to include an offer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2474.731" offset="10033942">Because very frankly, in the Trial Court, the defense was raised that Mr. Dahl agreed to sell in exchange for a commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.806" offset="10122236">Another sense would be the way that the SEC has taken the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.308" offset="10136237">That if he were a promoter of the enterprise, that if he had a financial interest in the actual business himself, that would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.973" offset="10166957">We have taken the position that where the purchaser of a security has only an interest in a venture as an investor himself that he cannot be a seller to someone else merely by saying, hey, I have got a good deal, I have checked it out and I think that it is great, you ought to get into it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2600.661" offset="10537687">Now what really bothers me is the attempt here to shift the burden of what I consider to the statute's main function of the disclose of all material information in connection with an investment opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.412" offset="10592649">Mr. Pinter says, hey, you should have told him the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.925" offset="10606755">Now the critical thing that came up in the testimony that really is shocking is Mr. Pinter says that he gave nothing to Mr. Dahl to explain this offering or the three offerings, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.155" offset="10667672">He gave him one thing as a kind of geological report, but it has nothing to do with the particular well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.608" offset="10693481">He just said that it was to give him an idea of where approximately the wells were located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.099" offset="10707483">Well, that does not even meet, of course, the registration requirements, and it certainly does not meet the exemption requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.284" offset="10732143">And in this regard, Mr. Pinter specifically said in the subscription agreement that these securities are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.471" offset="10776969">But then it goes on, 146&gt; ["].</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.335" offset="10800374">And Rule 146 is a specific SEC rule providing a safe haven for an offering which is exempt from registration under the non-public offering exemption of Section 4(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.854" offset="10850425">Now if you are going to put the burden on Mr. Dahl and say equitably he is estopped and he is in pari delicto because he knew that the securities were unregistered, then so did everyone else who invested in those wells, because they all signed the subscription agreement and the subscription agreement is very specific that these are not registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.204" offset="10919911">But if you are going to charge him with that burden, then we should always charge him with the other burden it says, 146&gt; ["], meaning that Mr. Pinter must have complied with Rule 146.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.193" offset="10967872">But the testimony was just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.907" offset="10978634">And this was interesting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.612" offset="11789475">Judge Hill said so what, the old case from the Fifth Circuit, Henderson v. Hayden, that they have always applied the standard that you cannot waive your rights under the statute and you cannot be estopped from your rights under the statute even if you have knowledge that they are unregistered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.910" offset="11846735">Because in this instance, the great white father, Congress, says we are going to protect you, public, from your own ignorance unless the issuer gives you a complete disclosure of all material information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.503" offset="13557024">Secondly, I would like to point out in response to the questions of Justices Scalia and White that with regard to the in pari delicto test suggested by the government that they suggest that one ought to be a promoter and somehow be involved in the decision not to register, or involved in the conduct that results in the loss of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.467" offset="13648871">And I submit that in a 12(1) context, a strict liability context, that this puts again the burden on establishing a state of mind that a decision was made not to register, and that a decision was made to take the transaction outside the exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.558" offset="13717312">I submit that that again flies in the face of the basis of the statute.</text>
