            <text syncTime="54.135" offset="330247">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.003" offset="341741">Thus case presents a straightforward question of statutory construction, whether a court may order the Secretary of Health and Human Services to withhold a portion of past due benefits owed a financially needy claimant under Title XVI of the Social Security Act and pay those benefits directly to the claimant's attorney as an attorney's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.750" offset="420735">The Secretary of Health and Human Services has concluded that the court is without such authority under Title XVI.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.320" offset="446962">The language of Title XVI and its legislative history, we believe, prove the reasonableness of that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.308" offset="470890">For this reason, we believe the decision of the Eighth Circuit should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.010" offset="485728">The pertinent facts of the case can be very briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.878" offset="501192">In May 1982, Respondent Mary Alice Galbreath applied for Supplemental Security Income disability benefits, or SSI, under Title XVI of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.269" offset="542779">That program provides supplemental security income to financially needy persons who are aged, blind, and disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.756" offset="572768">The agency, HHS, denied her application, both initially and following internal administrative appeal on the ground that she was not disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.314" offset="610906">Her financial need was uncontested.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.933" offset="621460">In August 1983, Ms. Galbreath, represented by her counsel, brought this action in Federal District Court challenging the agency's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.753" offset="656673">In February 1985 the District Court reversed the agency on the ground that Ms. Galbreath was in fact disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.776" offset="684781">The Court accordingly remanded the case to the agency with instruction that it calculate and pay to Ms. Galbreath the amount of past due benefits owed to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.048" offset="721875">On July 23rd, 1985, the agency accordingly sent her a check for approximately $8000.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.635" offset="748206">One week later, her counsel filed with the District Court a motion for an attorney's fee award out of her past due benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.891" offset="781225">The District Court granted the motion, relying on a provision of Title II of the Social Security Act, Section 406, and ordered the Court to pay Mr. Bartels, counsel, 25 percent of his client's past due benefits, or approximately $2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.501" offset="843710">The Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court's order, but on a different ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.554" offset="863876">The Court of Appeals concluded that courts possess inherent authority to order the Secretary to withhold a portion of Ms. Galbreath's benefits and pay those benefits to her counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.779" offset="904836">It is from that judgment that we sought this Court's review.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.731" offset="916644">In our view, Congress deny courts the authority, in Title XVI, to order the Secretary to revert to a claimant's attorney a portion of the claimant's SSI benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.753" offset="956663">Congress's plain intent is evident from the statutory language and from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.074" offset="977979">Indeed, the latter shows that Congress specifically considered the possibility of granting courts authority to order withholding and declined to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.346" offset="1011102">Congress determined that withholding would be contrary to the purpose of the SSI program, which is to provide benefits to the financially needy.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.997" offset="1129698">Once Congress entered the field and there was legislation, then whatever inherent authority courts had... and even the Celebrezze decision, which is the one decision to adopt that, in 1965, said it was in the absence of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.322" offset="1182988">And at this point we have a statute, we have specific, we believe, Congressional intent not to allow attorney's fee withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.106" offset="1206080">And it is that Congressional intent we rely on.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.474" offset="1219560">--Do you concede the authority of the courts to do it in an ordinary case where there hasn't been any prohibition by Congress?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_j_lazarus" startTime="284.961" stopTime="625.728">
            <label>Mr. Richard J. Lazarus</label>
            <text syncTime="284.961" offset="1253519">Well, there are several prohibitions, and there is also... here we have the United States as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.882" offset="1273267">I wouldn't concede it with respect to the United States being party.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.834" offset="1285075">There is some common law precedent far back there in England, starting with the decision by Lord Mansfield in 1779, called Welsh v. Hull, which endorses the notion that courts do have inherent authority to split a judgment and ensure the attorney's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.177" offset="1354351">But it's always, even at common law, it's always been in the absence of a statute, and the courts have noted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.663" offset="1380369">And they have never been in cases involving the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.032" offset="1389773">And in here what we have is we have the government, we have a statute, we have an anti-assignment prohibition in the statute which we believe is explicit, and that's the first thing we rely on in Title XVI, which Congress lifted with respect to attorney's fee withholding in Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.375" offset="1451213">We don't concede that Celebrezze decision was right at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.993" offset="1465633">The first point is that the language of Title XVI is explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.231" offset="1486635">It bars the transfer or assignment of any individual's right to payment of SSI benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.099" offset="1510041">The purpose of the anti-assignment provision in Title XVI is to ensure that the benefits go to those who Congress wanted them to go, the needy claimant, to provide for their basic subsistence needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.323" offset="1554972">There is no exception made in Title XVI for attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.144" offset="1570227">In contrast, in Title II of the Social Security Act, which provides old age, survivor, and disability benefits to insured individuals who need not be financially needy, there is express authority in the statute authorizing withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.202" offset="1626547">Section 406(a) of Title II authorizes the Secretary to withhold a portion of a claimant's past due benefits as an attorney's fee upon making a determination favorable to the claimant in administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.343" offset="1675031">Section 406(b) of Title XVI likewise authorizes a court to order attorney's fee withholding upon making a determination favorable to the claimant in judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.281" offset="1718812">They lift the anti-assignment bar in Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.952" offset="1733545">Although Congress incorporated much of Title II's procedural provisions into Title XVI, it did not include either of these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.189" offset="1766459">Indeed, comparison of the relevant provisions in Titles II and XVI, Sections 406 and 1383, reveals a remarkable fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.695" offset="1800523">The language of Title XVI... Congress enacted in 1972... duplicates the language of Title II prior to 1965 and 1967, when Congress amended Title II to provide an attorney's fee withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.722" offset="1856529">Congress, in effect, reached back to the language that Congress enacted in 1939 for Title II rather than simply adopt Title II's then current language in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.846" offset="1901042">The language, we believe, of Title XVI by itself suggests that the omission was careful and deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.666" offset="1924343">The legislative history confirms the deliberateness of Congress's decision, and answers why Congress chose to omit withholding from Title XVI.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.856" offset="1961124">First, as we lay out in our brief, the legislative history shows that Congress considered the possibility of including withholding authority in Title XVI, just as it had in Title II, and rejected the idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.414" offset="2015354">As first proposed in 1970, Title XVI would have simply incorporated all of Section 406 of Title II, including the withholding authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.987" offset="2053597">Congress, however, subsequently redrafted the bill and carefully omitted withholding authority from Title XVI.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.375" offset="2079197">The revision was not a product of mere oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.243" offset="2090691">It was precise, it was surgical.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.862" offset="2101140">The withholding provisions were removed, while most of the rest of Section 406 was carefully retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.847" offset="2121097">Congress, moreover, explained why, the reasons in the accompanying legislative reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.801" offset="2144921">Congress stated its view, speaking to the administrative proceedings, that withholding would be contrary to the purpose of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.157" offset="2174283">The purpose, again, unlike for Title II, is to provide benefits to financially needy persons, Title II... Title XVI benefits, unlike Title II, being needed to meet basic subsistence needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.964" offset="2217542">Congress decided that withholding those benefits from those needy persons was not warranted, as it had been in Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.702" offset="2244500">Not surprisingly, Respondent concedes that Congress denied the courts the power to order withholding when Congress first enacted Title XVI in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.760" offset="2288699">Respondent, however, contends that Congress somehow revisited the issue and decided to allow withholding when it amended Title XVI in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.782" offset="2324853">The claim, we believe, does not withstand serious scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.901" offset="2337287">The amendment upon which Respondent relies had absolutely nothing to do with attorney's fee withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.471" offset="2359543">In 1972, Congress had decided that the Secretary's administrative determinations under Title XVI would be subject to judicial review, as they were under Title II, with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.160" offset="2402384">The determination of any fact by the Secretary would be final and not subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.647" offset="2424327">In 1976, Congress amended the law to omit that exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.468" offset="2443553">That was the extent of the revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.920" offset="2453375">It was a deletion of one prior difference between the two titles that had absolutely nothing to do with attorney's fee withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.157" offset="2478348">It concerned Section 405 of Title II, while the two attorney's fee provisions of Title II are in Section 406.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.978" offset="2505620">If Congress had originally in 1972 made the standards of judicial review exactly the same, no serious claim could have been made in the face of the language and legislative history of 1972 that Congress had by that action intended to allow attorney's fee withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.754" offset="2564657">That Congress instead only achieved that result by an amendment and a deletion to Title XVI four years later wholly unrelated, for reasons wholly unrelated, to attorney's fee withholding does not add any credence to that theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.376" offset="2703210">There's also a general anti-assignment provision for claims against the U.S., and then in this statute itself we have Section 1383(d), which incorporates the anti-assignment bar in Section 407 of Title II.</text>

            <text syncTime="680.811" offset="2836957">We believe it presents a very different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.511" offset="2843749">It doesn't run into the anti-assignment provisions; it doesn't direct the Secretary to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.632" offset="2864229">The legislative history speaks to the issue of withholding and not to the issue of the maximum fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.952" offset="2889515">And finally, to the extent that Congress spoke in the statute at all to ceilings, it actually authorized the Secretary to do just that for administrative proceedings, and all the courts actually are in agreement on that question, that the courts do have the inherent authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.461" offset="2951582">And we believe that presents a different issue not raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.246" offset="2962658">In sum, the sole question in this case is whether the Secretary's construction of Title XVI is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.067" offset="2994005">Because it is supported by the language, by the structure of the statute, and the legislative history, which show that Congress considered and rejected attorney's fee withholding in the context of Title XVI, we believe that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.660" offset="3044369">The decision of the Court of Appeals, therefore, should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="747.087" offset="3102048">May it please the Chief Justice and Members of this Court, we have in this country a wonderful social security disability system.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.340" offset="3131096">There is one brief flaw in it right now, and that is how the poor people are going to come about paying their attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.994" offset="3157636">If these people can't pay attorneys, lawyers aren't going to take their cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.464" offset="3175504">They have the right to present a social security claim, but if they don't have a lawyer to help them appeal it, they can't get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.702" offset="3196506">Now, the whole issue is legal representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.320" offset="3210926">And I'd submit to you that most of these people out there who I represent, they're the poor, the illiterate, the downtrodden.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.676" offset="3244363">They don't know what it is to even carry a credit card, a Kerr-McGee gas credit card or American Express or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.080" offset="3269963">They're poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.830" offset="3272993">But they live from day to day, from mouth to mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.215" offset="3290547">If these people can't get a lawyer to help them, they don't live in one town long enough to get their social security claim with the local social security office.</text>

            <text syncTime="860.521" offset="3555742">Yes, that's true, when we settle automobile tort claims, if you're in that area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.306" offset="3570893">And of course, the social security law is a regulated law, attorney fee areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.877" offset="3593150">That is to say, there are a lot of attorneys who won't take a social security case because, hey, there's nobody out there going to tell me what I can charge these guys for my services.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.547" offset="3623870">They don't want some bureaucratic agency dictating the amount of their fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.851" offset="3641111">And of course, you have problems like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.803" offset="3652918">This... there is a bureaucracy problem with your attorney's fee, whether it's an SSI or a Title II, and whether it's at the administrative level.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.259" offset="3690743">If you win a case at the administrative level, and you're not happy with your attorney's fee, you can appeal it one step.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.062" offset="3717911">But there's no judicial review of that, and the Social Security Administration right now is reducing all requested fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.300" offset="3742884">And of course, when you get it into court, you can file for an EAJA fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.870" offset="3761169">And you probably are asking yourselves why I didn't file an EAJA fee petition and then file my other fee petition, you see, because under the Equal Access to Justice law, an attorney is supposed to file that EAJA first.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.630" offset="3820206">He's supposed to do that, and I know that, and I know it in this case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.249" offset="3830655">But I couldn't raise that issue if I had filed EAJA and the judge would have granted my EAJA petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.652" offset="3856255">Then I would not have had this claim to present to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.354" offset="3871093">That would have ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.104" offset="3874123">So I just went ahead and filed a claim for my one fourth of past due benefits, based on an hourly rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.174" offset="3906410">And this claim is more valuable to you than an EAJA claim because you don't have to show for this one that the government's position was not substantially justified in this--</text>

            <text syncTime="970.040" offset="3993868">That's the reason, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.992" offset="4001705">Now, I had a case recently, an SSI case recently, where a man, after seven years of litigation, he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.347" offset="4039112">That was an SSI case.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.633" offset="4048203">They hadn't made the award yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.699" offset="4052487">Had they made the award, I... and paid him, I could have maybe gotten my money from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.620" offset="4072131">But I had... I went ahead, when I discovered his death, and no payment made by the Social Security Administration under Title XVI, I immediately filed an EAJA fee petition to get paid for what I did in the federal court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.011" offset="4121764">I won't get anything at the administrative level; I got about $1200 off that case, working with that older, alcoholic tramp for seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.284" offset="4154782">That's what my... I really made off that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.417" offset="4163351">Now, so I filed an EAJA real quick in that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.188" offset="4182472">So you see, if the client dies before the money comes, you don't get anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.556" offset="4195951">That's the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.189" offset="4198459">And I daresay about 50 percent of the people I represent and get on social security are dead within three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.912" offset="4229388">I have the... I can definitely tell you that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.899" offset="4249241">Most people don't last very long, where they are sick, disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.351" offset="4271080">And you don't go into federal court and try to get a substantial evidence case overturned without having a good case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.124" offset="4298142">You'll go broke practicing law doing that out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.340" offset="4307024">Now, I'd like to talk a little bit more about the Social Security Administration's attitude about attorney's fees; that is to say, first, they deny the people; the people get in a lawyer who gets them on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.049" offset="4365852">Then they say, well, now you got the money coming, we're going to regulate the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.120" offset="4382152">And a thing or two they do, and I've showed it in one of my briefs, maybe miscalculate the benefits, you submit your fee petition based on that benefits they've submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.559" offset="4419977">Then six months later you find out they made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.195" offset="4430426">They write back and say, the client, we made a mistake, we undercalculated by 6000, we're mailing a check, client directly, $6000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.867" offset="4465117">You don't get any of it, we're sorry, we made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.653" offset="4476297">I've had that happen to me, and I attached two more in my briefs, a case where that has happened before, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.807" offset="4496882">What I'm saying is, the administration, the Social Security Administration, is taking a very hard attitude towards attorneys getting paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.762" offset="4536693">And if you'll read books on the subject by Mr. Francis or Mr. McCormick, who I'm sure you're all acquainted with those books, point out that problem you have in collecting your fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.470" offset="4579533">And that just drives the lawyers out of the social security legal representation business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.600" offset="5088085">--Sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.883" offset="5089235">Now, Judge, let me... because, you know, when this legislation comes down, the Social Security Administration has their representatives there at that hearing, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.589" offset="5120059">And they politick, and they saw where Congress was missing the point here, and didn't rule on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.076" offset="5145973">They stayed silent, Congress had to adjourn, the boys had to go back to their home fields to run for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.980" offset="5165617">And, of course, well, Social Security says, we'll cover that with a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.266" offset="5178782">And I've attached a copy of their regulation, most recent regulation at this point, after the Galbreath case came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.670" offset="5204382">They wanted to come up with another regulation to make sure they covered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.455" offset="5215563">It said in there, we do not... and I've supplied it to the Court already... we do not pay money directly to those attorneys; we just don't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.160" offset="5254328">Even if you got a court order, you don't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.362" offset="5263106">And sometimes you have a court order to collect the title to fee, and you... it's just pretty hard to get the government in contempt to get that check out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.868" offset="5297169">Those are some of the things you run into in the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.987" offset="5313679">But the circuits are split.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.939" offset="5321411">The First Circuit says no, the government doesn't have the... have to pay the checks, because the court doesn't have the inherent authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.211" offset="5354534">The Third Circuit's the Reid case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.678" offset="5364356">Motley vs. Heckler says yes, they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.330" offset="5375014">Galbreath vs. Bowen says yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.115" offset="5386195">And the McCarthy and Howard out of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits say to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.853" offset="5405107">Now, when they first passed this social legislation for disability back in the early '40s, they forgot to put in there whether the court could order it to be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.660" offset="5448366">And it took a court decision back then, which our counsel referred to earlier... it was the court decision of Celebrezze vs. Sparks, which came down on March 16th of '65, and that case held that court did have the inherent authority to order those payments made out of Title II benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.455" offset="5523494">Then, later... now that decision was in March of '65... then in May, April and May of '65, Social Security Administration lobbyists did appear before a Senate committee and said yes, we think it's all right to go ahead and do that, but there should be a cap on the lawyer fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.201" offset="5602488">So they came up with the 25 percent cap on past due benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.237" offset="5618684">Now, that's great if you won every social security case you took.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.522" offset="5631746">But you take 10 cases out there, and you got to be pretty good sometimes to figure out, pick the winners, because you pick a lot of losers, you're going to go broke practicing law now, and we all know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.811" offset="5668944">That's... but you take 10 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.847" offset="5681065">You lose three of them, you don't get paid for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.032" offset="5689842">So there's no past due benefits to take any fee out of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.651" offset="5700291">You got seven you win, so... and of course, if you hit a big fee on social security cases, you don't automatically get one fourth of the past due benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.471" offset="5727563">That's just the amount the government holds back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.589" offset="5736026">You have to submit an hourly fee petition, and then they take a look at the hours you worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.058" offset="5753894">Suppose a guy came in, all you had to do was interview him, write for three or four medical reports, submit them to Social Security, get them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.564" offset="5779912">You got him, say, 22,000 in back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.764" offset="5788794">You might get an attorney fee of $550, based on that hourly rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1478.638" offset="6028284">You go over there when they're having those social security hearings and you'll find out how social security people politick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.959" offset="6049496">But the government's Justice Department's also a little bit of a sharp politician, and I'll tell you why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.743" offset="6072693">Here's why I say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.628" offset="6080216">They lost some cases on this point in different circuits, but they didn't appeal them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.766" offset="6096725">Now, they know, they kind of gauge those circuits out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.384" offset="6111249">We know where our strength is in the First Circuit, we know what the Ninth Circuit'll do on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.836" offset="6129013">And I do wish Mr. Kennedy would be here, because I did have a case before him on a three-judge panel about a year ago this time, and he ruled against me on a substantial evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.125" offset="6166211">And like I say, that's a hard one to overcome as a plaintiff lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.310" offset="6178959">But you got to... you know, to win a social security case and overcome that substantial evidence test, you got to have a winner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.464" offset="6207589">And I really didn't have too good a winner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.499" offset="6215739">But on this case, he didn't, you know, bump.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.201" offset="6230472">The woman had been, from the time she applied, about a year later she'd been involved in a very severe automobile accident and almost ground up to hamburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.139" offset="6262237">Then they set the hearing again, or the onset date at a different time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.775" offset="6276761">And so, but you have to... the government hasn't always picked the cases they've lost; they just don't try them in, say, that circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.131" offset="6318244">And of course, the fact that the law of the Sixth Circuit's one way is not res judicata in the Eighth, as I've had to find out the hard way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.553" offset="6351889">See, like in submitting fee petitions, okay, you do some work at administrative level, you have to submit it at the administrative level for what you do there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.429" offset="7047373">But we are dealing, gentlemen, about a large issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.333" offset="7067017">And I talk to a lot of lawyers, and a lot of lawyers will tell me, I wouldn't handle a social security case for anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.153" offset="7094289">And I look at them and say, well... then I find, in talking to them, I find out they're really not up on what the social security law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.455" offset="7111530">There's big money on... in it; unquestionably there's big money on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.740" offset="7124696">Now that lawyers can advertise, although I've never advertised, I got a large social security business, probably have 350 cases pending in federal court right now on various issues, issues like under the EAJA, they don't want to allow us to get paid for our billing time, they don't want to let us get paid for advance costs, like for photocopying, telephone calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.137" offset="7206198">I have that pending before the Eighth Circuit in a case of Payton vs. Bowen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.966" offset="7289581">See, this is the point now that I have before the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.620" offset="7308180">You see, it takes... you take a case... this case here is one of my shorter-lived cases; it's only about five, six years old in my office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.024" offset="7337751">I've had cases that, like with the alcoholic man who died, on Title XVI, that case had drug on for seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.797" offset="7368888">I got, you know, just for one case sometimes, you'll have a file this thick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.332" offset="7387070">And then they want you to compute your billing time, and you go back through there and compute that billing time, it may take six, seven hours to get all the billing time in on that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.954" offset="7421551">And they don't want to pay you for that, but yet you got to submit the billing time, and they want you to get paid by the hour rather than by the 25 percent contingency fee contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.127" offset="7450182">So, gentlemen, I don't want to take any more time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.576" offset="7544013">One is, of course, ultimately the wisdom of the statute is for Congress and not for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.480" offset="7567628">As to the impact of Congress's decision, one can speculate that perhaps Congress hoped that the financially needy would be eligible for Legal Services Corporation or other things, and therefore the impact would be less in the Title XVI context.</text>
