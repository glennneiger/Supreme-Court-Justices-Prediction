            <text syncTime="57.503" offset="360231">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.305" offset="371411">The issue presented by this matter is whether the Respondents should be held in criminal contempt for publishing materials in violation of a temporary restraining order where no attempt was made for judicial relief of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.750" offset="437240">On November 8th, 1985, Mr. Raymond J. Patriarca brought suit against the Providence Journal Company, a Rhode Island newspaper, as well as a Rhode Island television station, WJAR-TV, the Justice Department and the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.128" offset="518742">Mr. Patriarca at the same time filed an injunction motion seeking to enjoin dissemination of information which was about him, which had been obtained as a result of illegal electronic surveillance by the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.593" offset="604528">That dated back to 1962 to 1965, when the FBI quite illegally entered into Mr. Patriarca's father's business, and they planted electronic bugging devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.039" offset="678402">There were tape recordings made of those conversations over those several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.693" offset="700972">Those tape recordings have since been destroyed, but logs and memoranda regarding them have been retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.362" offset="731692">Some years ago, back in the seventies, the Providence Journal sought to obtain those FBI materials and litigation regarding that was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.487" offset="776100">They did not ultimately prevail in that after the matter was decided at the 1st Circuit level.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.260" offset="807238">After Raymond L.S. Patriarca, that's Raymond J. Patriarca's father, when the senior Patriarca died, thereafter, the Journal renewed its attempts to obtain the FBI materials, and those renewed attempts were successful and they obtained at least some materials from the FBI regarding these illegally-obtained conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.577" offset="920505">Shortly after the complaint was filed, there was a temporary restraining order conference where the Chief Judge of the Rhode Island District Court, Judge Boyle, Chief Judge Boyle, had counsel gather.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.770" offset="973273">Counsel for the Providence Journal as well as the WJAR-TV were present in arguing that any kind of restraint would be a prior restraint and would be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.728" offset="1021129">The Government defendants likewise represented by the U.S. Attorney's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.548" offset="1048401">The Judge was apparently very concerned that there were paramount 1st Amendment rights which may be or which would be impinged if you were to enter any kind of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.474" offset="1108065">Therefore, he set the matter down for hearing or intended to set the matter down for hearing the next day and issue a temporary restraining order.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.161" offset="3878820">What happened at this conference was critical, at temporary restraining order conference, because the Judge indicated that he would hear the matter tomorrow, the next morning, presumably because it was of such constitutional proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.473" offset="3944127">In response to that invitation, the Journal lawyers and the media lawyers said, no, we cannot go forward tomorrow, we need more time to prepare.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.161" offset="3982892">In response to that, the case was put over another day.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.998" offset="4010164">The request for postponement was granted and then the violation occurred in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.819" offset="4029495">Before the violation occurred, there are several things of extreme importance that did not occur, and that is that the Journal did not go back to the trial judge to seek to vacate or to stay the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.777" offset="4081322">They didn't indicate that they had so much problem with it that they had to violate it, that it was such a sense of urgency that they couldn't live with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.133" offset="4110683">They did not go to the Court of Appeals to seek to vacate it or stay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.403" offset="4139836">They did not seek an emergency appeal and the Court of Appeals level, although that right is available to them in these sorts of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.059" offset="4178393">They did not seek mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.927" offset="4185916">They did not apply, as Mr. Justice Brennan asserted, to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.415" offset="4203888">They did nothing, except violate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.217" offset="4223114">The publication was the next day of the matters that they ought not to have published, and the basis of our argument on the merits is that courts are the only body that are empowered by the power of this country to determine cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.178" offset="4290928">Private litigants are simply not authorized to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.445" offset="4307960">The Respondents in this case seized Article III power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.349" offset="4323633">They made themselves the court and not just made themselves the court, but it was sort of a star chamber proceeding where they didn't even invite Mr. Patriarca.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.806" offset="4365429">They claimed a unique status in the superiority to the judiciary and went ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.960" offset="4390089">The basis of our being here on the merits is that we suggest that lawful review is required and that Walker v. The City of Birmingham requires that where there are facially available procedures for judicial review, you must try to take them, and if, at that point, you're denied meaningful opportunity, then that's a different story and perhaps then you can later contest the merits on a collateral attack at the contempt proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.883" offset="4533762">But in this case, there is no excuse or no attempt at all to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.120" offset="4558631">The explanation perhaps may be that the Journal considered any question or any answer by any court to be beyond their belief in that they would not be beholden to any court that might restrain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.931" offset="4637939">Had they applied to the District Court and indicated to the District Court Judge that they were having this problem with the order and it was so serious to them, he might well have averted this clash and the ensuing contempt of the Court's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.262" offset="4719232">I think the timing is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.697" offset="4724979">It happened mid-day in the middle of the week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.149" offset="4738771">The courts were open.</text>

            <text syncTime="2638.497" offset="10684136">I would think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.032" offset="10694376">I mean, I think... let me take it in two different steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.103" offset="10718618">The Court of Appeals analyzed this basically on a transparent invalidity theory rather than the pure speech theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.339" offset="10747562">It took into account it was pure speech, but it treated... it concluded it was transparently invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.410" offset="10771803">If there were, say, an order of this Court, to take the easiest case, it would be hard to see any circumstance under which an order of this Court could, even in the most optimistic moments of counsel, be deemed transparently invalid, and, so, that would fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.372" offset="10839722">I mean, there are some arguments one simply cannot make, and I think that would be such an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.828" offset="10873472">So, to the extent one focuses on transparent invalidity or some such notion, frivolous pretense to validity, when the Court of Appeals has spoken or the Supreme Court has spoken, I take it that that would govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.987" offset="10930105">It is only if you come to the other branch of our argument to you, which the Court of Appeals did not reach, but which six or seven state courts, highest courts, have reached,--</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.770" offset="11137309">After all, it was the Court of Appeals which, in its ruling, speaking about itself, said that it was left with no clear conviction that an answer could have been had.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.513" offset="11196241">But I think that that's what they were speaking to, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.001" offset="11214213">So, it is our view, Your Honor, that, and this is an extraordinary case, we have so few prior restraints in our country and fewer still situations where something like this occurs, that what the Court of Appeals is saying is that there is a small exception to the collateral bar rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.497" offset="11300208">It is an exception in the area of an order which is so wholly insupportable based on already-decided case law and the like, and even in that case, they have said in the future that you must make a good faith attempt to seek to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.126" offset="11370739">The fact that there are and have been exceptions to the collateral bar rule is really indisputable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.795" offset="11401354">This has never been a rigid rule requiring immediate and total adherence to every court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.885" offset="11429776">If Mr. Hauser, the editor of the paper, had during the contempt proceeding, claimed the 5th Amendment and the Court overruled it and ordered him to testify, it's settled law in this Court that the way to test that is to claim the 5th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.495" offset="11496127">If he had asserted a claim that he shouldn't produce documents, if he had asserted a claim that under the 1st document, if he had asserted a claim that under the 1st Amendment, confidential sources were protected, all that is settled law in this Court already, that the way to test those orders is not to abide by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.372" offset="11563731">So, it is not as if we have a principle so sweeping that any disobedience to any court order is itself a contempt or itself would prevent you from defending in a contempt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.299" offset="11619425">There are exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.401" offset="11627784">They are few.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.884" offset="11633740">They are deliberately few because it's so important that court orders be abided by.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.857" offset="12173638">It's not a venal sin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.073" offset="12178445">It is simply a mistake and it is not a waiver of the 1st Amendment rights of the Journal simply to have said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.212" offset="12207075">Nor is it a situation in which there was some advantage taken of Judge Boyle.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.472" offset="12264127">So, nothing happened as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.507" offset="12276247">It's not like, for example, the Moreland case of this Court where counsel sat for three months not seeking expedition out of this Court on a prior restraint that was then outstanding and then came in and demanded, so to speak, expeditions consideration from this Court and the Court treated it, so to speak, as a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.088" offset="12358585">That is not what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.838" offset="12361511">It is much more similar to some cases cited in our brief, one involving... both involving CBS, one involving CBS, one involving NBC, where, in two separate cases around the country, trial courts said in substance to attorneys, turn over material that's about to be broadcast, so I can have a look at it and make a judgment about whether to enter a prior restraint, and in both those cases, counsel initially said, all right, I'll bring it tomorrow, and in both those cases, they then spoke to their clients, which also happened here, they then spoke to their clients and their clients said, what do you mean, to turn over to a judge a script of our broadcast we're going to show tomorrow and they came in the next day and they said, we're not going to turn it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.716" offset="12545100">In both cases, there was a contempt finding initially and in both cases, the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and the 9th Circuit excused counsel for having said that in the heat of the ordinary desire of counsel to get along with judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.178" offset="12614899">So, Your Honor, it is really not acquiescence in the order, and I urge upon you that the testimony of counsel and Mr. Patriarca himself really demonstrates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.671" offset="12668920">The only other thing I was going to add was just a correction to one thing in my opponent's brief, which is of some moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.574" offset="12692535">It's Part III of our brief, in which we deal with a due process claim, and in which we urge upon the Court that a 1st Circuit decision, called United States v. Arthur Andersen, had previously said that the way to test prior restraints on pure speech was to violate it and then argue at the later contempt hearing that the order was improperly entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.523" offset="12788247">Counsel had urged in his brief, in his reply brief, just received by us a few days ago, that we had not made the same argument at the District Court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.046" offset="12822416">Our District Court brief has been lodged with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.765" offset="12833282">At page 22, you will see the citation and brief discussion of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.484" offset="12856166">It was relied upon there, it was relied upon in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.270" offset="12867242">If the Court reaches it, I would urge upon the Court that we have always relied upon it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.144" offset="12922726">May I make just one point and not stretch your patience any longer, and that would be to draw a distinction between the cases where a party is permitted to violate an order and later challenge its validity in defense of contempt proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.544" offset="13008407">Those cases, the Cobbledick case, the Ryan case, and so forth, all stem from the idea that the prompt administration of justice simply does not permit appeals from such orders and because no appeals lay in those cases, then those parties are permitted to go ahead and violate against the usual rule that is urged by special prosecutor, that all orders must be obeyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.729" offset="13137139">As was indicated in the United States v. Ryan case, in footnote 4, the distinction was drawn and said that Walker was no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.001" offset="13178203">Walker was totally consistent with that because in Walker, there were procedures available for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.989" offset="13202131">I simply would like to make that distinction and thank you for your patience.</text>
