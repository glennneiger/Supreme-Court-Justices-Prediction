            <text syncTime="12.574" offset="180122">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.676" offset="192556">Cherlyn Clark filed a support complaint against Gene Jeter in 1983, on behalf of her daughter, Tiffany, who is 10 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.115" offset="230277">At that time Pennsylvania marital children to pursue claims for support against their parents at any time up until the were 18 years old, and in some instances, beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.089" offset="274162">However.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.823" offset="277088">Pennsylvania limited the right of non-marital children to pursue claims for support against their biological fathers by the requirement that paternity actions be commenced within six years from the date of the child's birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.099" offset="334244">In Pennsylvania, a support action can be begun, but if a putative father denies paternity, it cannot be continued until a paternity determination is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.705" offset="376667">Gene Jeter raised, as an affirmative defense, the six-year statute of limitations in paternity actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.894" offset="409372">This was an affirmative defense to show Ms. Clark's support complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.881" offset="425359">Over the objections of the six-year statute of limitations was unconstitutional, the trial court dismissed Cherlyn Clark's support complaint on the basis that the statute of limitations had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.856" offset="477186">While Cherlyn Clark's case was pending in the appellate court, Pennsylvania enacted an 18-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.378" offset="511354">Both the intermediate appellate court and the Pennsylvania highest court have refused to apply the 18-year statute of limitations to Cherlyn Clark's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.519" offset="555867">The first issue before this Court today is whether the federal child support enforcement amendments of 1984 require the invalidation of the six-year statute of limitations and require the application of an 18-year statute of limitation to Cherlyn Clark's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.432" offset="639563">The 1984 child support enforcement amendments are part of Title 4(d) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.602" offset="672269">Each state that participates in the AFDC program is required to comply with Part 4(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="144.358" offset="707273">The statute authorizes specific funding penalties for failure to comply with the child support enforcement amendments.</text>

Wyman in another AFDC case, indicated that it is not necessary for a claimant, who has no normal route through an administrative appeal or no impact on the Secretary of HHS's decision to review for compliance and penalize the state, that in a situation like that the federal courts have the power to oversee the compliance of the state with the federal statute.</text>

            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="216.620" offset="996291">And that seems to me different from the question that the Chief Justice was asking, because this is a case in which you are saying simply that a state statute on a procedural matter determining when an action can be brought under state substantive law is void because of a spending prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.735" offset="1092735">So I think Rosato is quite distinguishable as are the other cases you have mentioned in your brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.287" offset="1114992">Perhaps a better response to that would be the case of Bennett v. Arkansas, which was very recently decided by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.893" offset="1141428">That also was a Social Security Act case in which the federal law provides that social security benefits cannot be garnished or attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.914" offset="1177477">Arkansas had a state law which specifically said when a person who was receiving a social security benefit was incarcerated the state could attach the social security benefits essentially to pay for their upkeep while they were in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.841" offset="1241215">In that case, this Court held that the federal... what had happened in that case to bring it to this Court was that the State of Arkansas went into a state court and attached the pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.453" offset="1307671">And the pensioner raised as a defense to that attachment the fact that the state law was in conflict with the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.741" offset="1348735">And in that case, this Court held that the decision of the Arkansas court allowing this to proceed was reversed on the basis that there was a conflict between the Federal Social Security Act provision and the state law provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.639" offset="1424386">That was a provision by Congress that said you shall not attach any of these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.691" offset="1444553">And the State of Arkansas says we think there is an implied exception to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.328" offset="1459077">But that wasn't a question of whether the Congress grant so much money and says, to be eligible for these you have got to have the following statutes in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.930" offset="1581539">And in this case, Cherlyn Clark's case will go forward if the federal law is complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.768" offset="1604840">The compliance under the statute is not required except after three years.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.408" offset="2155397">In this particular situation the statute of limitations as contained in the federal statute, the requirement of this 18-year statute is framed in mandatory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.864" offset="2201268">It is one of the four sections of 666 which is required on the states, but which specifically is not included in the number of requirements that a state is allowed to request a waiver from the Secretary of HHS.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.326" offset="2267096">So the structure of the statute underlines the fact of the mandatory and clear language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.415" offset="2299488">For the statute to say it requires the state have in effect procedures which permit the establishment of paternity of any child at any time, the House report that accompanied the bill in the house talked about the fact that there were shorter statutes of limitations in the various jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.161" offset="2390499">Remember that this congressional decision to pass this statute follows hard on the heels of the Pickett v. Brown decision and the Mills v. Habluetzel decisions which had invalidated a one and a two-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.873" offset="2461343">That was in '82 and '83.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.492" offset="2467821">The congressional debate about this was taking place in '83, and specifically made part of that is the recognition that there are these shorter statutes of limitations out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.348" offset="2507214">The House report, talking about the 18-year statute of limitations, says,</text>
            <text syncTime="598.550" offset="2524037">"If a state's applicable statute of limitations does not permit establishment of a child's paternity past the child's second, sixth or other birthday, it will be impossible ever to establish support orders on behalf of a child past these ages, and therefore impossible to obtain support for them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="617.129" offset="2598329">The legislative history here is clear that Congress was thinking about children who were already past the statutory limits in their particular states.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.235" offset="2638766">And that it intended by the broad comprehensive mandatory language of 666 to apply this 18-year statute to any child.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.675" offset="2676487">The Health and Human Services comment to the regulations is also helpful here, because it speaks specifically to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.483" offset="2727792">It says, they are not going to promulgate regulations on this because,</text>
            <text syncTime="654.285" offset="2746913">"Since it is clear the case is previously closed because of a child age will now have to be reopened. "</text>
            <text syncTime="660.088" offset="2770110">they found it unnecessary to promulgate regulations on this particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.008" offset="2789859">So it's clear also from the HHS gloss on this that everybody was thinking about the fact that this would apply retroactively to children who were already born at the time this statute was in effect, to children who may already have passed the statute of limitations if it were shorter in their individual jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.876" offset="13629317">And apart from that, the ability of the child to get into court in Pennsylvania can be achieved through the custodian, the guardian or the next friend.</text>
